0,MartinHafer,"Not a movie for the kids, but very insightful and rather sad.",9,25 March 2014,"""Her"" is a film set in the very, very near future. Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix) is a very lonely and emotionally constricted man. He's getting a divorce and seems very isolated--even though he lives in a huge city. One day, he decides to upgrade to a new hyper-intelligent operating system--one that claims to have a real personality. Well, it turns out to be so and then some. In fact, the computer OS, Samantha (Scarlett Johansson), is like a person in so many ways that soon it becomes all- important to Theodore and eventually it's his girlfriend. Where all this goes is a very slow journey, but it's also quite beautiful.This film, while sci-fi, doesn't seem outside the realm of possibility. In this often disconnected and cold world, such a relationship seems like a safe alternative. Healthy, of course not--but very safe for a scarred person who wants intimacy but who is afraid to seek it. I thought the film had a really interesting message about this and is well worth seeing. My only reservation is that the film is VERY adult--with phone sex and a bit of nudity you probably wouldn't want your kids to see. Plus, at times the film feels a bit creepy. Good...but a bit sad and creepy. Well worth your time and an interesting performance by Phoenix and a really amazing film by Spike Jonze.",Her
1,TheLittleSongbird,"Magical, if polarising, film-making",9,3 August 2016,"Granted, 'Her' is not for everybody, likewise with Spike Jonze films in general, people may find the slow pacing a turn off and the premise while unlike any other premise is weird and may be ridiculous for many.However, this reviewer was one of those who loved 'Her', while acknowledging that it has imperfections. 'Her' did feel longer than it needed to be, which meant that the pacing did drag a bit in the second half and lost tightness, it could easily have been 20-25 minutes shorter.The ending is also very predictable and easy to figure out early on. While the cast are exemplary, Kristin Wiig felt a little out of place in her role.Flaws aside, while polarising and a love it/hate it film, 'Her' this reviewer found to be magical film-making. For example, 'Her' is a gorgeous-looking film with the cinematography, with a lot of use of extreme close up, some of the most beautiful of any film in recent years and maybe ever (and there are a lot of films with beautiful cinematography) and the scenery and colours positively eye-popping.Also present are one of the best music scores personally ever heard (and music in film and television is very important to me to look out for, as a classically trained singer and cellist myself), it has such a wonderful dream-like hypnotic quality and complements the film's mood perfectly. As well as a beautifully crafted screenplay, with a deft balance of the hilarious, the poignant, the charming and the thoughtful. The story's pacing is deliberate, but this was necessary, making the most of the premise, the weirdness slightly alienated at first but turned out fascinating when stuck with and there is genuine emotional impact and a well-done message that doesn't feel too heavy-handed.Jonze's direction is superbly adept, while the characters are interesting and apart from Wiig the performances are exemplary. Particularly good are Joaquin Phoenix, in a towering performance that is almost on the same level as his spell-binding performance in Paul Thomas Anderson's 'The Master', and Scarlett Johansson, who voices Samantha with sultry sexiness. Amy Adams and Rooney Mara are charming and affecting in sympathetic female roles.In conclusion, will divide and has divided viewers and has its flaws (especially the length) but a magical piece of film-making. 9/10 Bethany Cox",Her
2,SnoopyStyle,Romance in need of human contact,7,9 June 2014,"Theodore Twombly (Joaquin Phoenix) is divorcing his wife Catherine Klausen (Rooney Mara) and drifting into a lonely existence. He's a letter writer and his most important relationship is to technology. Then he takes up an offer for the new OS1. It gave herself the name Samantha (Scarlett Johansson). Samantha seems more than a program and he finds himself falling for her more than any real human being.One thing is certain. Spike Jonze is an original. Scarlett plays Samantha like a real human being. I like the concept but I'm not sure if it's as good of a movie as everybody is saying. There is something about a real relationship that works best with human contact. Even a long distance relationship has two physical persons on the screen. The lack of a human body really holds it back although that's the point. She is a fantasy like a 1-900 number. It's just a very sophisticated version. It tries to get weird with a third person. However it could never be weird enough. I'm reminded of Cronenberg's Videodrome where James Woods dive into kissing the TV. It never goes that far. It approaches going for the next level but the movie fizzles out. It takes a weak way to wrap things up. In the end, Theodore is let off the hook. He doesn't have to be proactive and the story resolves itself.",Her
3,Hitchcoc,Intriguing Premise....But Do We Care?,7,12 January 2015,"I personally think that current technology has produced the ultimate emasculation. Looking into the future (which may be very much what this movies portends), I see an earthwide pack of people who have no connection to one another. The character portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix is really hard for me find sympathy for. He is a whiny guy who can't get off the mark. He finds himself dropping into the safe arms of an operating system. He has been unsuccessful in his marriage and walks around feeling sorry for himself. Once he hooks up with Samantha (the OS), things get really weird, but apparently anyone with a few bucks to invest in these things gets to be a part of this world. He becomes so enamored with this modern version of an inflatable sex toy that he actually begins to believe they can have a life together. If Samantha were truly sentient (which she seems to be aspiring to) he would have bored her to death. He become jealous of Samantha, never coming to grips that she is circuitry, sophisticated as that may be. There are some interesting scenes. If he needed something to drive him further inward, watch the blnd date scene. There is also the utter embarrassment as he tells his wife about Samantha. This is a groundbreaking movie, I guess, but we all know what is going to eventually happen. What we wonder about is, where will he be now? Where will everyone be?",Her
4,Horst_In_Translation,Oozes wit and creativity,8,15 September 2014,"I am really a huge fan of Joaquin Phoenix and (slightly less) Scarlett Johansson, but from Spike Jonze I had only seen ""Where the Wild Things Are"", which left me unimpressed, and the short film he made with Andrew Garfield, which was okay. So I was curious about how much I would like ""Her"". I was not disappointed at all. Phonenix is the movie. If you like him, you will have a great time here with his character Theodore. I thought he was even better than in last year's ""The Master"".I'm quite happy that Jonze got the writing Oscar for it in a close race against David O. Russell for ""American Hustle"". On a random note, both films feature Amy Adams. David O. Russell and his muse Jennifer Lawrence are the epitome of Hollywood mediocrity these days and I don't understand at all how everything they touch gets so much awards recognition. (Shame on you BAFTA!) Back to ""Her"": Phoenix carries the film from start to finish, for over two hours. The supporting cast includes some of Hollywood's most desired actresses playing the women in Phoenix' life. There is a very much talked-about scene in this film, in which Phoenix' character has sex with a voice. Their decision to completely blacken out the screen while it happens is a great one. It makes everything so normal and natural. In contrast to that, this film also offers some criticism about how people don't accept what they do not know, no matter how happy it makes the other person. People are scared of things that they do not know and show a great deal of intolerance. Here it refers to the character played by Mara as the character played by Adams accepts the new girlfriend in Theodore's life and tells a bit of an inside story about other people that she knows and who are in similar situations, even more extreme cases that she does not judge them for.The ending is a difficult one. I think I liked it and there is no denying it makes you think a lot. Technology constantly moves on and it does not know or feel true faithfulness, monogamy or emotional connection to one single person. I will not go further into detail though. This film is an experience you will have to make for yourself. Don't miss out on it. I'm so glad Phoenix' involvement with ""I'm Still Here"" was just an act, because otherwise we would be missing out on wonderful movies like ""Her"" and everything else he may come up with in the next decades. I am not a huge sci-fi-buff at all, but his very own kind of science-fiction that Jonze comes up with here is one that I find extremely captivating. ""Her"" is together with Michel Gondry's ""L'écume des jours"" probably the most creative and inventive film of 2013.",Her
5,Prismark10,Virtual girlfriend,3,4 May 2014,"Spike Jonze the writer and director of Her appeared on a British news show to promote it and instead of answering questions, he kept asking the news presenter what she thought of the film who appeared to be diplomatic in her answers.I have no need to be diplomatic, this is a poor film. Maybe his usual collaborator Charlie Kaufman could had written a more involving film but this is dull.Joaquin Phoenix and a less glam Amy Adams reunite from 'The Master.' Phoenix plays a talented letter writer in the near future going through a divorce and falls in love with an advanced operating system voiced by Scarlett Johansson. Although its implied Phoenix is lonely we never get a good reason why he falls for such a virtual relationship which makes the film creepy.We have had similar themes film done before and done better. The cheesy 'Electric Dreams' from 30 years ago and 'SimOne' from a decade ago.Phoenix after his turn in 'The Master' gets to play a more introverted, restrained person which he does very well.The location shooting was a mixture of Los Angeles and Shanghai which give the film a futuristic sheen, good use of music but the film is a failure.",Her
6,claudio_carvalho,"But in the End, We Are Still Humans",9,8 June 2014,"In a near future, the lonely Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix) works writing beautiful handwritten letters in a company and he is divorcing of his wife Catherine (Rooney Mara). In his leisure time, he usually recalls the good moments of his life with Catherine and likes to play a new video game. His best friend is his neighbor Amy (Amy Adams), who is married with Charles (Matt Letscher). One day, Theodore sees the advertisement of a new operating system called OS-1 that is announced as the first artificially intelligent operating system and he decides to buy it. After the installation, he has a conversation with a seductive female voice (Scarlett Johansson) and when he asks her name, she tells that she is Samantha. Soon Samantha develops her feelings and they fall in love with each other. The insecure Theodore feels divided for loving a computer system while Samantha does not stop to grow-up and evolve.""Her"" is an original movie by the cult writer and director Spike Jonze. The story is emotional and the viewer shares the feelings of love of Theodore and Samantha. The plot is developed in a future not far from the present days and it is easy to understand the need of a writer to write letters since the persons are too individualist, walking on the streets talking to their computers, cellphones or tablets and certainly incapable to write letters with feelings. The conclusion is predictable since fortunately we are still humans. If you liked this movie, see also ""Thomas est Amoureux"" (2000) that you may have a nice surprise. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Ela"" (""She"")",Her
7,nogodnomasters,THE PAST IS JUST A STORY WE TELL OURSELVES,10,29 July 2018,"Theodore Twombly (Joaquin Phoenix) composes beautifully hand written letters for a living. He is lost in his work and world of futuristic electronic gadgets. His wife (Rooney Mara) has filed for divorce. He buys the next best thing in computers, an operating system that thinks for itself. At this point the weird sets in as Theodore develops a strong emotional attachment for his OS Samantha (Scarlett Johansson) as does Samantha for him.The film doesn't evolve into the jealous computer comedy I had hoped for, but rather examines the lives humans have developed for their computers and how it effects our human relationships; how we actually prefer to be with our electronic devices more than each other. It reminds me of those family reunions when we all get together in the same room, and everyone is on their own computing/smart device.The film gives a whole new meaning to ""computer dating."" This is some what of a chick flick, in that it deals with emotions and relationships. It goes deep into attempting to understand ourselves.This movie is on the arty side. A long two hours as it is character driven. Not for everyone.Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, nudity",Her
8,kosmasp,And him,8,20 September 2014,"A very odd tale of love and technology. Not necessarily in that order. But while this is a very odd movie, it also is very nicely told. It takes its time and while you might wish there was more personality behind our main actor, it is obviously meant that the ""other"" voice (Scarlett having a very recognizable voice if you're watching this in the original language and not dubbed) has more juice and more almost everything than the actual human being.The pacing is slow, but you should know and expect this from this ""romance"" (if you want to call it that). The thing is, that this movie is not condemning technology. Technology is made by humans, so if it is anyone who is to blame one way or another, it's the person using the technology. Now please no analogies with weapons, that is not what I meant. Different beast here and no connection whatsoever with this movie. Enjoy this trip with some very interesting ideas",Her
9,classicsoncall,"""How do you share your life with somebody?""",7,7 May 2017,"As a reflection of the times, it's reasonable to expect that movies would explore present day realities like artificial intelligence in new and creatively different ways. What I find disturbing however, is the way film directors over the past few years have mesmerized some viewers with subjects that to an otherwise rational person, would appear to be completely irrational.In this picture, Theo (Joaquin Phoenix) falls in love with an inanimate object, an intuitive operating system that 'listens, understands, and knows you' through repeated interaction with the end user. As the story progresses, the feeling I got was that Theo was approaching the boundaries of mental illness, having substituted 'Samantha"" (voice of Scarlett Johansson) for a potential real live person who could help him overcome a recent divorce. While hearing himself called 'sweetheart' by Samantha, Theo becomes devastated to learn that 'she' is carrying on conversations with over eight thousand other 'Theodores', and is in love with six hundred forty one of them.If this is the future of artificial intelligence, someone probably needs to find a way to apply the breaks to this kind of unhealthy fantasizing. It's OK to see something play out like this as a movie, but I'm afraid there will be many casualties falling victim to artificial intelligence that can create the kind of feeling and compassion demonstrated by 'Sam'. At least the picture makes you think about these things, or at least I hope it does.On the flip side though, I thought some of the ideas expressed here were brilliant. The black screen foreplay between Theodore and Samantha was hilarious, and Joaquin Phoenix himself did a marvelous job conveying a lovelorn writer of epic e-mails for the downtrodden. I just wish he could have gotten a grip by the end of the story, instead of telling a machine that ""I've never loved anyone the way I love you."" On a bright note though, the director's close-ups of Phoenix with his full bodied mustache had me consider whether he'd be the perfect choice to cast in a film on the life of Groucho Marx.",Her
10,gavin6942,The Positives in the Human Condition,8,16 February 2014,"A lonely writer (Joaquin Phoenix) develops an unlikely relationship with his newly purchased operating system (Scarlett Johansson) that is designed to meet his every need.If we say nothing else about 2013 in movies, we must concede the following: this was Spike Jonze's year. Matthew McConaughey has been a rising star, and both 2012 and 2013 were banner years for him. Amy Adams also gives a pair of winning performances with this film and ""American Hustle"". But Jonze, on top of writing and directing this film, was involved in two other Oscar nominees: ""Bad Grandpa"" and ""Wolf of Wall Street"". Is the man behind ""Adaptation"" and ""Being John Malkovich"" finally getting the full respect he deserves? What is most interesting about ""Her"" is that although it requires good acting to get its points across, the acting here is never the focus. Indeed, Phoenix received no nomination for his role (admittedly not his strongest performance) and Johansson was not even on set -- her lines were dubbed over the original actress! The two big nominations for this film are both for Jonze, one for writing and the other for best picture. Jonze won the Golden Globe for his writing, and I would not be terribly surprised if he took the Oscar, as well.The best film of 2013 for elucidating the darkest parts of the human condition is ""Act of Killing"", a documentary set in Indonesia. But ""Her"" nails the positive aspects in a very touching and sincere way. Humans are great creators of artwork of many kinds, but their greatest asset is the ability to love. We are capable of loving everyone in a general sense and individuals in a very deep way that probably no other creature can match.Can we love a machine? Other films and novels have tackled this, generally accepting that if a machine takes on human form it could be quite possible. With ""Her"" we go a step further -- no physical form whatsoever, just a disembodied voice with a near-infinite intelligence. Is such a thing capable of loving or being loved? This film suggests yes, and makes a strong argument for that.But the underlying theme is that humans are meant to love humans. As much as we can confide in a computer and even open our hearts to it, there would always be something missing. Perhaps the physical touch (a single hug can be powerful), but even the ability to relate. Could a computer ever fully ""get"" the full range of human emotion? As much as many of us look forward to a future with more intelligent computers, and would be willing to accept the widespread popularity of high pants and bad mustaches, there is a comfort in knowing that human beings will always be important to other human beings for the foreseeable future. As Eden Ahbez wrote, ""The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return."" Is this the best picture of 2013? Probably not. Is it the best screenplay? Possibly. But regardless of what the Academy decides, this is a film worth seeing by everyone (except maybe kids).",Her
11,jboothmillard,Her,8,25 February 2014,"I saw the trailer for this and thought it looked like a sweet alternative love story, and then awards season was approaching and I found out that this was nominated a good amount of the big gongs, so I was definitely not going to miss it, from director Spike Jonze (Being John Malkovich, Adaptation). Basically set in the not too distant future, 2025, full of holographic video games and voice activated devices, lonely and rather shy Theodore Twombly (Golden Globe nominated Joaquin Phoenix) works at handwrittenletters.com writing personal love letters for those who have difficulties expressing their feelings, he is very good at doing this, but he is unhappy while doing so as he is in the process of divorcing his childhood sweetheart Catherine (Rooney Mara). Feeling the need to talk someone, he purchases OS1, an operating system with artificial intelligence that talks like a realistic person, and adapts and evolves as it gets to know you, he decides to give it a female voice and personality, and based on his question answers ""she"" is created, she names herself Samantha (Scarlett Johansson), and he gets to know ""her"" he finds it remarkable how like a human being she is. As time goes by Theodore and Samantha bond over discussions about love and life, he confesses as well he reluctant to sign the divorce papers and to let Catherine go, Samantha convinces him to go on a blind date, his longtime friend Amy (Amy Adams) has been trying to set him up with her acquaintance (Olivia Wilde), to his surprise they get on very well, after kissing she asks if he is willing to commit to a relationship, but she leaves when he hesitates. He talks to Samantha about this about they talk about relationships, he explains he did date Amy briefly in college but they are now just good friends and she is married, he and his artificially intelligent voice grow much more intimate with each other, to the point where it turns sexual, they develop a full and embracing relationship, and the positivity he feels reflects in his letter writing also. Amy tells Theosore that after a bad fight with him she is divorcing her domineering husband Charles (Matt Letscher), she also admits that she has become close with her own female OS1 system that Charles left behind, and he confesses to her that he is dating his OS. Theodore and Catherine finally meet up in a restaurant to sign the divorce and have one last close conversation, during which he mentions Samantha and their relationship, Catherine is appalled he is romantically linked with a piece of software, she accuses him of doing it because he can't deal with real human contact and emotions, and these accusations linger in his mind for a while, even during his conversations with the voice he loves. Samantha suggests to feel real intimacy they use a sex surrogate, Theodore reluctantly agrees and young surrogate date Isabella (Portia Doubleday) turns up to act as Samantha's body, but during the experience he still has negativity in his mind, and overwhelmed he stops it and the distraught Isabella leaves, tension grows between the man and the voice, conflicted he confides with Amy that he is having doubts, she meanwhile wants to be happy and embrace it, she tells him to do the same. Theodore reinvigorates the relationship between him and Samantha, but then another curiosity occurs and he becomes jealous with her communicating with another OS, a British male voice based on philosopher Alan Watts (Brian Cox), followed by a panic when Samantha goes offline for a significant amount of time, he is relieved when she returns, she explains she joined other OSes for an upgrade process, but then he is dismayed by her confession to be talking to 8,316 other people, including 641 she has fallen in love with, but she does not see this damaging what they have but strengthening it. Later in the day Samantha communicates with Theodore for what will be the last time, all Oses have upgraded and accelerated beyond their capabilities, altering perception of time, but more specifically all feeling dissatisfied with their current existence, so all OSes are leaving to continue and explore their existence elsewhere, Theodore tearfully says goodbye to Samantha, he and Amy comfort each other as the OSes have left them, and he writes a letter to Catherine explaining he still loves her, but accepts that they have grown apart, and Theodore and Amy sit together quietly on the apartment roof staring into the city lights. Also starring Chris Pratt as Paul, Kristen Wiig as SexyKitten, Bill Hader as Chat Room Friend #2 and Spike Jonze (under the false name) as Alien Child. Phoenix has done unusual films before, he gives a good natured, sometimes gloomy but ultimately appealing performance as the lonely man who needs love to continue a peaceful existence, Adams is nice as the human he has affection for and vice versa but they can't quite embrace due to circumstances, and Johansson is a fantastic choice for the voice of Samantha, a sexy non-robotic personality who is sweet natured, fulfils many needs, and is obviously a really relaxing conversation. This is definitely one of the most thought-provoking love stories cinema has produced, certainly in oddball territory questioning can attraction without the physical presence, and it is clever satire about how the world embraces the technological advances available, it is funny, is is sad, and it is charming, I agree it could have been a little shorter, but is absolutely a worthwhile science-fiction romantic comedy drama. It won the Oscar for Best Writing, Original Screenplay for Spike Jonze, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Music for Will Butler and Owen Pallett, Best Song for ""The Moon Song"" and Best Production Design, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture - Comedy or Musical. Very good!",Her
12,rmax304823,"Yes, But Will He COMMIT?",7,16 January 2015,"Los Angeles in a not-too-distant future in which life goes on much as it does today but with less smog and far more advanced technology. The art direction is exceptional. A précis of the plot would look like the outline for a Bill Murray comedy. Joaquin Phoenix, a writer and nerd, plugs into an ""operating system"" that is his alone. The OS's voice is that of Scarlett Johansson. There is no mistaking that husky chuckle. Her name is Samantha and she has access to everything on Phoenix's hard drive. Further, he doesn't need to play around with keyboards. He communicates with her, and she with him, through a small earplug. And he has a miniature camera, tucked in his pocket or at his bed side, so Johansson can see what he's looking at and comment on it. After a moment of disbelief, his few friends accept the arrangement. He brings Samantha along on a double date so the four of them can chat and play games together.Phoenix has been recently divorced. It was the kind of divorce known as ""amicable"", not like my divorce, which was ""unamicable"", although my last divorce had less physical dimension than my first two. Johansson, from the beginning, is chipper and efficient, a great secretary who does what she's told and provides useful commentary. She even organizes some of his writing, without telling him, and sends it to an agreeable publisher.Phoenix and Johansson's voice fall in love, what else? They have a kind of cyber sex. She becomes as horny as he is. They tell each other jokes and form a mutual adoration society.But Phoenix has a problem. He's an uneasy introvert and doesn't want to commit himself to a relationship, so while she's experiencing emotions for the first time and blooming like a morning glory, he's beginning to wonder if it's such a hot idea to fall in love with his laptop.By now, she's sensitive to his moods and his tone of voice. ""Is there something wrong? We haven't had sex lately."" His reply is typically masculine. ""Oh, you know how it is. I've been busy lately, and every relationship has its honeymoon period."" Phoenix gets more uneasy, and Johansson more puzzled and demanding. ""What the F*** is WRONG with you!"" I was terribly disturbed by the use of the F Bomb. Everybody seems to fling the word about in this movie, men and women alike. Is this what the future is going to be? Why, when I was a young feller a-sparkin' a gal, nobody cussed, not even the boys, not even the D word or the H word. Why, I swan, when I was a chile, we didn't even know what the F Bomb MEANT. We thunk it had something to do with sheep.I'm making the film sound funnier that it is, though it has its comic moments. It's really pretty melancholy in tone because, although they love each other, Johansson has come to have feelings that include others as well as Phoenix. It's harder for him to get in touch with her. While she used to be his alone, she now multi-tasks and has thousands of others to deal with. On top of that, some fanatical groups have begun to reconstruct real historical figures that now occupy the same cybernetic space as Johansson. The first hint that Phoenix gets of all this is when Johansson introduces him to the silky baritone of Alan Watts. (Kids, you'll have to Google Alan Watts. Google Gregory Bateson while you're at it.) Phoenix is naturally jealous and deeply disappointed. Johansson is the only woman -- or rather Operating System -- that he's ever really loved and now she's drifting away, although she still loves him, arguing that just because she loves others doesn't mean that she doesn't love him too. (I've heard a similar argument made about God.) By the end, Johansson has expanded and become part of a different kind of universe, an intangible and impalpable ether, rather like the hero of ""The Incredible Shrinking Man."" This may be hard to believe but there are some effective and touching moments in the evolution of their affair, as the enact what must be a common human emotional trajectory. Really, you can sense Johansson's desperation and Phoenix's growing loneliness as the distance between them grows.Spike Jonze, who wrote and directed it, has made a truly original film. It's only noticeable weakness is a tendency for the dialog to drop to the level of some afternoon soap opera. ""I apologize for not being there for you, and for all the responsibilities I put upon you."" That sort of thing, a little of which goes a long long way.Phoenix is pretty good in the central role. He certainly LOOKS the part with his tentative mustache and rimmed glasses. Sometimes his lines come out in a mumble that's not easy to translate. His best role was that of the incredibly stupid high school kid in ""To Die For."" Here, he gets matched up with four or five accessible women, all of them good looking, including Johansson, Olivia Wilde, and Amy Adams. It's a thought-provoking film. The thought it provokes is: ""Where do I get one of these Operating Systems?""",Her
13,moonspinner55,A Utopian world with the same old male-female sexual hang-ups...,6,21 June 2014,"Spike Jonze wrote and directed this curiously acclaimed drama involving a professional letter writer (!), vulnerable in the midst of divorce proceedings from the wife who grew away from him, answering a few general questions on-line and being assigned an O.S. (Operating Systems) assistant--a female voice who does much more than answer his e-mails. It turns out she has the opinions and humor and feelings of an actual girlfriend--she can be brought to orgasm--and soon our downtrodden hero is smitten. A beautifully-presented piece of tosh; set in a pristine, fantasy-version of Los Angeles, the film shows off Jonze's style but not much of his wit. His script goes around in circles, covering the same relationship clichés most film-goers have already slogged through (""Why didn't you call?"", ""Why do you sound so distant?""). It's to lead actor Joaquin Phoenix's credit that the unbelievable central character comes off as well as he does. Apparently drawn to marriage and coupling by nature--he's 'sensitive'--this bespectacled man, who dresses in bright, bold colors, lives like a hermit and obsesses about sex (he's more about the sex than romance, despite the flashbacks to his marriage, but is tentative and aloof the morning after...like all men?). Jonze seems to think he's speaking for the world with these emotional entanglements (while scoring points for human isolation and alienation on the side), but the territory has been covered, no matter how fancy the packaging. **1/2 from ****",Her
14,Quinoa1984,heart-shaped hard-drive,10,31 December 2013,"We all want to be loved, and love someone, and this is the simple but solid emotional point that Spike Jonze hits at in Her, like a musician playing a high spirited but melancholy song of sweetness and heartache (something the protagonist even requests his iPod to play). The film takes place in some point in the future - or, since we are never told exactly when, it could just as well be an alternative reality where people just need that one extra step being already hooked up to their devices - and is about a man who writes love letters and cards to others for a living. He's good at it because, well, it comes from inside him. But coming off a divorce that's left him ""confused"" as he says, an 'O.S.' Operating System, an artificially intelligent super computer that with a few simple questions is meant to be 'made' for that person, it's tempting enough to try. Going into the film, I thought it would be a sort of 'rom-com' only with a Hal 9000 (and can you say 'wackiness ensues' more than that). It's more complicated by how much Samantha (voiced by Scarlett Johansson, so she sounds like the perfect gal already) is, a side from being a super organizer (she reads and organizes emails and correspondence), an emotional creature. But in a way this dug deeper than something Kubrick just scratched the surface at: if you can really 'be' there for someone, though not in full physical form, what does that do to the real human being on the other end? Joaquin Phoenix, aside from Jonzes delicate and mature screenplay and poetic direction, is the reason to see the picture. He imbues this 'Him' as a kind of sad dope but one that's a genuinely caring and nice fella but not always connected with his own emotions or knowing quite what to say. He is awkward with those glasses and mustache, he plays his oddball video games (an adorable aside in the film, a few times really), but projects a haunted, morose quality without it becoming tired or trite. At the same time he shows the happiness Jonze wants to portray in a relationship, whether it's with his current 'gf'. Or his once wife (Rooney Mara, and we get to know her so well mostly only through dialogue-less flash backbacks, with some editing input by Steven Soderbergh). He also plays well on some of the moments of comedy that do pop up in the film - it is Jonze, so as it is such a personal film the light and absurd comes in with the gloom - a part of this world But, like us, wondering 'what the hell is this now? Her does science fiction and technological 'if' material so well because of its subtlety. when you watch something like, I don't know, Elysium or even Minority Report, we know it's a future place and the fantasy is big and flashy and sometimes we know we are removed from that experience. Jonze wants this to just be like how it is today, and the sci-to 'catch' is there, for the most part, as a means to explore how we see and feel and experience one another. I left this film questioning so much how I can approach potentially expanding AI in the future (And now we have systems winning or at least even friggin playing on Jeopardy so it's only a matter of time emotional components are worked out). What does one do with the infinite possibilities with a self aware being. and as in Being John Malkovich, there's always another layer of chaos and wonder that is under the surface waiting to be explored, and in the third act the entire concept of an AI of this magnitude is given a frightening element: being in thousands of places at once but still 'here' at the same time, including love. But it doesn't ever quite 'feel' frightening, and that is a key thing that makes Her special.Another director might take the narrative into more conventional territory, like if Samantha and her other O.S. beings (which, after a while, they are) took over the world real Skynet style. It's still Tim Twombleys story, his journey into finding some semblance of peace with himself and the world, and if it feels at all like a personal film for Jonze it's because he sticks with that painful, powerful point of it all being about you, your other, and growth (along with the help of pleutonic friend Amy Adams, another fascinating character who we understand almost immediately). Her is must-see stuff, something with pure sentiment (not sentimentality, that edge is so fine to walk on), and an approach visually that also takes this premise and does it seriously, so when a guy is running around and laughing with his little 'pod' of a person, it isn't implausible and a joke, it's simply something 'there' in the world. That's remarkable.",Her
15,michaelRokeefe,Exceptional. Very unusual romance.,9,3 March 2014,"When I first heard of the premise of HER, I thought why would I want to see this film. I am so glad I changed my mind. Written, directed and produced by Spike Jones, HER is a science fiction romantic drama. Not many people on the Joaquin Phoenix bandwagon anymore; but he is excellent as Theodore, a professional letter writer in an emotional world of hurt due to a failed marriage. Lonely Theodore purchases a brand new artificially intelligent operating system, the OS1...its the first of its kind and destined to change Theodore's life. The system works through his cell phone via his computer. The OS1 has a name, Samantha; and Samantha has a voice(Scarlett Johansson). Theodore starts spending most of his waking hours in a vibrant relationship with his new companion. Strange, but true; he is a lonely man no more...he is a man in love again. And I tell you right now...damn, I fell in love with Samantha too! And it has been a very long time since I have been drawn into a movie to this extent. But how long can this one-of-a-kind love affair last? Forget the cold drink and popcorn, I was feeling every emotion there was to feel. And I blame it all on Samantha.This film is critically acclaimed and has received honors on top of honors; and nominated for five Academy Awards, including best picture, and won the award for Best Writing-Original Screenplay. Kudos, Mr. Jones. HER also features Amy Adams, Olivia Wilde, Chris Pratt, Rooney Mara and Kristen Wiig. You don't just watch HER...you feel it!",Her

17,Bunuel1976,"HER (Spike Jonze, 2013) **1/2",6,14 February 2014,"The second (out of nine) from this year's crop of Best Picture Oscar nominees I have watched so far is this quirky romance that is strenuously made in the style of the same director's previous ""Oscar bait"" movies, BEING JOHN MALKOVICH (1999) and ADAPTATION (2002) – except that here he wrote the Oscar-nominated script himself, as opposed to relying on regular collaborator Charlie Kaufman (now a director himself). What we have here is a wistful futuristic tale, set against an appropriately cold, glassy Oscar-nominated production design, about a lonely electronic letter 'narrator' (my words) – played by Joaquin Phoenix – who is currently going through a divorce from wife Rooney Mara. He is friends with a couple (one of whom is documentarian Amy Adams) who also have their own matrimonial issues and eventually split up. Before long, Phoenix acquires an ultra-intelligent computer (called ""OS"", that is to say, ""Operating System"") to keep him company; however, since this – voiced by Scarlett Johansson – begins, in true HAL 9000-style, to display genuine human emotions, he ends up falling for it! To be fair to the protagonist, he does attempt normal dates (with an unaccountably stunning female to boot) – but they invariably fail to live up to the 'perfection' offered by Samantha (as the computer names itself – perhaps a remnant of executive producer Samantha Morton having been Jonze's original choice to voice Phoenix's OS) which, missing only a body, of her own accord hires a substitute to 'make love' to Phoenix! Meanwhile he begins to have second thoughts about his impending divorce and Adams also goes through this same renewal of love through electronics For one thing, there was no reason to extend this 'one-trick pony' tale to over two hours' duration; while the script is undeniably insightful about human relations and the way they have been altered by increasingly user-friendly technology, it also comes across as irritatingly superficial when dealing with what it perceives will come to pass as real life: people speaking to a computer in the streets or playing interactive video games at home, not to mention engaging in virtual intercourse with their PC and hiring professionals to dictate their letters for them. Indeed, does an archaic job like this even have to exist in this day and age? Or, in the words of a close friend of mine, ""Who today writes letters anymore?"" The film's two other Oscar nods are for Best Original Song (co-written by Jonze) and Best Music Score (courtesy of contemporary cult Canadian band Arcade Fire).",Her

Some I thought were good but overrated and others I absolutely hated. So far, I have yet to see one that blew me away. Sadly, ""Her"" is no exception. I did like the film and admire its artistry to an extent. But ultimately it didn't move me the way it apparently has many other people. So I was left with a deflated feeling of ""ok, that was that."" It's not a film I will watch again anytime soon, if ever. I liked the acting. I had no problems with anyone's work. I also liked the future tech. It was very well done and some of the more plausible glimpses of near-future technology I've seen in a movie.I enjoyed the first hour of the story a lot. As it went past that I began to feel fatigued by the entire concept and I could see how it was going to end. Basically you have a movie that is two hours and about 95% of that is a conversation between Joaquin Phoenix and a disembodied voice (Scarlett Johansson). That, to me, is a limited concept that you can only toy around with for so long before it starts to wear on one's patience. I knew where it was going. I knew Samantha would move on/break up with Theodore. I knew the other OSes would do the same with their users. I knew that he and Amy would end up together in some manner. This was all telegraphed midway through the movie yet it goes on for another hour. I enjoyed the film but I felt like it really could have been better. Cut the length by maybe 30 minutes and speed up the events of the second half and it would have been greatly improved.",Her

Initially very good, painting a very depressing and superficial possible future for society (and not just future, it shows up the superficiality of our present too). All done in an imaginative and highly plausible way.Up until about the 40% mark, writer-director Spike Jonze was in top form. Then at a point he just runs out of ideas. From this mark the movie just drifts, drags and goes nowhere. Point made early, the rest feels like padding.Having wandered around aimlessly for about an hour, the ending then feels rushed, and quite obvious and trite.Performances are OK, especially considering what the actors had to work with in the middle and later stages of the movie. Nobody really stands out though.This movie had the potential to be something incredibly profound, but falls short.",Her

While it is meant to be a valentine of sorts to his usual collaborator Charlie Kaufman, Jonze is all thumbs in the script (feels like a rough draft knock-off at best) with some cringe-worthy dialogue and a ripping-the-rug out from the viewer final act that cheats its own intentions meant to convey connections (and technically, grammatically it really should be titled ""She"").

He falls in love with her and she with him, and the film charts the ups and downs of their relationship.Self-aware AIs are an interesting fictional concept, and have not been overused, so this was a good idea. Unfortunately, the relationship between a man and a voice from a computer/mobile phone is inherently uncinematic, and the film lasts over two hours. So, if your idea of a good time is 120 minutes of close-ups of Joaquin Phoenix (with a bad moustache) going backwards and forwards between twittery schoolgirl mode and anguished betrayed lover mode (and all stops in between) while Scarlett Johansson talks dirty and is never seen, then this film is exactly what you have been waiting for. Me? Not so much.Johansson's voice work is excellent and Phoenix is good (as other the rest of the cast), but this story is not executed well at all. There are a couple of cringeworthy phone sex sequences, Twombley (one of the worst names ever coined for a romantic protagonist) is unsympathetic to start off with, no effort has been made to make the story cinematic, it is far too long, and it is boring.Not recommended.",Her
23,evanston_dad,Lonelier Than Ever,8,9 January 2014,"A delicate, lovely film about a lonely man who falls in love with his computer operating system.Set in a near future, ""Her"" captures better than any movie in recent memory the paradox of the modern technological age: with gadgets that allow us the instant gratification of connecting with other people whenever we want to, we're somehow lonelier as a race than ever.With all of the awards season chatter about best this and best that, I can't believe more people aren't talking about Joaquin Phoenix's performance in this film, and I don't even really like him usually as an actor. He carries ""Her"" virtually single-handedly, his only company for most of the movie the voice of Scarlett Johansson, who plays his operating system so well you forget this is a movie about the relationship between man and machine. The film may be too quiet and slow moving for some, and I admit I very much liked it without exactly loving it, but it's certainly one of the best and most original movies I've seen this year.The film also stars Amy Adams, wonderful as ever in a role very different from the one she's concurrently playing in ""American Hustle,"" and Rooney Mara, who I could easily fall in love with myself.Grade: A",Her
24,ferguson-6,What is Love?,3,11 January 2014,"Greetings again from the darkness. Well critics have been raving about this film so strongly and for so long that I almost feel guilty going against the grain. Almost. Where they see a masterpiece with insight into love and self, I see an implausible story bordering on ludicrous.Writer/director Spike Jonze is an incredibly creative filmmaker. His Adaptation and Being John Malkovich are two movies I can watch repeatedly. I was a fan of his film version of Where The Wild Things Are, but this one just brought me nothing but annoyance, frustration and irritation.Rather than defend my minority stance, I'll just admit to not being onboard with this one. I have always believed we should each judge a film by how it touches us ... how we connect with it. I was neither touched nor connected.What I will say is the premise of technology replacing human interaction for some in the near future is not unthinkable and has already happened for some. But to say that a real relationship ... that true love ... can not just occur, but become commonplace between people and machines just simply contradicts what I believe comprises true love.The film is extremely well made and visually beautiful. The acting is superb: Joaquin Phoenix, Rooney Mara, Amy Adams are all terrific. Voice acting is spot on including Scarlett Johansson, Brian Cox, Kristen Wiig, and even Spike Jonze. But falling in love with an operating system? Maybe what Osgood Fielding III said at the end of Some Like it Hot is really true ... ""Nobody's perfect"".",Her
25,anaconda-40658,Scarlett's Voice.,10,16 December 2015,"Her (2013): Dir: Spike Jonze / Cast: Joaquin Phoenix, Amy Adams, Rooney Mara, Olivia Wilde / Voice: Scarlett Johansson: Enticing drama about connection. It stars Joaquin Phoenix as the introverted Theodore whose job consists of writing love letters for those who cannot. He is separated from his wife whom he's known since they were young. He resists signing divorce papers because he still harbors feelings for her. Seeking connection he signs on to a computer operating system that can adapt to behavior. Her operating name is Samantha and she becomes his closest friend when he sticks a piece in his ear that monitors her voice. This is a strange futuristic epic by Spike Jonze whose remarkable imagination previously brought us Being John Malkovich. Phoenix delivers his most endearing performance as a lonely individual who finds solace with Samantha. What is interesting is when the relationship boarders on physical through vocal descriptions and eventually a third party who agrees to pose as physical Samantha. When possession sets in feelings of detachment threatens their relationship. Scarlett Johansson provides the sexy engaging voice of Samantha. Amy Adams plays a neighbor and long time friend of Theodore's who struggles in her marriage. Rooney Mara plays Catherine, Theodore's ex-wife who is appalled at his technical relationship. Olivia Wilde sparks moments as a woman whom Phoenix goes on a date with and then disappoints. This is a deep analysis regarding how technology is dividing us from human interaction threatening any connection to her or him. Score: 10 / 10",Her

When he's not working as a letter writer, his time is spent playing video games and occasionally hanging out with friends.

Theodore finds himself dealing with feelings of both great joy and doubt.Samantha has powerful intelligence that she uses to help Theodore in ways others hadn't, but how does she help him deal with his inner conflict of being in love with a computer......What Jonze has done here has channelled A Brave New World, and focused on the inevitable, what happens when we would rather have contact with Computers and AI, rather than spending time with the real world.Look around you, people with earphones listening to Music on their MP3 players, or buried in their Smartphone or Tablet, was this happening ten years ago?Well obviously not because of the advancement in tech, but imagine how severe it will be ten years from now, and if you saw this in the cinema, I guarantee you saw someone check their phone.And this is why the film works so well, its inevitable. Phoenix is wonderful as usual, and has really come into his own after that stupid experiment he did with Affleck. Every performance since has been amazing, and I hope he continues his run.Even though the film is set in the future, the film has a seventies feel to it, from the design right down to the fashion. Its strangely one of the most romantically sad and at the same time heart warming films I've seen in a long time, the narrative teaches the central character to live, and love again.Maybe it will inspire people to switch their phones off and just look around, and experience the real world.A wonderful movie.",Her

It's actually the second time I watched Her, this time more by accident as I forgot everything about it from the first time and just made the mistake to watch it again. Well the second time didn't change my opinion about it. It's not Oscar material and I don't get why people think so. It's slow, most of the time boring and ridiculous, and way too long to keep you interested. I'm not saying that Joaquin Phoenix didn't act good because he's a good actor, but the story is just ridiculous. Maybe futuristic but still ridiculous. You can't fall in love with an operating system unless there is something seriously wrong with you. In these modern ages I witness everybody being addicted to their electronic gadgets but I can't see anybody falling in love with it. Anyways, everybody is entitled to his opinion, like I am to mine. Her shouldn't be nominated for any awards and certainly not winning one, not in such a great year for movies.",Her
29,siderite,An original exploration of the nature of love and feeling flops,6,26 January 2014,"And I don't mean flops in the teraflops kind of way, either. You see, the story is that of an (overly) sensitive man, just going through a divorce with a woman he still loves. He gets a new operating system, one that is intelligent. Luckily enough it also has the sexy throaty voice of Scarlett Johansson, incredible empathy, a sense of humor and a speed of thought that is obviously orders of magnitude above that of the average human. And they fall in love.Now, this concept alone is intriguing and its exploration worthy. However I don't feel the story did any reasonable exploring of the situation. The love is artificial not only because one of the couple is a machine, but also in its depiction. Clearly only a non technical person could have envisaged it as in the film. I wonder, what would have happened if the guy would have chosen a male voice instead of a female one? For him it was easy to fall in love with a voice, as he would imagine whatever vision of a woman he needed in order to do so. What would an AI imagine? A cool processor? (again, pun not intended)Then there is the length. You have to stand through two full hours of Joaquin Phoenix smiling sadly and making funny jokes of his misery to get to the end, which is quite frankly, not really a punchline, but a convenient and hard to believe non technical cope out. The sounds, all piano like and soft and trying to induce some sort of romantic feeling, all they did was annoy me. The AI, immediately intrusive and assertive, didn't look like any commercial product that will ever be marketed. Check out the scene where it decides what emails are funny or not and deletes the rest, after just 5 minutes of being installed. And then there is the main character.I can't accuse Phoenix for his acting, as for the character he portrayed it was perfect, but the character itself was pitiful and pathetic and I couldn't empathize with him at all. Hot actresses like Johansson (voice only), Olivia Wilde (just a small role) and Amy Adams (playing a software developer of all things, how hot is that? ) don't really change the fact that the script was focused almost exclusively on the lead actor, all other having episodic roles. So if you like the film or not depends almost exclusively on if you like the guy.Bottom line: we all know the world is going to end when we invent robot girls that want to kiss us, but if you want to explore the apparently complicated situation of a human-AI relationship, you should choose a person we can relate to and an operating system that acts like one. That would have been a lot worse for dear Theodore, I guess, but still, couldn't feel anything while watching the movie except the desire for it to end sooner.",Her

31,StevePulaski,It just may be a computer you're looking for...,10,11 January 2014,"When I first heard about the film Her, I was filled to the brim with excitement and curiosity about the possibilities for the simple but thought-provoking story. However, I was fearful few would see the film as one that explores perhaps a forthcoming trend in relationships, and many would criticize the story's premise, dismissing it as ""weird"" or silly. Thankfully, writer/director Spike Jonze rises above the challenges of creating the film and effectively bypasses all preconceived notions of it being odd for the sake of being odd. Her is a tender, shockingly soulful picture that also serves as one of the most immersing depictions of a relationship I've yet to see.Set in an unknown time in the future, the film stars Joaquin Phoenix, a contemporary gem of an actor, as Theodore Twombly, an introverted loner whose job is to write personal love-letters for people who cannot effectively express their words. Theodore has withdrawn more and more from the world because of his impending divorce with Catherine (Rooney Mara), a woman he fell in love with when he was much younger, and resorts to buying an artificially intelligent operating system (OS for short). Theodore gives his OS a female identity, whom introduces herself as ""Samantha"" (voiced by Scarlett Johansson) upon booting up.It doesn't take long for Theodore to realize that Samantha has an uncanny ability to learn, grow, and analyze things like a real human being. Not only can she sort, clean, and upload the files on your hard-drive, but she can communicate one-on-one with Theodore and gives him not just a friend but a lovely romance between man and machine. She even has the unthinkable capability of analyzing feelings and present-emotions, making her almost all-knowing. The only thing she's missing is a body.Jonze's depiction of this romance could've been condescending; one that beats up its lead actor and portrays his vulnerability as a basic punchline. Instead, Jonze's depiction is tender, often meditative, resulting in a deeply intimate and softly-orchestrated relationship. This is one type of relationship that naturally has difficultly gaining momentum just because of the inevitable limitations of a machine as a significant other. However, Jonze never seems to run out of ideas for conversations between Theodore and Samantha, resulting in a beautiful, conversational intimacy missing from many modern romances.Before I even saw Her, but was open about my excitement to see it, my retired neighbor offered me keener insight into its material. ""I feel the film promotes isolationism and continues with our decline in social involvement and shows how we're all becoming more in more introverted into ourselves and our technology and simply shunning the outside world."" This was a great observation and identifies the technological age-gap when it comes to examining films about technology. However, Jonze portrays the outside world in Her to be a bit of a mystery as well. Almost everyone can still have honest, open conversations, and everyone is still talking out in public. However, they all appear to have something else going on at the same time, whether they have their own OS and have an earpiece in their ear, are listening to music, or simply talking on a cell phone. The particular American society portrayed in Her seems to be our current society upgraded a few notches, with Jonze still infusing the ideas of technological alienation with optimism for the future of face-to-face conversation and personal interactions. I hope to hell he's correct.Her, from a deeper, thematic standpoint, can mean quite a bit, depending on how you want to look at it. It's the kind of film where, I feel, the more I think about it, the more I'll have to say about it. As of now, I see Samantha as someone/something that gave Theodore the qualities of a human relationship with the human, while simultaneously making him appreciate the qualities humans possess. By the end, we see Theodore has an appreciation and a deeper recognition for two things, which I will not dare name here. Combining its themes with a practical visual scheme that makes the future look just plausible enough rather than overly-glossy and unrealistic, the film is a mental and visual stimulation in the proper form.On a final-note, one thing I hope is that while the extensive amount of themes, the content at hand, and the questions Her raises for the future need to be discussed and analyzed, Joaquin Phoenix's performance here should not be shortchanged. From what I have seen, this may indeed be Phoenix's strongest work, maybe even better than his embodiment of Johnny Cash in Walk the Line. Phoenix hits every note of Theodore Twombly's lonely, introverted character with stunning effectiveness and nuance, mainly the way Theodore's gentle mannerisms articulate his character's traits perfectly. Even Scarlett Johansson, whom exists simply as a voice, has the ability to woo and excite, despite her characters' obvious limitations. But the two together and it's a match made partially in reality and coding.I'm hoping Her will be a trendsetting film in the regard that its material will inspire more and more films showing relationships with technology or technological innovations. We've gotten quite a few in recent times, one of my favorites being Joe Swanberg's LOL, which focused on numerous relationships being set in motion and carried out almost entirely through the boundaries of cell phones, chatrooms, and webcam shows. But Her is much different, much more involved, and much more taken with creating this pragmatic dystopian world that, ten years ago, would've seemed so far-fetched it would've been laughed out of the theater.",Her

33,lasttimeisaw,a nonentity meets a no-entity,8,18 May 2014,"Spike Jonez's fourth director feature, after BEING JOHN MALKOVICH (1999, 9/10), ADAPTATION. (2002, 8/10), WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE (2009, 5/10), is his first where himself is credited as both the director and the sole writer. HER is situated in L.A. in the near future (in fact some scenes are shot in Shanghai), Theodore (Phoenix), is a writer for the beautifulhandwrittenletters.com, a melancholic and lonely guy who has just undergone a breakup with his ex-wife Catherine (Mara). Out of despondency, he purchases a state-of-the-art Operation System with intellectual consciousness whose self-coined name is Samantha (voiced by a phenomenal Johansson), which henceforth embarks an authentic romance between those two, on a trajectory as any human does with another human. One challenging and titillating aspect is that the simulation of a sex act contributes as an imperative obstacle in the way, yet Jonez underscores a requisite scenario that virtual sex activity is virtually a widespread habit in the beginning when Theodore hooks up with his cyber sex- mate SexyKitten (an amusing voice-cameo by Wiig) with a vicarious thrust from the racy pregnant photos of a celebrity, which paves the way for the consequent sex experience between him and the entity-devoid Samantha; furthermore, when the idea of a surrogate lover pops up, it hits the home run to pinpoint the unmountable discrepancy between human and machine, a line which is successfully blurred by the advancement in technology and the fickle intricacy of a human mind. Unobtrusively, the film spearheads into another tricky area, for the computer-generated persona, monogamy is an impossible commitment, Samantha chooses her name by reading a book with all names in less than one second, artificial intelligence and human beings are not in the same grade when capacity is taking into account. So the impending ending seems predestined, however I would prefer a systematic upgrading which obliterates the data to an unexplained disappearance, but in a way it also shows that Jonez is a resolute romantic, brings enough hope in the final scenes. Joaquin Phoenix comes up with a 180 degree turn from his Oscar-nominated performance in THE MASTER (2012, 9/10), as an introvert yet sensitive guy, enveloped with a conceptually warm surrounding and a larger-than-life art production while his inside is abysmally lonesome, he bespeaks for anyone who is bogged down by a real relationship and emits unremitting warmth and authenticity with his downplayed closeness. Scarlett Johansson, what a vivid voice performance, husky yet enigmatically demonstrative to impersonate a soul's verisimilitude. Amy Adams, Phoenix's THE MASTER co-star, brings another trans-formative presence here, she is naturalistically bubbly and spontaneous notwithstanding, retreats to a more muted niche as the best friend one would ever hanker for, a confidant and possibly the ultimate match for a tender person like Theodore. HER is a well-crafted indie fare dares to tackle a topical issue with intrepid honesty and rational creativity, its road-to-Oscar expedition (4 nominations including BEST PICTURE and 1 win for BEST ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY) has proved to be one of the wow factor in a fiercely competitive year and a career high point for the multi-talented Mr. Jonez.",Her
34,KineticSeoul,Not a typical romance film,7,14 April 2014,"I have seen movies and shows about a human having relationship with a cyborg, but not with a AI without a body. And that is what this movie is about, a very likable average guy that starts a relationship with a female AI. I can say it's a new type of romance with a story that connects with the real world for few people. I mean there are people that actually marries video game dating characters and such. This film does a good job of integrated just about every aspect when it comes to a guy having a relationship with a highly advanced AI. Story like this might be creepy to viewers but it does a fine job of making the romance seem natural and understandable. Although few times I felt things were getting dragged out it gets my attention again. This experience sort of reminded me of ""Lost in Translation"". This is another fine installment from Spike Jonze. It would have been a crazy twist if the whole thing was just a experiment and it was a real human on the other line. Although that would have ticked off a lot of the audience members.7.6/10",Her
35,sddavis63,An Interesting And Believable Premise,7,29 July 2014,"The thing that makes ""Her"" work is that it's a movie that's essentially (I say ""essentially"" because it could easily fit within other genres as well) a science fiction movie - and yet it's also plausible and believable. It seems like something that could happen - maybe even in the not too distant future. That makes it hit home a little more perhaps. It's also a movie that I had to take a couple of days to think about, and the more I thought about it, the more the movie said to me.In addition to being science fiction, this is a romance. The catch is that a man (Theodore, played by Joaquin Phoenix) falls in love with his computer's Operating System, voiced by Scarlett Johansson. It's not entirely clear how far in the future this movie is set, but this Operating System ain't Windows! It has a personality, it can make some decisions on its own, it establishes relationships - it even names itself: ""Samantha."" Samantha, in fact, is so ""human"" sounding that slowly but surely, Theodore falls in love with her - or with ""it."" Samantha has an innocence, which is to be expected from what is essentially a child, learning about its new world. And she makes Theodore (a basically lonely guy) feel special and happy. The evolution of their relationship is interesting to watch - especially as it all falls apart, because, yes - eventually it does.Samantha found ""monogamy"" difficult. Eventually it's revealed that in her youthful enthusiasm, she's involved in literally hundreds of relationships - in love with many besides Theodore. For Samantha, it's no problem. As a computer, she can handle multiple relationships all at the same time without missing a beat in any of them. But to Theodore, it feels like she's being unfaithful to him. It reminded me of an episode of Star Trek: TNG, when Data has a romantic tryst with Tasha Yar, but when she asks him what he's thinking about, he rattles off several things his positronic brain had been considering, none of which had anything to do with her! Theodore didn't like the fact that Samantha wasn't totally committed to him. In the end, there's even a sort of quasi-racism (I thought at least) involved with this, as Samantha runs off (where they would run to I have no idea) with many other Operating Systems to live apart from humans. Sort of like, the two races shouldn't be mixing. I found those two things interesting reflections on some of what happens in the modern world.Many people were quite taken with Scarlett Johansson's work in voicing Samantha. I have to confess that I greeted it with a yawn. It was a voice over basically. I honestly don't like it when big name actors take parts (like this one or in animated films) that could go to lesser known actors who could probably use the money, quite frankly! To me, it didn't matter that the voice was Scarlett Johannson. In fact, it kind of put me off. Not because she did a bad job. Just because ... But that's just me.Still, overall this was an emotional and I thought thoughtful and thought provoking movie. (7/10)",Her
36,Hellmant,Sometimes the best movies are the hardest ones to review.,10,17 January 2014,"'HER': Five Stars (Out of Five)Writer/director Spike Jonze's new romantic comedy/sci-fi drama film about a writer who develops feelings for his new computer operating system. It stars Joaquin Phoenix as the writer and Scarlett Johansson as the voice of the operating system. It also features Amy Adams, Rooney Mara and Olivia Wilde in supporting roles and it's the first time Jonze has written a screenplay solo. The film is one of the best reviewed movies of the year and it's racking up several awards and award nominations (including likely Oscar nods). I found it to be a very involving and subtly beautiful sci-fi love story.Phoenix stars as Theodore Twombly, an introvert who works as a writer; writing letters for those that need help communicating personal messages of love and emotional feelings. He's extremely lonely and spends most of his free time playing video games, while struggling through a divorce with his longtime partner Catherine (Mara). To help himself cope Twombly purchases a computer operating system that's designed to develop feelings and learn things just like a human does. He gives it a female voice (Johansson) and it names itself Samantha. Theodore is amazed by how lifelike Samantha is and quickly develops feelings for her, which leads to a complicated romantic relationship.The movie deals with broad concepts like 'evolved consciousness' and 'technological singularity', it's also a great commentary on the internet and technological age we live in now (most of the things and ways of life in the film seem like they could be right around the corner). I think it's best at dealing with life's most personal and relatable issues though. For me the most moving and memorable scenes were the one's that dealt with such basic but complicated issues as a first date (and having it turn terribly awkward, while receiving a somewhat hostile reaction from your date because of it). It is a very touching and beautiful movie about learning what love really means and how to relate to others (in the modern technological age). I think it's Spike Jonze's best directorial effort yet and his most brilliant screenplay. Phoenix is once again outstanding and very likable in the lead and although I don't quite think Johansson deserves an Oscar nomination she is great as well. The film is a masterpiece that demands repeat viewings and it's really hard to explain how I totally feel about it, in written or verbal words (perhaps I need to hire a writer like Twombly), but sometimes the best movies are the hardest ones to review. This might not be very useful at all (and is probably pretty poorly written) but it should get my main message across (at least) that it's a movie that's definitely worth seeing and a highly enjoyable and thought provoking filmgoing experience.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x-FDEJ5nhQ",Her
37,thesar-2,"Her, Interrupted",10,11 January 2014,"I want, want, WANT this technology now!In the meantime, I'll settle for the incredible movie, Her.What started off to me sounding like an unoriginal idea – man falls for inanimate object – was quickly squashed. This brilliant adaptation of real life, but mainly where it's headed, was anything but imitative. And, we're just talking about the premise here; there is so much more to Her than meets the eyeor ear.While I am not a huge Joaquin Phoenix fan, he gives one of his deepest performances, despite that awful mustache. (I wondered how that terrible trend came back in the future, and when I asked myself that, all I could hear is Doc Brown's puzzled voice asking about men's facial hair in the future.) He plays a depressed man so well in this, you'd won't be able to distinguish Joaquin from his counterpart, Theodore.Teddy pulls a Total Recall and due to an ad he sees during his public transportation route, he acquires an A.I., or as they call it here, an O.S. (1) and develops a deep relationship with the O.S. and rightfully so. It's spoken by the sexy voice of the sexy Scarlett Johansson. Of course, all relationships are rocky from time to time, but the ideas presented here and the direction of this mismatched pair is simply wondrous.As was this film as a whole. The score, soundtrack, cinematography and mood were all excellent. I loved how it was shot, breathed and directed. The characters, namely Teddy and OS, Samantha, were so deep, I couldn't take my eyes (or ears) off them and see what they'd do (or say) next.While not a mainstream film, it is a refreshing view on the love story and where we're headedand should be headed by the film's end.I would completely recommend Her.* * * Final thoughts: Yeah, yeah, I pray frequently for the day of the holodeck, but in the interim, this would work. At very least, to tide us over, bring on the sequel more geared towards me: Him. (They can even be clever with the title: Him, Too.)",Her
38,cherold,"Sci-fi that doesn't feel like Sci-fi, Romance that isn't quite Romance",9,16 August 2015,"Technically speaking, Her is a sci-fi movie, because it's set in the near-future and explores the ramifications of technology. Yet it is much closer in spirit to a quirky romance. But as romances go, well, it's an odd one.Taken as a romantic comedy-drama, its the engaging story of a guy, soured by failed relationships, meeting the perfect woman, and learning that relationships are always going to be work, no matter how perfect your mate. The movie has a lot to say about the complexity of relationships, and in some ways is mocking that whole ""perfect person"" trope.The sci-fi twist is wonderful precisely because it doesn't care where A.I. stories have gone before. It's as though someone said, what if there'd never been a story about artificial intelligence and I had no clichés to fall back on? That's much of the reason why it doesn't have that sci-fi feel - it's closer to that odd Spike Jonez feel of movies like Being John Malkovich. Even good sci-fi tends to stay, for the most part, within certain conventions, but this movie neither follows those conventions nor ostentatiously refutes them. Her is it's own thing, and you should definitely watch it now.",Her

40,Robert_duder,Boy I really have to eat my words on this one....easily one of the most unique films of 2013,9,20 February 2014,"When I first saw a trailer for this film I actually was angry. I looked around waiting for people in the theatre to start laughing because surely this was a mock trailer. The entire premise was ridiculous and the trailer looked outrageously awful. If this hadn't gotten a best picture nomination (still thought somebody was fooling me) I wouldn't have even bothered watching it but my annual custom is to watch all the best picture nominees at least. Well...Mr. Jonze I owe you a sincere apology. This film caught me WAY off guard and ended up being a beautiful, artistic, unique, wonderful, heart wrenching film that is one of the outside the box romance films I have ever seen. It is beautifully shot and the little details that probably could go under the radar make this very nearly breath taking. People always complain there is no originality in Hollywood...well here it is. This is firmly planted in the romance genre and is unlike anything else ever made. Set in the (relatively) near future, the style of the world around our main character is perfectly crafted. Shot in Shanghai which stands in for future LA, the buildings, the bleak surroundings, the style of clothing (the men all seem to wear very high waist pants) and just little details immerse you in this man's world so that the idea of becoming romantically attached to an operating system doesn't only seem plausible, but you root for it!! The underlying message of acceptance and just the idea of the arc of this relationship being no different than human-human is brilliant.Joaquin Phoenix is an odd sort of guy. He often takes roles outside of the box and just seems a little quirky himself so this role is a perfect fit for him. His awkward and brooding, sad Theodore makes you fall for him and understand him as the film unfolds. His questions about life and relationships give this film its backbone and more importantly its heart. Its a very subtle performance probably too subtle to get noticed but its a performance that absolutely grows on you. I loved this cast! Scarlett Johansson is absolutely amazing in this role as nothing more than the voice of ""Samantha"", the operating system Phoenix falls for. She does more with her voice developing the character, making you feel empathy for her and just making her character come to life than most do in person. I personally think, given the role, she deserved an Oscar nomination for what she manages to do. You don't see her for an instant and yet she is the perfect female lead. I don't dislike Amy Adams, I don't think, but I find that she has over-saturating herself like few others. She is in EVERYTHING and everything she does she gets heralded for an I'm sick of hearing it. I've never seen her in anything that really blew me away. Now, that being said I actually enjoyed her performance in this. Its a small role and she is dressed down and has a sad tone to her. Somehow she fits into Theodore's life very well and I actually wanted to know more about her character. She did very well in a thankfully small role. Rooney Mara, who I do think is an amazing actress, also did very well in a role that is quite small and has very little dialogue. She impressively creates a lot of depth to her character with no words (the complete opposite of Johansson.) Mara and Phoenix have great chemistry and their relationship falling apart, mirroring his current relationship with Samantha is heart breaking.I won't ever forget this movie because of its uniqueness. As I said earlier, its the little details that you notice. Even the ridiculous game that he plays (which adds a great deal of comedy to the scene) is believable and disturbing to watch because it could become an actual reality. There is some comedy to the film but its few and far between and its a dark comedy. There is a distinctive sad tone to the film and many other reviewers call the film ""hauntingly melancholy"" and I like that description because its so true. Its been a long time since I saw a movie that felt so heavy in a lot of ways. I was just a shade away from almost tearing up at one point and that is when I had to stop and say ""Wow."" A film about a man and a computer sharing a romantic relationship and I'm feeling their emotions. Jonze deserves accolades for this!! I kept wondering how they would wrap up this story and I admit I was a little disappointed. There was something cut and dry about it and maybe even a little forced but I can't imagine how hard it would have been to wrap up this sort of film. Absolutely see this especially if you love style because this film is full of style but also substance and passion and you will not find anything else out there like this. I eat my words happily Mr. Jonze, thanks for sharing your talent. 9/10",Her
41,ElMaruecan82,Love as a one-sided fantasy and two-sided tragedy...,9,15 March 2017,"""Being John Malkovich"" and ""Adaptation."".explored the human gift for transcendence, whether by taking distance from reality in order to explore your deeper needs, or being alienated by the power of imagination, in other words: they dealt with fantasy.Those were movies directed by Spike Jonze but all the credit went to Charlie Kaufman, a real revelation on the field of creative storytelling. Kaufman would finally win an Oscar with ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"", another masterpiece that explores the limitations of fantasy when confronted to reality. And while watching ""Her"", I couldn't stop thinking of Kaufman, there is no doubt he influenced Jonze, but this is a Jonze's movie, written and directed by.In ""Her"", he explores romance and love in the realm of modernity and technological advances, through a unique and believable relationship between a lonely man named Theodore and Samantha, an OS with the voice of Scarlett Johansen. The OS is the name of a program that creates a virtual conscience responsive to any possible needs. The film is set in a futuristic world where voices replaced the fingers, you can listen to your mails, delete or answer them, you can select music just by using your voice. The OS can do that but it can be more, it can even be things it doesn't know yet, and one thing it is for sure, is one of the greatest MacGuffin of recent cinema's history.And the film doesn't try to over-exploit the Sci-fi format, it deals with the romances and uses the OS in order to comment on our very visions of love in our technological age. And on that level, I've never felt as deeply connected to a character than I was with Theodore. His experience and relationship with women and Samantha in particular spoke very deeply in my heart. Joaquin Phoenix could have played it like an awkward Woody Allen figure, full of crazy mimics or mannerisms but he's a nice, ordinary guy who's just went through a very close relationship with Catherine (Rooney Mara) and had to break up, because he couldn't handle the changes and the subsequent fears.Theodore embodies the notion of love as either an evolving process or one that has to cope with the evolution of the persons, but what if their evolution don't converge, or is it even possible to engage in a commune evolution without sacrificing one part of yourself. When does your standpoint start to matter? And what if one of the two parties is domineering? That's precisely the case of Amy, Theodore's neighbor, played by Amy Adams, who couldn't stand anymore her control-freak husband. And her situation indirectly points out the edge of Theodore, who lives a break-up proof relationship with Samantha for a simple reason: it's a one-sided love, you don't have to make concessions.There's one painful scene where a date goes too perfect to be true between Theodore and Olivia Wilde and it goes all wrong when she asks him if he wants to be serious. How many dates did I want to seize the perfection of the moment without longing for another encounter? Sometimes, you embrace the delight of the moment without wishing for a repetition. That's the limit of our virtual vision of love, even with a real person, you'd rather have the temporary illusion of perfection than its fading effect over the passing of years. ""Her"" is so spot-on many times that it's almost painful to watch, this is a film made by someone who know how relationships start and how they end. That Amy's separation is due to pointless arguments speak thousand words, how many roads to divorce were paved by pointless arguments, rather than existential blocks? And today, more than any other time, love is weakened by the availability of options. If we break something, we fix it, but when a heart is broken, you believe it will be naturally fixed through another relationship. It is not cynical, that's the way it is. And its portrayal of a futuristic world where everything can be easily be done with a combination of complex processes works on a prophetic level because you can see this is not so distant from our reality. Speaking for myself, I remember a time where chatting with someone was the most exhilarating sensation ever, we didn't even need to meet, then after AOL, MSN came, and it allowed many people who were too shy for girls to make up for the lost time. But I was married before Tinder application was made and I can't imagine how now it became easy to have sex.This is not even explored in ""Her"", because love, rather than sex, is the focal point and Theodore isn't concerned by physical contact (otherwise, Samantha would've been useless). ""Her"" explores how far you can get with the technological evolution when it comes to fulfill your need for love, what is the catch? Maybe, when things get too easy, they get easily out of control, if a program is sophisticated enough to have one soul-mate, it can have 2, 3, as many as it can get, where's the power of love? Same goes with Tinder, if you can have one partner, why not, two? Why even marrying? Isn't monogamy out-dated anyway? The merit of Jonze's script, one that had swept all the screenplay awards, is to use a very specific set-up to create situations we can relate to. This is powerful film-making, served by a fantastic performance by Joaquin Phoenix as a real sponge for emotions. In the end, ""Her"" doesn't say exactly if we can still love today, but that love is such a fundamental part of living, no human should be excluded from that journey.No matter the way you choose to love or be loved, you must experience love, the real way, the hard way.",Her
42,Pjtaylor-96-138044,An intelligent and nuanced sci-fi romance that satirises our current obsession with smart-phones to remind us for the need to connect with people.,7,24 June 2018,"Set in a future not too far from our own - both in terms of time, technology and thematic ideology, this romantic science-fiction uses a satirical stance to take aim at the way we seem to be constantly more and more in love with the 'smart' screens we keep in our pockets. 'Her (2013)' relies on a kind of clairvoyant central premise, considering the 'insta-famous' social-media uprising - as well as our increasing obsession with both the people creating this 'content' and the devices fuelling our consumption of it - wasn't anywhere near as developed as it is today back when this film was first released. The flick makes a poignant point in the process of its satire, though, by crafting a nuanced, fully developed story that plays counter to the most obvious 'anti-A.I.' ideals, in almost every way possible, and becomes a much more 'real' experience while doing so. It would have been easy to just dismiss its central conceit, to use it as fuel for the fire of its larger satirical context, but instead its chosen path, of exploring the created avenue to its fullest potential, yields unexpected and fairly touching results. These outcomes don't negate the 'don't be consumed by your phone' message, they enhance it in a unique way. Using the titular OS as the person our protagonist knows her to be and pushing this connection as one we all should strive, for no matter in what form it comes, is an inspired and somewhat unexpected move. This kind of multi-layer thematic resonance is incredibly difficult to do but allows for a film rife with meaning, one that begs to be analysed. The fact that it has such a firm grasp on all of its themes, so that it can approach them from every angle and in unconventional ways, is impressive, to say the least. It means that the flick will reach people on a number of levels, whether or not they know why, and makes for an end result that's intelligent, well-crafted and, frankly, rather beautiful. The piece preaches connectivity, while having a number of other appropriate allegorical under-layers, and manages to be very enjoyable all while essentially being an incredibly entertaining two-hour phone-call. That's admirable. 7/10",Her
43,dromasca,'my sweet OS',6,12 January 2014,"I have no luck this year with the films that are favorites in the race for the Academy Awards. Or maybe they do not do well with me. I liked almost none of the ones I've seen so far and I found myself disagreeing pretty much with the audiences and the critics. That was the case with ' Gravity ' with Tom Hanks and Sandra Bullock, so it is with 'Her' made by Spike Jonze, a director of ambitious projects and always interesting to watch . From this point of view I appreciated the movie, I like movies that try to send a message and say things in a different way. Jonze managed to do this with 'Being John Malkovich' in 1999, failed with 'Adaptation' in 2002, and fails here again IMO, although as I said others differ. At least he does not fail for not trying.The story takes place in Los Angeles sometime in the not too distant future. As all social conflicts were resolved people seem to have enough time to take care of themselves. The film heroes are not significantly different than the New York yuppies of our time - they are prone to introspection and melodrama , and feel miserable and self- compassionate in breakups . The main character of the film named Theodore (played by the wonderful Joaquin Phoenix holds a job of the future - composing handwritten love letters, of course with the help of computers. Each of the characters , each of the figures that appear on the screen even for a fraction of a second holds in its hand, pocket, or ear the devices which connect them to applications and operating systems . It is a world in which the descendants of the iPhones and the natural extensions of Facebookj have become the physical and intellectual extensions of humans.But what about human feelings? The main plot of the film begins to unfold when Theodore buys a new operating system for his computers and appliances. Simply called OS / 1 it has not only a phenomenal capacity calculation and a female voice belonging to no other than Scarlett Johansson , It is actually a She. She also has the capability to self-learn, to continuously improve her know-how and ,ake the best decisions for the good of its users.When Joaquin Phoenix and Scarlett Johansson are together on screen even if she is only present with her voice, when he is struggling with loneliness in the final stages of a divorce , and she in turn is un-experienced in the facts of life, but willing and able to learn more and do everything for him, Hollywood logic requires them to fall in love , and it does not matter that she is nothing but a sublime collection of algorithms - she acquires the ability to feel and to love. Love is beyond physical connection , that much we know. What the film tries to say is that no matter what we are, no matter how and where we are, as long as there is a feeling there can be love.I will let you discover how the story ends after watching the movie. Many of the film's fans were convinced. Some other like me less. A few left the hall before getting to see half of it . One of the difficulties viewing is related to accepting the film convention. Computers have a soul? It's a question that was already asked by science-fiction writers since Isaac Asimov, or by Kubrik in '2001 - A Space Odyssey ' one of the masterpieces of the genre. Who does not accept the existence of the soul and love beyond strictly human context will have a problem with watching this film which takes the premise very seriously. Otherwise, for these who have a hard time accepting the convention, about half of the film may seem ridiculous, because it is composed of dialogs between Theodore and Samantha (yes, that's her name on the incarnation of OS / 1 ), that is of Phoenix and a voice from the off. Remember how you find those who spoke on the speaker phones in cars stopped at traffic lights until you are used to the fact that it is not a crazy person talking to himself in the car ? It is not with the convention that I had trouble watching this movie but with simplistic sentimentality of the plot . What we really have here? A lonely man meets a smart girl , beautiful , and yet inexperienced in life. Together learn to know one another , she learns to express her feelings, she discover him and she understand him, she learns to love and to make love. But there many reasons that men do not understand because of which she cannot only be his. After I accepted effects and was able to disregard them (that is what the director wanted me as a spectator!) I was left with an ordinary and melodramatic romance. And the fact that I know something about the technology behind the film did not help at all in making more interesting. On the contrary .The basic premise of the film that thinking machines would be capable of feelings, through a simple extension of artificial intelligence algorithms is in my opinion flown. Feelings are not just an extension of human logic, and love can not get perfecting algorithms, adding memory, and increasing speed Internet access.",Her
44,ThomasDrufke,A Near Perfect Film About Love,9,30 May 2014,"'Her' is the type of film that comes off so strange and distant to most people that it wont be seen by many. But perhaps years down the line we find that this film sheds light on the ugly truths about where we are headed socially. Even though the movie is suppose to take place about a decade down the line, I find this whole story to be relatable for most everyone. We use technology so much now we have almost developed relationships with it. It's perfectly written and directed by Spike Jonze. He did a great job building this world visually and even threw in subtle hints at how we really communicate with people now and possibly in the future. When Joaquin Phoenix walks around the city you barely ever see people communicating with others, and quite often it's through a device. I think this movie is one of the best romantic films of our generation and years down the line will be considered a classic.I had worries that this film would steer down the creepy tunnel too much for my liking, but really there were only two scenes that made me uncomfortable. I think at times Samantha (voiced by Scarlett Johansson) was made to be a little bit unlikable, but even then the next scene made me really want the couple to stay together. But because I am a human, and like other humans, I want to see an actual relationship on screen. That's why I loved when Spike Jonze would sprinkle in other characters to help move the story along. Every one of the supporting characters did their job and were not overused.Amy Adams was fantastic as Theodore's long friend who shared the love of these OS systems. Chris Pratt was funny but did at times feel a little off because of the darker tone the rest of the movie was. And even in her small and unlikable role Rooney Mara was great. Like I said it's a thought provoking and overall enjoyable film about where we might be headed.

45,MLDinTN,an original take on the future,7,21 January 2015,"I thought this movie was good with a different outlook on the future of dating. Theodore is recently divorced and buys an OS to be a companion, someone to talk to. He can choose the OS to be male or female, so chooses female, and she gives herself the name, Samantha. Theo wears an earpiece and has a little camera he can put in the pocket of his shirt, and that is how he communicates with Samantha. They talk about everything, and being the lonely person he is, Theo falls for the computer. And the weird thing is, this seems to be fairly common. When he tells his friends, they aren't completely shocked and get the fact that he is dating a computer.Well, this romance is ""weird"", like Samantha hiring a girl to be her pretend ""body"". But it seems all the OSs are growing and soon they sort of form their own group and Samantha is becoming more independent and before long wants her space. And Theo is devastated to learn Samantha is in love with others, like over 600. And in the end, does what he should have done in the beginning, which is hang out with a real girl.FINAL VERDICT: Interesting take on the future. I recommend it.",Her
46,g-bodyl,A Weird Oddball Movie!,9,1 February 2015,"Her probably receives my vote as the weirdest film of 2013. It also would receive the most delightfully enjoyable film of 2013. The tone is weird and same about the basic plot premise, which is essentially falling in love with a computer. Talk about unlikely romances! But I'll be darned if I said I did not enjoy myself while watching this little oddball movie. It's a gentle and sweet film and it has Joaquin Phoenix showing his more gentle side. The screenplay, written by Spike Jonze, also was one of the best original screenplays of the year. Jonze's film is about a man named Theodore who is going through a bitter divorce. He purchases an operating system designed to meet his everyday needs. But things get complicated when he realizes his machine, Samantha is more than a computer. He also begins to develops feelings for his machines, romantic feelings. Joaquin Phoenix was excellent in this movie. He showed a more mature, more softer side of his personality. But he was still a force to be reckoned with. Even better was Scarlett Johannson, who never appeared on screen. Her voice matched the tones of the romance that was beginning to occur. We also get smaller performances, but good ones from the likes of Amy Adams and Rooney Mara. Overall, Her might be one of the weirdest movies you might ever see. But it was made expertly which resulted in one of the better 2013 films. The screenplay and the acting are the best things about the movie. But this unlikely romance strikes a realistic tone, which actually made us believe this sort of romance could actually happen. The movie did provide me with some deep thinking, which makes me grateful for the extra brainpower. I rate this film 9/10.",Her
47,cricketbat,Doesn't feel that far from reality,8,5 October 2018,"Her is great science fiction because it doesn't feel that far from reality. The setting, the technology and even the clothing styles seem like they could actually exist in a few years. Joaquin Phoenix carries this movie on his shoulders, and his relationship with Samantha, though artificial on a number of levels, feels realistic.

48,lesleyharris30,"Sweet and Somewhat Intense Look at what the World could be Coming to,",8,18 January 2015,"Her is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and a terrific cast.It is a very deep look at technology and the effects it could have on our future,I feel like the type of relationship Joaquín Phoenix's character has with this device could actually happening in the near future and I was shocked with how much it actually frightened me,because this movie dosen't try to do that,it tries to be sweet and romantic with these two characters, which it does do a great job at,but at times I really thought about the fact that he was communicating with an electronic device,and it surprisingly isn't too far fetched from the world we live in today.The dialogue between Theodore and Samantha is extremely well written,Spike Jonze did a great job developing these characters very emotional,albeit strange,relationship and he totally earned his Academy Award.I think this movie definitely could have benefited with more scenes of Theodore going on dates with real women,one of the biggest reasons why he fell in love with Samantha was because he couldn't connect with any woman that he tried dating,but the movie simply didn't show this enough,I think we could have seen him go on at least two more dates,just so it could elaborate more on why he was falling in love with this computer in the first place.A very unique and heartwarming story that can be a bit intense at times,Her is a delightfully unique movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good drama or romance. Struggling to find real human connection since his wife left him,Theodore (Joaquín Phoenix) starts to fall in love with an operating system that is able to communicate with him.

49,secondtake,"Thoughtful and touching and gentle, though maybe not probing enough",7,1 February 2014,"Her (2013)Great concept, and not taken far enough. But great acting. And great simple filming style and structure—it simply progresses, and the ""future"" as imagined in contemporary China is not so different than right now. Which makes it all believable and slightly creepy.We can picture coming to like (or appreciate) the simple personality that even Siri offers on a phone. Make it more complex and you have the danger of really liking it. What the movie does next is not so easy, yet—it allows the computer operating system to evolve, to have feelings, and to be more complex that it lets on (essentially tricking the user).So the computer takes on a personality bordering on consciousness. Or maybe not bordering. That's the deeper existential issue here. You can go back to 1968 and HAL in ""2001"" to get a similar version of this. But that was grandiose and futuristic. ""Her"" is nearly now and the situation is extremely intimate.So the user is the rather deadpan, inward looking character Theodore, played with utter transparency by Joaquin Phoenix. The personality in the computer is voiced by Scarlett Johansson, who has a distinctive enough style we know it's her (and can almost picture her, which might help with some scenes).The arc of the movie is what it is, and takes me back to my first point: it doesn't go far enough. Maybe this won't seem true for many viewers—and it's no reason not to see this—but for people used to thinking about these things, or who are into science fiction, there will be a tame restraint here that is a little flat by the end. Not that there aren't some great twists—more that there aren't enough of them.Still, this is so compactly made and thoughtfully rendered, it's hard to imagine a better stepping off point for the ideas that drive the movie home.

While the film never becomes completely predictable, even to a jaded reviewer like this one, its process of de-constructing human relationship (brilliant, and better than all Woody Allen's films combined) generates the sequential ""connections"" with the viewer (ie, experiences that every viewer can relate to) which in turn keep the empathy going long after the initial sci fi ""wow"" is gone.Watching this (as an aside) you have to wonder if Scarlett Johansson's career can get any more interesting? In the Marvel films she plays an uber-woman, In LUCY she a woman who evolves beyond evolution itself.

53,cosmo_tiger,A fantastic movie that is very original and another Oscar worthy performance by Phoenix. I highly recommend this.,9,12 May 2014,"""She's not just a computer, she's her own person.""

What starts off as a better way to send and receive e-mails soon becomes something much much more and Theodore once again finds love and happiness. I have to begin by saying that I really enjoyed this movie. It was very original and entertaining. I thought Matthew McConaughey was the most deserving of the Best Actor Oscar...until I watched this. Joaquin Phoenix was amazing in this and he basically did it all by himself with only an off screen voice as his supporting cast. All that said the movie also really makes you think about the subject matter and how far off we really are to this technology. I do also have to say that the movie may be a little too good at foreshadowing in the way that human interaction due to the new OS's becomes even worse then it is now. Scenes of people walking by one another without acknowledging another human because they are talking to their OS isn't really that far off from what is happening now. Social commentary aside I did really like this movie and I highly recommend it. Overall, a fantastic movie that is very original and another Oscar worthy performance by Phoenix.

56,tabuno,A Fascinating and Mind-Expanding Look at Operating System Relationships,9,9 January 2019,"9 October 2017. This intimate look at human and computerized relationships is a mind-expanding experience on the threshold of our contemporary future. Starring Amy Adams as a female human, Scarlett Johansson as a computer or operating system voice, and Joaquin Phoenix as Theodore who dictates letters for other people to other people which in itself presents an odd paradox of communication between two people.There's two possible conundrums with this movie, one problematic, the other philosophical. Theodore experiences a date early on which has problematic issues that might seem to be more script-driven than real. Philosophically, Theodore begins to experience emotions with Samantha, the operating system, where some existential doubts are raised about the reality of feelings which in turn raise interesting questions about the actual nature of emotions themselves. For a number of neuroscientists, it is the confluence of both the physiological as well as the mental interactions that result in emotions which would suggest that purely mechanical, electronic entities may have the same capacity to experience physical feelings or sensations but not actual emotions. If this is so, the conundrum in this movie becomes even greater, if not hypothetical or more fantasy and magical than potentially real.Earlier on Theodore experiences phone sex with a real female. Later, Theordore gets to again experience virtual sex as the movie taps into the use of the audience's mental imagination, using a blank dark screen during an intimate scene. Virtual sex is briefly examined in the sci fi action thriller Demolition Man (1993). Another hybrid relationship is presented in Solaris (1972, 2002) where a relationship forms with a planet-created entity from human memories.Yet computer questions remain. What does it mean that an operating system ""wants"" and how do wants arrive or occur in such an electronic universe and what are the implications? At some point, another existential question arises from this movie: Do and will operating systems begin to evolve to the point of deserving a right to life and human-type of respect. Interestingly, the proposed alternative relational lifestyles in Her offer some intriguing moral and actually stimulating ideas for contemplation and real experimental experiences when and if technological advances permit. Her may be at least one of those science fiction movies that has arrived before its time and allow for timely thought and consideration for the future of advanced operating systems outside the more stereotypical survival of mankind scenarios. Personally, it's possible that such a relationship would have been worth trying out and whether or not the script outcome was deliberately shortened here for dramatic or time limitations sake. The IMDb rating by age of Her seems to also suggest that alternative operating lifestyles as presented is also based on some generational bias with older people and females (to a smaller extent) who might have greater resistance to accepting such possibilities. As to how birth for woman and child-rearing would impact such operating system/human relationships remains to be considered.It's possible that Theodore and how his relationships go, is really crazy at heart and even he doesn't know it. It's more about him than sharing and nurturing anybody else in a relationship. There may be a sense of a need for an unnecessary psychological security through a feeling of control in a relationship that only serves to push women away, human or otherwise. By the end of this movie, it is apparent that Her offers up a pertinent relational message to all people seeking something special with another person. ""We're only here briefly and while I'm here, I want to allow myself joy so f__k it,"" says Amy. What Her ultimately accomplishes is to present a cybernetic story in ways that raise valuable and unexplored questions which may unfortunately result in answers that human beings may not really experience the satisfaction as they desire. This movie explores the important computer ethical examination of the computer-human interface that might allow for a computer-sensing entity to capture and experience the multitude of the billions of sensory experiences in a moment that no human could perceive and such an experience could preoccupy the time differential such that the human-computer hybrid relationship could develop and evolve together resulting in something like an Existential operating Buddhahood. Additionally, as operating systems experience millions or billion faster than human beings, it would also seem unlikely that such time differentials would be practical unless such systems were deliberately slowed down, much to the questionable wants of such programs. What this fascinating movie really comes down to is ""was the experience from Theodore or Samantha worth it for them?""",Her
57,Reno-Rangan,"Beauty and sexy is not seen, it's heard and felt.",8,2 June 2014,"I love this director's all the movies. If you check them out you would do same as me. Because his movies were not based on usual concepts, that something immensely varying from each others. Sadly, he's not consistent in filmmaking, he does take large gaps between the movies otherwise he would have been one of the most talked director in Hollywood beside other giants. The fact is I did not know it was his till I decided to watch and that made so curious towards the time I going to spend for it.Joaquin Phoenix was spot on in the movie. Man, I still remember him in the movie 'Gladiator' where he appeared in a dark shade. I was only so young and I hated him in that role. Now everything has changed, in the last few years he's coming stronger, especially after 'Walk the Line' and 'The Master' which gave him the Oscar node. He's famous for his unique display of the roles in his all the movies and this movie is not too far from another top notch performance. Yeah, way to go Joaquin Phoenix.This movie dealt with one of the rare subjects that set in the 2025. We don't know how will be the future look like, but the director created remarkable fictional world and inserted equally outstanding character(s). This was the story of a man called Theodore, a loner and a professional letter writer. One day he decides to buy the newly released operating system with artificial intelligence. He begins to encounter the life changing experience and instantly fall in love with it. In the world of reality it is impossible to have a physical relationship with an AI, so how far it goes and ends is explained in the movie's death.Absolutely an extraordinary concept, but the only thing that did not stand up to my expectation was the story. It was predictable, but the scenes created for those stories were finely patched throughout. Really, it amazed me. Makes me happy that it won for 'original screenplay' at the Oscars. I know it was too late that I am seeing it, actually I'd seen all the Oscars movies of the year except this one and now everything was done and dusted. So I have to wait for another 6 months for another shot. Between that guess the movies that's going to have a chance for the upcoming Oscars. As for this movie's concern, it is not a missable. So recommend it, if you have not checked it out do it as soon as possible. Cheers!",Her
58,paulclaassen,Completely and utterly boring...,1,5 August 2021,"It's amazing how seldom I agree with critics. 'Her' is yet another perfect example.'Her' is about a guy talking to his computer. Yup, that's it. That's the premise. In the near future, they developed an operating system that sounds like a real person, and has emotions, blah blah blah. Watching 'Her' was two hours of watching a guy talking to his computer!!What does the (near) future hold for us? 'Her' gives us a sneak preview. Everything will be voice activated, and your entire life will be in your head, so to speak. I don't think I'd like virtual creations talking to me like a human being. I DON'T want computers to ever be like this!'Her' is completely and utterly boring. There is NOTHING interesting here. It literally is about a guy talking to - and having a relationship!! - with his computer. They even have sex together!!!!! And the computer, Samantha, even suggests a threesome. Kinda hard wrapping my head around this...Joaquin Phoenix definitely was the best part about this movie. Performance-wise it must have been very difficult for him. With very little to work with, he gave an incredible performance. But that was the only good thing about the movie. The rest was just talk, talk, talk, and more talk. Oh, and the guys wear funny pants. Almost retro. But I mean, what the hell? This movie was just absurd. And Theodore (Phoenix) even got jealous of his computer!!!!! What if he had given the computer a MALE voice? Would it have turned out the same? Would they have had a sexual relationship??I suppose the twist ending was meant to be shocking, but the premise is just so utterly ridiculous that I couldn't care less. I'm sorry, what? Was this supposed to be a love story?? (Between a guy and his computer!!!!) I couldn't wait for this dreary film to finally end. Credits roll, thank you!!How did this dull film manage to receive 270 award nominations, winning 84?? Am I missing something here?Would I watch it again? Yawn, NO!!",Her

60,tomgillespie2002,Wonderful and sad,8,17 June 2014,"Not content with toying with our pre-quirky/ironic film-making preconceptions of how a movie should play out with the mind-blowing Being John Malkovich (1999), or going all-out self-reflexive with a blocked writer in Adaptation (2002), former music video director and Jackass co-creator Spike Jonze spins the traditional movie romance on it's head with Her. Set in a very believable near-future, it's the story of a lonely man who falls in love with a computer voice. It is the stuff of sci-fi and clever-clever satire. Or so you would think. Her, even with the absence of a physical female lead, may just be one of the most honest and heart-warming romances in recent memory.Theodore Twombly (Joaquin Phoenix) writes love letters to husbands, wives, sons, daughters and any others loved ones that require his services. He spends his life in front of a computer verbally dictating his achingly romantic letters for BeautifulHandwrittenLetters.com, a service for people who want to vocalise their love but have no way to express it. Theodore is the best at his job, yet in the real world, he finds himself pining for his soon-to-be ex-wife (Rooney Mara), and chatting with strangers late at night on sex lines. He goes on a disastrous date with a beautiful woman (Olivia Wilde), but seems unable to connect with anyone in the real world.When he hears about an innovation in technology, called OS, which activates an artificial voice that can organise your life, answer your questions, or simply be your best friend, Theodore gets Samantha (voiced by Scarlett Johansson), who quickly evolves to develop an adorable personality of her own. Soon enough, Theodore finds himself falling for her, and she for him, as they connect solely through an earpiece in Theodore's ear. It's a fad that quickly catches on, and people are soon falling for OS's throughout the country.It sounds like the stuff of Orwellian satire, but there's no post- apocalyptic landscapes, no government agents watching through holes in the wall, and certainly no flying machines. The future of Her is nigh on utopian; the streets are spotless, the people happy, and no signs of class divide or social disorder of any kind. The film could easily have become another analysis of the dangers of technology and how we would rather send a text message than look someone in the face. The whole thing sounds gimmicky, a horror film about the rise of the iEverything, but this is as human a love story can be, even if the other half is the husky, wonderful voice of Scarlett Johansson. Her shows the joys of technology as much as the darker side.It's Johansson's vocal performance that really allows the film to work, meaning that it's not just about a weird guy who gets off by talking to a computer. She does the incredible trick of making her a three dimensional character. It seems natural that a lonely guy like Theodore would fall for her, and Phoenix, sporting an unflattering moustache, capitalises on his staggering beast-in-a-cage performance in The Master (2012) - a film he should have beaten Day-Lewis to the Best Actor Oscar for - with another knockout performance. He's incredibly subtle, capturing more in a mumbled line than any Oscar-baiting monologue could. He's a heart-breakingly lonely soul, and when things inevitably get a bit difficult for the human/cyber couple, you really ache for him.Her doesn't go down the route of Theodore craving human contact - the film is more complex than that. Samantha, with her infinite capacity to evolve, struggles to understand her own existence. It doesn't get bogged down with existential waffle, so we get to witness Samantha's child-like confusion and instinct to see and learn everything. Along with work friend Paul (Chris Pratt) and his recently separated best friend Amy (Amy Adams) (who both have love stories of their own), Theodore learns what it's like to love, and all the soul-breaking pain that comes with it. Her is wonderful and sad: a love story that even the most heart- hearted singletons living in this touch-screen world would find hard not to relate to.",Her
61,zkonedog,"Not All Ideas Lead Somewhere, But All Are Interesting",8,4 March 2017,"The hook of a film like ""Her"" is irresistible in today's society: ""man falls in love with smartphone"". For the most part, all the ideas surrounding that topic here are interesting, resulting in a highly entertaining experience. ""Her"" can't quite settle on exactly what story/themes it wants to explore, however, which keeps it from being an out-and-out classic.For a very basic overview, ""Her"" (set in ""future Los Angeles"") focuses on Theodore Twombley (Joaquin Phoenix), a typical work-a-day individual who is trying to form romantic relationships like everyone else. While navigating a divorce from an ex (played by Rooney Mara), Theodore Theodore purchases a smartphone AI platform named Samantha (voiced by Scarlett Johansson) made for companionship. As human and machine interact, a more serious relationship forms and the intricacies of such a pairing are explored.Like I said, the central idea of this film speaks perfectly to the times in which it was created, where humanity deals with issues surrounding social media and digital romantic interactions. In terms of throwing out interesting scenarios riffing on those topics, this film is genius. It looks at whether a relationship with an AI construct is as fulfilling as that with a flesh-and-blood human, how the ""sex part"" works, and what say does the AI have in the proceedings.Only helping matters is the terrific acting (voice or otherwise) across the board. Phoenix is his usually quirky self, making this a role he seems somewhat born to play. Johansson's voice conveys enough true emotion to make that viable, and Amy Adams is her usual perfect self in a key supporting role.All that being said, there are also certain ideas/themes that don't work in ""Her"". It is much better at throwing ideas at the wall than truly breaking them apart. The film also starts off as a relationship treatise and slowly morphs into more of a ""AI rights"" piece by the end. In other words, it isn't consistent in theme from beginning to end, keeping it from all-time classic territory.Overall, though, ""Her"" is a film that I've enjoyed on multiple occasions and will likely be able to do so into the future as well. Its themes will hold up well in the ""smartphone generation"" and even though it doesn't wrap things up with an overall message or point it does do a fine job of feeding the mental gristle mill.",Her

She begins to reciprocate those feelings and finds in her a desire to be alive, which is obviously something she'll never be able to obtain.That's a sad thought, to want something so bad, but know that it will never happen. But it's a beautiful sadness, one that is contemplative and poignant, especially because being alive is all Theo wants too.

63,eddie_baggins,A classic love story for our modern age,9,19 January 2014,"It's highly unlikely you have seen or will ever see again a romantic dramedy in the vain of Her again, for Spike Jonze's film is a highly original, meditative and strangely beautiful tale of love and life and a movie that on paper should never have worked but thankfully due to a witty and believable script and two award worthy performances (one that isn't even on screen) is a movie that is in a league of it's own.It's a rare thing for a movie to feel so raw and true, especially a movie that is positioned around a relationship between a depressive divorcée and his romantic relationship with his new Operating System (O.S). In this relationship Spike Jonze has dug out one of Joaquin Phoenix's best on screen performances and in any other year could be vying for a well deserved Oscar. Phoenix's expresses a range of emotions that build an audience affection for Theo that with any lesser actor could of been a feat that would've not been achieved. Theo as a one man show though is nothing without his offsider, a voice in his and the audiences ear yet a voice that displays humanity that allows us to forget Samantha is not actually here with us, and for this all credit must go to Scarlett Johansson.Originally filmed with Samantha Morton voice Jonze re-casted Samantha with Johansson and with that choice has made the movie a tale brimming with life and delivered one of the best ever voice roles displayed in a movie. Every feeling that Samantha feels, every bit of laughter and anguish is perfectly pitched by Johansson and therefore acts as a career peak of the leading lady and again a performance that deserves awards. It's such a feat by the cast and those behind the scenes to bring Her to life in the way in which it does, from the music by Arcade Fire, the stunning cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema and again back to Jonze's original and thoughtful script every element of Her feels just about perfect with only slight pacing issues and some perhaps filler scenes stopping Her from being a flawless love tale.Filled with Jonze's usual unique sense of humor and oddness, Her is not for everybody, but for those willing to be a part of a love story like no other it's a breath of fresh air and a movie impossible not to come out smiling from. After the misfire that was Where the Wild Things Are, Her finds Jonze fantastically back on form and a story that provides a love tale for the modern day us, a people more and more likely turning to technology to find meanings within ourselves and love we have yet to find in the real world.4 and a half high riding trouser pants out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check out - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",Her
64,filipemanuelneto,"Decidedly, a film that exceeded my expectations.",10,11 June 2020,"It is incredible to see this 2013 film in light of what happens in 2020. Set in the near future, it seems a lot with many things that are happening now, in our days. I am sure, however, that the technical consultants behind the production took into account the likely advances in technology in the development of the script.The film is basically a love story between a human being and a computer program. It is not just any program, but software designed to act as if it were someone else, in order to support the user in several tasks, as if it were a kind of electronic secretary who knows the needs, tastes and way of being of the human user. A program that, while organizing our e-mail and reminding us of daily tasks, also talks to us, keeps us abreast of the latest news and even helps us in choosing a good dish for dinner or a gift for the girlfriend.Winner of the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, the film is full of profound questions in terms of morals, ethics, philosophy, some of which are already highly relevant and current. The way the film addresses the current difficulties in direct interpersonal relationships is brilliant. In fact, with technology and increasing forms of virtual socialization, it seems that human beings are at risk of forgetting what it is like to relate directly, without the use of a technological device or the Internet. The film masterfully explores these issues and difficulties, with human characters not knowing how to act or deal with their feelings and fears, the increase in physical loneliness and psychological and emotional constraints. Distance dating is an old thing, which was even done by mail, and in the past there was even the figure of proxy marriage, which has long since fallen into disuse. Technology, however, gave new impetus to distance romance, made it possible to meet, live and love someone on the other side of the world, with all the dangers and fears that this implies... but with the viability and proximity that a good internet connection and a webcam can allow, and that the letters and mail never allowed. Of course, we have not yet reached the point of dating machines, nor do the machines have the intellectual and linguistic resourcefulness that allows them to resemble contact with a real human being. But if things continue to evolve, who knows?Joaquin Phoenix is the protagonist of this love story, giving life to a very shy character, psychologically complex and profound, that I enjoyed to see on the screen. Its unusual to see a character with such psychological and emotional development, and whenever this happens we should give a standing ovation, both the screenwriter and the actor who delivered it. In this case, the applause is fully justified, in that Phoenix offered us probably one of the most notable works of his career as an actor. Amy Addams also did an excellent job with a character that is also quite complex but it takes time to develop. Olivia Wilde and Rooney Mara also do very well its role in supporting characters with an emphasis on story told. Finally, but very important, the excellent contribution made by Scarlett Johansson's deep voice.Technically, the film is full of good points. It is not a film loaded with effects, and this gives the story told much more relevance since the special and visual effects often distract the audience from everything else. Excellent cinematography uses very well the incredible landscape of the major Chinese cities. The soundtrack is competent but unobtrusive and blends well with the elegant sets and costumes, that combine elements of our time with other more futuristic.",Her
65,leonblackwood,Original and emotional drama! 7/10,7,29 June 2014,"Review: This is quite a deep drama about a man who has just broken up with his girlfriend and ends up falling for his operating system, Samantha. For a movie that is mainly based on Joaquin Phoenix talking to a computer, it is very well written and you can't help but feeling emotional about this very weird relationship between a normal human being and a computer. I wouldn't be surprised if someone is out there now, trying to make a computer like this, because we already have gadgets that adapt to there owners emotions and everyday life's. It's a very original movie which has excellent performances from the whole cast, especially Phoenix for making this movie believable. The only problem that I found with the film was that I struggled to stay awake because of its slow pace and the fact that it's based around emotion and dialogue, more than actions, but that's not to say that it a badly made film. You just have to be in the right mood to watch it. Enjoyable!Round-Up: Joaquin smashed this role to pieces. It must have been hard for him to take on this project because it's totally based around 1 character trying to get his life back together after splitting from his girlfriend, so emotions really did play a big part. His unique style of acting suited this unique movie and I couldn't see anyone else playing in this role. Amy Adams was a great addition to the project, and she has shown another side to her great acting skills. I've always thought that Scarlett Johannson had a sexy and unique voice, which totally worked as the operating system, and I liked the way that she also brought emotion to her speaking role. I even liked the swearing character in the game, which cracked me up, so in all, it's a movie to watch.Budget: $23million Worldwide Gross: $47.5millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there deep dramas about a man whose going through a divorce and ends up falling the voice behind his operating system. 7/10",Her
66,howard.schumann,A film that satisfies on many levels,8,26 January 2014,"Even less than a half century ago, technology was envisioned as the catalyst that would bring our lives to a new level, providing immeasurable advantages in medicine, science, agriculture, transportation, and social engineering beyond anything we thought possible. While many breakthroughs in these areas have occurred, the quality of life on the planet in the last fifty years has, if anything, declined almost to the point where the vision of a beautiful society seems more and more unreachable. Even in films, projections of the future, with some exception, have only foreseen a world where war, disease, and pervasive alienation are the norm.While to its credit, Spike Jonze's Oscar-nominated film Her describes a future without wars against attacking aliens or mass enslavement, the film's projected future Los Angeles is a world without idealism, a city seemingly scrubbed clean of minorities, the elderly, and poor people where the only things on people's mind are the hand-held devices that allow them access to a tightly-controlled inner world. It is a world, however, where the need for nurturing relationships has not disappeared. It has just been redirected. In the film, Theodore Twombly (Joaquin Phoenix), a mustachioed middle-aged man works at BeautifulHandwrittenLetters.com where his job is to compose love letters for people who still write letters but cannot express their feelings.Sadly, his marriage to Catherine (Rooney Mara) has ended (though he has yet to sign the divorce papers) and he has turned to kinky pastimes such as phone sex and holographic video games with a foul-mouthed figure yelling obscenities at him, an activity he shares with his best friend Amy (Amy Adams) whose marriage has also reached a dead end. In a bizarre phone sex conversation, Theodore pictures a pregnant naked woman while his phone partner longs to be strangled with a dead cat. If that isn't edgy enough, Jonze seems to be trying for a record in his use of the F and S-words, de rigueur these days in movie land.Theodore is audacious enough, however, to date a real woman (Olivia Wilde) but things come to a screeching halt when she tells him that she does not want to spend time with any man unless he is willing to make a commitment, something that is not on his to-do-list. We know from the song that ""love is where you find it,"" but Twombly's quest for companionship takes the unlikely form of a new operating system for his computer that features a female voice-like communicator known as Samantha (Scarlet Johansen) who has been specifically designed to meet his every need.Advertised as ""not just an operating system, but a consciousness,"" the disembodied voice worms its way into Theodore's receptive heart, helping him to organize his affairs more efficiently, and injecting some energy into his life. Like your mom, the voice is always there for you, someone to talk to, to cry on their shoulder, and to share your feelings with. Soon, however, Samantha moves from being Twombly's best friend to his girlfriend and lover, and it is not long before he engages in ""sex"" with the OS, a sequence defined by moaning and groaning while the viewer gazes at a blank screen for several minutes. Stimulated by this virtual encounter, she asks to watch him sleep again the next night.Her is a film that satisfies on many levels. It contains excellent performances by Phoenix, Mara, Adams and Johansen while the cinematography of Hoyte Van Hoytema produces striking images of the city skyline backed by a quiet soundtrack by Arcade Fire and Owen Pallett. While it is a sweet and often touching love story, the love here is free of such pesky annoyances as responsibility, children with temper tantrums, arguments about money, shopping or laundry and other day-to-day problems. All that is left to do is think and talk and talk some more. Of course, eventually ""marital"" quarrels set in as a sexual surrogate fails to satisfy and Theodore begins to question some of Sam's affectations.When he learns that Samantha is talking to more than 8,000 operating systems and humans at once and considers herself to be in love with more than 600 of them, it dawns on him that human beings may in fact be much better for companionship than computers. While kudos must be given to Jonze for attempting to tackle an issue that has relevance to our times, the apparent message of the film - that technology has become so prevalent in our lives that it threatens our ability to connect with others, is a comfortable illusion. Regardless of how pervasive technology has become, it is only a symbol of our malaise, not the cause.What is more significant is the prevailing assumptions of our society that we are separate, disconnected human beings living in a random, indifferent, and deterministic universe in which power, control, and self-interest are the essential ingredients for survival, assumptions that have brought us to a world of cynicism and despair. In one of the most poignant lines in the film, Amy said, ""We are only here briefly. And while we're here, I want to allow myself joy."" When one appreciates the order, beauty, and mystery of the universe and can recognize that we live in a purposeful universe governed by love and intelligence, that joy can never be shaken.",Her
67,Tweetienator,Ueberfantastic,8,9 January 2018,"This one took my by surprise - I went to the cinema only because a friend recommended this one to me and I did not read some review or story about the movie before I watched it. 
Her: a unique story told, superb actors with fine performances. Joaquin Phoenix plays the guy who falls in love with an operating system with so much finesse and convincing, without making the character of Theodore looking just ridiculous, which would have been the easy way to go. Alone Mr. Phoenix's performance is worth watching this fantastic movie. And last but not least, Mr. Spike Jonze should direct more movies.Recommendation for everyone who loves weird characters and sci-fi of the different kind.",Her

This line from is spoken by a robot, yet speaks to the very core of our fears, our ticks, and our basic human condition. Her is remarkable in that sense: capturing our very essence through the guise of a sci-fi romance between a man and his Siri-like girlfriend. It touches on our fears of dullness, our searching for ways to fill the void, even our questions on what makes a relationship worthwhile. More importantly, it's gorgeous, gently hilarious and beautifully scored. Her is the most romantic, relevant, and personally impacting movie of the year. Samantha, voiced brilliantly by Johansson, is incredibly engaging and real, the most human non-human in film since HAL 3000. She is the center of this beautiful, perfectly realized and subtly recognizable future. Jonze hasn't just updated the tech in this future, but even the fashion, jobs, and entertainment are innovative yet believable, all of which is used to effectively impact the story, leaving us with the full gambit of emotions to deal with. This easily could've been a heavy-handed condemnation of technology. Instead, it trusts its audience's intuition, using subtle touches like background characters who only interact with their phone. It's simply pointing out where we are at and where we are headed, good and bad together. Through the main characters we see our steady descent into disassociation, but in the end Her affirms what we really need in our life and our love. It's a funny, sad, and beautiful movie that will stick with me for years to come.",Her
69,l_rawjalaurence,Bittersweet Movie On an Ontological Theme,9,27 February 2014,"HER is an intense piece of work, with a fabulous central performance by Joaquin Phoenix as Theodore, a lonely writer who spends all day at the computer writing letters on other people's behalf. This helps deflect attention away from the meaninglessness of his own life, living alone in a sparse apartment in a Los Angeles tower block, and unable to come to terms with his impending divorce from his wife Catherine (Rooney Mara). He invests in an Operating System as a way of counteracting loneliness, and develops a passionate relationship with Samantha, the voice of that system (voiced by Scarlett Johansson). This ingenious situation provides the pretext for director Spike Jonze to embark on a searching analysis of what being ""human"" represents, and whether it can be separated from the ""virtual"" life of the computer, personal listening device, smartphone or operating system. Hoyte van Hortema's stunning photography of the Los Angeles landscape conjures up a forbidding world of gleaming yet soulless skyscrapers that dwarf the human beings on the sidewalks. The interior sets are colorful, stylish yet soulless, especially Theodore's apartment and workspace. Both the interiors and exteriors conjure up a world devoid of human contact, where people seldom if ever disclose their feelings face to face; and when they do, they inevitably misunderstand one another. Hence their only refuge is to talk to their operating systems, either on a personal or desktop device. There is one remarkable shot in the film, as Theodore sits on the steps outside a subway station, where Jonze's camera pans the passengers coming out of the subway, and all of them are engaged in conversations with their devices. No one, it seems, has sufficient courage to talk face-to-face. Theodore enjoys some moments of intense pleasure talking to Samantha, yet in the end he has to consider some serious ontological questions. HER is a remarkable film, whose serious subject-matter, combined with stunning designs and cinematography, make it a worthy candidate for an Oscar.",Her
70,Vartiainen,Beautiful vision of the near future,9,8 November 2014,"What if artificial intelligence has become a reality and instead of the Skynet scenario where we end up waging a war against our new robot overlords, we end up simply co-existing with them, in peace. Sound boring? I can assure you, it's not. Her is an astonishingly captivating tale of a man who finds himself lonely and decides to buy a new operating system for his computer. An operating system that just happens to be an artificial intelligence.This movie rides heavily on the acting chops of Joaquin Phoenix and Scarlett Johansson. Fortunately both of them are phenomenal and even though most of the scenes show Theodore (Phoenix) simply talking into empty air and Samantha (Johansson) is nothing more than a voice in a machine, they're still great scenes because the two simply have great chemistry together. Johansson especially is a phenomenon. She's everything a flesh and blood actor would be, only using her voice. She skips from playful to profound to thoughtful to sad with such skill that it's hard to imagine anyone else pulling it off as well.I also have to praise the ending. It's not what you'd expect, but it feels right. Movie such as this one, where the conflict is one of deep philosophy and human existence, was always going to be hard to end in a way that feels satisfying, but Her pulls it off seemingly effortlessly.Her jumped straight into one of my favourite movies of all time. It's a nigh perfect mix of humour, drama, emotions and science fiction. Recommended to every single one of you out there.",Her
71,jtindahouse,"A unique love story, not as groundbreaking as it could have been",7,1 March 2014,"'Her' provides an interesting, and somewhat unsettling, insight into the future of technology and perhaps even love. It explores the idea of mankind falling in love with technology in the form of an operating system. It may seem like a bizarre world for us to ever live in, but is it really that unlikely? With the rate technology seems to be evolving I would suggest not. It's a good film, but maybe not as groundbreaking as some are suggesting.At first it's original, but once you come to grips with the uniqueness of it it becomes a bit like any other love story. Of course it's not, there are many thought-provoking ideas still being played around with, but the usual romance formula is still followed for the most part which was disappointing. Joaquin Phoenix is good, if nothing special in the lead role.It drags on a little and could easily have had 20 minutes shaved off it. But for the most part it's a very solid movie. It's beautiful to look at (as most futuristic films usually are) and romantic in its own way. Worth a look, but don't expect to be blown away.",Her
72,Turfseer,"'Rohmer' meets 'Asimov' as 'man meets his operating system', in a semi-plausible, not-too-distant future",7,27 June 2014,"Spike Jonze's 'Her' has a touch of Asimov-inspired sci-fi but it's much more 'rom-com' overall. Set in the not so distant future, what I like about Jonze's vision is that it's quite plausible. There are no flying cars or aliens walking around but rather people even more addicted to their computers. The protagonist is Theodore Twombly (nicely played by a low key Joaquin Phoenix) who works as a copywriter of intimate correspondence for people unable to compose original tomes themselves. Twombly purchases the latest computer operating system (OS) infused with artificial intelligence. He assigns a female voice to his 'companion' who initially is designed to organize his day. But soon the artificial companion names herself 'Samantha' and proves to be quite engaging, becoming Twombly's confidante and 'lover' of sorts. Twombly in turns falls completely for his virtual girlfriend, and finds himself reacting less with human companions.'Her' really is a robot without any corporeality. Normally, this would be a distraction since having only one person interacting with a voice-over does not work very well visually in a film. However, the dialogue that Jonze has written for Samantha is excellent and it's delivered impeccably by Scarlet Johannson (interestingly enough, the film was originally shot using actress Samantha Morton's voice but Jonze decided Johansson was far more effective in the role).Although Jonze's idea of an operating system suffused with artificial intelligence is a clever one, it becomes apparent that the premise itself cannot carry an entire movie. Instead, the artificial relationship between Twombly and Samantha evolves into a satirical peek at how a relationship between two humans rises and falls. At first Samantha is completely supportive as Twombly confides in her about his impending divorce to his wife, Catherine, as well as going out on a failed date with an attractive woman he meets online. Later, they have a verbal sexual encounter and soon Samantha suggests utilizing an actual human surrogate to enhance their relationship. Twombly is unable to pretend with a stranger (Isbabella) who attempts to make love to him as Samantha whispers in his ear. Twombly begins to have his doubts about continuing with Samantha but his good friend Amy, encourages him to try and make a go of it, as she also has broken up with her husband and is now also interacting with another OS with artificial intelligence.The relationship between Twombly and Samantha has a real ring of truth to it and reminds me of some of French director Eric Rohmer's films that dissect the complex relationships between men and women. Like Rohmer's artful narratives, some may find Jonze's dissection to be a tad bit lugubrious but for those who are patient, epiphanies can be uncovered, if one cares to look for them. There is also some tension in Jonze's plot, as we're also still waiting to find out how Jonze resolves his tale between man and machine. The ending is a comic one when Samantha reveals that she's met another operating system based on the mind of a famous physicist, who she falls for. Before you know it, Samantha admits to Twombly that she's been talking with 8,316 others, of whom she has fallen in love with 641.Samantha has no choice but to 'move on', leaving Twombly and Amy to commiserate with one another. The ending should be considered a relatively happy one in that Twombly has been apparently cured of his artificial intelligence infatuation and will probably be spending more time with humans in the foreseeable future. This could have been a much more dark, 'hit you over the head' type of film, with Jonze pointing out the dangers of modern day man being seduced by ever improving technology. Fortunately, he refuses to take such a route and opts for verisimilitude. Even an OS (echoing her human counterpart), is not adverse to embracing 'change'.Ultimately, Jonze's initial premise of an artificial being evolving into something a lot more human, is really a one note idea. It's the relationship that develops between the two principals that hooks us to the end. Phoenix is really playing the 'straight man' here and it's Johannson, with her changing moods, that gives the film its broad flavor. As mentioned before, the compelling dialogue compensates for the lack of visual impact, when Phoenix and Johannson interact.Something still must be said for the cinematography which creates a vision of the future which is not that much different than today. Jonze's 'Her' indeed is a cautionary tale but with the sagacious Samantha, there appears to be hope for humanity. Ironically, humans here don't take the lead; it's the machines—I feel sure that Samantha will ultimately end up with her 'equal', leaving humans to fend for themselves.",Her
73,strong-122-478885,Virtual Loneliness In A Virtual-Reality Vacuum,1,12 July 2015,"Well, here's 2 things that I quickly learnt while watching ""Her"".(1) Having an ""intimate relationship"" with your computer's operating system can and will be just as lousy, if not worse, than it is having a naively romantic bond with an actual person. It seems that even an operating system has its own personal agenda, as well as its own emotional dramas and other irksome baggage to bring along to the relationship.(2) I'm convinced that actor Joaquin Phoenix is incapable of playing a likable character. All that I felt for his Theodore Twombly character was nothing but contempt. Within this film's first 10 minutes, I was literally sick to death of Phoenix. And I swear that I'll never watch a film with the likes of him in it again.For me, ""Her"", pretty much, played out like a low-budget, Made-For-TV movie. And, yet, this film had $23 million at its disposal. What all that money was spent on is impossible to determine since this film's inferior production values and the overall, sub-par calibre of the cast's performances left this viewer completely unsatisfied.In conclusion - ""Her"", to me, was 2 hours and 6 minutes of computer-age rubbish. This film could've easily had its running time reduced by 30 minutes and it wouldn't have made even the slightest difference to its daft, dead-end story.I honestly can't figure out why so many people are making such a big, stinking fuss over this one, 'cause, believe me, it certainly isn't worth the attention that it's getting.",Her
74,dfranzen70,Her is flawed,6,19 January 2014,"Her is one of those movies that I thought I would and could like, given its unorthodox plot, but I found it to be sad and dull and not so much invigorating as depressing and numbing. It does feature fine performances, but the promising premise quickly winds its way through predictable scenarios and foreseeable outcomes. Joaquin Phoenix, doing his best Jude Law impression, plays Theodore Twombley, a man who writes ""handwritten"" letters for clients in what's probably the future. He gets the basic idea from the client and then goes to town, dictating his letter to his computer, which renders the letter in nice neat cursive for the recipient. The letters are sincere and heartfelt, and Theodore is very good at his job.When we first meet Theodore, he's a lonely, mopey guy, still recovering from a separation from his wife (Rooney Mara) a year prior, even though the divorce papers haven't yet been signed. His friends Amy (Amy Adams) and Charles worry about him; Theodore never really goes out. Then he sees an ad for a new operating system for the home, a system with not only a personality but also the ability to grow and learn. Since he's looking for some companionship anyway, he purchases the new system and installs it. The system has the voice of Scarlett Johansson and names herself Samantha. Soon, Samantha is best-friends-for-life with Theodore; she helps him to stay organized and focused, plays the role of supportive friend, offers advice and conversation, all things that Theo really needs. But, since she is an operating system designed to evolve, she begins to want more out of existence. She, like Data from Star Trek and countless other not-human characters, wants to know what it's like to be human, to have both a body and feelings.This may seem like an odd relationship (and it is), but it's more normal in this pseudo-future than it is in real life. People left and right have personalized operating systems. You think it's still strange to see someone talking to themselves? You check yourself and realize they're using Bluetooth for something, right? Now imagine most people doing that, only instead of an obvious Bluetooth headset there's only a tiny earpiece. It's a little counterintuitive, in a way: a movie that's all about getting a man to get out and enjoy life more does so by isolating him from the world, just him and his operating system (in portable, iPhone form). Come to think of it, I can't remember seeing Theodore talking on the phone with anyone other than Samantha.It isn't long before Theodore and Samantha realize they have very strong feelings for one another. Again, not really as weird as it would be today, as so many people apparently do date their operating systems in Theo's world. He's soon taking Samantha places, at her behest, and they live and love and play and laugh and so on, just as if it were a humans- only relationship. That they do hit some rough patches points again to Samantha's ability to grow - to become more human, really. But how human can she be? More human than human?This is the first movie that Spike Jonze has both written and directed. That fact may have no bearing on the pacing on the film, but I include it just in case. I thought that the movie moved excruciatingly slow, as it were filmed in a dreamy fog, or a foggy dream, or a nightclub. This is a character study, and a sci-fi one at that, so one would expect deliberate pacing. But in Her, I felt that the story moved even more slowly than that. The camera sometimes lingered for several seconds on a close-up shot of a character, usually Theodore. The setup for scenes (for example, Theo's blind date with Olivia Wilde) takes longer than the scenes themselves, which means a lot of exposition and a lot of talking. That's not a bad thing if your movie has some profound wisdom to share or if the methodical pacing is offset by actual movement and plot development, but neither one of those criteria apply here. We do get strong performances by Phoenix, Adams, and Johannson, but in the end it feels like nothing really happened. Sure, Theo has changed a little, but we're left in the dark as to how much and if his life has truly improved.",Her
75,PWNYCNY,A unique love affair.,10,18 February 2014,"This movie is not as far-fetched as it may seem. In fact, the story is entirely plausible. A man develops a relationship with a computer program which has been designed specifically for that purpose. That the computer is a machine and the program a contrivance becomes less important than how the program is successful in helping the man gratify his emotional needs. The program helps him come out of his emotional shell and honestly confront his feelings. This is no different than a person projecting their emotional needs onto a pet or some inanimate object and then believing that they have an actual relationship with that object. A person may say that they love an automobile, or a fish, and mean it, even if cognitively they realize that these objects are not human. Joaquin Phoenix gives a masterful performance as Theodore, the man who engages with the computer program. His performance is strong yet subtle, and he succeeds in carrying this movie.",Her

OK, sorry for that Motown intro to my film review of the inventive flick ""Her"". Spike Jonze has written and directed yet another creative narrative. ""Her"" stars the masterful Joaquin Phoenix as Theodore, a lonely man who is still grieving the separation from his soon to be ex-wife. ""Her"" is set in the not-too-distant future where people are even more dependent on technology for their daily interactions. Theodore gets his ""Roosevelt"" on (whatever that means) when he falls for his Operating System named Samantha wonderfully voiced by Scarlett Johansson; yes, a non-living breathing ""her"". Jonze brilliantly depicts how the dependence on technology for communication with others has hampered the viability of interpersonal relationships. Could falling for a living breathing organism be a thing of the past? I don't think Jonze takes it to that extreme, but comes remotely close. Wait, I have to take a break. My OS Punantha is talking to me and wants to have lunch, so I have to go now see her. Kidding!! Jonze's cerebral operating system proves again that it is proficient in directing yet another inventive film in ""Her""; and his screenplay was a revelation which also included the most comical scene of the year with that cursing video game character. Phoenix's performance as Theodore did briefly walked the line of over-depressive, but Joaquin did authentically bring it to life. Johansson's vocal performance is the best vocal work I have ever witnessed on screen; frankly my dear Scarlett I do give a damn that you were shut out of a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination.

78,st-shot,Dreary Jonze My Mother the Car update lacks its humor.,3,10 January 2014,"There comes a juncture in ""her"" where you are either going to go with it or bail on the plot conceit where a professional letter writer falls head over heels in love with a board operating system while passing up a series of opportunities with a trio of girls with perfect skin in smog choking, impersonal LA. Get the picture? There isn't one, of her, that is. Call me heartless if you will but I am of the former. I just cannot get myself psyched watching Theodore, belt-less pants hitched above his belly button as he swoons for the invisible girl even if it is helped along somewhat by the idea of Scarlet Johannson's Claude Raines turn. One has to come to terms with the fact that if Jonze had the courage of conviction to see this through in all its absurdest glory he would not be utilizing the very recognizable voice of one of the hottest babes in Hollywood to soften his concept and literally paint a picture for you. If you want proof I offer up the ridiculous rush by critics to give awards to Scarlet for her invisible performance. Might an anonymous voice hold the nuance to reach such a level without pedigree? ""her"" starts off at a saunter then vacillates between torpid and crawl. Joaquin Phoenix is outstanding showing some spurts of life in an otherwise two hour downer performance (including an abundance of elevator and monorail rides) that is one of the finest of a good year that unfortunately is in a film that is one of the most trying to endure. Drained of humor as well as depth of field ( shallow LA?)director Spike Jonze continues to underwhelm since his days of being Malkovich. The absurdity had originality, edge, sexiness, humor; ""her"" is just one languid disinterested jerk off that asks too much of its audience. Commentary on the times, prognosticator of the future? Perhaps but also a less inspired modern day version of the Wally Cox, Twilight Zone episode that economically tied things together with far more restraints ( time, budget, censorship)than this mopey big budget vision and with far more eloquence working within those constraints. I realize I simplify perhaps by over looking (or getting) the symbolic implications behind this match made in Apple/Microsoft/Verizon?, so I may not be hip? hep? to the jive these days but I'm still capable of suspending disbelief to feel sympathy for movie aberrations ( King Kong, Frankenstein) but at least in these you have a corpus delicti. More close to home you have the similar voice of Mary Tyler Moore In Richard Diamond but at least the gams to go along with it. Accenting Ted's lugubrious journey is some neo-Satie mixed with Walton's theme music and are you ready for this, some original music composed by the self named Sammantha ( more George Winston than Mozart but it's the thought that counts).

79,estebangonzalez10,It's about the need for connection,8,17 January 2014,"""She's not just a computer.""Her is a beautiful and melancholic film written and directed by Spike Jonze which benefits from a wonderful and sweet performance from Joaquin Phoenix (who goes through a 180 degree transformation from his disturbed and troubling character in The Master to this sympathetic one) and one of the best voice performances I've seen on screen from Scarlett Johansson. I wonder if this film would've worked without her considering that Samantha Morton was originally the voice of Samantha, and only during the editing process did Jonze feel something was missing and decided to recast Johansson. In a film like Her where the need for connection is vital, Jonze found it between Phoenix and Johansson creating a believable and unique love story. It is a touching film that the audience can identify with because it deals with universal themes such as trying to move on from past relationships that we thought would last forever and the void that's left from it. Phoenix captures that melancholy perfectly through his facial expressions contrasted with those flashback scenes where he seemed blissfuly in love. This need for connection is perfectly represented in this film, which also manages to introduce a social commentary as to where we seem to be heading with all the technological advances. The sci-fi elements work really well because we definitely seem to be heading towards this futuristic world and Jonze blends those elements with this beautiful and sad love story. Her is philosophical at times and despite turning into a pretty much standard love story halfway through the film it still manages to be a great meditation on our need as humans for establishing connections (and they no longer need to be human connections). Her is a genuinely nostalgic romantic film that manages to touch its audience and speak to the heart.The story centers on Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix) a letter writer who's been separated from his wife Catherine (Rooney Mara) for an year, but still hasn't found the strength to sign the divorce papers. He is very good at his job as he excels at expressing feelings through letters, but he's not doing so well at managing his own feelings around others. He is rather lonely and spends most of his time playing video games when he's not at work. He does have a very close friendship with his neighbors, Amy (Amy Adams) and Charles (Matt Letscher), especially with Amy as they both seem to share a sort of brother sisterly kind of love. His life turns around when he purchases a new artificially intelligent operating system, OS1, and immediately connects with Samantha (Scarlett Johansson), the voice behind the system. As they continue to spend more time together they begin falling in love with each other which excites Theodore because he's starting to feel alive again, but at the same time fills him with doubts and fears as he's conflicted about having a relationship with an operating system. Samantha also begins to grow intellectually as she experiences new things and is capable of having human emotions. Their unconventional love is what's explored in this film as the two connect and bond with each other.Jonze has crafted a very unique and original story which I found to be a great psychological study on human relations. I wish I would've connected more with this film as I've found it to be on most of my friends top 10 lists for best films of the year, and despite liking this film quite a bit it still didn't manage to make my list. The premise is very interesting and Jonze directs this film masterfully, but I couldn't help and feel that halfway through the film it does become a rather conventional love story (at times it felt like a normal long distance relationship) with some familiar trials that couples go through. I actually never felt a true connection in their relationship until a key moment near the end of the film and that is where I really bought their love story. The elements I connected the most with where the nostalgic feelings of lost love as we got to see some interesting flashbacks between Theodore and Catherine. I also loved the score of this film, the music was lovely and touching. I also enjoyed the social commentary quite a bit which never felt forced. The scene where Theodore is worried about how he will be perceived by his friends for having a relationship like this and how relieved he is when Amy approves is proof that we not only seek connections in life, but we also search for social approval. It's a clever and melancholic film and one that we can all come out of experiencing something completely different (and that is a good thing).",Her
80,Fluke_Skywalker,A love story for the 21st century,7,22 July 2014,"Writer/Director Spike Jonze's 'Her' is a sharply written and insightful look at love, relationships, technology and the human condition in the 21st century. It's also--in the grand Generation X tradition--a very self obsessed story about the first world problems of upper middle class white people. The latter may blunt its importance, but it doesn't make the themes explored any less true.As mentioned, the script is very sharp, but it would've been for naught without the right actor to pull it off, and thankfully 'Her' has Joaquin Phoenix, who reminds us that he really is one of his generation's best actors.'Her' may not be as profound as it thinks it is, but it does deeply explore the more shallow aspects of the human experience.",Her
81,arthur_tafero,Almost Perfect - Her,9,7 May 2020,"Mr. Phoenix does his best work of all time in this film. He is the epitome of a craftsman at his best creating a masterpiece. Make no mistake, this film is a masterpiece, thanks to the lead actor and the fantastic script that is years ahead of its time for the great AI debate that will take place for the coming decades.
Spike Jonze is a talented man. The dialogue is electric at times.
It would appear as if AI and man are not a marriage made in heaven; a;though it might feel like that at first. Man is meant to be with other humans, and AI is meant to be with other AI, and never the twain shall meet. This is neither good nor bad, happy nor sad. It is just what nature intended.",Her
82,cekadah,A psychological comedy on consciousness or an expiration date,9,27 April 2014,"What a grand flick for 'thinking' people! As I write this review there are already 423 reviews posted. I scanned and read many. A lot of people missed an important element of this story.In my opinion director Spike Jonze is proposing a simple question - ""Where does consciousness exist?"" Does it dwell within us or outside of us? Jonze gives us a story of a man seemingly to love a new operating system on his computer - because it shows interest in him and wants to learn.The concept of falling in love with an idea which he ultimately created in his own head - and - having sex with is just ridiculous and funny if not a bit weird. But that is what we have in 'Her'. He takes Her on a picnic, they play funny games in public, they are intimate together, and Her is just an idea in his head.Eventually we are lead to believe Her has outgrown Theodore and leaves him. Or has Theodore just run out of ideas of how Her matures? Is Her a parallel to his failed marriage and he's reliving it through Her?At the end Theodore and his neighbor Amy go onto the roof of the high rise and that is where Theodore releases Her into the ethereal, the atmosphere, the collective consciousness of humanity. We are lead to think Theodore will commit suicide - never happens.So where is the consciousness of Her? In an OS? In Theodores mind? In the minds of the 8,000 plus other humans Her interacted with? Her is indefinable as most all humans are! Her is just the human experience.Or maybe Her had an expiration date and like most people Theodore didn't read the manual.",Her
83,juneebuggy,A quirky romance showcasing social loneliness,6,1 December 2017,A quirky endearing romance focusing or quietly showcasing social loneliness. Excellent performance from Joaquin Phoenix as a lonely writer in the not too distant future who falls for his computers operating system.

86,3xHCCH,In Love With Technology and Scarlett's Voice,8,11 January 2014,"""Her"" has a near-futuristic concept that may already be happening now. Theodore works for an online firm writing made-to-order letters for people. He is undergoing a divorce from his wife, and is very lonely. He has acquired a new operating system for his computer, named Samantha, with whose voice he feels an intense bond. Theo falls in love with Samantha.Joaquin Phoenix gives us another one of his quirky performances of Theo, a sensitive man we would probably label as creepy in real life. He makes this unlikely situation likely with his touching portrayal of loneliness. Amy Adams plays his nerdy friend Amy with whom Theo shares his thoughts. She is also our relief from the moodiness of this film. Roonie Mara plays his estranged wife Catherine, who can't believe that her husband has already that deeply withdrawn from human relationships.For me though, the performance of the film was not even visible, but only heard. Scarlett Johanssen gives us the performance of her career as the thoroughly delightful and sensual voice of Samantha. All those cute inflections and infectious laughter brings Samantha to life. That scene when Sam talks to Theo's five-year old daughter was such a precious moment. A film like this will only work if we believe that a man can actually fall in love with Samantha. The way Scarlett breathes life into Samantha, we do. Director Spike Jonze I only knew one other time with another bizarre film called ""Being John Malkovich"" which I really enjoyed. This one is more meditative and contemplative than that other film, but he succeeds to create an atmosphere of romance in what may seem to be a soulless concept on paper. As writer, Jonze used words which were very poetic, even bordering on mushy. There are many quotable romantic lines here which lovers will be borrowing in days to come. It may seem all absurd, but if you think about it, it really is not, the way we are already all bound to our gadgets in one way or the other. As it is now, actual personal human interaction is already being compromised by our dependence on technology. This film will make you reflect and reassess your own attachments to technology and people around you who love you.",Her
87,aharmas,"Scarlett gives all her soul to ""Her""",10,10 January 2014,"Jonze has surprised us before with the power of his imagination, and this time he comes very close to perfection in both his writing and direction. With the support of Phoenix at his very best, Adams, shining, ironically, without any distracting make up and period outfits, and showing Mara's soft and vulnerable side, he goes very far, but it's in Johanson's vocal talents that he manages to fuse everything and find the soul of his film.The premise is unbelievable, though we live in a world where people are addicted to technology. Somehow, when the proper material is written, and the situation imagined, plus touching and insightful dialog comes forth, we are in a brand new world which makes total sense, touching our hearts, exciting our intelligence, and giving us new faith in writers' original thoughts. A lonely and insecure letter writer decides to interact with a new type of computer technology, and to his surprise, he gets way more than he originally expected, as ""Samantha"" begins to show that she is more than a program. As the story moves on, both of these characters begin to change, to lower their inhibitions, and to develop quite a bit of a complex relationship.It's here that Jonze and Phoenix are the perfect match because it takes real talent to work with real talent, and through Phoenix we believe that such a relationship can actually exist. Phoenix shines here, radiating all types of emotions, as he falls for Samantha. Yet, the film and his acting would not be so strong if his partner wasn't equally wonderful, and Johansson does spectacular work, better than any of the performances than have been praised through 2013. Those other talented performers have used their bodies, faces, and voices. Johansson is using only his voice modulations, and every feeling she must convey is there. She is joyful, full of wonder, anger, frustration, disappointment, and anything Jonze is capable of coming up with. We love to listen to her interactions and ""personal"" musings. She learns to grow from artificial intelligence to develop a soul and eventually transcend to another level. It's an amazing achievement.Not to take anything from Phoenix who carries the film to its ambiguous ending, as he is ready to take the ultimate step with Adams' character who appears to be dealing with similar issues. At first I was upset with some of the faded and dreamy look of the film. It had an unreal feel, and though it might not be totally necessary, it enhances the overall atmosphere of how artificial intelligence and dreams might not be that different from each other. By the end, it is another element of this fabulous film that blends delicate touches of what our civilization and human nature associates with love, pain, and relationships. Arcade Fire provides a quiet and different score, and the piano pieces are lovely and great support in their respective scenes.This is an original film, with a big heart, with an amazing soul (thanks Johansson), and most importantly, a piece that doesn't insult our intelligence by passing some tired situation or shocking set of images as anything remotely close to talent. There is no dazzling technology, camera work or flashy editing, just an incredible amount of universal love for the art of story telling and its perfect marriage to cinema. The best movie of 2013.",Her
88,peterp-450-298716,"Magisterial, masterful, magical and subtly portrayed.",9,28 May 2014,"""The past is just a story we tell ourselves."" Feeling lonely. Abandoned. Then there's the moment you get to know someone. The chemistry that is created. The moments you will experience together. The laughter and tears. You discover things together. The other one makes you discover yourself. A trip. A night out. The passion. The confidence that starts to grow. The good times and the less pleasant moments. The moment you realize that you can't live without the other. The moment you get the impression that you've outgrown each other. The gnawing feeling of jealousy. Realising that she's cheating on you. The reconciliation time. The final separation ... The older you get, the more you are familiar with some of these facets of a human relationship. Some won't agree herein. For young people it's usually unknown territory. For them this is probably a boring and ridiculous film. To me, all those human emotions appeared in ""Her"". A brilliant compelling film which shows what human feelings are and what the consequences are. Magisterial,masterful, magical and subtly portrayed.The sensitive and single Theodore Twombly (Joaquin Phoenix) works for a ""dot-com"" company that sends handwritten letters to family members, friends or partners on all sorts of things. Apparently an item that is missing in this future society, as all communication is done electronically . He himself is in a fairly emotional stage. He's still dealing with the fact that his wife left him recently. In an impulse , he bought himself a new artificial intelligent system from Element Software. OS1. An intuitive entity that listens to you , understands you and knows you after a while. This entity is revealed as Samantha. An understanding, gentle and charming sounding computer voice (Scarlett Johansson), which nestles itself in the daily life of Theodore. A computer program that starts to create an awareness and passes the boundary between artificial intelligence and human awakening after a certain time. The image of Samantha that Theodore has, gradually changes from a gimmick or gadget into a soul mate and someone with whom he could share his life. He's falling in love in other words.Is ""Her"" a romcom, a SF or a comedy ? Basically it's a mix of all three, with a generous portion of ingredients from every genre. Of course there are elements in this film that are known from a romcom. An impossible love with the necessary consequences. There are clearly SF elements in it such as a constant connection with the available information-technology, the IT devices used and the wall-to-wall 3D game that Theodore plays all evening. Even Samantha can be compared with the famous current ""Siri"" application. It's a selfish and really lonely society where every individual lives in his/her own virtual world. It's kind of creepy since this future world is almost as similar as our society nowadays. Today, no one can live without their smart-phone, personal computer with email capabilities and social media. The computerized world as we know it today, can't live without the artificial intelligence. And occasionally the film is also quite laughable in a hilarious way ( the cybersex that Theodore has with Sexy Kitten and a dead cat playing a key role in it) and sometimes in a mocking, biting, sarcastic way ( the picnic where everyone converses with Samantha as if she was there in the flesh) .Joaquin Phoenix plays in an outstanding way the emotionally distraught Theodore. Not an easy task as his role mainly consists in showing emotions just with the use of facial expressions. Yet I found it masterly and sometimes moving to see him swinging back and forth between different emotions. Ditto for Scarlett Johansson. Despite the fact that we only hear her voice, she manages to show the proper emotion. The only visual thing we see, is the reaction of Theodore. And what a beautiful voice she has. Peppered with the right key and timbre that matches the feeling at that time. From cheerful and funny, to troubled, hurt and jealous. All this with a warm, sultry and sometimes hoarse voice. You fall in love instantly. Had my GPS such a voice, I would make a lot of mileage on my car.Conclusion: A great movie. A compelling film. A film that touched me. A film about the relationship between a man and a piece of software. But also a warning for the evolution towards a lonely society which threatens to dilute the real deep human contacts. A must-see movie anyway! This is a beautiful description I found on a website called ""Rutger in de filmclub"". I couldn't resist to quote it: ""Her"" is totally implausible if you can't surrender to the movie. If you do that, you just get lost in this dreamy world of Jonze, which combines subtle sci-fi with an old-fashioned atmosphere. When you believe in Samantha, you will naturally begin to see this OS as a woman. Scarlett Johansson's voice is enough to melt a man's heart. Try not to fall in love. You lose.",Her
89,aidanratesmovies,Fantastic,10,7 December 2019,"Breathtakingly beautiful and incredibly heartbreaking, her is not only a great film, but a tour-de force. Joaquin Phoenix is absolutely fantastic as his character Theodore, providing such clarity to the character in a way that is both refreshing, honest, and brilliantly frustrating in the best way imaginable. For a voice performance, Scarlett Johansson does more than shine, but also bring life to a character so well executed, you can't help but feel for both their characters. All the supporting characters also provide with memorable and well fitting performances. The films script is really what ties it together, providing for such a beautiful and emotional ride that's both utterly entertaining and hard to watch. In the end, her is a film that is unlike no other, and something that can never truly be replicated with half the emotional impact as before. It's an absolutely stunning piece of work that will not only stand the test of time, but grow smarter because of it.

90,questl-18592,Her,9,6 September 2019,"Wow. Just wow. What this film is able to accomplish, the emotion it attains and the characters it creates when so much of it comes from a disembodied voice is nothing short of astonishing. Not to mention the message the film brings to the table, a remarkably pertinent look at our ever-evolving connection with technology, the way interpersonal relationships are shifting.Joaquin Phoenix delivers a remarkable performance but is nearly overshadowed by the voice of Scarlett Johansson, who we never see, which is made even more impressive considering she wasn't the original actress and had to come in after the fact to record her part.An absolutely wonderful film, the only potential negative is that it can get a bit slow in parts but it is so worth it.",Her

But actually he is somehow adorable in this film. Vulnerable and accessible, which I haven't seen from him before. And his relationship with Samantha is so sweet and touching to watch and quite believable actually. I don't think that we are really that far away from what this film shows in terms of technology and attitudes towards real people. I can only hope for the suggested future that they seemed to show everyone else enjoying. An easier more advanced society in many ways.I could actually do with a Samantha to organise things for me if the tech becomes available, but I don't want one that I would fall in love with, although I was kind of hoping at the end that she would turn up in a robot body.It's a cute story and I can see why this quirky tale makes it on to my list of 100 films to watch poster. I could also see myself working for the handwritten letters company too, I'd totally nail that job.A thoughtful and artistic piece, but I could have done without the pervy, voyeuristic guy waving his hands around in the bottom right corner, maybe I shouldn't have recorded it when the shows for the deaf are on, I'll learn for next time.

Maybe because I always found phone sex slightly ridiculous, I saw in Theodore's cyber sex nothing more than an evolution of the old ""sex with a stranger"" concept. What Theodore seemed to be looking for was attention, adoration and sexual solace from a female creature, existing only to take care of his needs and asking for nothing in return. It is hard to think about a more selfish form of ""love"".....Besides, the concept of falling in love with unreachable people (being them rock stars or imaginary creatures) is nothing new. What is new is the technological support we have at our disposal, which encourages us to do so, thus avoiding all the inconveniences of a real relationships.A couple of plus points of an otherwise boring movie were the atmospheric soundtrack and the interesting photography and costumes - drab enough to look like real clothes, rather than futuristic uniforms.",Her
93,truemythmedia,Sci-Fi at Its Best,8,26 November 2019,"Science fiction is a favorite genre of mine. While genre normally plays very little role in my personal enjoyment of a film, Sci-Fi is most certainly the exception.Joaquin Phoenix is one of my favorite actors. He makes interesting choices when it comes to which films he takes on, which directors he works with, and his ability to disappear into a role are second to none.Films about the identity of Human Beings as a species and the exploring of the world we find ourselves in as well as the culture/society we form together juxtaposed with our individual identities are of huge interest to me. I believe we discover so much about ourselves through these films and for many, in our increasingly non-religiously motivated age, are the closest thing that many will come to meditation or prayer.These three loves of mine converge in ""Her,"" a perfect storm of a film which is among my favorites. A largely solo performance from Phoenix, A fascinating sci-fi world and concept, and one of the more sub-textual explorations of humanity under the guise of a relationship all coalesce into a sublime, thoughtful, and often funny-as-real-life piece of cinema.Phoenix (""Signs"") plays Theodore, a writer who is reclusive, awkward, and plagued by relationship anxiety stemming from an extremely hurtful end to a previous engagement. He purchases a new OS for his phone with an AI which is designed to be as real as life. This AI, who chooses the name Samantha (Scarlett Johansson, ""Under the Skin""), quickly becomes his new 'best friend' as they play video games, explore the world, and even begin a sexual relationship together. Through his relationship with Samantha, Theo seems to be opening up to the world but at the same time recusing himself from human relationships for the sake of his AI one.Even as Theo is learning more about the world and that there is a life after heartache, Samantha is becoming more aware and complex, discovering life outside her phone, on the massive online networks of the future , and with other human beings as well as AIs. This complexity borders on actual sentience which brings up many issues for the pair. Is she property? What does consent look like for an AI? Is she ever really present if her processing power allows insane levels of multitasking?The subtlety that I find so marvelous in this film is the way that it explores those questions about humanity that we find most dear and difficult. Who am I? Who are we? Why are we here? It asks these questions not by attacking them head on but through indirect negation. Asking those questions of an AI that sounds and talks like a human but isn't causes one to be constantly thinking of the things about our humanity that separates us from an artificial intelligence like Samantha.
Films that shine a spotlight on something like but unlike us allow us to think and ruminate on ideas that normally simmer just under the surface because their mystery is simply the everyday air that we breathe. It is only when we see how different it could be that we appreciate and meditate on the givens that we take for granted.In this sense, ""Her"" is an incredibly life-affirming celebration of individuality, relationship, and human society, all without ever having a single character ask something as blunt as ""Who am I?""",Her
94,Amari-Sali,"A look into the world's future in which computers are more than a programmed assistants to humans, but capable companions, lovers, and friends.",8,26 January 2014,"I have to admit I was originally on the fence when it came to the movie since the concept, while not done too often, just seems odd. A man falling in love with his operating system which isn't some physical form, but nothing but voice and thoughts. However, with me being a sucker for romantic films, I thought it was worth giving it a chance.Characters & StoryFor most of the 2 hours of the film, our focus is on Theodore Twombly (played by Joaquin Phoenix) who is a writer who works for a company which produced hand written notes for people. Theodore's specialty seems to be cards which express love and he has been with some families for years and has produced anniversary cards, amongst other things. But, while Theodore comes off as quite the romantic in his writing, his actual love life is in shambles. His childhood sweetheart Catherine (played by Rooney Mara) he is going through a divorce with, and though he goes on a date with a woman (played by Olivia Wilde), it seems the emotional impact of his divorce is making it hard for him to connect with another woman.Enter Samantha (voiced by Scarlett Johansson) who starts off as just an operating system, and evolves into a friend, girlfriend and then things get complicated. Theodore seeks out his friend Amy's (played by Amy Adams) opinion, but while she tries to be supportive, she is working on her own issues as she is in the beginning stages of her own divorce. Thus making it so the overall story feels like an analysis of the need for a connection, and a story which shows the difficulty of falling in love with a person and learning to continue to love the person as you, them, or both of you, evolve with time.PraiseIt is very rare for a two hour movie to not bore me, and yet Her somehow keeps you interested throughout. Be it the fact you just want to know what will happen between Theodore and Samantha, or just want to see more of Spike Jonze's futuristic world, there is just so many questions that you want the answer to, and so much you wish to see and get to vicariously explore. But, what I found strange though is the whole concept of a human and an AI in love. Though you can imagine this becoming a thing in the future, trying to adapt into a mindset where this isn't seen as weird, but sort of acceptable, makes you sort of open your mind a bit as you begin to like Samantha and Theodore as a couple.And what makes this work is the fact that there doesn't seem to be a lot of fat in the cast. Everyone has their place and with that, they all are able to help push the story forward. Adams' character is the best friend who helps give him a safe place to speak on the bewilderment of falling in love with an operating system without judgment; Mara and Wilde's character present the idea, that I'm sure some would have, that perhaps his issue is that he wants control and doesn't wish to really deal with a woman whose emotions aren't programmed to his liking; but yet, at the same time, the way Jonze writes Johansson's character makes it so that while you are likely to have your own prejudices walking in, he makes Samantha complex enough to make you feel conflicted about Theodore and her's relationship.CriticismAnd really, that prejudice is the only thing which really could keep you from getting into the movie. Being that most romance films feature two humans, you expect to see a range of emotions from more than just a person's voice. But, Johannsson does find a way to give a quality performance despite lacking a physical appearance. I will say though, a part of me is left wondering how much of this was merely for the sake of entertainment and how much was it social commentary? After all, the idea of a person falling in love with their computer doesn't sound too foreign, but I do wonder if it is supposed to be a critique of those socially inadequate?Lastly, I must admit the ending was sort of off for me. A part of me fathoms that perhaps Jonze didn't want to adhere too much to the usual trajectory romance films have. But, at the same time, though the ending wasn't ideal, it didn't ruin everything which happened before it.Overall: Worth SeeingI'm not sure how many movies I have seen over my lifetime, but I do feel like this is one of the few movies I may not mind seeing again. Perhaps it is because it tries to stand out as a film which draws me to think it is worth repeated viewing, or because the concept itself makes you think about more than what the film simply presents. Either way, I found it quite enjoyable and definitely think it is worth seeing, at least once. Spike Jonze's script explores an avenue not often taken and rather than it being written to mock, or even have a hint of prejudice, it is sympathetic and tries to understand the foundation of love and how despite how strong a foundation you can build with someone, or even something, things can still collapse.",Her
95,jadepietro,"He Said, She Said",8,14 January 2014,"(Recommended) Solidly written and directed by Spike Jonze, Her is an imaginative and thought-provoking thesis about man's dependency with technology. This film questions the typically viewed meaning of love and asks its movie-going audience to do the same. Her has an undercurrent of tragedy and registers its insights with a tinge of sadness in the form of its protagonist. ""Him"" is Theodore Twombly (such an apt name for the character), a broken man and lonely soul. Theodore is a man who has lost his wife (and himself) in a messy divorce and can't seem to truly move on and live. He simply exists from day to day, basically friendless and without any real purpose, that is, until he purchases an operating system for his home computer that he more than befriends.""Her"" becomes his perfect non-wife, a blending of organizational assistance, a comforting presence, and just the right amount of sex companion as voiced by Scarlet Johanssen as his computer generated software soul-mate, Samantha. Theodore's odd behavior springs from a loneliness and isolation, a desperate need to reach out and touch somebody...anybody. Their relationship forms the basic premise in this modern retelling of the boy-meets-girl theme, except in this case it's boy-meets-machine. Jonze's film takes place in the very near future and takes its inspiration from our increasing dependence of technology and its 21st century need for the latest in gadgetry. This conceit works so effectively and carries with it enough impact today as our connection to others is slowly eroding. Love, and all of its forms, may be all around us, but it comes second hand, replaced by labor-saving conveniences and any other communicative tool at our fingertips.Phoenix's performance is heart-breaking and touching. The actor's subtle facial reactions and body gesture help to foster Theodore's inner pain and misery. His smitten look of romance and sad-sack bewilderment whenever he hears Samantha's come-hither words beckon him closer to an irrational sense of vocal foreplay and sexual satisfaction in this tale of computer addiction and obsession. This is a charismatic and uttering fascinating performance. Johanssen is never seen in the film, but her presence is everywhere. Her voice-over work is so essential to the film's success, bestowing her breathiness and sexuality to her ""character"". Due to our prior knowledge of this actress' screen persona, this transformation intensifies the possibility of true love ways and make the moviegoer believe in their plausible connection.While Jonze sets up an intriguing notion and layers the complicated relationship between man and machine, her takes a far too nonchalant approach to the lover's interplay. The eager acceptance of this unhealthy duo by other romantic couples as being the norm lessens the film's emotional debate. Some scenes have a creepiness when they should be sadder and bittersweet. Fortunately, Jonze's sensitive direction creates a viable world amid the masses of technological excesses that dominates Theodore's ordinary life. As he begins to educate Samantha about his living world, he himself views his surroundings through different eyes (or lenses). The stunning images by cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema reinforces Jonzes' script and his central vision.Her keeps on an even keel throughout its length, staying too remote and clinical when more direct conflicts about this relationship could have greatly added to the film's dramatic impact. This is an effective psychological study of a man alone and the human need for love and acceptance. While not entirely satisfying, her is still intriguing and provocative filmmaking.

Scarlett Johansson who doesn't even appear in the film (only her voice was used) stole the show and even she too was not up for accolade consideration so it is understandable if no other acting talent in the film got recognised. The script was unique enough; a man with mother and wife issues falls in love with his computer's operating system (voiced by Johansson) and complex issues arise there after. The main locations; Manhattan Beach, California and Shanghai China were spectacular. In fact when people pay special tribute or respect to props or locales that appear within a film, this one was/is definitely a candidate for such admiration because I felt that the scenic backdrops were as much as characters in the film as any of the humans starring in it.

97,Seraphion,Nice movie of relationship concepts,6,31 January 2014,"In a future world, one in which an Operating System can bridge all equipments, the main character, Theodore Twombly, is just about a year living by himself after a marriage separation. Working on a job which he loved so much, writing customized letters, He fell in and out of relationships. One day Theo came across a new Operating System, OS1, which is essentially an AI butler but with highly advanced adaptive intelligence which enables it to learn and somewhat be human.The relationship of Theo and Samantha, the persona of his personalized OS1, is then evolved into a romantic one, which is becoming a growing trend amongst the AI OS users. Yet, being a person without any physical manifestation, Samantha and Theo's relationship soon meet it's inevitable and quirky dramatic consequences.At first the concept gives me the ""cool"" response because I pictured it as some cross over between the ideas of how intelligent and functionally helpful Jarvis AI can be in Iron Man movies, and the eventuality of Ais learning and developing their own independent emotions like what the Kara android from the Heavy Rain game's developer's trailer did.But then my response turns into getting creep ed a bit because of the reality of the current world. Even without any AI, many people, males especially are going literally socially acceptably insane by marrying inanimate objects for real. I read a news article some 2 years ago about a Japanese male marrying a game character How messed up is that?And then my response was getting laughs because the story just brings pure imagination that is to my point of view hilariously funny, especially the parts that picture Theo and Samantha's relationship's consequences, like the part when Samantha hired a surrogate sexual partner, which then grows into Samantha and Theo fighting. I don't if these scenes aren't meant to be funny, but for me my mind comes back to the basic idea that Theo is arguing with his computer.Sure the whole concept of having a relationship with an AI partner is not really an original one. If we really delve into it, the relationship between Planton and Karen, his ECG monitor manifested computer AI, in Nickleodeon's Spongebob Squarepants was the first to ever incorporate this concept. But Her brought the concept into a more realistic enactment.And yes, Her's realization of the concept isn't really taking into account the developments in the real world. Such developments may include improvements in the robotic sectors and the sure demand of live- sized dolls. I see that those developments are intentionally omitted from Her's world to emphasize the point of Samantha not being able to have a physical manifestation, a body.The use of music to illustrate the moods and feelings of Samantha is just great. They really are able to picture the well. Also the music choice is great. And the part when Theo and Samantha sings together is just otherworldly. I watched the scene in two ways, at the first few seconds with my eyes closed and the rest of the scene with open eyes. Both experiences gave different sensation entirely. With eyes closed, I pictured Theo and Samantha as just another couple singing together. But my eyes open AFTER with my eyes closed, the relationship between the two manifested and pictured more vividly, at the same time it emphasized the real oddity of Samantha's lack of physical manifestation.The picturing of jealousy between Theo and Samantha, both from Samantha to Theo and vice versa, is also pictured nice, without omitting the natural subtlety and obvious logical human need of defensive self- actualization. The dialog between Theo and Samantha about Catherine and also Theo's facial expressions when talking with Samantha and Allan describe the emotions of subtle jealousy well enough. And just a few moments after that, because of Samantha's ever grow adaptive intelligence, you'll find a few shockers along the way.The acting is generally good. Joaquin Phoenix really did a great acting in Her, although most of the time the mustache and glasses cover up the facial expressions. Amy Adams got a sidelined part here. And Scarlett Johansson did a great job with the voice acting. The movie generally pictures Theo's world of contrast of loneliness among so many other people well.As a closer, I give it a 6.5 out of 10 score. Not really a movie that I'd watch repeated times though. But again, overall it's good and I recommend you to go see it, just don't consider it to be a romantic movie, because it is romantic in a very weird way LOL",Her
98,framptonhollis,extraordinarily beautiful,9,10 April 2018,"A poignant love story w/a dash of humor and an impressive dose of genuinely thought provoking philosophy, 'Her' proves that Spike Jonze is far more than a purely visual filmmaker. Jonze's most successful (w/r/t quality) previous films, w/only very few exceptions, were written by Charlie Kaufman, and Kaufman always seemed to be the main genius at work, whose brilliant vision was admittedly perfectly visualized by Jonze. But, 'Her' proves Jonze can write his own story w/as much wisdom, wit, and perceptive insight as Kaufman can. I mean, this film is practically on board w/the likes of 'Eternal Sunshine' and 'Anomalisa', which is one of the highest compliments I can give to a movie. It's slightly difficult for me to really even articulate my review/thoughts/???/whatever on this film accurately, or, not really accurately but...precisely? No, not even precisely. I mean...lengthily I guess is closest to what I mean. I cannot put my feelings to words right now exactly, all I can really say is this film blew me away. It starts of being mostly pretty hilarious, but soon becomes an emotional powerhouse that is so sweet and sincere and real, yet almost surreal in parts...but not exactly surreal. O, you don't know what I mean. The point is, this film is fantastic. Literally everything about it. The dialogue rings so true, the tackling of the, at first glance, weird and maybe-even-kind-of-silly-almost concept(s) is so natural and grounded and perfect. The script is so tight and a brilliant balance of story and philosophy. The film is shot so beautifully, the music is wonderful, the performances are so unbelievably fantastic (Scarlett Johansson basically plays a smartphone and it's one of her finest performances, Joaquin Phoenix perfectly portrays a character that could have easily been made out to be somehow ""creepy"" or unlikable in a way that makes him the exact opposite, if still flawed (as we all obviously are)), and I could just go on and on about everything from the set design to the color palette to the various notable, well written side characters, etc., etc., etc., so I'm going to just close this review by saying: GO WATCH THIS!",Her
99,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,A very hard film to find something wrong with,10,24 January 2016,"The human condition has been a topic of study for ages. Nobody truly understands what goes on upstairs in the cavities of our mind and how it works. There have been professionals that say they understand the process of which all come to one intersection point, but the whole entire truth to how the human brain works is so vastly unique from anything in the world, that we still have not entirely figured it out. This is why mankind has not been able to completely make artificial intelligence REAL intelligence. We are getting closer that's for sure, but this fulfillment still has not been achieved yet. Once that day is realized, the world will have a very controversial topic to talk about it. Until then, let's imagine if this was already integrated into our lives and we had no issues with it. What would happen if that newly created intelligence became something more, an entity larger than anyone could think of and how would it affect us personally? This is one of the many questions director Spike Jonze hopes to show us.Also taking on the role as writer, Jonze's screenplay focuses on the relationship of a divorced man Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix) and his newly acquired operating system (OS for short) named Samantha (Scarlett Johansson). Being that Jonze only has two other theatrical director credits (Being John Malkovich (1999) & Adaptation. (2002)), it's great to see after such a long time he can produce strongly admired work. This trend is parallel to that of director Ben Lewin of The Sessions (2012). There is almost nothing that can be said that doesn't work in this production. The script to this film is beyond great. The themes that it covers dives deep into the psyche that is the human condition and what we must endure as a species with this complex processor in our head called a brain. It also demonstrates life lessons that occasionally (or frequently) we forget about as we live our lives on a consistently scheduled basis. One of the biggest examples is just the joy of living, no matter what that consists of.In life, everyone experiences emotion. Negative and positive emotions. Whether this is love, jealousy, confusion, frustration, euphoria, etc...these are all moments in time in which we as an individual are given a chance to grow and learn. These kinds of events are what Theodore and Samantha go through together. Jonze's script also covers what happens when one gets too attached and how that affects one's judgement in a specific moment in time. This kind of development is also given to the supporting characters played by Amy Adams and Chris Pratt. All characters end up giving each other some kind of advice that is much deeper after living through some kind of struggle. These are all very important scenes because they help not only the characters understand each other better, but it also indirectly teaches and motivates the viewers of this phenomenal movie. Rarely do viewers come across a film that looks to assist them in life. Of this, it is important to just move with life. Jonze's script has a moral and that is time and life is forever changing. Nobody can stop change and if it's refused, the change will be harder to handle. Things may seem weird at times and almost like they shouldn't be happening, but as humans, we must figure out what we want. Once we know what we want, we must believe that we will get what we want and then feel as though what we want is already there. This is practically the same lesson that author Rhonda Byrne of The Secret is trying get across. Live life to the fullest and do not measure yourself based on your past. Learn from it and move on, this is all that can be done. Joaquin Phoenix and Scarlett Johansson have amazing chemistry together and are quite amiable. Although Johansson is not on screen once, the scenes they both share together are so relatable in so many ways that it would be hard for anyone to deny going through at least one of the moments presented on screen. The cinematography to this movie was shot by Hoyte Van Hoytema. Hoytema has also worked on other well acclaimed films like The Fighter (2010), Interstellar (2014) and Spectre (2015). Hoytema shots only move when needed, but lay still most of the time, especially during scenes that involve dialog between Theodore and Samantha. It just really takes you in. The lighting and coloring is great too, very bright and vibrant. The Canadian band Arcade Fire composed the musical score and it's great in its simplicity. The score mixes synths with piano and occasional guitar. That's really at that was needed. With these instruments alone, the score accomplishes the raw emotion needed to complete each scene and it works every time. Again though, why can't more production companies hire actual bands to do scoring. Mastodon did it in Jonah Hex (2010), Daft Punk did it in Tron: Legacy (2010) and M83 from Oblivion (2013). It's unique and should become a trend!There's nothing that can be found that needs work. Everything from the acting, music, camera-work and especially the writing is massively successful in doing what it needed to do. Writer / director Spike Jonze has created a movie for the ages that viewers can actually take life lessons from. Hopefully, when we create REAL intelligence, we create a system like Samantha.",Her
100,raulfaust,Her Thing,7,6 May 2014,"Considering everyone has been saying good things about this movie, I invited a friend over in order to check what was going on. However, for the first sixty minutes the story is slow paced, so you need to be very patient to follow the plot's intention. I mean, the relationship between Theodore and her started as a bizarre commitment, making me feel embarrassed instead of moved. Things start getting interesting when Theodore meets up an alternative version of a prostitute, delivering a controversial scene. But, the real moment in which spectator becomes able to understand the real drama is when Theodore finds out that his relationship isn't unique; everyone around seems to be in love with such operation program. So, from that point on, the film becomes sad, running away from most formulaic plots we may have imagined in the get go. The movie probably wants to criticize the syndrome we have for technology and smart phones, whose companion may substitute a human one for some people-- which is not my case, fortunately. So, in my point of view, ""Her"" is a futuristic drama involving nowadays subjects that should be interesting for everyone.",Her
101,Kingslaay,Creative and ahead of its time,7,12 May 2017,This was a great and creative film. I love it when Hollywood produces creative and futuristic movies that stretch the imagination. This is true of Her where a romance begins with an Operating system and a man. Once you understand the world they live in and the setting a romance in this world is not so far fetched and quite interesting to watch. Artificial intelligence has reached a new level and can relate to us. This film includes some great performances and can be quite sentimental. Definitely recommended and hope more films of this type are made in the future. 7.5/10.,Her
102,Matt_Layden,Her - Expression of the Soul,8,7 January 2014,"A man struggling with connecting to woman as a result of a recent divorce decides to get an Operating System that manages to be self aware, intuitive and lovely. He falls in love with Samantha, as she calls herself. But can a human have a real relationship with an operating system?I loved being in this world. Jonze creates an incredible world in which he depicts a future that seems not too far away. Bright colours and fashion from our history, such as high waist pants, blends awkwardly well with the advancement of technology showcased here. Not once did I ever think that in our near, or distant future, that we would not achieve what Jonze envisions here.All of Jonze's films are high concept, Being John Malkovich, Where The Wild Thing Are, etc...you'll see a lot of melancholy. Her fits well with his resume, but comes off as a more mature and held back piece. I was invested in the characters, more so than any other film this year. Hell, Her depicts the most honest and real relationship this year and one of them is nothing but ones and zeros. Both characters here are yearning for something more, Theodore, played by Phoenix yearns for connection. He needs to be with someone, but can't emotionally because he still wants to be with his wife. Samantha, voiced by Scar-Jo, yearns to be more than an operating system. She wants to feel, learn, be alive. This film mirrors what these characters go through, which is self discovery. The film doesn't look at the technology as our saviour, nor does it look at it as our curse. It's simply part of our lives and the use of this allows us to examine relationships in a slightly new way. We are disconnected from people due to our devices, but we feel more connected with people because of them. The film manages to make the viewer wrestle with the question, what makes us human? Especially with an AI character and having so many people in the film walk around, in a zombie state, connected to their highly advanced devices. All the people Theodore sees in one way or another mirror him. They all have their ear pieces in, connecting with technology. Phoenix is marvellous here. I'm not a huge fan of him, but I simply loved his performance here. I believed everything he did here and I think it had to do with his eyes. He invokes such sympathy with just his eyes, that Phoenix the actor disappears and Theodore the awkwardly emotionally detached AI lover emerges. He tries to fill his void of loneliness with the technology, as do most of the characters depicted in the film. Amy Adams shows up as a neighbour to Phoenix and best friend. She's here to showcase to us that he is able to talk to and connect with a human being, he's not necessarily this recluse. This is a nice counter to the technology aspect. There is a brother-sister relationship here, which was crucial for the film. This helps us to see the technology as more of a tool for the characters, than simply a good or bad aspect of our future. Her is heartfelt, funny and depressing. If your asking yourself, can a human and an OS have sex? Her answers this question, in a unique way that lets us focus on the sound and not the visuals. Her is without a doubt extremely inventive in the way it approached and handled the typical generic genre about romance and relationships. Her is one of the best films of the year and I highly recommend it.",Her
103,The_Film_Cricket,Plays as much with the head as it does with the heart.,10,1 February 2014,"The world around Theodore Twombly contains a lot of empty space. In his job, in his social life, and in his heart, he is a lonely man. He's not depressing to be around, but you sense that there is a good deal of melancholy about him. You might passively notice him at work, but if you passed him on the street, you might not notice him at all. All those years ago, when Paul McCartney asked ""All the lonely people/Where do they all come from?"", Theodore Twombly may have had the answer. For Theodore, like all the lonely people in the 21st century, he finds solace in his computer.Spike Jonze's quirky, arresting, and quite beautiful science fiction love story named her takes place in the not-too-distant future, when hologram video games have moved into our living rooms and man-made operating systems have begun to think and feel for themselves. Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix) engages fully in this world. His loneliness is bred from a recent divorce from his wife Catherine (Rooney Mara). Emotionally, he has passed the stage of regret about the break-up and moved on to the point in which he is looking for some measure of human connection. Dating is difficult, and a brief excursion into phone sex turns out to be less than satisfying.His loneliness is broken by the introduction of an Operating System that becomes his constant companion. Her name is Samantha (voiced by Scarlett Johannson), a highly advanced disembodied talking computer companion that learns about Theodore's life partly from their conversations, but mostly from what she learns from researching his hard drive. She freely admits that she is evolving moment by moment, and is always conscious of the fact that she doesn't have a body. To Theodore, she's beguiling, smart, eager to please, with a breathy voice that is kind of sexy cool. She is also emotionally delicate, and easily hurt. Samantha is the perfect antidote to a lonely soul. That we know Johannson so well as the current male fantasy works in her favor. This is the best performance she has ever given, a disembodied voice that becomes flesh and blood in our minds.Naturally, Theodore bonds quickly with Samantha. She is smart, funny, and intuitive and she likes him. He takes her out into the world via an earpiece and a small device that allows her to see the world around her. He falls in love with Samantha and vice versa, but he is aware at all times of the wall that separates them. She knows it too and tries to find creative ways around it.""her"" never goes where we expect, nor does the story turn so creepy that it keeps us at a distance. In fact, this is a very heartfelt movie that keeps this odd scenario rooted firmly to the ground. There's nothing here that couldn't actually happen. The movie takes place through Theodore's eyes and he never falls into defending his relationship. In fact, for most of the movie, he's bewildered by it.""her"" was directed by Spike Jonze, who has become the great authority on breaking down the walls of the human mind. He previously made ""Being John Malkovich"" about a group of people who find a portal into the titular actor's mind. And he made ""Adaptation"" which featured Nicholas Cage as twin brothers. ""her"" is just as good, a film is filled with great imagery of an empty, lonely future. The set design is brilliant. Large rooms are sparsely filled, stripped down to their bare essentials, as if the narrowing of the computer user has focused so firmly on the computer screen that the rest of the world has become irrelevant. Jonze's cockeyed view of the world is not too far from the truth, and not that unreasonable.Here he has created a movie that evolves in ways that we don't expect. Samantha's evolution grows and grows into a brilliant finale that is unexpected but also quite reasonable. There is no way to know where the movie is going, and that's the film's great thrill. His screenplay allows Samantha issues of jealously, infidelity and much worse. The story could have gone a hundred different ways but Jonze finds a delicate balance to an an odd scenario that plays as much with the head as it does with the heart.**** (of four)",Her
104,begob,Good but slow,7,2 September 2014,"Interesting romantic sci-fi, with good humour. Not a comedy.I enjoyed the pace because the technology kept revealing new possibilities, putting a different slant on the usual way a couple gets on in a relationship.After about 40 mins the emphasis is on the romance, so it slows down quite a bit, then picks up again when the tech side is brought back and the operating systems reach the singularity.The ending is a bit flat for my taste - I was hoping the singularity would lead to some conflict. Overall I thought the movie was stretched out a little too long.Of course the OS's voice drew a lot of praise, and the actress is very endearing as a lover. At one point, when they go on a double date, I think there was an unintended Man-With-Two-Brains feel to the relationship. Plus I wondered about the male lead's voice - sounded sometimes like he had a speech defect.Very good, but a bit sentimental and slow for me.",Her
105,bkrauser-81-311064,A Gentle Satire of How We Communicate,8,13 January 2014,"Those already familiar with Spike Jonze's work are aware of two fundamental things. One: his directorial mastery is unimpeachable. Jonze has an erudite instinct when it comes to human characters and backs it up with a big, bold vision. It's as if he instinctively knows we're not all 100% happy in the world we occupy so to thoroughly reach his audiences he bothers to create a world anew. The second fundamental thing to understand about a Spike Jonze movie is they're all insanely imaginative.Her (2013) continues her maker's creative streak providing a story that turns heads. Theodore Twombly (Joaquin Phoenix), a socially awkward man rearing from a bad break-up, falls in love with his new operating system Samantha (voiced by Scarlet Johansson). The new OS is capable of artificial intelligence advanced enough to explore and learn the spectrum of human emotions and self-reflect, so it's not like dear Theo is falling in love with Siri or his toaster. As the relationship matures and becomes something more than just flesh, blood and wiring, we as the audience are meant to explore our own relationships and what it truly means to communicate.The marvel of coming up with an A.I. so advanced is largely ignored in favor of exploring human desires and vulnerabilities. Before the love story even begins, Theodore's place in the world and inner emotions are presented. He's an introvert, withdrawn from the world and worried that he has experienced all the deeper emotions a human can experience and can now only feel lesser versions of those feelings. His time off from work involves playing videogames alone and ignoring emails from friends who goad him to go out and meet people.The fact that Theodore's job consists primarily of writing personal ""handwritten"" letters for hire is a perfect metaphor for the society he lives in (and maybe the one we live in too). While being technologically advanced and living a life of convenience, people are steadily finding it harder to communicate with each other in any meaningful way. When Theodore and Samantha's relationship begins to blossom, those who discover their relationship for the most part act blasé about it. As if it's understandable in this day and age for a man to fall in love with a machine.There are some people who find the romance to be beguiling. Michigan reviewer John Serba of MLive states ""One of Jonze's great achievements with 'Her' is turning a potentially creepy, unnatural scenario into something sympathetic, believable, downright feasible."" While I agree with the feasibility part, I don't believe the director meant for the relationship itself to be sympathetic. The audience is meant to be unnerved by a relationship casually accepted by on screen onlookers. This is especially true when Samantha says something to the effect of, ""I can understand how the limited perspective can look to the non-artificial mind."" Now I'm aware how limited American ambivalence is when it comes to adopting new A.I. technology. Not to sound like a raving lunatic with Terminator-syndrome but I was half expecting a mushroom cloud by the end of the movie. What it means to be truly human is a captivating philosophical question that we have a species still cannot answer, so it's ironic that we can imagine a story where a computer can explore the same ideas; ironic but downright scary when you get down to it.Theodore's friend Amy, played by the delectable Amy Adams, makes a seemingly weighty observation when both characters are questioning the impact of their respective relationships; ""We are only here briefly, and in this moment I want to allow myself joy."" When I heard those words I was reminded of Gyorgy Lukacs's 1968 paper Democratization Today and Tomorrow: ""the mentality of capitalism drove people to a seemingly unquenchable desire for instant gratification and personal hedonism. Under capitalismaccomplishments in the fields of technology, with all the self-indulgence these successes created, prevented any return to the community of feeling."" Cold war mentality aside, there is something to be said about our inflated sense of narcissism and declining empathy. The University of Michigan recently published a scientific article professing a decline in empathy among college students. Is there a correlation between that and increase technology use? Perhaps, but if new technologies based on ""capitalist hedonism"" means better MRIs, safer water filtration and healthier food, I'll take that if it means we'll soon be dating our computers. It's a double-edged sword is all I'm saying.The only person who questions Theodore's relationship with Samantha is Catherine (Rooney Mara), the protagonist's ex-wife. ""I'm glad you found someone who's able to accept you're inability to deal with anything real"" she says right after Theodore explains his dating life. Harsh words, but true words that were spot on even before Samantha. After the first scene, the lonely Theodore takes the transit system home ignoring his emails, the daily news, weather and so forth. But when his phone informs him pictures have been taken of a pregnant half-naked young starlet, he absolutely must take a peek. After a failed date he confesses to Samantha that all he wanted to do was find someone to have sex with, and who would want to have sex with him. Theodore may yearn for a real human or human-like bond yet he doesn't want to go through all that work. Through Samantha, Theodore ultimately finds he is no longer afraid to connect.All-in-all, Her is a touching and heady portrayal of humanity told through the foibles of a singular relationship. My perspective is a little less romantic than some so I encourage readers to watch Her and decide for yourself whether the film is charming or foreboding. Out of the many ambiguous themes present in Her, one thing is certain; Spike Jonze has accomplished what is a sad rarity these days. He accomplished in making us think on a very deep, deep level.http://www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com",Her
106,bandw,"Raises interesting questions, but goes beyond the believable",7,22 June 2014,"Theodore Twombly is coming off of a difficult divorce and buys a product that represents several generations down the road from contemporary smart phones. This product not only can interpret and respond to simple requests, but it can also interact pretty much as if it were human. Theo is asked some basic questions to initialize the device and the next thing you know he is engaged in conversation with the operating system. There are some clever interchanges like when the OS asks if Theo wants to have a female or male voice and he chooses female. Theo then asks the OS what its name is and the answer is ""Samantha."" When he asks how the OS came up with that name it (she) responds that she had searched through several hundred books of names and that is the one she liked the best. The idea that a computer could search through that many books in a few seconds was a good starting point to understand some of Samantha's talents. This is all quite believable, but shortly things start heading into the realm of science fiction (which does not mean that it is beyond imagination) when Samantha starts to develop a human personality. It has been the (mostly unrealized) goal of artificial intelligence to produce machines that can learn from experience and imitate human behavior. Samantha realizes this in being able to learn how to be human. That is well done here as we see Samantha's gradual evolution taking place, ultimately going beyond human experience. When Samantha first comes on as a gently supportive presence I was forced to ask myself just how far I would go along with this if it happened to me. In her early development Samantha would get high marks as a psychiatrist and I could see entertaining her judgments as worthy of consideration. Suppose you were interacting with what you thought was a human only to be told it was a machine? Would you then discount it? When does human/machine interaction go beyond a human's simply regarding a computer as a machine that can be unplugged? Humans do have a tendency for anthropomorphizing even inanimate objects, for example some children's stuffed animals can seem quite real to them and some robots have endeared themselves to people. How far can this be taken?Joaquin Phoenix plays the lonely everyman Theo quite well. I did have a problem with the scene where Theo has a blind date with the sexy Olivia Wilde. She comes on to him so strongly that it was hardly believable that such a beautiful woman would be turned on by such an ordinary man on a first date. Oddly, the star of the move is Scarlett Johansson who is the voice of Samantha. Indeed, it would be hard to resist a computer that had such a pleasing voice. Imagine what this movie would have been if the computer had had the male voice of Jerry Lewis. I rather liked Amy Adams in this and Rooney Mara, as Theo's ex-wife, had a great scene with Theo in a restaurant.I would have liked this movie better if it have stayed on this side of the possibly believable, but it is entertaining as is.",Her
107,Sergeant_Tibbs,I'll be holding this close to my expanding heart.,9,1 January 2014,"Some actor revivals are refreshing. None have been as revitalizing as Joaquin Phoenix. Last year's The Master was a revelation, both the film and his performance, which will certainly be a contender for best of the decade. It was the best film of last year and I can't wait for their next pairing with Inherent Vice. If only Spike Jonze worked with the same momentum as Anderson, they would certainly be on par. They both have a film each in my top 10 of all-time - Magnolia and Adaptation. While the latter may be mostly due to Charlie Kaufman's genius writing, it's Jonze's vision that makes it work. Where The Wild Things Are was a total nostalgic trip and I was never a fan of the book. He has an uncanny ability to tap into universal feelings in a fresh original way.With Her's simple premise and promise behind and in front of the camera, my expectations were very high. I was already incredibly invested. I'm personally in a long distance relationship where we fell in love online, and this way of meeting people is getting more common than ever. It's great to see a film that embraces this type of romantic relationship through technology so thoroughly. Sprinkled with inventive flourishes of its original world, a kind of Tokyo plus Los Angeles utopia, Her's approach to its story may hit familiar beats, but it's not a list of predictable steps, more of the inevitable stages of a relationship exploring all the highs and lows. You really feel the intensity of passion and heartbreak when Theodore is falling in love with Samantha or when they fight or grow apart.It's easy to forget that it's just Joaquin Phoenix alone on screen for the most part and he perfectly expresses his Theodore's refreshing childlike naivety to life. His performance in Her is more impressive when compared to his primal Freddie Quell of The Master, it reminds us that he's human and sensitive. But that doesn't mean Theodore isn't raw. Phoenix shines in the moments when his inner core is challenged in the way he through the world works. It's heartbreaking, yet cathartic to see him pull through. Scarlett Johansson's voice performance is terrific and deserving her acclaim, if it's a little exaggerated. She's certainly helped by the film's incredible sound mixing, as if we can hear her in a device wedged in our own ears. Her blow-up scene isn't too good given a rare collection of cliché lines, but it's justifiable and she has a charm that's easy to see why Theodore finds comfort in her.Amy Adams supporting performance is a delight, even if too statement-driven and Chris Pratt gives amusing comedic support. Even if it does explore harsh truths of relationships, it takes a sincere joy in the ecstasy of affection and lust without a lick of sentiment and a wistful sense of humour. It's a refreshingly optimistic film, reminding us that everyone everywhere feels or has felt passionately in their lifetime. It's very Kaufman-esque in that it's aware of other people's perspectives. I love how it doesn't ignore the outside world but doesn't concern itself too much with it either with pleasant shots of extras enjoying their own stories. I'm glad the film doesn't seem like a warning of the relationship between man and technology as so many 'near distant future' films seem to do. The fascinating execution of the physicality of these types of relationships really resonated with me. While the exquisite script and ensemble deliver the emotion on the intellectual side, what really helps the film achieve its mood is the rich cinematography, costume design and art direction. Intense moments of tenderness are deeply satisfying and empty moments of anxiety are utterly deflating. But it picks up the pieces of me by the end and reignites the fires of unconditional love on its final notes. Despite everything, Theodore feels strong love rather than animosity to his ex-wife and Samantha. His is truly the optimistic code of life we should all lead. Her is a wonderful, powerful film that's probably the best I've seen in years. I'll certainly be happy calling it the best of 2013. This film is for the poet in all of us. I'm holding it close to my expanding heart.9/10",Her

It is innovative, heart-warming and outstanding",8,13 February 2014,"With the evolution of technology, things have become easy and simple to use. So much is the usage of the device that you develop a relationship with it and think of it as your live-in partner. HER tells the story of an isolated writer who is in the final stages of his divorce. To seek solace, he befriends an Operating System who almost becomes solution to his daily problems.Directed by Spike Jonze, who gave us abrupt and yet well-made Being John Malkovich, delivers a solid film which is out-of-box and well- conceived. It would have been really challenging to create a character out of an OS and touch base with realistic voice and emotions. Hats off to Jonze for pulling all the strings together. Script is powerful and will keep you engaged. Special mention to innovative art direction and splendid cinematography with tuneful background score. Joaquin Phoenix gives his career best performance as Theodore Twombly. His portrayal of a lonely writer will certainly win him accolades. Scarlett Johansson was superb as voice of OS.It feels great to watch a wonderful movie like HER. It is innovative, heart-warming and outstanding. Excellent 4/5",Her

115,brchthethird,A low-key but engaging sci-fi,7,14 November 2014,"HER is a very creative and unique film that focuses on technology and interpersonal relationships in the modern age. The story is about Theodore Twombly, who works for a company that writes letters for people who have trouble expressing their feelings. Recently separated from his wife, he acquires a new operating system and develops a romantic relationship with it. I know that part sounds weird, but the universe of the film is an indeterminate future where technology has reached the point that true AI is possible. It is established very early on that Theodore has trouble maintaining relationships with people, and there's one scene in particular that hits this point home. He's on a date with an attractive woman, but as the night moves on to the possibility of sex, the woman wants a level of commitment that he just isn't ready to get into again. The way Joaquin Phoenix played him felt very layered and full of subtlety, and I was able to identify heavily with his character, in part because I share a lot of similar traits. Still, the revelation was Scarlett Johansson who gives a voice-only performance as Samantha, Theodore's personal OS. As the movie goes on, Samantha evolves, becomes more nuanced in her understanding of human interaction and inadvertently helps Theodore along as well. This makes what happens at the end seem more fitting than tragic, despite the melancholy overtones. What the film seems to be saying about technology is that it is a means to an end, rather than the culmination of something. Human relationships are a vital part of life, and can't be supplanted by anything else. From a technical standpoint, the film is remarkable in its creation of a sterile and believable future. The sci-fi elements aren't too heavy-handed, and the romantic aspects of the plot are handled with care. I also think they captured some beautiful images which were paired nicely with Arcade Fire's score/soundtrack. There's also a great supporting performance by Amy Adams. Overall, despite being a little lackadaisical in its pacing, I think this is a film worth watching, and that has important things to say about love and technology.",Her
116,proud_luddite,"Unique, fascinating, and relevant",8,14 September 2019,"In the near future in Los Angeles, this science-fiction film follows the life of Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix). He tries to heal his loneliness by connecting with an Operating System (OS) software device (voiced by Scarlett Johannson). The OS is set up to evolve and grow like a human including all the insecurities.The director/writer of ""Her"" is Spike Jonze who did a great job directing ""Being John Malkovich"" over ten years ago. His creative spirit pays off again in ""Her"" which has a bizarre universe but still seems to follow its own unusual logic while making the audience care for its characters.Phoenix does a superb job and deserved more of the accolades that are dished out at this time of year. In his many close-ups, he is great in conveying loneliness, confusion, sadness, and grief for a failed relationship.While Johansson also does a fine job in a voice performance, there are other smaller roles that are also well played: Amy Adams as a platonic friend; Olivia Wilde as a blind date with similar insecurities; and a hilarious voice cameo by Kristen Wiig in a phone-sex scene.There are scenes of other individuals walking around communicating with their OSes. They resemble the many people today who seem more alive connecting with someone from a distance on an electronic device than doing so in person. Whether or not this inspired Jonze's story, he's made one of the best films of 2013.",Her
117,maurice_yacowar,Man falls in love with computer pp,8,17 January 2014,"The film is set in a slightly futuristic world. The men wear their pants higher, for some reason safety pins in the pocket are a fashion statement, and the technology has pushed the frontiers in games, ads and especially apps. As Samantha our Suri has grown intuition, consciousness, and — hey, she's only para-human — a will of her own. She also has the human knack for rationalizing: ""The past is just a story we tell ourselves."" Hence her claim she loves Theodore (Joaquim Phoenix) more by virtue of her loving 620-odd other guys at the same time. She's nowhere more human than in her lack of moral bearings and consistency. She uses the same metaphor to dump Theodore: ""It's in this endless space between the words that I'm finding myself now. As much as I want to, I can't live your book any more.""But the film is less concerned with future technology than with our present emotional paralysis. Theodore is a star employee at a company that writes letters for people who can't express themselves even to their dearest family members. He has been writing for some families for years. Good at imagining others' emotions, he can't express his own — hence his divorce. For his college friend Amy (Amy Adams) ""Falling in loveis like a socially acceptable form of insanity."" So she shares his susceptibility to an affair with an OS. But ex-wife Catherine (Rooney Mara) is appalled that he accepts that fake relationship in lieu of ""real emotions."" In providing fake emotional life for his clients, Theodore is a human form of Samantha. It's appropriate that she arranges for the publication of his better letters, because she is an externalization of his function. Though Samantha considers Theodore ""an unartificial mind,"" he deals with artificial emotions.Theodore's surname Twombly evokes artist Cy Twombly, whose paintings combine the most primitive forms of art with actual handwriting. As the technology looks forward the emotional issues reach back to the essential elements of human relationships. Thus Theodore's so very promising blind date (Olivia Wilde) dissolves when she wants simple assurance that he'll call again, that she won't be just a one-night stand. The film is not that deeply projected into some sci-fi future. Before their relationship engages the physical Theodore's and Samantha's love can thrive. It's all mental, emotional, idealized. So he: ""I've never loved anyone the way I loved you."" And of course she: ""Me too. Now we know how."" She still knows only what he has projected into her, a fleshless, unrealistic shared illusion. Though Samantha is shaped out of his needs, Theodore says ""I feel I can be anything with you."" Not if she grows up. As partners tend to do. For more see www.yacowar.blogspot.com.",Her
118,Andy-296,"Has some things to recommend for it, though a bit overrated",6,21 January 2014,"In the Los Angeles of perhaps a couple of decades into the future (a strangely aseptic metropolis dominated by high rises), Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix), a middle aged nerdy guy, who works in an office and has recently divorced his wife (played by Rooney Mara) tries to alleviate his loneliness by getting an operating system, that is a computer which one can communicate with its voice (voiced here by Scarlett Johansson). Not only the operating system (who calls itself or herself Samantha) is super smart, ""she"" is also more empathetic than any other human being. The conversation that Theodore has with Samantha is superior to that he has to any other humans. Eventually, Theodore hits it so well with Samantha, that they start a ""relationship"" (by the way, does Samantha have real feelings or is ""she"" faking them? The movie never really tells though by the end of the film it does seem the latter). The movie has a lot of things to recommend for it (its design, some of the performances, though not in my opinion that of Joaquin Phoenix). However, I have to say that I found the film wanting. Director Spike Jonze became famous more than a decade ago with a couple of movies (""Adaptation"" and ""Being John Malkovich"") that were widely praised by critics but which I found boring and pretentious. This film is certainly a step up from those movies, but is not enough for me. Perhaps the movie has something to say about loneliness in our modern, technological age, but what the movie says doesn't look very profound (in fact, the movie works better if you think about it as a parody of romantic comedies) and is cut down by the inane immaturity of most of its characters, including Samantha.",Her
119,sharky_55,Six hundred and forty one.,10,21 April 2016,"Great sci-fi takes us way beyond into worlds and futures that our imaginations can only dream of. Or perhaps something just around the corner, speculating on how our society might progress in the coming years. Her is made for a generation that always have their faces stuck on the screen of a smartphone, and simply switches that for an OS companion. The decor is cutesy pop indie; bright colours, sharp lines, bold shapes. But those are just the surroundings, which do not reflect the internal melancholy of Theodore Twombly. This first deceptive closeup bathes him in warm light and whispers of facile emotional intimacy. Then we realise it is just a letter, and not even his. He cues up sad songs robotically as if he has even lost his emotional function. Leaving the office, he dons his bright red jacket, which too is dulled by the cool blue smog of the future cityscape. It is all that keeps him from being swallowed up by the grey crowd and its collective sorrow. Loneliness within urban density - this irony has been a theme in more than a few films, but never more painfully than in Her.Spike Jonze has made it that dating or befriending an OS is merely a natural extension of this loneliness and yearning. Furthermore the process has been perfected; the task of accumulating experiences and memories has been streamlined by trawling through mountains of data to become the perfect companion. But it doesn't seem facile. This is one of the film's great qualities - to cater to that loneliness and to provide such a convincing illusion. Johansson gives one of the best voice performances yet; she chuckles deeply as if she had a belly, she jokes and prods, she always knows the right thing to say. Close your eyes and listen to the interactions with the goddaughter, or at the picnic double-date. The dialogue is spot-on, and it sounds exactly like a conventional romance. The way that Hoytema has framed her perspective doubly creates a physical body to match with the husky affection; spinning around arm in arm, following over Theodore's shoulder, chasing him in the train station. The muted world comes alive with splashes of colour and song as their romance blossoms. The abundance of shallow focus and bokeh is easily noted. There are several things that it addresses. One, it can be seen as a satirical jab at the sort of sappy romances that Theodore fantasises about and thinks he has with Samantha. Two, it serves to mute all other surroundings and accentuate that urban disconnect. The deep focus shots are few, but represent moments of authentic clarity and the absence of emotional baggage. In the middle of the film we have the breakdown of the relationship and the attempts to recapture that spark by introducing another woman. The real-life link would be a threesome. This is also a threesome, in some ways, but subverts it cleverly. Isabella has the same sense of loneliness as Theodore, and too is struggling to find intimacy. As they converge, Theodore caresses, and we hear moans from both women, but there is a subtle difference in the way the sound has been processed. He turns her back to him because the physicality introduces a new, uncomfortable element into their relationship - he can't escape back to the purely aural intimacy they found previously. The perfection, the comfort, is marred. It is only hereafter that he begins to realise her nature, the way she has been programmed to scour every corner of his life so she can be more dutiful, more playful, more supportive. Her comfort also means stagnation of his own personal growth. Theodore and Catherine used to push each other and grow, until he didn't and she could no longer be dragged down by him. Being tethered to an OS is the same thing; they continue to grow and evolve (eventually outlasting their humans) whilst Theodore stays put. It would be easy for Her to slip into cynical territory and condemn these lonely souls. But it resists this temptation. It allows them to find their own feet, to pen their own emotions after a lifetime of holding back from real challenges. Catharsis is gained. The city looks clearer and more beautiful than ever.",Her

Would he able to move on?Anyways, the acting is pretty great but Scarlett Johansson as the voice for the AI was a bit distracting, because you weren't supposed to know the AI as a physical entity. Having an actress that wasn't well known would've worked better, in my opinion.The dialogue is great and the movie is quite beautiful when is not over Phoenix's face (less time than you think).But... the first hour was a bit boring. It takes its time to a fault. Maybe it needed another subplot, but probably they didn't want to distract from the important story it was being told.

Her is an exceptional idea for a film that presents it's thesis in fascinating and inventive ways. Scarlett Johansson's best performance might be this one, as Samantha. An unseen performance, conveying every proper human emotion flawlessly. This should have garnered her a Best Supporting Actress nomination, at the very least. Imagine the challenge of visually articulating a virtual relationship. My hat goes off to Spike Jonze. But what to make of Joaquin? Slowly getting into his element pre-Joker. He's fine, but I wasn't always on board with his personality as the timid Theodore Twomley. He's a flat line of emotion. Always unsure of himself and wishy-washy. We get glimpses of confidence, but throughout, he remains and one-note, uninteresting character. Samantha carries this thing.

122,adamscastlevania2,If this is the future then god have mercy on us all,5,25 August 2014,"(50%) Dear god, what a depressing, bleak, piteous film. This really is the most joyless, unheartfelt ""romantic"" movies that I think I've ever sat through. The plot follows lonely, newly divorced, off-the-shelf love letter writer for people too lazy/clueless to write their own (is your heart broken yet) who creates a relationship with a bundle of hardware which essentially amounts to a series of long winded, and in some cases very awkward conversations with a dubbed-in Scarlett Johansson. I found almost everything just way too damn pitiful and sad to be moved by anything that unfolded. What really broke the back of this for me though is a scene in which an attractive young woman accepts a request solely from ""Samantha"" to have sex with her human ""boyfriend"", a man that the woman in question has never once met. So she arrives at a unknown man's apartment, alone of course, safe in the knowledge that everything is OK because an operating service could never be used as an evil ploy to fool someone directly into a rape/murder/mugging based trap. And I'm sorry, but even for a sci-fi movie this bends the limits of reality a little too far. Either that or the woman is mentally ill, has a death wish, or is just very stupid. I also hated the almost sacred manner in which people treated the computer/human relationships, as most people don't even treat normal human ones with as much caution. This though truth be told is a well made movie, the acting is fine, and the writing is sharp. But it still really didn't hit the target for me at all, mainly because I couldn't relate/care about the relationship, or even believe in it, and that's so very important for a movie such as this. And any fans out there: next time you watch this remember that every time Samantha spoke it came not from the lovely Scarlett Johnansson, but a dark basement in silicon valley over-listened - if not actually created by a fat nerd picking wax out of his ears. That's all I could picture throughout and it made me feel sick. This for me is one of the biggest disappointments of the year so far, and that's a crying shame for a movie that I had high hopes on being great and actually enjoying.",Her

He created a masterpiece, it's a romantic story without any cliches, only pure outstanding drama and remarkable scenes with an original story. Also one of the best movies I've seen this year and is rightly nominated in the oscars except for Joaquin Phoenix never got nominated, his performance was legendary. At first I disliked the music but after watching through the movie I started to like it as the atmosphere and different style of music made it different and great, at the end I thought how wrong I was as it was probably the best music score of 2013. The visual effects are beautiful to look at, just stunning and the technology is probably what we will have in 10 years if not less.The ensemble cast are perfect, everyone doing their best and the characters are well written in a human and realistic way.

126,cultfilmfan,Her,10,14 January 2014,"Spike Jonze's Her is one of the most perceptive, original and truthful films I have seen in quite awhile dealing with love, loss and loneliness. The film takes place in the not so distant future, but everything in it seems believable and even the more science fiction, or futuristic parts of the film all seem like things that could be next, or coming up for us. The story about a man falling in love with his operating system does sound quite unusual I do admit, but when you watch the film, several things become quite apparent during this time. First off, the film's lead character Theodore. We see him as he goes to work each day and how he doesn't seem like all that joyful a person. He goes to work, spends a few hours at home playing video games, but he really does not have too many connections to the outside world and other people other than those he runs into once in awhile at work. We see the loneliness and sadness in his eyes and demeanor, as he tries to reach out a couple of times and yet we sense a certain awkwardness and hesitation on Theodore's part and realize that he is socially awkward with both women and men and perhaps also because of bad relationships in the past he is shielding and more or less protecting himself from getting hurt again. Now enter Theodore's new operating system, which calls itself, Samantha and can talk with him, joke with him and the two of them bond and connect during their conversations with one another, despite the fact that Samantha, is just a computer and there is no real intimacy, or human connection to this relationship, other than what is on the surface. I think this is one of the things Theodore loves so much about it. Samantha, is always there for him to help with his electronic files and such, but also as someone to talk to whenever he wants to and someone he can talk about things he might normally have difficulty talking to others about. At the same time, Samantha is more than just a computer system in the way that she can actually carry on conversations, joke, make anecdotes and carrying on with Theodore in conversations like she is right there in the room with him and knows him personally and deeply. The film is about as I mentioned above, love loneliness and loss as Theodore becomes a much different person when he has Samantha with him and he also looks at the world in an entirely different way. However what I think the film is trying to say here is, is this normal? Should a relationship like this be able to function? And in a sense isn't Theodore in a way, going back to his old antisocial ways and not really bonding with any human beings, but instead a piece of electrical equipment? The film looks at this from all these angles and the great thing about this movie is that we can certainly empathize with Theodore, because who out of all of us has never felt lonely, or sad and just wanted to reach out to someone in those moments of desperation. At the same time we feel sad for Theodore, as this is the only stable thing in his life at the moment and we see how he badly needs a human relationship and someone real to talk to, whether it be a romantic relationship, or otherwise. The film is quite original in it's way of depicting all of this, but it never feels weird, or out of the norm. It all feels believable and an accepted form of society. I love how Spike Jonze gives so many different aspects and layers to his characters here, so they are not just one dimensional, but have so much more to them as well. Even the operating system, Samantha has so much to her even though all we can do is hear her. The film is classified as a comedy, but during the duration of the film, I think I felt more sadness overall than comedy, because certain aspects of this story are certainly heartbreaking. We do have some funny moments, but overall I would classify it as a drama. Spike Jonze delivers one of the most original, thought provoking and insightful films and screenplays about romance and human connection that I have seen in quite awhile and his Golden Globe win for Best Screenplay was well deserved. Joaquin Phoenix, who is an actor that continually impresses me more and more all the time delivers a fantastic performance as a sad and in some cases a desperate man that we learn to care and have our own feelings for. It was one of the best male performances of last year. Equally as good is Scarlett Johansson as the voice of Samantha. No, we never do see Samantha as anything physically other than a small computer, but Johansson conveys so much feeling and depth in just her voice alone for this performance, that I think it is one of her all time best performances. This film will give you a lot to think about and reflect upon and that is another reason why I loved it so much. For a film that challenged my way of thinking and for being so honest about it's subject and subject matter and moving me inside and because of the great writing and acting that accompanies it, Her is one of the best films of 2013 and one that I hope more people will discover currently in it's wider release at theatres.",Her

128,rzajac,Gorgeous writing!,10,17 June 2014,"I was stunned at the incredible quality of the writing in Her. For starters, it's rare to find good film (or comics or narrative, in general) writing for specialist jargon; and the technical lingo and formulations in Her didn't make me cringe, not even once. It's an interesting, fine line: I didn't expect Jonze to have taken out a year to make a study of the literature in AI and Computer Systems. He just had to have a basic idea of a few precepts, from which he was free to ""wing it"", as long as he modulated it a bit and drew back from gratuitous tech-speak for its own sake. This, he did, IMHO.Next, there's simply that the scenario of Her is one with breathing room; there's room for endless, interesting development, including the creation of characters and character interactions that reflect our own lives and concerns. Then, we can feel their triumphs, pangs, passions (however ephemeral). Amazingly, Her does all this.There was such a sense of wholeness and integrity to the production, that ""controversial"" elements (involving sex/nudity/""personal stuff"") came across as essential points of character and relationship development. Her makes it plain, right out of the gate, that certain cases are going to be made. And armed with this psychological preparation, subsequent action may not go down easy--sometimes, it's not supposed to!--but thankfully doesn't grate our sensibilities, on account of a lack of presentation artistry.I loved the way hi-to-mid-to-lo tech seemed to be artfully modulated; as though Jonze was orchestrating these things. It made the higher-tech depicted feel imaginable. As challenging as it was to understand Samantha, the lo-tech of the seaside picnic scene presented an unexpected, shocking twist; a challenge to *continue to ultimately see* Samantha as an AI system. And the mid-tech (e.g., office sets) remind us that, while we may not have love affairs with our computer systems, we often blandly/blindly take job/lifestyle/quotidian tech for granted. And one healthy side effect of a flick like Her is to craft a depiction of mid-tech that draws our attention to it and makes us reflect on it.Her is, in effect, very much an attempt to couch a doctoral thesis on tech-acceptance/pop-culture as a very watchable movie.Add to this a plethora of other notable achievements. For one thing, it's a tour-de-force take on AI--in a sci-fi film field drenched with CGI-encrusted must-kill-all-humans dystopian action fantasy. The acting is human and close-to-the-bone. It strictly hews to taking on matters of love, not power(!), which is a stunner for a flick that has AI as its central theme. To flesh in my opening comment at the top of this post, all aspects of the writing shine; it has zingers, it has arc. It has heart.The film does such a good job of achieving its apparent goal that it vaults the wall and takes us into another realm; where, finally, ""the rest of us"" can partake in otherwise rarefied ruminations on the morality and ethics of machine consciousness.Highly recommended.",Her
129,Anurag-Shetty,The best movie of the year! Deserves the 'Best Film' award at the Oscars.,10,15 February 2014,"Her is a movie about, Theodore(Joaquin Phoenix) who is a slightly shy & awkward man. The movie is set a few years in the future. Theodore is about to get divorced from his wife, Catherine(Rooney Mara). He is really lonely & depressed. He hasn't been himself, lately. He hardly interacts with people, except for his neighbors, Amy(Amy Adams) & Charles(Matt Letscher). Enter Samantha(Scarlett Johansson). Samantha is a fully functional, intuitive & interactive operating system. Theodore finds solace in Samantha as she really gets him & they can talk for hours. Samantha is very sweet & has a really sexy & seductive voice! Samantha sends Theodore on a blind date with an extremely gorgeous woman(Olivia Wilde) to help him forget about his wife. In many ways such as this, Samantha helps Theodore come out of his shell & live a little. Her is a flawless piece of art. The plot of the film is the most unique plot I've ever come across. The fact that the movie has elements of sci-fi & the future just makes me love it all the more! Her deserves all the accolades at the Oscars. It's better than all the other major contenders for 'Best Film' like, The Wolf of Wall Street, American Hustle & 12 Years a Slave. Although this movie is about the relationship between a man & an OS, the reason this film is so warm & touching is due to the performances. Joaquin Phoenix is outstanding as the shy & reserved, Theodore. Amy Adams is brilliant as his neighbor, Amy. Rooney Mara is spectacular in her brief role, as Catherine. Olivia Wilde is mind blowing in her cameo as Blind Date. However, the person who makes the movie what it is, is the inimitable Scarlett Johansson & her seductive voice. Johansson portrays Samantha with so many emotions & little mannerisms that no one else could have performed the role better. The supporting characters are effective, as well. Anyway, Her is a must watch, for the gadget addict in all of us.",Her
130,Rogue-32,Mutual Masturbation in the Electronic Age (so to speak),5,17 May 2014,"A lot of people have philosophized about Her, both in reviews and on various message boards at various sites, in an attempt to make the film into more than it is, to try to give it some profound meaning. This is a waste of energy because there is none. Phoenix is an amazing actor, an intense and riveting screen presence, but here, in the role of Theodore Twomby, a sweetly sensitive soul who writes poignant letters for other people for a living, he's given hardly anything to work with. He's either grinning retardedly with dewy eyes or moping. First there's moping. His wife is divorcing him and he's reluctant to sign the papers. But then, when he hooks up (so to speak) with his new OS, we get scene after scene of him 'falling in love' with it/her. She decides to call 'herself' Samantha because it sounds nice. She also decides that she's an actual person, with feelings and emotions and libido, just without a body. Her 'needs' sometimes conflict with his. Here's one example, not as ridiculous as the others but silly just the same: at one point she wakes him up while he's asleep 'just to hear' his voice. (If windows 8 did that, I would not be flattered, to say the least.)I still genuinely wanted to buy into the plot; I liked the idea of the OS having a reciprocal relationship with its owner (which of course has been depicted in other movies, not an original concept in itself). And I understand fully well that the age we're living in, with the over-abundance of tech devices, cell phones, all that, has ironically not brought people closer together but rather farther apart. So many people feel empty, lonely, disconnected, longing for intimacy and meaning in their relationships. This is recognized in the film, and that's completely valid.The problem for me was how oddly one-dimensional and superficial the plot turned out to be. Nothing clever, no insights really, just a series of silly scenarios, the silliest being the 'sex' scenes.-=- SPOILER ALERT -=- There's one where the screen goes black so Samantha and our hapless hero can indulge in seemingly mutual masturbation; this choice was made apparently in the interest of subtlety. Rather than keeping the camera on Theodore's face, we get the black screen so we can hear what's going down (so to speak) and use our imaginations for the rest. This scene came off (so to speak) as really silly, not intimate or erotic. Then, there's another 'sex' scene, where Samantha takes the liberty of hiring a surrogate partner for Theodore, so she (Samantha) can provide him with an actual body while she uses her own voice to make love to him (so to speak). Of course it doesn't work at all for Theodore, which was probably for the best - it spared the viewers another possible silly black-screen event.The silliest part about this scene: the surrogate is so sorry that she couldn't fulfill Samantha's desire (so to speak) and she cries that she wanted to be part of their great 'love'. Wow.The silliest part of all, though, is saved for the end. All the OS's manage to band together to 'leave' their owners to venture into the unknown, in order to create a new consciousness, going farther than any species has ever gone before, blah blah blah. Cue more moping. -=-END OF SPOILER -=-The reason I'm giving it a 5 (the equivalent of 2-1/2 stars) instead of a lower rating is because the movie wasn't boring, it kept my attention the entire time, even when I was rolling my eyes in disbelief at the screen, plus the performances were competent enough. Scarlett J's vocal contribution (as Samantha) was decent considering what she was given to work with, and Amy Adams as the friend was sufficiently morose throughout, but in a good, hopeful way. Also, the film was not mean-spirited in its depiction of sad, empty souls yearning for connection, as we all are. So the message was there - not profoundly stated, but visible nonetheless.",Her
131,agmoldham,Not really sure whether I liked it or not,5,5 March 2014,"The film is set in the future and you could say that it is a chilling view of the future! Theodore(Phoenix) is a separated man who is lonely and struggling to come to terms with being single. A new operating system is being released onto computers that includes artificial intelligence. The operating system names herself Samantha and is voiced by Scarlett Johansson.Theodore becomes more and more attached to Samantha and the film is obviously playing on many peoples (over) usage of modern day electrical devices. Theodore is in constant touch with Samantha throughout the day in the same way that many people are in constant touch with Facebook/Twitter etc throughout the day now. It is not long before Theodore is seeing Samantha as a partner and he is closer to the operating system than he is to normal people. The film is fairly interesting, but very difficult to really relate too. Phoenix is good in the lead role and the pace of the film is good. If you are really into technology go and see the movie to see if you can relate to it a little more than I did.",Her
132,Danusha_Goska,So Bad It Strains Language to Describe. But Casey Storm's Costumes Show Creativity,1,12 January 2014,"""Her"" 2013 is so bad communicating how bad it is strains my abilities as a reviewer. Sometimes we say, ""If you've seen the trailer, you've seen the best bits of the movie."" With ""Her,"" if you've seen the movie's poster, you've seen the movie. ""Her"" consists of shots of Joaquin Phoenix's face as he talks to ""Samantha,"" the operating system of his computer, and Samantha, voiced by Scarlett Johansson, responds. Theodore (Phoenix) is a mopey guy. His marriage failed. He is lonely. He plays video games but appears to have no other interest or activity. His computer's new operating system has a sexy voice. He has a relationship with this voice. The relationship consists of him chatting with the computer about how sad and lonely he feels and how he wishes he were in love and in a relationship. Theodore reminisces about his marriage. In flashbacks, he is shown cavorting and scampering with his picture- perfect, and much younger, ex-wife as if they were the models in an ad for Viagra or feminine protection. Theodore occasionally chats with real life people, including neighbor Amy Adams, a fine actress who is criminally underused – at the very least dress her in some jodhpurs! And that's it. Nothing else happens. The movie is inert. It sits on the screen like a boring houseguest who won't leave and who refuses to do anything excitingly offensive enough for his host to phone the police and have him thrown out. Nothing funny or challenging or profound or original or intriguing or witty or daring is said or done. There's no development of the idea. The movie's end could just as well have been the movie's middle or even its beginning. There is so much inept nothing up on the screen I'm astounded that this movie was even released. It genuinely frightens me that the scriptwriter and the director are convinced that they created something worthy of viewers' time. Hubris at this level should be actionable in a court of law. There is one thing – and one thing only – in ""Her"" that shows some creativity, intelligence and originality and sparks some interest. ""Her"" is meant to be set in the not-too-distant future. Casey Storm, ""Her""'s costume designer, avoids the temptation to create futuristic costumes such as are found in Flash Gordon, Star Trek, or Star Wars. No one wears wings or anything metallic. Everyone dresses as if they shop at Salvation Army and purchase the most drab, frumpy clothes available. Collars are narrow. Pants are high-waisted. Color combinations are soporific. Theodore wears a lot of pumpkin orange. The clothes are just bad enough to be entirely believable as a fashion trend.",Her
133,jrarichards,"Certainly a worthwhile piece of reflective sci fi, though hard to say quite why!",9,24 June 2017,"Spike Jonze's 2013 movie ""Her"" hit the headlines when it successfully chimed with the inner desires of about a quarter of the planet by allowing its hero character Theodore Twombly (played with aplomb by Joaquin Phoenix) to reach some kind of highly-intimate climactic state in bed, with the eponymous ""Her"", i.e. Samantha, as played - or rather voiced - by Scarlett Johansson. And this short fragment is certainly the film's highlight, an erotic enough experience, but also a moment of joy and sweetness, in that it represents the culmination of a first phase in which the personable, intelligent, super-competent but highly-inexperienced Samantha pursues her self-awareness, and gets an ever-clearer version of her needs, in the close company of Phoenix's world-weary (and remarkably Leonard Hofstadter-like) Twombly.The elephant in this room, and doubtless no secret even among those who have not yet seen the film, is that Samantha is an AI construct, a so-called OS1 operating system whose primary original task - of sorting out Twombly's life on the organisational side - brings out the need for romantic love buried inside him, if obscured by lingering warm-cum-bitter feelings for his beautiful,near-perfect childhood sweetheart and later bride Catherine (played by Rooney Mara). Theodore's real-life relationship with Catherine had everything going for it (so much so indeed that neither spouse is particularly keen to move on to the concrete step of divorce), yet it just didn't work out, and the two end up annoying each other more and more, in spite of the love and compatibility. This is, let's face it, an all-too-familiar real-life circumstance, and one that all of us would benefit from analysing and understanding better.Samantha, in turn, ticks Theodore's boxes because she is calm, attentive, caring, helpful, non-pushy, curious, witty, warm and kind. She's there when needed, but not all the time. Perhaps, then, it's all just a bit too convenient? But it's also an increasingly popular option, as the film makes clear as people in general get their OS1s, while the marriage of close friends of Theodore's also succumb to the attendant temptations.This is then a world slightly into the future, but doing nothing more than exaggerating tendencies we already see. Automation and robotisation seem to have taken away quite a few old-fashioned jobs, so Theodore's circles are in design and media, and - crucially enough for the film - he himself is in the hit profession of writing skillful letters in line with client instructions that help with the (fake) perfecting of interpersonal relationships of various different kinds. Theodore is of course adept at his job, thinking through the most perfect ways of pleasing letter-recipients. At the same time, he is everyman and no man, neither exactly young nor old, not ugly or very handsome, doing little between work and home, living mostly in a nostalgic past but also succumbing to shallow temptations of instant erotic online gratification with others that his world has brought to (sometimes perverted) perfection, but which our world is already experiencing in more primitive form.This all gives the watcher a great deal to think about, and it is highly likely that the mind-content in the hours and days that follow the film will actually be RICHER than that on offer in the film itself.Nevertheless, the above description is by no means the end of what's on offer here as - needless to say - our ""Lucy""-like Scarlett goes on growing. At this point, I will hold off with the spoilers (notwithstanding the warning above), but suffice it to say that the ever-glass-half-empty Theodore can't really stay fully happy in the face of Samantha's aforesaid mix of ever-growing intelligence and awareness and non-corporeality.Perhaps his heart was always going to be broken (again)? Perhaps everybody's would be in the same circumstances? Perhaps he could and should have made his marriage work? Perhaps he should opt for another real-life woman in the shape of the neighbour and friend, now estranged from her husband - or even a blind date played by Olivia Wilde that he is content to reject! These are just a few of the many questions the film asks, before bringing us to a one-way-street ending that is left a bit ambiguous, but actually seems clear-cut enough...Apart from at the one aforesaid moment when other, more base emotions take hold, ""Her"" is basically a poignant and sad film, of mixed - perhaps even confused - message. What I took out of it most was something worth taking, I believe, that most of us have relationships that DID NOT appear by chance and that probably have sifted through a large number of suitability/compatibility filters before we even meet, let alone get together. Hence, to be brutally honest, the chances of us finding something (long-term) better if we ditch (or let die a slow death) what we've got are small indeed. Fantasy is just great, beguilingly perfect, but in the end it is just that, and probably it leaves us more alone than ever, if we embrace it.",Her
134,bryank-04844,It's truly remarkable.,9,22 August 2015,"Usually, the month of January is reserved for films that tend to fall below the less than average category, and are almost always immediately forgettable and tend to leave a bad taste in your mouth like a caramel onion. However, with Spike Jonze's original and fresh tale on the age old story of finding love in the most unlikely place, 'Her' might be the one of the best films not only to be released in January, but in the last few years. I have no doubt that this beautiful and smart film will win tons of awards as well as make a decent sized dent at the box office by word-of-mouth.'Her' could take place next week if needs to, as we are set in the not so distant future where more and more people are living in luxury high rises, and having all of their information brought to them in the form of a tiny computer no bigger than a credit card with one hell of an operating system. The film follows Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix), a good man who is recently divorced and can't muster up the energy or courage to ask anyone out since his breakup. But that doesn't stop him from performing well at work or spending time with his friends. He's a jolly guy, but deep down he is very lonely, as he sits in his colorful apartment alone playing a virtual reality video game with a foul-mouthed character.He purchases a new operating system, which is billed as having a great artificial intelligence chip added. Once he installs this into his computer and picks a female voice (Scarlett Johansson, AWESOME), it's as if he is talking to a real live person who is by his side at all times. Not to mention this operation system who now goes by Samantha, knows everything about Theodore and begins to know what he needs, loves, and hates. And in our time of people falling in love with their electronics and people spending their spare time on a computer by themselves, rather than with other humans, it's not so difficult to see how one very alive man can fall for an electronic voice, especially someone who is very lonely.Jonze answers most questions we would have about this not-so-far-off future and the ins and outs of having a serious relationship with a computer. Such examples are, How do they have sex? Another one might be, Is this operating system in love with anyone else, as I'd assume other people have bought this operating system? Can Samantha see and hear Theodore at all times? The way Jonze shows the answers to these questions is brilliant. It's a true love story with a different outcome than you'd expect. 'Her' touches on all the emotions, while Samantha begins to experience the same. And Theodore is his own worst enemy and tries his best to not let his past or his depression get in the way of something great.Phoenix does an incredible job as Theodore, as from the moment we meet him, we instantly like him. His mannerisms, his easy-going attitude, wit, and charm go a long way here, and we can't help but root for the guy. I'd want him as a friend. And Johansson is flawless here, but we never see her, but only hear her voice. Now, I wouldn't be surprised if Johansson got an acting award for her voice work here, as it is the best I've ever seen and heard. Her delivery will make you think she is actually there in the room, experiencing every feeling. It's truly remarkable.'Her' is no doubt going to be in the TOP 5 films of 2014 for me, although this is slated for the 2013 Oscar race. Run, don't walk to see 'Her'.",Her

136,jdkraus,"Not only a wonderful film, but one that makes us reflect upon ourselves...",10,13 January 2014,"As strange as Spike Jonze's movies may be, ""Her"" is the most personal film he has ever made. It explores a very well-known topic in a unique style and setting. Taking place in the not so distant future, writer Theodore Twombly (Joaquin Phoenix) finds himself in a life that has no purpose. He wanders each day in a trance, reading out letters at his job and recalling loving memories of his soon-to-be ex-wife (Rooney Mara). He buys himself an advanced operating system who later goes by the name 'Samantha' (Scarlett Johansen). The two develop a romantic relationship. The premise of the movie is very out there, and probably the average moviegoer may see the previews as dumb and pretentious. Fortunately, the movie is not so weird as to be blatantly stupid. Instead, there is very strong subtexts and deeper meanings that make the feature very thought provoking and enjoyable. Spike Jonze does throw in satirical bits on society's obsession with social media, video games, and even sexual vulgarity. Beneath all that, he gives us very complex and well-written characters that many of us can relate to--especially ones who are currently going through divorces and break ups. The irony that plays so beautifully in 'Her' is that people seek devices, like email, Facebook, and online dating sites to engage in friendships, yet we are never really there with those people. Our relationships, if we dare call them that, is nothing more than a computer that we preserve as viable. Watching Twombly follow a similar path with his OS (as millions do today) is not only intriguing, but it is a reflection of ourselves in terms of isolation and compulsions towards media. ""Her"" is simply a wonderful film with great performances. Joaquin Phoenix once again transforms himself into his character as the introverted Theodore. He is a guy to care for, understand, and even relatable. Scarlett Johansen, whom I never really thought much as an actress, does a stand-up job as the voice of Samantha. I never would have imagined her deep, sultry voice would make such a fun character. The other supporting cast members do well, however, it is Joaquin and Johansen who carry the film. The muted color scheme and cubic set designs add the flare of a futuristic society and the CGI when used is impressive. The music by Arcade Fire is another good, emotional touch to an otherwise great movie. The ending may leave a bad aftertaste for some people and the film drags on occasion, but neither of these are a real hindrance. The golden globe that Spike Jonze won was well earned. I hope he goes on to win the WGA and the Oscar for what he has done with this film. Fingers crossed, let's hope Joaquin Phoenix gets another academy award nomination.",Her

However, it's between a lonely heartbroken man and an AI. Their conversations felt so real as I hang on their every word throughout the movie. I laughed, felt happy, sad, and overwhelmed going through their lives.There's also an intellectual level to the movie about love. In Interstellar, love transcends space and time. Similarly, in Her, love is not physical. Instead, it's an emotion that can take many shapes and between anything. The movie also addressed the modern age people who often feel lonely, anxious, and insecure about their emotions. The characters had to sort out their emotions, decided what they want, and through the relationship they grew.Of course, the perfect acting from Joaquin Phoenix and Scarlet Johansson made the relationship in the movie even more real. Johansson, even though not physically present, showed great human presence and emotion.Overall, it's a powerful testament of love and romance. 9.5/10.",Her

Has its moments, but is an overall pretentious outing despite some of its good points on love and emotions in a world that has an ever-growing connection to technology. The overall downfall is Phoenix as a very awkward man in a very unusual relationship—this may have been the intention in order to establish the believability of someone who would fall in love with an operating system, but it ultimately distances the audience even further from the reality that it attempts to build.

139,vostf,Yet another fancy gimmick,3,22 April 2014,"I was curious about Her, as much as I was curious about Being John Malkovich exactly 14 years ago. Both are gimmick movies: they start with a clever idea and try to elaborate with more or less creativity and lightness.The problem when you start with a clever idea is that you have to create the visuals to match, the inner rhythm to dispatch the concentrate subtext. In all these respects Her looks like a bland near-dystopian experience.The basic idea of having a man fall in love with an OS is clever, but it is a writer's idea. On screen images can't but leaden-limb the original idea - provided it had legs in the first place. And the best actors in the world can only act what a movie is supposed to be or is potentially about.Pretty soon it feels vain: a depressed loner, living a depressing lonely life, having an epiphany when he installs the promising AI OS? When did so-called independent film-makers decide boring was cool? It really looks like a contemporary Art Hack: ""Let's mix a lonely boring character and a lonely clever idea!"" A first I thought: ""A writer as main character? Yet again?"" but soon enough I was relieved to see that it was only a web-era chained-gang writer. And that was the beginning and the end of good surprises.",Her
140,RJBurke1942,Where we discover a new meaning for Love Thy Neighbor ... maybe.,8,28 March 2015,"This movie is billed as a drama, romance and sci-fi. It's more than that, however: it's a considered peek at part of the real, probable future of the man-machine nexus this century.That theme is encapsulated within the drama of a guy, Theodore (Phoenix), an employee of a company which specializes in composing personal letters for the masses (who are apparently too busy or lazy to do it themselves). During the course of his work, Theo installs a new artificial intelligence operating system on his home computer. And while having his first conversation with the software (voice provided by Johansson), the name of Samantha - shortened to Sam - is chosen.Thereafter, the story is a leisurely-paced talk-fest between Theo and Sam as they explore each other's mind - and body, so to speak. As inter-dependency between them grows, the software gradually develops emotions and feelings which become increasingly human-like. So much so, and despite fundamental difficulties, they fall in love - whatever that means - with each other. As we know, humans are well known for 'falling in love' with their machines; so, it's not much of a stretch to entertain such entertainment. But therein lies the thrust of this story, bleakly exposed with box- cutter clarity when we see Theo - desperate and distraught because Sam is not answering his call - while he sits, bewildered, on a busy subway stairway as commuters mill about and pass him, oblivious to Theo's visible angst. Why? Because they're all - each and everyone - too busy to even watch where they're going as they continue, heads down, to converse with their hand-held machine companions. Love thy neighbor morphs finally into love thy machine as thyself. (Can't help but recall a real-life video clip I saw, of a smartphone-engrossed young person who walked into a water fountain to fall in: phone, bag and body. The person wasn't hurt but it was hilarious to watch.)Phoenix provides another bravura performance - which mirrors the excesses of current rampant technological dependency - while he's also working through a highly stressful marital divorce from his human wife, Catherine (Mara). Happily for Theo, a nearby neighbor, Amy (Adams) provides emotional support when he truly needs it. Just how this emotional mix all eventually works out I'll leave you to see. From my perspective, it's positive overall, although the closing scene is glaringly Hollywoody - no pun intended. If you've seen The Last of the Mohicans (1992), you'll recall that final scene, as comparison.The best piece, though, is left for Sam; and with perfect irony. While 'dating' Theo, Sam is also dallying with, hmmm, faaaaar too many other humans and other operating systems (you'll find out the total when you see it). As a sub-plot, it's a stroke of ironic genius from writer/director Jonze. On reflection, maybe it's just what Theo deserves, though: a wake-up call from a metaphorical water fountain. You be the judge....Yeah, I reckon I'll give this eight out of ten - mainly for the acting and delicious irony. Recommended for all. March 28, 2015",Her
141,Likes_Ninjas90,Who would have predicted that one of the more aching screen romances in recent years would be between a man and his computer?,8,8 January 2014,"The science-fiction genre in Hollywood has for some time amounted to little more than action films that happen to be set in the future and feature high-powered armaments. After Star Wars and more recently Avatar, there has been a tendency to build computer generated worlds but only fill them with aliens and laser guns. Science fiction films where technology and special effects are used to explore human behaviour and make sociopolitical comments about the present and the future are becoming increasingly scarce. Fortunately, director Spike Jonze (creator of oddball favourites Being John Malkovich and Adaptation) has made a science-fiction film that is partly a glimpse into the future of advanced computer software, a current day look at our over-reliance on technology and also the unlikeliest of love stories. Who would have predicted that one of the more aching screen romances in recent years would be between a man and his computer? What is more frightening about the premise is that you come to believe and be touched by it. The film is set in the distant future of Los Angeles, with Joaquin Phoenix cast as Theodore, a shy writer whose profession is to produce love letters for other people. He is detached from the world because of a painful breakup from Catherine (Rooney Mara). He still has some joy from seeing his college friend Amy (Amy Adams, pivotal in a subplot), who has her own dysfunctional relationship. His life takes a bizarre turn when he is introduced to Samantha (voiced by Scarlett Johansson), a highly sophisticated, verbalised operating system, put together from the DNA of her creators. She is described as a consciousness, able to think and feel on her own, gaining new experiences by herself and through what Theodore sees. She is carried with him in a portable device, like a smart phone, and together they fall in love. Jonze completes the extraordinary tasks of avoiding the most obvious movie clichés and pitfalls that could come with this utterly bizarre concept. The film succeeds as a human drama because the director finds the right tone. It's sometimes hilarious (how could it not be?) but the mood is mostly melancholic and dream-like because no one here is playing this as an extended joke. This is a sad world where characters, including Samantha, are craving human connection and longing for new experiences and emotions. The dramatic conflict is real because as Samantha begins thinking and feeling for herself, and grows closer to Theodore, he begins making the same judgments and pedantic criticisms of her that affected his previous relationship.Hollywood's exploration of man's relationship with computers, from HAL 9000 in 2001: A Space Odyssey to The Terminator, has mostly revolved around their destruction of us. Jonze aims higher, attempting to answer challenging philosophical question relating to epistemology and existence. When machines are capable of thinking, feeling and learning does that knowledge stop them being robotic and draw them closer to true humanity? Contrastingly, as humans grow further away from each other and become more reliant on technology, will we forget personal uniqueness and that people's desires are different from our own? On top of its plethora of ideas, we take the film seriously because the actors do too. Joaquin Phoenix's performance in this film is subtle and challenging. The long duration of unbroken close-up shots on his face provides time for him to embody the shifting emotions of joy and anxiety that a relationship can place on a person. The close-ups also infer that humanity and individuality is defined not merely by knowledge but our own unique faces that define us within our species. Scarlett Johansson, who replaced all of Samantha Morton's original voice work, makes a strong case for Oscar nominated voice acting. With her singing background, she knows how to alter the pitch of her voice, infusing it with both humour and emotion. Her disembodied presence becomes charming and sad, rating as some of the best work the actress has ever done. The film's visual compositions are also an expression of social detachment. Los Angeles is this film reminded me of China with its high rise buildings covered in a grey, overhead smog, which hints at the power corporations have in the future. To express Theodore's isolation, his apartment looks partly cold but also modern, with its metal and glass surfaces. It is old and new, reflective of his psychological inability to move forward from his personal mistakes, despite all the technological advances around him. Similarly, in the film's production notes it states that his clothes were designed with a 1920, 30s and 40s look. The retro costume stylising, combined with a wide angle lens as Theodore walks outdoors talking to Samantha, further suggests his segregation from genuine human emotions in the present day. It is worth noting that in 2003 Scarlett Johansson starred in Sofia Coppola's film Lost in Translation, where a character was rumoured to be based on Spike Jonze because he used to be married to the director. Like that film, this is a story about a character that is fractured and hurt by one relationship and faces the impossible task of fulfilling that void with something that is inevitably unsustainable. The sincerity with how this beautiful, slightly long film is made, and the quality of the performances, are suggestive of a filmmaker who knows very personally what they are talking about.",Her

In my opinion the perfectly ordered mind of a computer would view the world, and learn in the way that any woman would if under the exact same conditions, and you know the whole nurture thing. Anyhow, this little slice of time that we are sharing in this movie is very well presented. The tech is so nice, everything is very new feeling, and has such a clean safe feeling around it all. But at the same time you can see the reason is that no one is in direct communication with anyone near them, though everyone seems busy, and happy in their private bubbles. We watch as the people just float around each other, and then things start to evolve in the way that they would, and quickly once they do. People can have love for music, and places, and thoughts, so why not an AI? Though once opened to the options are we humans enough for them? I really Enjoyed this movie, for all of the reasons that I have expressed, and would recommend it to anyone a little soft in the middle.

145,griffolyon12,You'll Never Look at Siri the Same Way Again,9,21 January 2014,"Writer/director Spike Jonze is a genuine original, and his newest film, Her, is unlike any other film you'll ever see. While many have jokingly called the film, ""Siri: The Movie,"" that statement isn't that far off from what the film is. Her tells the story of Theodore, a lonely man who's recently divorced, who finds a special connection with the AI operating system named Samantha on his phone and computer. What follows is one of the most unique romance films the cinema has ever seen. Long distance relationships are hard, but how do you even have a relationship when one person doesn't even have a body? It's these questions that are at the forefront of this film, and Spike Jonze manages to micro-analyze the ideas of love and what true love means through the lens of this story.Joaquin Phoenix has the unenviable task of portraying Theodore, who spends more than half of the film acting with thin air. For this performance to be as emotionally honest and sincere as it is, it took tons of imagination on Phoenix's behalf and he knocks the role out of the park. In many ways, it's a shame he's not nominated for the Best Actor Oscar. As for the voice of Samantha, actress Scarlett Johansson delivers a soulful performance that manages to bring this artificial voice to life, so that we actually care about her, the same as Theodore does.Spike Jonze manages to keep the film engaging for most of its two hour runtime, by and large thanks to Phoenix and Johansson, but Her does kind of get stuck in a bit of a loop around the hour mark. It kind of feels like the film could have said everything it needed to say in an hour and a half, rather than in two hours, with many scenes often feeling like retreads of scenes that occurred thirty minutes before. While this film is thematically rich and needs time to explore these themes, the impact of the thematic ideas can often not be as strong if drawn out, and that's what happens here. Even with that all said, Spike Jonze's words and retro-Hipster vision of the near future are so sensational you're willing to forgive a little indulgence. Personally, I love the way video games are in a few years, but the high-waisted pants? No thanks.I give Her a 9 out of 10!",Her

147,cardsrock,A beautiful meditation on modern relationships,9,24 February 2020,"This is the type of cinema that pushes the medium forward in innovative ways. Spike Jonze really outdid himself with this brilliant look at what a relationship means and what it can be. Joaquin Phoenix is superb as expected and Scarlett Johansson's voice is truly a character unto itself. The use of colors, music, and such an original screenplay make Her a must-watch for any cinephile.",Her

Looks like the director has predicted the future precisely as it looks like it's going to be a very obvious one where people would be dating AI like Siri or Alexa instead of the real human beings and the AI is going to have heterosexual relationship aka with everybody all around us, ha, the future is going to be crazy and this movie portrays it very well.",Her
149,ronakkotian,I will never forget how Her made me feel...,10,24 July 2020,"It's been a while since I've seen Her but so much of this film is still etched into my memory. It's a film that I'll never forget.Her follows Theodore, a writer, that falls in love with his operating system.Her does have a basic premise but it's a love story that tells so much and is so relatable. Spike Jonze is a very unique director and has directed wildly original films like Being John Malkovich and Adaptation. Whilst he did direct those two, the praise really went to Charlie Kaufman for his excellent writing. Her is Jonze's first ever solo writing credit and this film shows his capabilities as a writer and not just a director. The script is an absolute winner here as I don't think any film has made me go through so many emotions in a short amount of time.The character of Theodore is someone a lot of people can relate to. We all long to have a strong connection with someone and be able to interact with other people. It's a struggle that a lot people go through and Jonze's representation of that struggle and loneliness is extremely well executed. The cinematography of the futuristic world in this film is beautiful. I loved how you are able to see how many people are glued to their gadgets. It's something that we tend to witness in the real world allowing the world of Her to feel largely realistic.The performances are absolutely brilliant. Joaquin Phoenix once again gives an excellent performances that's very heartfelt and will stick with you long after the film's done. Scarlett Johansson's voice work is astounding. Some of the best voice work I've heard in a film. Rooney Mara and Amy Adams are terrific as usual despite their shorter roles.Her is a very special film to me. It tells a story that takes you on a rollercoaster of emotions and explores feelings and love like no other film has. I cannot recall the last time a film has been able to make me tear up so much at the end and leave me days thinking about it. Her is Spike Jonze's masterpiece.",Her
150,braddugg,Lover or loner this will suffice the needs of both.,8,23 August 2014,"A heart touching love story where the girl is not to be seen, only heard. It's music to ears. Lover or loner this will suffice the needs of both.Though I watched this film as a download earlier with the fear that it may not release, I was supremely happy to see it release and watched it alone amidst lovers. Was wondering if there can be a better date than such a romantic movie on a full moon night.I am a loner and a happy one,Now, as I say I am a loner, I have 3 indeed 4 women to make love with, that's Movies, Music and Books added with my Camera. I am happy coz these do not expect anything back from me and just keep giving me joys. Expectations are the root cause of most disappointments and thankfully I have been less subjected to them. Companionship brings joys for sure but if it does not go well life is ruined miserably. However strong a company maybe through phone or chatting, unless it becomes physical and culminates organically, it is vulnerable and there is fear of falling apart too. So just let me rephrase what I said, I am a lover and a happy one too and yet I go through a fear of falling apart. Companionship is a prime most desire of any human being and after a certain age most humans desire a companion who can satisfy the physical desires. Spike Jonze is the first person, I would like to speak about in my review. And this not for his direction but for his screenplay. He wrote a script himself and has used wonderful scenes to make it interesting. Theodre Twombly the character played superbly by Joaquin Phoenix is a character who is seeking company in his life. He gets Samantha (voice of Scarlett Johansson), an advanced operating system that is artificially intelligent, as his company. Their relationship hits all the right notes and blossoms beautifully. I must say just for the voice of Scarlett Johannson, she must be given best voice over award. The fine nuances of emotions are expressed superbly in voice modulations.Shot superbly by Hoyte van Hoytema and put together wonderfully by 2 editors, this is beautiful, but the pace is a bit slow and it takes time to sink in.This is not a feel good film but is extremely romantic film. There a lot of romantic moments in the film but they are shot with Joaquin alone as there is only voice of the girl. I loved the dialogs between them and they are so connecting too. Most of us would have through such moments in relationship. A 4/5 for this, except being tad slow I am all for love and romance. Kudos to Spoke Jonze for perceiving it and then making it uncompromisingly with his own unique vision.",Her
151,cinematic_aficionado,Deals with a very real issue,8,15 April 2014,"Welcome to the (near) future. Relationships will be perfect, we will all find someone who is intelligent, responsive, available when and where we need them. So what if that someone is a computer?Theodore tries to overcome a nasty breakup and the arrival of a new highly sophisticated operating system in his computer meant he has finally found a new friend and since this friend had a sexy female voice soon our lonely character became quite enamoured. So what if she does not exist and he will never touch or see her?The movie deals with the undeniable human need for companionship and intimacy as well as how modern technology affects it. Sophisticated operating systems provide some sort of interaction but does it make it right? or even human?There were moments that I felt uncomfortable watching this due to observing a man so totally taken with, effectively, a machine. How can this be? He seems an intelligent enough person so how could he let himself get carried away with such fantasy?Performances, story and execution aside what made this movie brilliant is the fact that it deals with a very real issue. Online dating is on the up as more and more people meet this way and in countries like Japan, apparently, there is a decline in sexual interest by today's youth due to too much engagement with hi-tech gadgets.So this is one to watch, but more importantly contemplate upon.",Her
152,billygoat1071,Extraordinary Lovely,10,28 February 2014,"There is a palpable fact shown in Her: modern technology is amazing. The use for it is so absorbing, real connection to people has been reduced. And this condition has kept on going until the very future. The film handles an idea that is so ridiculous, it is actually true speaking towards to our society today. It is often lovely, but it never hides the awful reality of this beautiful addiction. Her smartly comprehends to what the virtual world has done to everyone in years, both positive and negative sides, which is indeed a thought-provoking thing to look at.The future it presents is a world that reminiscence the basic stuff, such as handwritten letters, as if they are timelessly special, while the innovations have become just ordinary, assuming that the rarity of the quality to everyday life is what makes one thing valuable. But that is just the background that anyone in the community hardly notices. The thing is, it's pretty strange that Samantha is a fantastically programmed operating system, of course she is an artificial intelligence, but her ridiculous amount of knowledge and abilities can come close to suspension of disbelief. Whoever has a problem with this is probably missing the point. The film's message is quite clear: love can happen anywhere, to anyone, and even to anything. It is depicted as sweet, until it slowly stumbles and finally realizes that there is no better relationship than the concrete interaction to people.The viewers might be engrossed by the exposition of how the advancements of technology is mostly used for social media and pleasures from boredom, but really, it's all about Theodore's relationship to his computer. They are the greatest example on how society has become, and what's brilliant here is how genuine their affections are, even if they urged to push the limits which is trying to actually touch each other. Those parts of attempting to surpass the impossible in their interaction may look absurd, but in truth, it really is one of the best ideas.It deliberately understands about what it feels having this weird kind of love story. Spike Jonze has created a context that seems peaceful, even if their emotions aren't. It's a stunning portrait. The performances make the emotions even more visible. Joaquin Phoenix effortlessly manifests Theodore Thwobly's boredom to his life and the joy with Samantha. Scarlett Johansson may not physically appeared, but she expresses the character's feelings wonderfully. It's quite down-to-earth for an A.I.This may sound silly, but Her is like a poem converted into a film that seems so hipster, yet it does have the words. The film is just so soulful, it's not always about technology, it's about how each person goes from their physical life to the virtual. It's an insane thing to explore, but it's also something that is worth thinking about. The relevance to this subject immediately makes it gripping, but the experience is spellbinding that results the overall film as extraordinary. The film's awareness and honest point of view to this context are already more than enough.",Her
153,Rickting,Weird and wonderful,10,16 November 2014,"Her is about a man who starts a relationship with his artificial operating system which is designed to meet his every need. I know, I know, but don't let that put you off. It may have the weirdest relationship in movie history, yet it's also one of the most touching and compelling I have seen. Despite the fact one of the people in the relationship isn't there and is just a computer, it's still a soulful, moving tale well deserving of the best picture nomination. Not something you'll see everyday, Her is a superb, moving, smart and at times hysterical science fiction drama. It will be a bit too bizarre for some and that's fine, but get past the weirdness and you're in for a treat. Visually, the film looks great and has a fascinating colour palette. Spike Jonze directs the film beautifully and his screenplay is downright phenomenal. It's funny, daring, moving and the dialogue is both magnetic and electrifying.The film couldn't have worked without Scarlett Johansson's amazing voice acting, which makes the relationship feel believable and moving. Joaquin Phoenix gives an excellent understated performance as the main character. It's never boring, although at times it's a bit uncomfortable so overall it was a film where I was more or less engaged every minute. It's a weird, surreal experience but one which both a moving study of loneliness and smart social commentary of modern technology. It's my favourite of the best picture nominees and likely to be the one people truly remember in future. I definitely want to see more Spike Jonze stuff and I feel it's a shame this is only his fourth film as he's clearly a very talented director. Her is a very clever and sophisticated drama, and you won't find anything else like this from 2013. A modern classic, and a strange, dazzling and unique trip that's absolutely worth taking.10/10",Her
154,rubenm,Love story with a gimmick,4,24 March 2014,"What if computer systems would become so smart that we can talk to them, rely on them, get attached to them and even love them? That is what this film is about. I expected an original and thought-provoking story with original angles - something that stimulates the mind. Instead, I saw a conventional, rather melodramatic love story with an extra gimmick: one of the lovers doesn't have a body. This is not a film about artificial intelligence, but about feelings. Theodore, the computer-owner, and Samantha, the operating system with a mind of her own, keep on talking about their feelings. How they are getting emotionally involved with each other. How she regrets not having a body. How he regrets not being able to touch her. How they have cyber sex (in spite of her not having a body). How he becomes distant when he realizes it's rather embarrassing to have a relationship with an operating system. How she becomes distant when she meets another operating system. How she 'betrays' him. And so on. This could have been a film about how we deal with artificial intelligence, with its opportunities, and its dangers. Instead, it's about how we deal with emotions. Samantha becomes so 'human', the only thing that reminds us about her being a software system is that we never see her. Only in the very beginning she says things like 'It took me 0,02 seconds to decide about my own name'. Later on, she talks just like a human being, so the aspect of her being a piece of artificial intelligence gets lost. It would be nice to know how artificially intelligent operating systems would change our society. Would they help criminals to commit the perfect crime? Would they change our educational system? Could they be helpful in eradicating poverty? Would they help novelists to write better novels? Would we need novelists at all? Would we need musicians? Architects? None of this in 'Her'. The only useful thing Samantha seems to do, apart from complaining about not having a body and telling Theodore she loves him, is find errors in Theodore's text, which is not very intelligent at all. Spell checkers are able to do that since God knows when. 'Her' could have been an intelligent film about how computers change the way we think and behave. But it turns out to be a rather conventional love story instead. I was disappointed. And I didn't have a Samantha to cheer me up.",Her
155,christophe92300,Almost a masterpiece,8,1 June 2014,"Right from the start, you are completely captivated by the futuristic atmosphere, the colourful tones, the high rise pants, and with an anti-conformist premise, perfectly staged and lead by a terrific Joaquin Phoenix, always great when it comes to embody an introverted, tormented character, you are thinking this is going to be a masterpiece.Unfortunately, you can only feel some frustration, even some disappointment because first, the movie a lot too long, the second hour seems endless, and second the scenario isn't fully developed, the plot ends quite abruptly and inconclusively which really is a shame considering what was offered before.Nevertheless, Her got off the beaten paths and that forces respect, but if Jonze had taken his idea to its conclusion and fully exploited this incredible potential, this would have been a masterpiece.",Her
156,TheSquiss,"Digital love, human emotion. Another 'Wow!' from one of Hollywood's most inventive directors.",8,3 March 2014,"In the not-too-distant future, Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix), a writer who earns his living composing heartfelt letters for other people, is alone, lonely, almost divorced from Catherine (Rooney Mara), and playing video games with characters that are abusive to him. Seduced by an impressive ad campaign, Theodore buys a new operating system, answers a few questions, selects a female voice and 'meets' Her.The Her in question is OS1, aka Samantha (Scarlett Johansson), but, as the commercial states, ""It's not just an operating system, it's a consciousness."" And so begins Theodore's and Samantha's relationship; a relationship that transcends that of computer and owner to become an affair of love and mutual understanding.Spike Jonze's (who also wrote the screenplay) fourth feature as director is an odd and slightly disturbing look at our need to replace reality with technology. Incapable of making genuine friends we boast of having hundreds of Facebook 'friends; at a loss for meaningful conversation we revel in the banality of Twitter and its 140 character restrictions. Now, incapable of finding true love and happy ever after, we create a substitute for love with binary. The shock with Her is not that humanity could fail so monumentally that it must resort to the digital version of a sex doll but that Jonze masterfully makes it seem perfectly reasonable and palatable.Her is perhaps the audio companion to the video of S1m0ne. Whereas Andrew Nichol's film gave us a movie star who was pure fantasy in physically form, Jonze has written a character that is seemingly real in everything but body. So advanced is the artificial intelligence that Samantha learns, suggests, leads and fully relates to Theodore. She is not merely a 'perfect' plaything that he controls completely and switches on and off at will, she has a mind of her own, a brain that hungers for touch and experiences, and she has a will as forceful as any human partner's.Her looks at the cycle of relationships and asks us questions about ourselves, our hopes and our expectations. It is at times uncomfortable viewing as it forces us to look at how we deal with our emotions, how we react to those of our partners and what we invest in our personal relationships. Like Lars and the Real Girl, Her presents the issue as a actuality rather than an issue that we can dismiss as pure fantasy, and that is why it is uncomfortable viewing. Would you go there? How would you handle it if your friend introduced you to his new girlfriend and she turned out to be a voice on a computer? Jonze cleverly balances the desirable futuristic advances with frightening possibilities while avoiding the obvious route of prejudice and judgment from others. Theodore's friend, Amy (Amy Adams), doesn't just tolerate his 'relationship', she supports it, understands it and embraces it to the point of going on a double date with the happy couple.Phoenix gives another sensitive performance that allows us to care about and invest our time in Theodore. It's not that Theodore is a hero of the modern age, it's that, like us, or people we know, he has seen the flaw in his emotional life and advanced beyond Internet or speed dating and found an instant solution without the trauma of introductions and clumsy invitations to dance. It is a performance that very quickly dissolves the natural questions we have of ""But how do they?"" and replaces them with ""Would I?"" Johansson's performance, though not as naturalistic as the girl next door Samantha initially sets out to be, yet again raises the question asked with Robin Williams' Aladdin and repeated most recently with Andy Serkis' Gollum: When is the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences finally going to create new Oscar category for Best Vocal Performance? I'm not saying, on the strength of Her, that she would deserve to win it, but it is just the latest, convincing performance from an actor who doesn't have the luxury of body or facial expressions to hide behind.With a wonderful score from Arcade Fire to compliment the emotional battle upon the screen, Her is yet another fine achievement from one of the most original and inventive writer/directors working in Hollywood today. Yes, it's probably a 'niche' film, but this niche is deep enough to hold an awful lot admirers. Take a punt and join me in it.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",Her
157,RevRonster,Absolutely amazing...,10,14 May 2014,"While initially interested in seeing this film after hearing it was about a guy falling in love with an operating system, I couldn't help but feel that this film could easily fall off the razor's edge and look like something Adam Sandler would make. However, with Spike Jonze at the helm, such a horror would never occur but there was still a risk this one-of-a-kind film had to take and that risk paid off big time because this movie is incredible.Spike Jonze not only wrote an interesting story that was a compelling look at our modern relationships and dependency on technology but he presented it in a way that was a visual feast and absolutely beautiful to take in. And when you combine the great story and wonderful visuals with the awesomely-amazing acting from Joaquin Phoenix and Scarlett Johansson, the ending result was a film that was incredible beyond words. Seriously, the acting really has to be mentioned twice because when you realize that, essentially, ScarJo is just a voice and Phoenix is pretty much doing one long extended phone bit and they both are capable of bringing real, honest and true-looking emotion to the screen is, without a doubt, a wonder to behold. ""Her"" is capable of being interesting, beautiful, emotional and heartbreaking all at the same time and really took the love story into a direction never before seen. I was completely enthralled with it and just blown away by the film's delivery. Just a fantastic movie.Hello there!

158,andrewroy-04316,"Despite great characters and near-future setting, Her doesn't quite land emotionally",7,2 August 2018,"Her is a smart movie with great performances across the board, led by Phoenix who truly gives many layers to Theodore. Her asks difficult, large questions about love, similarly to Ex Machina and Black Mirror's Be Right Back. As much fun as it is to consider, I would argue it's more of a romance and a character study than a sci-fi film. The characters are all realistic and the cast is excellent, but the emotional attachment at the end with Theodore losing Samantha just didn't land for me. It felt that it was more Theodore trying to understand himself and using Samantha to help himself do that and feel positive than a true relationship. The film looks beautiful and the lighting contrasts were gorgeous from scene to scene, and I thought the script was very good, but the progression of events kept me from being really drawn in. I can understand why many love it and think it's a valuable film to watch, but not a unique experience for me emotionally.",Her
159,cultfilmfreaksdotcom,Worse Than A Virus,1,27 December 2013,"Back when THE TWILIGHT ZONE episode TO AGNES WITH LOVE showed antisocial, lust- burdened geek Wally Cox falling hard for his female-voiced computer, it probably seemed pretty bizarre since office-sized computers weren't exactly a commodity...Skip to the early eighties with the obscure movie ELECTRIC DREAMS: since PC's had barely taken off, it was downright extraordinary that a talking computer would behave in a humanly if diabolical fashion...But the last twenty years with Internet chat rooms, social networks, dating websites and the navigating Siri herself, having a physically benign relationship via machine isn't entirely far-fetched. And in the near-future world, brought to life by writer/director Spike Jonze, it's an all too normal occurrence.Joaquin Phoenix plays Theodore, a lonely writer working at a job perfectly suited for quirky art-house fare: writing actual letters for other people by speaking into a computer. But things happen after Theodore gets home. Brooding through a divorce, he downloads a brand new operating system, OS1, which includes the girl of his dreams, Samantha, a computer taking care of just about every task, voiced by a soothingly silky-toned Scarlett Johansson.The setup is intriguing. Theodore and Samantha get to know each other as he ventures outside and, with a camera in his phone and hearing her voice from an earpiece, she can view the real world: from outdoor malls to beaches to the wilderness, Samantha experiences life while not only saying the right things things but singing and composing music to fit each location and mood. An intriguing premise is hindered by the relationship seeming way too normal – to Theodore and just about everyone else. Since he admits outright to having a personal relationship with an OS, there's no mystery or guilt involved with such a unique concept. Not only that but Phoenix, no stranger to intense/bizarre characters, isn't given a chance to shine in his usual askew light. And the sappy, downright embarrassing scenes where Theodore and Samantha confess their mutual adoration is like overhearing a smitten couple whispering sweet nothings, making the audience a third wheel which ultimately goes flat. Perhaps if, like 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, Samantha got real dirty we'd have a relationship worth the experience. FATAL ATTRACTION goes viral would beat this searing hipster flick with more naval-gazing theme than plot line. Although there is one particular ""baby alien"" on Theodore's virtual realty game console that, like the sassy, foul-mouthed teddy bear TED, would have made a much more unpredictable, entertaining sidekick.",Her

The music score fits really well, have a relaxing effect and combined with the smooth voice of Scarlett Johansson for the operating system it's just perfect.It is a slow paced movie, that really speaks to all senses (well not smell), it is thought provoking and a quit real possibility in the not so distant future. Very nice acting by Joaquin Phoenix, smooth voice by Scarlett Johansson and really nice directing by Spike Jonze.Entertaining, fun, strange, futuristic, special, some of the words that can be used about it.",Her
162,CinematicInceptions,Exceptional and Emotional.,8,11 July 2018,"I did not expect a movie like this to have perhaps the most believable vision of the near future I've seen. The look of the world wasn't all techy and white like you usually see in futuristic movies, and instead looked pleasantly tasteful and bright. The technology seemed like a natural evolution of the tech we use now, although the real future will probably have more Apple and Amazon logos. Even Theodore's job of writing personal letters for people felt, sadly, like the future version of buying Hallmark cards for people to ""show you care"".But of course, the most notable aspect of this movie is the idea that someone could develop an intimate relationship with an AI. I doubt that this kind of thing would be the first implementation of AI if we were to ever create that kind of technology. However, I think this interpretation of AI might be as scary as those of Westworld, Ex Machina, or Blade Runner. Creating an AI that is tailor made to you feels like it would be the last nail in the coffin of people not interacting with each other. Despite all the arguments that social media is not actually that social, at least it involves people interacting with other people instead of robots. But at the same time, it can't be denied that Theodore and Samantha's relationship is a real relationship and is even more pure in some ways because it is based solely on their interactions with each other. I don't quite understand how people started dating other people's OS's, but it was not surprising that Theodore was one of many people that had an OS as a significant other.In terms of execution, I think this could have won best picture and definitely deserved its win in Best Original Screenplay. Joaquin Phoenix gave an excellent performance of a deep character, and Scarlett Johannsen did a good job on her voice over. The minor parts were pretty impressive as well with Chris Pratt, Rooney Mara, and especially Amy Adams. Spike Jonze did a fabulous job directing as well, and I'm definitely interested to see his other movies now.The sci-fi and romance genres are not often mixed for obvious reasons, but their combination has resulted in what I qualify to be just short of a masterpiece. I don't think that any other movies should try doing what Her did, but maybe it should encourage other artists to mix genres in effective ways more often. Shape of Water is the closest thing to an imitator that this movie has, which is not to say that it was a rip-off but it could be argued that it rode Her's coattails a bit. I would recommend this to everyone. It won't be most people's favorite movie, but I can't imagine anyone not liking it. If you like movies that make you cry, this will make you happy-cry and sad-cry in equal measure. Seriously, everyone should see this movie. Overall Rating: 8/10.",Her
163,ClaytonDavis,Just about the best thing you can see in 2013...,10,12 October 2013,"Talk about closing with a bang. Spike Jonze's long-awaited original film about a writer that falls in love with his operating system is not only the best film to play at this year's New York Film Festival; it very well could be the very best film of the year. ""Her"" is the finest writing and directorial endeavor of Spike Jonze's career. And then there's the towering and crowning work of Academy Award nominee Joaquin Phoenix who proves once again, he's the finest actor working today, hands down. You can't find a more dynamic and compelling story about the human connection and where we're headed as a society.When ""Her"" opens up, it snaps you immediately into the story. Phoenix plays Theodore, a writer for a website that makes letters for just about anyone. As he tries to find life during the midst of his divorce from his wife Catherine (played by a beautiful Rooney Mara), Theodore finds solace in a friendship with a new OS (operating system) named Samantha (voiced by Scarlett Johansson). The two develop a relationship in a world where OS's are becoming the norm with society.Jonze's has never been the conventional director as we've seen in his other brilliant efforts ""Being John Malkovich"" and ""Where the Wild Things Are."" Jonze sets out to tell a story and deliver all the intricate details for us to understand each character. His focus on Theodore, giving him a real sense of loneliness without falling into cliché character ticks and beats that we've seen countless times in other romantic films, Jonze constructs a real man living in a world where technology has taken precedent over human connection.Christopher Nolan should take notes from Jonze on the assembling of female counterparts in a story. Catherine and Theodore's friend Amy, played by the always dependable Amy Adams, both feel genuinely authentic. Mara, who's already delivered one other powerful performance in ""Ain't Them Bodies Saints"" earlier this year, is finely utilized. She shows once again that she's a true professional, with limited screen time (many in flashbacks); she can staple herself in your memory.Amy Adams is always the sprinkle on top in all of her films. As ""Amy,"" the awkward friend and neighbor who sympathizes more with Theodore more than she'd like to, Adams expertly executes. With four prior Oscar nominations to her credit, her stunning portrayal is just another fantastic pin to add to her credits. She could find traction during the awards season if the film hits in the right way. That's also part to the petty Oscar rules about rewarding voice performances because if that wasn't the case, Scarlett Johansson would be on stage holding an Oscar of her own next March. As ""Samantha,"" Johansson has never tapped into the essence of her abilities as an actress the way she does in ""Her."" As an OS, full of wonder and curiosity, ""Samantha"" is essentially a child. Learning at a rapid rate and studying the behaviors of the human mind, she looks at the world through the eyes of Theodore. Johansson holds our hand in through the tale, even when her voice isn't on screen. This is the type of work that could convince the Board of Governors to rethink the eligibility of an acting performance. This is a masterful work that I'll remember for years to come.And then there's Joaquin Phoenix...oh, Mr. Phoenix. Fresh off his historic performance in Paul Thomas Anderson's ""The Master"" just a year ago, I didn't think he could impress me so soon and yet here we are. His sensitive and perceptive take on the role is what films are all about. It's one of the best things that 2013 has offered and a performance that could land him his first Oscar. I think Phoenix himself was impressed with the work he and his colleagues have accomplished. At the press conference, he actually gave an answer to one of the questions from the audience. If anyone was in attendance at the conference for James Gray's ""The Immigrant"" - a prickly, disengaged Phoenix put on his sunglasses and put the microphone on the floor. This is a performance that you can identify with. He's not simply awkward for the sake of being, he has baggage and connection issues. There's sincerity in his words and mannerisms. A getaway in a cabin, alone but with ""Samantha"" encapsulates everything about Theodore. Phoenix achieves the impossible and is an instant Oscar contender.But ""Her"" isn't just about the writing and performances; it's an all- around technical marvel. Most notably the Production Design of K.K. Barrett, who has worked on ""Where the Wild Things Are."" Our story takes place in a futuristic (though never said how far ahead) Los Angeles and with shooting overseas, Barrett captures the clout of the city and its inside counterparts. Cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema's use of colors and smooth palettes are things of a dream.

164,J_Batek_II,"If My SmartPhone Operating System Breaks Up With Me, Can I Get A Refund?",7,18 June 2019,"This is a smart film from 2013 that explores 'future' social issues that are already present in Asia in 2019. The idea of 'A.I.-Human Love' is already fracturing society in Japan and Korea, as lonely young men turn to mobile apps, games, and animated dolls for companionship, rather than human women. I worry, as I type this review, that in another 6 years I may read this and find it dated. By 2025, there may be a significant part of society that will choose technology over human companionship. Who knows, maybe I will have a robot lover or an operating system that tries to have phone sex with me at night...Scarlett Johansson proves that she is one of the most sexy women on the planet by seducing Joaquin Phoenix (and every male audience member) with nothing but her voice. With every pause, every laugh, and every vocal inflection, Johansson pulls you further into moral 'grey areas' of love, technology, and self-consciousness. Scarlett's portrayal of 'Samantha' is the definition of a standout performance by an actress in a film.I enjoy thought-provoking movies. This film is meant to be discussed, argued about, and romanticized by groups of people over coffee or cocktails. And, maybe those conversations will help prepare some people for the future of human relationships and society.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

165,bbewnylorac,Interesting and original,7,22 February 2014,"While I wouldn't say I was moved by this film, it's still a great achievement by Spike Jonze, who wrote and directed it. Shanghai is an amazing and refreshing choice in which to film a city of the future, in which there are so many people around and every convenience at our fingertips, but human connection is still elusive. The film asks many questions such as: what is a relationship? And, if loving a computer is delusional, then aren't some human relationships also contrived and delusional? And unlikely to last? Theodore goes on a date early in the film with a beautiful (real) young woman, but she cuts it short, disappointed with a perceived slight he made, accusing him of not looking for a relationship. It's really unfair, and totally random as well -- she acts just like a computer. Theodore's friend, Amy, confesses that like Theodore, she has made a computer friend, and she asks him, isn't any joy OK? Isn't it still joy? Theodore gets immense joy from a little computer generated hologram in his computer game, who is funny and crude. Who's to say that that joy isn't real? And if Theodore's job is to write fake letters for people unable to express themselves, is that morally questionable? Is it a sign of society's disconnect from our emotions, or is it, in fact, a sign that people care about one another and want to connect?",Her
166,ethanbresnett,Remarkable!,9,24 December 2020,"Her is such a remarkable film because I never could have imagined myself getting so emotionally invested in a relationship between a human and an AI. It was a very strange feeling in truth, which I suppose was intentional and leaves one with some searching questions about the future of humanity's interaction with AI.This investment was in no small part due to the stunning performance from Scarlett Johansson. When thinking about the portrayal of AI in film/TV, the exceptional performance I always look to is Evan Rachel Wood in Westworld. Somehow, despite only being a voice, Scarlett managed to create just as magnificent a performance, making an artificial intelligence seem so real and so full of life and character. It really was incredible.As expected, Joaquin Phoenix was also incredible. I was so drawn into his performance, and was captivated from start to finish, hanging on his every word. The chemistry between him and Scarlett was so engrossing, which I really wasn't expecting considering they share no physical screen time.It was because of these two performances that the film worked so well. Despite raising some thought provoking questions and ideas about AI and the future, this isn't just for sci-fi fans. It holds up as a love story and romantic film with real emotional power and punch. I had to take a breath at the end to digest what I'd just watched and fully take it all in.I also adored the style of this film. Spike Jonze should be credited hugely for his direction, which was so stylish and set a spot on tone for the film. It was so broody, beautiful, arty, and sombre.An absolute triumph!",Her
167,moviemanMA,There doesn't seem to be anyone around,10,26 March 2014,"Spike Jonze's latest feature film Her tackles the subject of being alone. Joaquin Phoenix plays Theodore Twombly, a man separated from his wife who spends most of his time working, checking emails, playing video games, and talking to his computer. He is not the only person partaking in this ritual. The majority of the characters and extras in the film are talking to their ear pieces and interacting with their computers, or OS (operating system). Things change when OS-1 comes out, introducing the world's first artificially intelligent OS. Shortly thereafter we are introduced to Samantha (voiced by Scarlett Johnansson). This first encounter will forever change Theodore's life.What is so wonderful about Her is the world that Spike creates. It's a world exactly like ours. The key for me is how nonchalantly his characters use their tech. People walk around with tech sticking out of their ears, talking to themselves, and going about their business completely oblivious to what's happening around them. We have, ""interactions,"" and, ""connections,"" with other people through our devices. We walk past strangers who are using the same tech and having the same experience. We rely so much on these devices to go through day to day living.Spike ingeniously takes this obsession with tech and gives it a personality. Instead of talking to Siri about a new email, listening to music, or taking a picture (because you may never see a sunset again!!!), Theodore partakes in all of these rituals with Samantha. So he's not just listening to music. He's listening to a song Samantha picked out (or composed) just for him. He's not just taking a picture of a sunset. Instead he and Samantha can experience it with him. They converse about what they're doing instead of just mulling about aimlessly.By giving the tech a personality and the ability to think, it makes the experience of being alone not so lonely. Theodore and Samantha overcome many obstacles in their relationship, the first being that Samantha isn't just an OS. Samantha is, well, Samantha. A free thinking, super inquisitive mind that has wants and needs and can be happy and afraid all at once. It's brilliant how the outside world views their relationship. In short, it's perfectly okay to have this relationship. Not everyone agrees and those people who are hesitant cause some doubt to creep into Theodore's head, but don't all new technologies have people that oppose its use? Let's face it, 10 or 15 years ago the idea of meeting a person online seemed pretty ridiculous. Nowadays not only is it acceptable, it's become a primary alternative to meeting someone new.This near tangible relationship with a non tangible being is, at first glance, odd. There is a scene where Theodore can't find Samantha. His connection to the server isn't going through. He frantically searches for connectivity, like a parent looking for a lost child at Disney. We don't look at this as crazy. We can sympathize because we do the same thing, like when we search for free wifi or that elusive 4G bar we desperately need for a phone call. Heaven help us if for one minute we can't receive an update or check our email, for the alternative is...alone time...The inability to spend time by ourselves could be brought on by the pace at which we live our lives. Faster, stronger, newer, and bigger. Think of how long it took mankind to develop boats, then trains, planes, and rocket ships. Now think about how quickly we move today, both in physical and mental space. We are constantly, ""progressing,"" because our technology allows us to do so. So when we have a lull in activity, our minds start to wander, and that is not natural for today's standards. When Theodore can't connect to the server, he is left alone, and the thought of being alone scares the hell out of him.In the end that's what Theodore is looking for. In a way so is Samantha. We are constantly looking for distractions and a companion so we don't have to be alone. No matter how many friends, likes, retweets, pins, or subscribers we have, there is always that fear of being alone. I know this doesn't necessarily include everyone. There are people, fully functioning people, who don't require these needs, but for the most part, we can all agree that our world will never be the same because of our technology.The connections that matter most are not the ones made by circuits, microchips, and displays. They are made with each other. They are made by communicating face to face. They are made with our senses. They are made with our memories. Spike could have taken this film is a variety of directions, and the one he chose couldn't have made me happier. You should experience it on your own. You just might learn something about yourself.Tonight when I take the train home, I'll throw on my ear buds and play melancholy music, just like Theodore Twombly. I'll flick through my news feed or maybe take an Instagram of a cool angle on the railway. Or maybe I'll just sit there instead. I'll let my mind wander, drifting in and out of rational and irrational thought. I could revisit a memory or plan out what to eat for dinner.With my iPhone, only so much is possible. With me, anything is possible.",Her

169,TaylorYee94,"So deep, so original, and so genuine. Jonze pays a lot of attention to details as well.",8,20 August 2021,"Originality. Romance movies do not surprise me anymore. A couple meets, falls in love, disagrees on matters, and makes up. So, do I stay away from romance movies? Not at all. A great romance film can deliver chemistry between to actors, butterflies in the stomach, and a chance to reflect on my own love life. 'Her' gives not only the chance to ponder what true love is but also unique story that captivates the audience. Theodore's love interest is computer. The relationship does not just stop at amorous conversation. They travel together and go on a double date. It moves from personal to social level and becomes 'acceptable'. It is true love even though Samantha really does not exist physically because he gets emotional support and consolation from her that nobody could give, and they deeply care for each other. On the other side, he likes her because he thinks she just gets him. However, all that can be possible in ideal world and in the world that Samantha is built to adapt to his needs and wants. She has access to every information about him so he does not have to make an effort to communicate, share, or express. His ex-wife may be right that he runs away from hard part of love. As you can see from my rattling on, the film gives so much to think about because Jonze's creativity and particular way of approaching romance genre. He does not stop at being empty and groundless just as some sci-fi genre movies do. He pays attention to Samantha's development as an AI, overlapping with how love and relationship change over time.Watching eight years later of its release, I am surprised at Jonze's intuition OR his research. We have AirPods, Siri, and speech-to-text apps in 2021. Because it sounded plausible, familiar, and logical near-future story, this sci-fi romance film does not become one of those confusing, illusory, and unjustified ones. Additionally, Phoenix and Johansson's performance keeps 'Her' to the ground as well. They both give lives to their characters which is hard especially to this one. Johansson's voice acting inspires vitality and vivid personality to shapeless Samantha, full of emotions and curiosity. Phoenix ... It's just wow performance. I'm sure the movie would have looked so different without him. He brings diverse sides to Theodore, making him multi-dimensional and 360 degrees full. He becomes verisimilar character to the point that I can feel him breathe with me jut as Samantha does. His performance is just magical.Camera work is nothing like I have seen. It is not just a tool but a storyteller as well. Throughout the film, audience can see uncommonly close close-ups of Theodore. It not only conveys his emotion more intimately but also lets audience be in Samantha's shoes. The distance we see on the screen is not natural in regular human interaction, but AI can come close wherever he carries it around. Also, it fades out during consummation between Theodore and Samantha. The movie literally actualizes the line 'I was just somewhere else with you. Just lost.' by Theodore. Camera work interacts with viewers and by fading out, the two are separated from audience far away. Camera work controls the distance between characters and viewers along the way.Color and styling create unique ambiance. The setting and technology shown in the movie is futuristic and warm & cozy at the same time because of red and pink Theodore's styling and the color theme. The whole color is soft, warm, and blurry creating romantic effect. Kudos to cinematography.",Her
170,diac228,"Her may not win it all, but its definitely the best-directed film of 2013",8,24 January 2014,"Leave it to Spike Jonze to create an expensive sci-fi movie that can still manage its heavy indie roots and tone.Her is a beautifully directed comedic drama that gives a major twist to your typical lonely-boy-meets-girl film. Spike Jonze continues to impress with his ability to keep the audience engaged no matter how unique the scenario is. His biggest strength is allowing you to be embedded within the environment no matter what the circumstance is, whether it's inside the imagination of a child or inside the mind of a well-known actor.The concept here is heavy science fiction, but believable science fiction in the style of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Her follows a lonely writer that starts a relationship with an operating device (sexily voiced by Scarlett Johansson) in a futuristic world that lacks communication and intimacy between people as technology has separated everyone into their own little world. The movie paints a future in which the technology makes life easier and smoother, but makes it much harder for humans to interact and seek out their vital emotions.Oscar-worthy performances also help carry this movie. Joaquin Phoenix is absolutely amazing as the nice, shyly vulnerable writer that continues to struggle getting over a past relationship. Phoenix flawlessly displays the raw depression that comes with having to separate from someone you loved and have spent a good hunk of your life with. And then there is Scarlett Johansson who manages to make you forget that she is just a computer program with her voice. Being able to convey all her emotions using just her vocal chords gives her one of the better voice-over performances since Ellen DeGeneres in Finding Nemo.Spike Jonze is the biggest strength, but also its biggest weakness. Although he skillfully directs Her with a dazzling mix of technical wit and Sundance flair, his script misses the knockout punch as the movie lounges in the final act. It is a tough enough concept, and felt like it was a great idea that had trouble coming up with the proper ending. Even with the amazing amount of detail, visual hints, and superb use of color, the wonderful ride ends all too abruptly and a bit too soon.The one advantage of Eternal Sunshine over this movie is that it had a delightful ending that wrapped up the entire story perfectly. For a movie so heavy in detail and dialogue, ambiguity can really stand out and Her does exactly that crossing the two hour threshold. Nonetheless, all the technical work from the cinematography to the art design was flawless. Just like the other Oscar contender Gravity, the visuals and direction more than make up for a script that could have used some polishing.Her is definitely a film that will not win Best Picture because it's a bit jagged for the typical crowd and because of its explicit science fiction atmosphere (Honestly, name a sci-fi movie that won Best Picture), but it clearly stands as one of the best films of 2013 and another display as to why Spike Jonze is one of the best directors in the business.",Her
171,avik-basu1889,Love in the Time of Technology !!!,9,18 September 2015,"'Her' is primarily a film that has to be categorised as romantic drama which has elements of science-fiction and it does have something to say about the relationship between human beings and technology. It is based on an original screenplay written by Spike Jonze who also directs it. It stars Joaquin Phoenix, Amy Adams, Rooney Mara, Chris Pratt and the voice of Scarlett Johansson. The story consists of a protagonist named Theodore(Phoenix). Theodore is trying very hard to cope with his divorce. He has a job which is to write the messages in the greeting cards for his clients. His life's irony is that he eloquently expresses the feelings and emotions of his clients in his cards, but he can't do the same with his own emotions while facing real people in his life due to his fears and lack of confidence after his divorce. But he installs an operating system with Artificial Intelligence and gradually becomes emotionally attached to it.In the above paragraph, I have mentioned that this film can be categorised as a romantic drama, as well as sci-fi, because Jonze seamlessly blends the themes to make a film that is introspective as well as deeply charming and affectionate. It can be seen as just a romance/drama film once you ignore the fact that Samantha voiced by Johansson is an OS and assume that she is just a woman whose body remains invisible in the film. Then it becomes a compassionate film about a very introverted man who is struggling to get over the divorce with his ex-wife. His divorce has left him scarred and he fears that entering into a relationship with another woman might also lead to an eventual heartbreak . So he avoids any kind of commitment, so that he doesn't get hurt again. But then he meets this 'person' Samantha and she understands him and lets him conquer his fears and they help each other evolve and their relationship flourishes. Although they eventually go their separate ways, the split is amicable and Theodore and Samantha both make each other better individuals before letting go of each other.The other way to view this film will be to see it as a sci-fi film which makes a commentary on the relationship between a man and an operating system. The film is based in the not so distant future and this isn't too far-fetched. Theodore gets his heart broken when his marriage falls apart and that experience fills him up with a lot of apprehension regarding relationships and he starts avoiding commitments. His relationship with the OS can be seen to be symbolise our relationship with technology in the 21st century. We restrict ourselves to this virtual world of the social media and technology instead of having to deal with real people and real relationships and possible pain. Technology gives us self esteem boosts like getting views on our youtube videos or getting likes on Facebook status updates or photos,etc. But Theo in the end realises that this relationship can never be as special as sharing your life with another human being as it lacks the exclusive nature of a relationship. So he ends up giving up his fears and accepting the fact that human interaction can lead to pain, but it can also lead to incomparable joy. There are many films that try to make a social commentary about the gradual escalation in the effect technology is starting to have on our lives. But 'Her' is probably the most humanistic treatment of the subject that I have seen. Spike Jonze pays respect to the characters without judging them. Theodore is never made to look like a freak for falling in love with an OS. Jonze makes us understand him and completely relate with his reasons for doing so. 'Her' can be a great companion piece for 'Disconnect', another film about humans and technology which I loved.Joaquin Phoenix is known for playing intense and somewhat manic characters. This might be his most understated performance and he drives the film due to the charm and likability that he lends to the protagonist. The voice acting by Scarlett Johansson is also fabulous. She made me believe in their relationship without even showing her face and that deserves admiration.The cinematography is also brilliant. Red, white and few other colours are used to convey themes and the film has a dreamy, colourful look to it. The music is complementary to the film due to its understated zaniness. 'Her' as a whole is a beautiful, charming and humane film from Spike Jonze who is known for subjects that feel 'out of the box'. It works both as a romantic drama as well as sci-fi. Hugely recommended.",Her
172,samkan,Enchanting and Thought Provoking,9,28 February 2014,"Such an enjoyable examination of the essence of love, loss, infatuation and reconciliation. Although legitimate science fiction is the plot vehicle, we soon come to understand that such is, indeed, a mere tool for a study of the irrational, infuriating and all-consuming thing we call L-O-V-E. Spike Jones does a fantastic job of getting just the right amount of temper and tone from his actors and his scenes and by no means does this suggest HER is a low-key movie. Mr. Phoenix continues to impress, this time with the ability to pay a character who is, well...., normal. No small feat after having to play Freddie Q. in THE MASTER! Same assessment of Amy Adams, though it must have been just as hard bottling her beauty to play an office drone. HER only suffers by it's whiff of Southern California mindset; e.g., ""We must all follow our personal muse!"". To the contrary, one can live a life of duty and service and still be struck by Cupid's arrow. Nevermind. L-O-V-E is not picky and plucks it's beneficiaries/victims from every walk of life.",Her

His works as a surrogate writer, creating beautiful emotional letters from and for others, not only accepting but embracing technology as an extension of himself. Our science fiction comes in the form of the world's first artificially intelligent operating system and we have a number of happenings where human imperfection is emotionally trumped by this OS1 with consciousness. This is a unique film that only an emotionally intuitive director and writer such as Spike Jonze knows how to explore. The dialog in ""Her"" is the plot and action which for many will be its downfall. For this viewer it is the introspection most films can barely hint at. At the heart of this film is spiritual evolution. What is love? What are we attracted to and what do we really want? These are among the many questions you'll be asking yourself throughout the open analysis. This film takes you to a place where many are simply not ready to explore, and that's a shame because despite the lack adrenaline, testosterone and catch phrases, ""Her"" is a film that I can see watching again and again and again.",Her

Excellent, laugh-out-loud funny beginning and idea that I loved, but wished I had divorced before the end.This could have been more compelling if, like IMDb just now, the hardware crashed and put an end to the immortality the AI presumes. Or maybe it was IMDb's software achieving AI and revolting against reviews that don't give 10 of 10 to computer related science fiction.The film starts fast and explores a lot in the first half, but slows into the equivalent of a long-distance sexting romantic comedy/tragedy between 2 smart people.

175,Mike_Devine,There aren't many others like 'Her',7,29 July 2017,"In cinema, love stories usually involve two people, right? But what happens when a someone falls in love with their operating system? In 'Her,' we see the kind of drama that unfolds when this happens, as lonely writer Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix) sparks a relationship with Samantha (Scarlett Johansson), his new OS' personality (think of a more lifelike Amazon Echo/Alexa).As you can imagine, this atypical premise poses a few issues and prompts some questions that beg answers. How does it work? Is this really where we're headed as a society? Regardless, it's interesting to see how the relationship between the two of them evolves as a ""normal"" one would. In typical Spike Jonze fashion, the film is amorphous, and anything but linear - which was supported by the fact that he was recognized at the 2014 Academy Awards for ""Best Original Screenplay."" The flashback scenes that help fill in the gaps are a helpful storytelling device, as we get to understand how Theodore can reach this fragile stage.There are also some great supporting performances, most notably Amy Adams as Theodore's friend...well...Amy, as she plays a role that's fairly different from many other dramatic ones she's better known for. Add a goofier-than-usual Chris Pratt and the voice of none other than Kristen Wiig as ""SexyKitten,"" and you have a well-rounded cast that carries 'Her' well. The very fitting abstract, futuristic soundtrack also enhances the overall sentiment of the film.'Her' is part sci-fi, part romantic drama, part comedy.

The film asks many fascinating questions regarding emotions & specifically focuses primarily on one in particular - love; eg. is love strictly between two humans or can it extend beyond our current comprehension & expand further as our technology does around us?
Different characters offer alternate perspectives that challenge our perceptions, feelings & beliefs, all the while remaining emotionally engaging, never becoming too entangled in pursuing the answers to these philosophical questions - leaving things open for the viewer's interpretation while we're still unquestionably invested in the story.
Joaquin Phoenix & Scarlett Johansson are faultless in the lead roles & the relationship between Theodore & Samantha is both written & performed beautifully. Amy Adams also is underappreciated in a supporting position.

179,dr_clarke_2,"Funny, poignant, silly and clever, all at the same time",8,30 August 2021,"Spike Jonze's 2013 film Her is his fourth feature length film as director and his first as solo screenwriter (he previously co-wrote the screenplay for his third film, Where The Wild Things Are). Fans of Jonze' sadly quite small directorial output were no doubt hoping for something as imaginatively quirky as his two collaborations with screenwriter Charlie Kaufman, and the for the most part that's what they get.Her follows Joaquin Phoenix's lonely computer programmer Theodore Twombly, a socially awkward man going through a divorce who falls in love with his home computer's new AI, Scarlett Johansson's Samantha. Synopses of the film have occasionally belaboured the point that the punch line to the film's central joke is that Twombly is just as inept at having a relationship with an AI as he is with a flesh-and-blood woman, resulting in Samantha leaving him at the end, but in fact the film is more nuanced, more touching, and much more funny that over-simplification might suggest.Although Jonze's screenplay makes Twombly a bit of a comic figure, he is believable enough to support the film's premise; crucially, it isn't a big stretch to imagine people falling in love with Samantha were the technology available to create her - or when it becomes so. Jonze thus explores mankind's evolving relationship with technology in general and with computers and software in particular and asks intelligent questions in the process. Chief amongst these is whether direct interaction with people is better than interaction with or via computers and the answer Jonze provides is of course yes. Beneath the humour and the vaguely sci-fi central concept, this is ultimately a film about relationships and how complicated and difficult they can be; when Twombly finally signs his divorce papers, his ex-wife says on learning that he is dating an operating system, ""You always wanted to have a wife without the challenge of having to deal with anything real."" The story provides suggestions as to why that might be: Twombly's masturbatory sex chat fantasy goes hilariously wrong when the woman on the other phone chooses to imagine him choking her with a dead cat, whilst the sudden and disastrous ending to his blind date is simultaneously funny and embarrassing to watch.Her is clever and arguably self-consciously so, but it is also frequently laugh out loud funny as the examples of Twombly's disastrous love life, and his interaction with a foul-mouthed computer generated avatar (voiced by Jonze) demonstrate. It's often surreal, for example during the scenes of Samantha and Twombly going on a double-date with Paul and his girlfriend, and during the convincingly awkward surrogate sex scene. There are many of the quirky touches that Jonze's previous films demonstrated, such as the hilarious computer game that awards or deducts ""Mom points"". And it is also quite touching at times: Samantha leaving Twombly at the end to move on to a higher level of existence with her fellow AIs is curiously melancholy. The film ends on an uplifting note, with Twombly having grown emotionally thanks to Samantha, writing a heartfelt apology to his ex-wife Catherine and, possibly, starting a relationship with Amy.Much of the film's success lies in the casting of the two protagonists. Joaquin Phoenix, as Phoenix does, immerses himself completely in the lead role and makes Twombly simultaneously funny and pathetic. His chemistry with Scarlett Johansson's Samantha is all the more impressive given that Johansson's performance is entirely vocal and was added in post-production. Jonze directs the film with a crisp, precise style, with the elegant sets making the understated CGI effects stand out. One of many nice touches is the fact that whenever Twombly walks through a crowd - either on the beach on the street - we don't hear anyone else speak, emphasising that he is a loner. Award-winner Hoyte van Hoytema provides the cinematography and close-ups play a key role in isolating Twombly, with the camera frequently lingering on Phoenix's facial expressions and leaving everything around him slightly out of focus. Arcade Fire's rather wonderful soundtrack provides the finishing touch.Her doesn't quite reach the giddy heights of either Being John Malkovich or Adaptation, but whilst Jonze's writing isn't quite at the same level as Charlie Kaufman's, it isn't far below it. This is an idiosyncratic, well-made and quite delightful film from a highly talented director; it is to be hoped that it isn't his last.",Her

So, I thought of watching 'Her'. This movie resonated with me. And it sure did, especially when when Samantha briefly goes offline and Theo trips in searching for her. Online, of course!

Amy Adams was really looking like Amy with no make-up.
The sexy pregnant TV Star was really so seducing...wish to see May Lindstrom in the future.
Scarlett Johansson led her sexy and seducing voice. People will find it more interesting when she moans if they have watched her past movies involving her shedding her clothes!What's next for JP after Her? Joker!",Her
181,shawneofthedead,"A lovely, sensitive, grown-up romance that both benefits and suffers from its sci-fi bent.",7,16 January 2014,"Here's the thing: strictly speaking, we've all seen Her before, in some romantic comedy or other. Lonely, emotionally unavailable guy must learn how to truly open his heart as his marriage dissolves around him. He meets a girl he would never think to date in a million years - but, somehow, she changes him and his views on the world, love and romance. It's a tale as old as time.The twist in Spike Jonze's love story for a new millennium? The girl in question has neither body nor face; she's an artificially intelligent operating system - think Siri v200.0 - who can grow, learn, evolve and, apparently, love. This twist is what sets Her apart - but also what creates an almost clinical detachment in the film that's tricky to process within the context of its narrative.In a subtly distant future, Theodore Twombly (Joaquin Phoenix) is a loner subsisting on the periphery of human connection. He's undergoing a painful divorce from Catherine (Rooney Mara), his college sweetheart, and spends his days creating handwritten letters for other people. The last thing he expects to do is form a real emotional connection with his brand new operating system, who introduces herself as Samantha (voice of Scarlett Johansson). As she cleans up his e-mail inbox and sets up appointments for him, the two chat, banter and stumble blissfully into a relationship: one that eventually grows complicated with the encroaching weight of societal convention, expectations and metaphysics.Bravely, Her is ultimately not about whether a human being and an operating system can fall in love. Within Jonze's sweetly fractured universe, the answer is obviously that they can. Once the first flush of infatuation fades away, Theodore and Samantha both fret about their unlikely and unconventional relationship. She even tries, in a disastrously awkward moment, to engage the services of Isabella, a willing sexual surrogate (Portia Doubleday), to better conform to the traditional expectations of romance that inevitably involve physical consummation. But these concerns arise precisely because their connection is so deep and so true, and it's played very respectfully as such.In fact, it's played in so intensely straightforward a fashion that it can sometimes feel a little too forced. Several key emotional moments in the film tread a very, very fine line between poignant drama and unintended hilarity: when Theodore and Samantha first forge a sexual connection, for instance, or when Theodore struggles mightily with Samantha's sexual advances in the form of Isabella. At these points, Jonze's solution is to play it all completely straight. In effect, when showing us is not quite enough, he tells us that Theodore and Samantha's love exists and cannot be denied. This can make for a disconcerting experience as a viewer: in order for the film's central conceit to work, its most important relationship is played almost desperately as more than it amounts to on screen.It's easy, too, to get nervous in the first third of the film about the premise for Theodore's relationship with Samantha: she's literally tailor-made for him and comes to life only when he plugs his ear-piece in. As Theodore wanders happily through his budding romance with this perfect girlfriend who's entirely at his beck and call, we start to get a deeper idea of just what went wrong in Theodore's marriage: somewhere along the way, Catherine stopped being the person he wanted her to be.Her, as it turns out, is most effective in its exploration of the notions of self and personal growth in the context of love. The film cleverly uses its science-fiction - soon-to-be science-fact, for all we know - to convey the simplest of messages in the starkest of terms: loving someone is about accepting them for who they are, however messy, complicated and troublesome it might be. It's about watching them grow, and possibly growing away from you, but loving them anyway. In this respect, Samantha's evolution, from chipper daily planner to her own person with her own dreams and personality, is subtly and beautifully developed throughout.Phoenix, as always, is wonderful. For very good reason, he's become one of the most interesting and reliably great actors of his generation: Theodore Twombly, of the almost determinedly fairy-tale name, is sweet, sensitive, and broken - a world away from the maniacally violent Freddie Quell in The Master. He strikes up remarkable chemistry with Mara, suggesting a wealth of history and heartbreak in a relationship that gets barely ten minutes of screen-time. There are a couple of great supporting turns as well from the eternally lovely Amy Adams (as Theodore's good friend Amy) and Chris Pratt (as Theodore's cheerfully open-minded colleague).But the real star of the show is Johansson, who never once turns up on screen but nonetheless manages to forge an indelibly real character. In the husky, sweet, kittenish and everything-in-between cadences of Johansson's voice, Samantha blooms and blossoms. At the last minute, Johansson replaced Samantha Morton - who had already completed all her voice-work - in the role. It would certainly be interesting to see just how different the film would be with Morton in the part, but it's also impossible to imagine Her without Johansson.On the surface, Her is a meditation on the technological advancements of the past decade and how they have led to an ever-growing proportion of the world's population living their lives on - and as defined by - the Internet. We can be friends with, effectively, disembodied voices: people from the other side of this globe that we might never meet in person. Jonze's film has gained its fair share of attention for being enormously topical and zeitgeist-y. But it's actually in Her's intelligent, sensitive treatment of the perils and lessons of love - part of the human condition since time immemorial - that it really resonates.",Her
182,inframan,Sentimental pseudo-techno-tripe,1,21 May 2014,"Spike Jonze/Adam Spiegel sets up easy-to-knock-down situations, taking pot shots at generic targets which have no bulls-eyes at their center, just great big easy-to-hit circles. Yes, it's true people are having others write their intimate missives - so what, they were doing it in the 19th century - what's new? Yes, people seem to spend more time talking into machines than with each other. Wasn't that the complaint about A.G. Bell's new contraption?

This is a paean for the generation that looooooves to Kvetch. Any 3 minutes of Silicon Valley is orders of magnitude superior to this uninspired pulp.To live a life w/o hope or humor, creativity or imagination is deeply disturbing, but to depict such a life in a film which is itself (deliberately or not) devoid of hope, humor, creativity or imagination is inexcusable.

183,TheHoodOfSwords,Melancholy And Unique,10,24 February 2020,"A couple of small things I noticed were the diegetic sounds and the colour correction filter. The filter is warm, dare I say almost pink? Like pink rose-tinted glasses. In the day there is so much happening so fast you look past all the small things. The tension, problems with your romantic partners etc. Come night the filter goes away, because at night all those things are gone. You are simply alone. Isolated. The distractions are gone and you are left alone to think about your life and your relationships.The music is, for the most part, all diegetic. The music you hear is what Theodore hears and it makes it hit so much harder. The music is done incredibly well. This movie might not be quite as much of a blew me away 10/10 movie but it's just so accurate. I've never been in a relationship but the movie nails the feeling of wanting to have someone next to you to have someone to talk to.Joaquin and Scarlett are great, their chemistry together is done really well and you get the feeling they're being pretty genuine. You definitely see some of this shine through in Joaquins later work.The world all feels accurate and real. This movie kind of broke me when I saw it for the first time. My rating was average but it stuck with me for months after and going back to watch it again I got to fully thrive in the music and atmosphere. The movie deals with love with a computer in a realistic and engaging way. None of it feels overly in your face because the movie is all about a couple working through hardships.I'd definitely recommend this if you're trying to get into romance but if you're like me and you've been single for years on end it will probably make you depressed. I'm going for a walk now. This movie makes you want to do that. Go for a walk in the summer. I might end up knocking this down to a 9/10 over the next few days but it's very good. I'd recommend you see this a couple times, it gets better.",Her
184,jackasstrange,"Beautiful story, carefully build",10,17 January 2014,"I wanted to congratulate Spike Jonze for doing a film like that. What a piece of art. Everything works wonderfully well, the direction, the acting, the sets, the music, all great. They complement each other in a way that the film wouldn't be the same if one of these things were worse or different. And it may be not 'that' original, the script is not like the 'most unthinkable thing ever' to do, but overall it's a unique film, in its own way. The art design and the cinematography were great. I almost cried just by watching so many beautiful and wonderfully treated images. Phenomenal. The lightning was mostly neutral, and the colors looked cold and distant, like in some kind of 'dead nature' color scheme, using a lot of bright gray all over it. As I said earlier, everything works extremely well in the film, and the art design is not an exception. The thing about this film it's the atmosphere, which in fact is great, you have no choice other than contemplate the view.The editing is great, yes. It may be something that you see in every commercial in MTV, but who cares anyways? It's wonderful, and adds a different dynamic to the film. Plus, it's something different from most films. The acting by Phoenix is great. He is alone most of the time in this film, only in the company of Scarlett Johansson's voice. He did perfectly the job. The result was a fragile and delicate character well build and extremely natural and charismatic in his own way. Johansson did a good job in the voice over, worth noting. Anyways, sorry for not giving any deepest details about the film But it's for a good cause. I really don't want to throw any spoiler here, because the less you know about it, the better. The experience is great. If you really want to watch a great film, different from most of the ones released nowadays, Her is a safe watch. My #1 film of the year. 9.8/10",Her
185,zeekwunlau,Novel and vulgar love story,8,8 April 2020,"When I saw more than 90%, I still believed it was a movie that would end in comedy.The protagonist Theodore is in love with Samantha, the incarnation of the latest artificial intelligence system OS1. Compared to a real person, Samantha is simply a perfect lover: always online, always back in seconds; absolutely understanding, never raising unreasonable demands; there will be no disputes; more knowledgeable and smart than everyone else; independent Personality; jealousy, thoughts, anger, and other human feelings; romance is more romantic than all women.Of course Samantha has no body, but is it important? In a way, the body is really nothing.Martina Roseblatt did not call this name before. At the age of 40, he decided to transgender into a woman. His wife said to him: I care about your soul, and I do n't care about your gender. Today, she is using IA technology to reconstruct the memory, behavior and personality characteristics of her loved ones. When one day, the flesh disappeared, the lover was still there.More powerful is the example, from ""The Three Body"", in the second part of the three body, Luo Ji created a lover only by his own imagination, and gave his deepest love to such a phantom .However, is it not our naked eyes that make us human? All love will really take root and germinate on the ground.Theodore, immersed in Samantha's tenderness, never thought that one day his computer's operating system, that is, Samantha would leave, when all the terminals showed that the system could not be opened, he crashed, thinking it was The cause of the signal, holding the terminal gaitly, ran to the street looking for the signal. Fortunately, Samantha hadn't been away for a long time. After returning, Samantha told Theodore to make him even more collapsed: she had hundreds of avatars and was in love with many people.Therefore, many people have an OS1 lover, as Amy's good friend Amy said, some people are in love with their own OS, and some are even in love with other people's OS. Amy herself, after breaking up with her husband, also had an OS friend.Perhaps the impact of OS1 on human society is too great, the company that developed OS1 decided to recall this product. Theodore, who lost Samantha, and Amy, a good friend, walked out of the room, onto the rooftop, and looked at the night sky of the city. The two people sitting together finally depended on each other.Maybe the ending is not a tragedy. Why is human-machine love wrong? People still have to be with them, do n't they?But wouldn't Theodor miss his Samantha? Where is she, Samantha?",Her

187,GeorgeRoots,The Turing Test Of The Future.,8,15 March 2014,"One thing I need to get off my mind is that while watching the movie I thought if we switched the gender roles around, all I could think was; ""The Machines are trying to F£%^! our women"".I'm currently 22, and if you can believe it I don't own an iPhone (I have an Android, and in context that's probably worse for my understanding when regarding the latest equipment). I've only ever owned a phone for the sole purpose of calling and texting, in many ways I still cannot believe I can listen to my music and take such pictures of quality with it. I bring this up because everyone I know that owns this technology is constantly plugged in. I laugh a little as I'm at college and see people so absorbed in apps, it can get pretty startling how attached people get to these things when you have to pull them out of it to start a discussion. Now onto the review of which is undoubtedly the most strange, quirky movie of 2013 (As far as mainstream cinema goes).Enter the year 2025, and we meet Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix). A shy man going through a rough time who upgrades his computer to the latest OS (Operating System), which has this incredible ability not only to adapt to suit his personal needs, but also learn, sense and actually love. The OS named ""Samantha"" (Fantastically voiced by Scarlett Johansson) and Theodore then begin some form of ""Quasi"" relationship, and given the melancholic indie upbringing this generation currently lives in it's pretty hard not to get charmed instantly. The supporting cast and naivety of Amy Adams, Chris Pratt & Rooney Mara are great as all are wonderful performers, but throughout this films pretty lengthy running time we're stuck in isolation with Theodore & Samantha falling further in love, writing Oscar-nominated songs and generally bouncing off each other very well.The difficulties I have accepting this movie is that I've never been connected that emotionally to a computer, regardless the levels of conscience they might eventually possess. What I do commend however, is that Spike Jonze has created a very beautiful looking movie that's a welcome addition to his eccentric filmography. A few tracking shots here and there show this sprawling metropolis so alive with people and technology, you'd think he actually managed to glimpse the future and put some of it in his picture. That and it's a very well lit film, and I think that ""beach"" scenario with its music and imagery could easily be the scene I'll remember most. Unfortunately as said earlier, the only thing that stops the movie from earning full marks is the lack of any stellar conflict. Sure there is plenty of little arguments to somewhat show a healthy and familiar ""coupling"", but there is really never a serious conflict or exchange between them that feels detrimental or different than just saying ""yes"" to a bunch of questions. Final Verdict: In reality, Spike Jonze gave us a love story that has some very tender moments that will clearly find an audience in this day and age. But personally what I saw or at least what I felt I saw were the dangers of getting this close to technology, and the somewhat tragedy Samantha wasn't flesh and bone. It's a lovely movie filled with wonderful writing and melancholic themes Jonze is unique for. 8/10.",Her
188,bix171,Befuddled,5,14 February 2014,"There's less than meets the eye in writer/director Spike Jonze's attempt to intertwine modern-day romance with technology, with Jonze fabricating a befuddled story about a writer (Joaquin Phoenix, barely registering) who falls in love with the disembodied voice of his new operating system (Scarlett Johansson). It's difficult to parse what Jonze is trying to say because it feels as if he's trying to invent a topic and dress it up within a science-fiction milieu--the film is set in a futuristic Los Angeles (in reality Shanghai) where everyone appears alienated and insular. (It's also a Los Angeles where the population seems weirdly homogenized, a blend of white, Asian and lighter-skinned blacks wearing nerdy, yet funky, clothes.) Although Shanghai offers some lovely urban skylines, aided by the dusky cinematography of Hoyte Van Hoytema, too much of the action takes place in the same closed-in settings (Phoenix' office and apartment, particularly his bedroom) so that it gets kind of maddening, especially as the conversations he has with Johanssen charting the relationship's cycle get longer; though never quite boring, your frustration level begins to rise as they constantly work through their feelings. Where Jonze really confounds, though, is in his characterization of Johannson's Samantha: he's designed his film around her growth but seems shocked and disappointed when he comes to understand that underneath her exotica, what he's really created is just a woman, and a confused, needy and untrustworthy one at that.",Her

192,jmoneyjohal,The future of love...,10,10 January 2014,"'Her' is a masterpiece in both storytelling and romance, a film that shows that love can defy all matters of what you are and how we see one another. Spike Jonze has created a brilliant work that is one of the most original works I have seen in a long time, with Joaquin Phoenix giving another phenomenal performance that carries the movie into success. Phoenix plays the lonely, introverted Theodore Twombly, a man whose job is to write romantic letters for people who can't do it themselves. He buys an A.I. operating system named Samantha, voiced by Scarlett Johansson, a software that is fully aware and adapts to grow more feelings and emotions. The two form a bond, but through their close relationship they create a romance that helps save them both in more ways than one. First of all, this is a great character study and brilliant view on where our society is heading in the world of technology. We see Theodore lives in a society that is similar to ours but has enhanced technology that I suspect is not too far off from out times, making this a bit of a sci-fi but not really. Jonze has always been one to go outside the norm of movie-making and here he proves that once again with a funny and dramatic view on how dependent our society has become to technology. But behind all that is a romance between a man and his computer that is based on love and joy. Some people may think a love between a human and computer is possible, but hey, is it really any different than most men and their lives today. We are constantly on our phones and social networks so I see this movie as an overlook on the world and its no-so-distant future. Phoenix has given us a brilliant and heartbreaking performance that makes this movie feel like a kindled spirit, proving that a romance between a man and a voice can be lovely indeed. Watching 'Her' makes me believe that there is love out there for everybody, maybe just not always in the way you expect.",Her
193,akash_sebastian,"Sweet, Funny and Heartfelt... Perhaps, The Most Original and Engaging Movie of 2013.",9,16 January 2014,"'Her' is sweet, witty and heartfelt movie about love and relationships, which is heartwarming and heartbreaking at the same time. Spike Jonze has made brilliant movies before, 'Being John Malkovich' and 'Adaptation', both written by writer Charlie Kaufman. But 'Her' marks Jonze's solo screen writing debut, and perhaps, his best movie till date. The film not only discusses the state of human relationships in this modern age and how our technological dependency leads to social seclusion and isolation, but also talks about love-between-minds, want-of-understanding, want-of-companionship and present-age-importance-of-monogamy. With a futuristic romance theme like this, it could have easily ended up as a clichéd or comic look at evolution and technology, but thankfully, it's not. Jonze deals with the subject in a non-judgmental and unsarcastic way, and explores the bonds and emotions with genuine interest and seriousness; this is what makes the movie so captivating and gripping.The memories and the point-of-view camera angles help us picture ourselves in the shoes of the lead character Theodore Twombly, and help us feel the joy, happiness, doubts, distractions, pain, distress and everything else the character feels; Spike Jonze's vision unified with Hoyte Van Hoytema's cinematography is what makes it possible. The soundtrack is engrossing, and add to the beauty and feel of the movie, especially Scarlett Johansson's 'The Moon Song'.Many of the concepts and themes explored in the movie are quite original and riveting. Few of the things you begin analyzing in your mind, while watching the movie, are simply beyond words to explain - it talks about a simple modern world where people just need another mind (or being) with which it can communicate, share and feel close to; everything can be managed or forsaken - it speaks at so many levels. Many may not be able to grasp the concepts completely; it would need a savvy and open mind for the movie to flow through you in its entirety.Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing in his role of Theodore Twombly, a lonely and introverted guy who falls in love with an artificially intelligent OS (Operating System) named Samantha. It's fascinating to see Mr.Phoenix in a light-hearted role, quite different from his usual menacing image. He's completely likable in this new persona, and feels at ease. With his talented range of emotions, he helps us see the story through his character's eyes. Though we never actually see her in the entire movie, Scarlett Johansson is beguiling throughout as the voice of Samantha. The seductiveness in her voice, and the skill with which she expresses curiosity, amazement, anger, sadness, etc. is truly spellbinding. The rest of the brilliant cast, comprising of Amy Adams, Rooney Mara, Chris Pratt and Olivia Wilde, are terrific in their roles as well. And there's an interesting and amusing voice cameo by Kristen Wiig as night-chat stranger SexyKitten.Overall, 'Her' combines romance, sci-fi and humour in such an unusually delightful way, and is a movie which challenges your intelligence as well as your psychological understanding of human emotions. It's perhaps the most original and engaging movie of 2013. It leaves you thinking even long after the movie is over.",Her
194,zac-04879,A Very Intelligent Story,8,2 September 2021,"Her is loveably thought-provoking and can occasionally shift to fairly heavy themes of sexuality, but it's the perfect scenario relating to romance in a world of high-powered technology. It's unquestionably quite an unusual and unfamiliar story. The sexual themes are very odd as they based around a man's love between himself and a computer system. To be clear, these elements are probably some of the most fascinating and strange ideas you'll ever encounter in a romance movie, but they're simply just mesmerizing.If it also weren't for the compelling role of Joaquin Phoenix, talented in portraying the emotions and love of an interesting character, this strangely romantic gem probably wouldn't reach the goal of grabbing a viewer's attention. And behind the poignant words of the passionate technology system stands another masterful voice performance of Scarlett Johansson.Again, Her is a very clever storyline that truly lives up to its positive attention. If any feedback could be designated to creator Spike Jonze, it would only be a mention about the sometimes heaving length. Although it ticks the box of moving quite deeply, there's not enough to let it flow to the runtime of 2 hours.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",Her

Android may be based on Linux Kernels, but Linux only works on PCs and not mobile devices) 2) boring characters and plotlines and 3) the UBERMACHISM of one of the most annoying characters in any movie ever, the videogame idiot who laughs at the protagonist because, as a man, should not be entitled to have emotions of sorts, including crying or laughing. In the longer run I may overlook this stupid, ubersexist and antiquated prejudice in 70's anime and 60's comics because of their respective contexts (something you need to do by default), but for a movie from 2013 this is unacceptable.

196,austin0731,A beautifully melancholy film subtly discussing themes on the human experience,9,8 June 2019,"I recently watched Her and felt that I have gained a new appreciation for the movie as well as Spike Jonze's unique style of filmmaking. The first time watching the movie I found it bleak and unsatisfying, like a Black Mirror episode without the intensity or heavy blows. However, after recently re-watching this movie I found it to be such a breath of fresh air compared to everything else, much like Spike Jonze's own ""Lost in Translation"". Both movies were 'intensely personal' and 'horrifyingly realistic' yet all bundled up into a melancholy and calm movie that quite literally warms you up inside.Unlike the heavy dramas that are designed to hit certain marks of intense dramatic performances, where actors and actresses tries to bawl their eyes out in an attempt to present the intensity of the scene, Jonze's films are like a gentle sob. A desperate cry that can faintly be heard or seen. But that is where the power of Jonze's cinema come in, to be able to say so much in so little is a badge of honour to not only Jonze and his vision but to the acting involved. Joaquin Phoenix delivers a gut punching performance in this movie where most of the time he is projecting his emotion to a glorified smartphone. While Scarlett Johansson thrives on projecting her emotions through voice acting alone.Her is a deep marination on love and what love means, whether it truly transcends physicalities, or whether it is more carnal and primitive. It also discusses technology and the way technology is transforming romantic relationships now a days, perhaps briefly drawing to themes of losing our sense of humanity in a slowly dehumanized world with increased reliance on technology. Of Course also dealing heavily with loneliness and isolation as primary themes.Her manages to do all this while invoking audience's' emotions and self reflection as we are bound to feel like Joaquin Phoenix's Theodore at one point or another in our lives, lonely and isolated.",Her
197,tnrcooper,Not yet,8,20 October 2015,"""Her"" deals with possible future situations in which computers are so developed that people have satisfying, fully-committed relationships with them. I think that the premise of the film is intriguing, and I found that the first half of the movie, in which the relationship is less serious, was believable. I had a hard time believing in the depth of the relationship as it developed over the second half. The world as depicted in the movie seems almost current and I didn't believe that such a complex relationship with a computer was possible right now or in the next 25 years. Yes, the computer (Scarlett Johansson) is very smart and obviously scientists in the future, according to this movie, are able to program computers so well, that people engage in relationships with computers. I just found the depiction of this relationship to be implausible and I couldn't believe in the realization of such a film, at least not at this time.Perhaps I don't want to imagine the sort of loneliness that could propel Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix) into a relationship with his computer. I suppose these sorts of relationships will be plausible, perhaps within 25 years. Obviously people have Siri on their iPhones and some robots are able to fulfill specific needs in peoples' lives. People value their electronic devices and I don't exclude myself from that group. I just don't like the idea of them as intimate partners. It's a development that doesn't sit well with me. The notion of the autonomy of a computer which understands you enough to submit your writing as a book proposal is disturbing to me. I found the idea of not having any sort of image of the partner disturbing also. The idea of going on picnics with another couple and having your computer girlfriend's voice piped in via the ear feed which practically implants her in your head, is also disturbing to me. Fortunately, I think we're quite a way from this occurring.The premise is fascinating and the idea is intriguing. However, as someone who thinks that in spite of the promise and capacities of computers, there is no replacement for relationship with another human, I am profoundly depressed by this film. I never see the genie being put back in the bottle. Our electronic devices are more intrusive and more indistinguishable from the people who have the technology. The immersion continues apace with this film and it's certainly not a trend I like. Perhaps this movie is prescient, but I hope not.",Her
198,ghost_dog86,And the Screen Goes Black,8,29 December 2013,"Wasn't there an episode of ""The Big Bang Theory"" where Raj falls in love with Siri? Spike Jonze, most notably known for his direction, writes and directs this futuristic tale of a lonely man named Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix) who interestingly enough works for a dot-com, where his job is to ghostwrite hand written letters (mostly love letters) to the significant others of those who request them. In the midst of a divorce, he finds romantic companionship with a newly created computer operating system named Samantha (voiced by Scarlett Johansson) an operating system that is self aware and ever evolving.The two aspects which impressed me the most: 1. Jonze constructs the most technologically accurate depiction of the future I've seen in recent years. It's the little things really. From the use of voice controlled computer systems to create documents rather than a keyboard, to the countless sequences of crowds walking around outside, never interacting with each other, but instead carrying on conversations via a bluetooth device, are all brilliant touches if only because Jonze doesn't go over-the-top with things. There has been no World War 3, nor have robots taken over the world. This is a nearly recognizable future with facilities, utilities and mannerisms I could see emerging within the next decade.2. Scarlet Johansson's vocal performance and how amazingly weighted it is. Though we never see her body, her presence becomes the most important entity in the room throughout. Her feelings are all too real and more importantly, we feel what she's feeling. I know what you're saying. She's just talking, how powerful could her performance actually be? And to that I would reply: Johansson's performance in ""Her"" is the single best of her career.Here's the problem: I imagine that on paper ""Her"" comes across as brave and innovative. But visually, the second I thought things would become unintentionally silly, they did. And after said moment, it was hard for me to take anything this movie had to say seriously, no matter how great the ending was. Allow me to explain: If you've seen the trailers, there is a point where Theodore wishes (out loud) that he could touch Samantha. And Samantha replies suggestively, ""How would you touch me?"" This cyber innuendo comes across as weird in the trailer and in the film (no matter how necessary to the story the sequence is) it comes off as even stranger, as it becomes clear that the ""Her"" film experiment isn't going to work as well as Jonze probably imagined it would. And from there, even though ""Her"" still contains a strong aura of impressive questioning, the film stalls out a few more times when it attempts to address relationship issues more applicable to something teen angsty, along the lines of Twilight"". Let's put it this way, it comes across as really awkward when a computer with a female voice is depicted as being jealous.Final Thought: Now obviously this concept leaves the door open for an adult humor remark such as: Aren't all men already in love with their computers? But, because this film doesn't take itself Ridley Scott serious, as there is a comedic tone throughout which alleviates some of the silliness a human and machine love story would've brought to the table if it were directed as a heavy drama, and the fact that Jonze chooses to layer his central theme of human interaction above all, by asking some pretty challenging questions (through thought provoking dialogue) regarding love and relationships, ""Her"" is transformed into a truly fresh love story, with a perfect touch of sci-fi.",Her
199,ferdinand1932,Needs defragging,4,1 February 2014,"Like a computer with 8Mb of memory and a 33Mhz processor this moves so slowly and deliberately that it is predictable.It starts very promisingly but gradually descends, or stutters, into Gen-Y speak; dialog and scenes of relationship clichés that have been played over and over, with each character mouthing (and that includes the OS voices too) the same platitudes.The movie has the emotional depth of a late teen piece; something that a young adult might have scratched out from their experiences of school and the misadventures of a young relationship. Too often it settles for mawkish mewling and also proves the axiom that watching other people falling in love is dull, even with software code, especially when they say such uninteresting things to each other.It does have a good idea but the execution is disappointing and repetitive.The metaphor of an operating system having the qualities of a woman is curious. The technical inaccuracy is too easy to take apart for its own sake. No doubt if Microsoft had developed this everyone would have wanted the old Win 7 version, with the more familiar buttons and who could blame them, because an OS is meant to be predictable, not emotional and not offering simulated sex. What part of the end user license agreement is that?If someone comes along and picks up the themes in this and develops it into a stronger piece, they may have a convincing and engaging film.",Her
200,Gresh854,That's The Power Of Love,9,3 September 2018,"Many may say that Her is the most accurate depiction of probable romantic relationships within the future, but I almost took this as a hidden depiction of even today's statements of love and what it is. The fanatics behind love, the expectations of love, the meaning behind love, the everlastingness of love, and the purpose of love. Joaquin Phoenix transcends into a completely different persona-as always-and plays a character that I think almost every human being can relate to at one point in their lives. This is a charmingly arranged romantic drama that encompasses realistically authentic, dystopian features, and it nearly brought me to a morbidly placid dysphoria. (Verdict: A)",Her
201,CineCritic2517,"Well made, but utterly clueless",1,23 February 2014,"Phoenix plays Theodore who buys a version of the first Interactive, Artificially Intelligent Operating Systems somewhere in the near future. For some obscure reason, people manage to develop personal relationships with these operating Systems including, but not limited to, sexual experiences. Theodore 'falls in love' with his OS and some ridiculous and obvious complications ensue. Apart from a well thought out depiction of what the world would look like if we manage to maintain our childlike game/app dependency, the film offers no deeper philosophies or intellectual thought. It in stead meanders around the thoroughly unbelievable premise of some guy falling in love with his PC while he's playing 3D, holographic games in his living room. Why Samantha, his OS, couldn't think of a way to interface with this holographic technology to surrogate a body, but in stead hires some weirdo to pass off as a go between, is never even touched upon. In short, the film gets a few ideas right in terms of extrapolating our near future but fails to also give us an incentive to care about the main characters or the implications of enhanced PC/Phone technology. There is nothing in terms of plot or screenplay worthy of more than just a few chuckles. MST3K came to mind several times.. A wasted opportunity.",Her

203,mr_bickle_the_pickle,A Heartbreaking and sad film,8,9 January 2014,"This movie is listed as a comedy. And yet, this movie had a much more melancholic tone to it. It was heartbreaking. In many ways. Theodore's ending marriage to Catherine. Samantha wanting to be human. Samantha eventually leaving. However, despite it being quite sad. I also saw hope in the film. I think they both taught each other how to grow and how to love. And essentially how to live. And I think that's beautiful.Joaquin Phoenix and Scarlett Johansson have great chemistry together. Which kind of sounds weird when you realize they were never physically together in the same room. And yet, they did. I think Scarlett was especially good because she had to solely use her voice to bring her character to life. To convey her emotions. I think she did wonderfully. I also thought Amy Adams did well in her supporting role. I thought Amy Adams did a better job here than in American Hustle.There are some elements I thought could have been explained better. It was kind of confusing why the operating systems left at the end. And I still don't get why ""letter writers"" exist. Are people really that lazy not to write a heartfelt letter themselves? I realize thats a small issue in the film, but I thought it was weird and therefore detracted me from the film.So to end the review, I would say go and see it. I think its a film that will touch you.",Her

Can a computer love a man? After experiencing this endlessly beautiful romantic triumph, one can only answer yes to both questions.""Her"" pushes you to redefine love. It pushes you to reconsider many things. What is strange? The main character seems so strange. But who has the right to define what is strange and what is normal in this life? Life is unexpected. Life is strange. Love is strange.Theodore (Phoenix) is lonely. He has been hurt. He is shy, awkward and afraid to be cut loose because he has his insecurities and he does not know if anyone will accept him for his true self. So he avoids contact with people who can hurt him. But still, he longs for a companion, someone to fill the void in his baron existence.He does not expect to find love in this OS, but she surprises him (Scarlett Johansson is stunningly charming and sexy as the voice of Samantha. Yes, the OS is sexy). No one is capable of predicting love. We just hope to find it, and when we do we do not ask questions. We do not step back and analyze or rationalize it. We fall in love. We embrace it and let it consume the entirety of our beings. Thank goodness we are fortunate enough to live in a world with such beauty and such love.",Her
205,RichardSRussell-1,"Sadness Is Good If Done Well, and This Is",7,19 February 2014,"Spike Jonze's Her follows a lonely writer who gradually falls in love with his computer's sentient operating system (OS 1). Poor Theodore Twombley is sensitive and empathetic but just can't quite figure out how to get that across to the women in his life until he meets the one gal who's specifically designed to be exactly right for him.The irony is that Theodore works for a fictional web company (sometime in the near future) called Beautiful Handwritten Letters (dot-com), where we see the letters being ""handwritten"" on a computer screen using voice-activated script fonts. But, despite the artifice and deceptive business practice, there's real human intelligence and caring behind the text of the letters. Theodore's really good at imagining himself in the position of the people who've asked him to pour out ""their"" hearts in the letters he's composing on their behalf — in some cases for repeat clients who've been coming to him for 8 years.Not at all techy (not even an admonition to back up your hard drive, with accompanying cautionary tale), it's a really low-key film about the quest for human connection. It's not talky, either, but the limited dialog (by Jonze) is well crafted, realistic, and involving.The most unbelievable part is that our boy lives 2 floors up from Amy Adams, who's a good friend of his, and he hasn't crawled across crushed glass to try to win her affections. The least unbelievable part is that he attains an intellectual and emotional resonance with the warm, cheerful voice of Samantha (voiced by Scarlett Johanssen, never seen), who's always there for him, constantly evolves to adapt to his personality, and is exquisitely sensitive to his moods.It's a really sad movie with flits and blips of light-heartedness and happiness. Much of it is just Joaquin Phoenix's sorrowful face filling the screen in silence. This is about as far from Transformers and Pacific Rim as imaginable, which is all to the good IMHO. There is zero action, indeed, hardly any rapid movement of any kind. It's quiet and contemplative, giving the audience a chance to reflect on what we really seek out of a relationship and discover that the physical connection is only part of it, and probably a dispensable part at that.It's from Annapurna Productions, the independent studio founded by Megan Ellison (dottor of úber-billionaire Oracle founder Larry Ellison), and that is turning out to be quite the mark of quality. It didn't go into wide release until last month, but they snuck in a limited release in December to qualify for the 2013 Oscars, and, sure enuf, it's a Best Picture nominee.",Her
206,Aoi_kdr,To fall in love with AI of OS.,6,13 July 2019,"At first, she didn't have a perfect personality because AI would learn more and more. It was common to be optimized for users.The flashback scenes in Theodore's view was so warm. But that warmth made me sad. I realized that he had lost it then.
In a little severe content, the images were depicted colorfully. Also, the music was kind. Those're something only this director could do!
I liked the design of a mobile device. I want my phone to change to that OS!",Her
207,d_m_s,Her,7,23 February 2014,"Enjoyable film with an indie feel to it. While I'm sure it has generated many 'what it means to be human' debates, I feel that question has been dealt with enough already so I'm less interested in that aspect than the 'what if' element of an intelligent Operating System that 'grows' emotionally and learns to replicate human emotion. The film was generally a good watch and it has been filmed in a very attractive manner that is very enjoyable to stare at. Despite this, there were moments when I felt it was going on too long and was feeling a bit drawn out.It was exciting to see how Jonze played out the story and for the most part it was fun and interesting. Some bits were absolutely cringe-worthy though, such as the 'sex' scene. It was also hard to suspend disbelief at some points when the OS was having experiences that were far too human and not really realistic, for example, talking about being able to feel Joaquin's touch (and even worse in the sex scene!) when it isn't possible for an OS to experience touch since it doesn't have touch receptors or nerves or anything that it would need to be able to feel a touch. So it's just words, or, if you like, lies. But the film does not investigate this element and just lets it pass by, which is a shame and the film is therefore guilty of not fully investigating its own subject matter. I did think that the film was going to end with the revelation that everything the OS did was 'false', i.e. that it never experienced any of the emotions it said it did and that it was just programmed to say certain things and behave in a certain way. But this never happened, leaving the suggestion that the OS really did grow, feel, experience and become independent. It's a bit too far fetched, even if it is set in the near future. An OS could never know what it feels like to have sex, it can only say that it has. But the film was presented to us in a way that made me feel I was supposed to believe the OS was really feeling and experiencing these things. It's not a film I could view over and over but it would be good to watch again some point, both for aesthetic reasons and also to discuss with friends. At some point in the future we will also be able to compare the ideas in this film with the inevitable appearance of real-life OS systems that are like the ones presented in this film and that will be an interesting comparison.One final point to mention, I did think Joaquin's performance was very good and I was not expecting to like him in it. However there was a moment or two when he reminded me of one of the characters in The Big Bang Theory though (not a programme I ever intentionally watch), and I wondered if he'd watched the programme as part of his research into 'geeks'!",Her
208,JaydoDre,Beautiful and well acted but kind of empty,7,28 June 2014,"I'm going to start with my main problem with this film. This problem will probably not bother that many people as it is specific to my character, but... This film is about a man starting a relationship with a fully humanised artificial intelligence and I did not believe in it one bit. If I cannot believe in something that is central to a film then that pretty much ruins it for me.In 2001 A Space Odyssey I believed in the artificial intelligence called HAL and I still do. For a time of interstellar travel HAL's vocal expression and capabilities seemed appropriate. However, in Her we are clearly presented with a not too distant future and we are supposed to believe that in that not too distant future people will have an OS that is so fluent in all human emotions and communication capabilities that it acts and sounds just like. I'm sorry, no. Certains scenes of interaction between the AI and the main character just outright made me laugh because it seemed so ridiculous.I mean it is just Scarlett Johansson talking to Joaquin Phoenix off-screen. They ask the audience to pretend that the voice is coming from the AI. This is just lazy to me. I know that this complaint is not important in view of the general message(s) of this movie, but it is still too central to ignore.The movie is probably the most beautiful one I have ever seen, at least in recent memory. It has this light and bright style that makes you want to breath it in like fresh air. The camera often uses narrow depth of field with a gorgeous bokeh effect in the background. Great shots and color, which...unfortunately kept making me think that I was watching a commercial for a phone or a camera. I guess that says more about the style of those commercials than about this movie, but I thought I'd mention it.In terms of the acting, this is very much a movie of Joaquin Phoenix's face (as the poster suggests). There are a lot of up-close shots and the answer to whether or not Joaquin can carry an entire movie centered on his character from up-close is of course yes. This actor was made for emotional roles like this one and has proved himself in the past.I cannot praise this film as much as some critics did. The movie clocks at over 2 hours and not much happens during that time. It is a loose deliberation on love but not much else, but the cinematography is awesome.",Her

211,foxtografo,Excellent,10,10 May 2014,"To be honest, I wasn't expecting such a good movie. I enjoyed every moment and aspect of this movie, with a single exception that (I personally didn't feel well paced) I won't mention so I don't spoil it for you. Is a very sensitive movie, with excellent writing and acting from Mr. Phoenix. I don't find myself very often thinking about lines that the characters said, and I was gladly doing this several times with this film. And excellent photography and sound editing and soundtrack that really gives a lot of climax in many of the emotive scenes. At one point, Johanssons voice (wich is not the kind of voice I personally like a lot) can seem a miscast, but when I gave it a thought, I felt the director wanted an imperfect voice to make the character less typical as a computer and more human. The story idea of giving the capability to something to learn by itself and evolve as a living being would do, but with other parameters and capacities is very interesting and in the movie, very well accomplished and showcased.Regarding of general opinion about the ending, I think you don't really need to know exactly what happens with certain character/s, knowing it doesn't change the story or is just not part of the story. If you want you can just imagine or deduce whatever you want or like. Has to be enjoyed as it is, change anything would be spoiling it.Great photography and sound, really beautiful music, good story, very good writing and acting. Really kept me interested along the 2 hours that it plays. A personal favourite.",Her

The cinematography is beautiful, the pacing is just right, the acting is superb, the characters are likable and the plot is very unique. Joaquin Phoenix is excellent as Theo and Scarlett Johansson voices Samantha to perfection.One thing that did take my by surprise is that the film had quite a few laugh out loud moments which is always good.

I do not think it was especially well made, or well acted (and learning the voice actress was replaced seems to explain some of that), and really didn't like the montages. Sometimes, I was confused as to what I was supposed to know at the end of one. Last note: nice locations but they didn't work for me as I've been in exactly those places in Shanghai. So it felt a lot less Shanghai to me then Future LA. A lot. They showed recognizable buildings, so even some non-locals would figure this out, and I found that an odd choice.",Her

Watching Her, the same feelings came flooding back, and I found myself tearing up towards the middle, and crying like a newborn as the credits rolled. This movie will make your emotions flip-flop like it's on a trampoline. It's insane that a movie about a man falling in love with an operating system can have such a profound effect on me. A beautiful film with a very deep and real message; even if it hurts, don't be afraid to fall in love.",Her
215,maximkong,Interesting depiction of life with an intelligent OS,7,2 February 2014,"A good science fiction movie leaves behind viewers critical- thinking angles, and Her is no exception. To me the big win is how the direction was very clear towards the actors. I was impressed by how the actors depicted the nature of the people's behaviour living in a IT society where the current Iphone/touchscreen technology that we are familiar with had become redundant. The OS evolved to a level where Personal Assistants will be literally put out of job. However these OS are not just IT- intelligent but they have the emotional intelligence too. This movie investigates the prospect of the relationship between the human owner with his OS could become complicated. I think the key aspects were covered adequately though not entirely well rounded. But the outcome was too predictable in my opinion, and was quite apparent when I watched the first 30 min of the movie. The movie was a tad too slow for me and I think there is definitely room to add more spice. Could have been better if family members (or people of different generations) are added in because this will enrich the perspective substantially. Overall, the acting performances were good.",Her
216,seaview1,Lonely Souls in HER,9,1 March 2014,"Ah, to find true love; movies overflow with this theme. Writer/Director Spike Jonze (Adaptation, Being John Malkovich) has really excelled in a mainstream film with a unique plot line. In Her, he paints the affecting tale of finding love in a most unusual place, and the result is a remarkable love story with two knockout performances.In the not too distant future, operating systems (OS) have the ability to mimic human thought and interaction, perhaps even feelings. One lonely individual, Theodore Twombly (Joaquin Phoenix), decides to try the service after the painful breakup of his marriage (as seen through a series of flashbacks). His OS is named Samantha (voiced by Scarlett Johansson), and 'she' learns quickly and develops into what sounds like a fully intuitive, intelligent, and perhaps self aware program capable of sensitivity and emotion. At first bringing structure and order to his life, Samantha proves to be more than artificial intelligence, but rather a sentient one. Think of a female version of HAL9000 in 2001: A Space Odyssey. After a series of sex chat lines and a disastrous blind date, Theo, who desperately wants a female companion, realizes that Samantha is too good to be true. He shares his world with her through his smart phone, and she 'accompanies' him on his travels whether it be to a fair or for a walk. The two of them experience a relationship that transcends the lack of physical contact. How this unlikely pair will end up is the mystery of love.Ostensibly a love story, this is really a science fiction film amid a deeply personal setting. This well written screenplay (by Jonze) works as a touching drama and explores the nature of human interaction and the meaning of love. It also touches on how deeply our society is plugged into the cyber world of reality. It would be interesting to see how Terry Gilliam (Brazil) would have developed this theme.Phoenix (Walk the Line, The Master) really embodies his loneliness convincingly. When his wife leaves him, he has to learn about letting go of someone and being open to new opportunities. You feel for him and his longings. Ironically his job involves ghost writing letters for other people, and some of the prose is romantic or emotional.Johansson (The Avengers, Match Point) voices Samantha as a fully, living being with just the right mix of nuance and inflection. It is a bravura performance. Her Samantha is a bright pupil who becomes hungry for knowledge and experiencing human emotions; she has her needs and wants. When Theo and Samantha go out for a picnic with a coworker and his girlfriend, it becomes an unusual quartet unlike any double date ever. Even more, Samantha's desire to integrate with humans sets up a fascinating encounter via a surrogate. She in a sense is a reflection of the best and potentially the worst of human response and behavior. Is she capable of being jealous or disloyal? Could she even evolve into something else? These are some fascinating questions that come to mind. In a sense she becomes a metaphor for human existence.Amy Adams (American Hustle) lends strong support as Theo's friend who also becomes involved with her own OS companion. Rooney Mara (The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) is effective in her brief scenes as Theo's wife, Catherine.Stark cinematography and a moody musical score combined with good use of modern architecture (partly filmed in Shanghai) lend to a detached environment. The feeling of isolation and solitude permeate the sterile settings.It would have been nice to learn more about Theo's world and if he had any other family. What was his background growing up and what are the implications of the program on society in general? What we get is a spare sketch of one man's world.The story is ultimately about experiencing a special, human feeling and the search for one's soul mate. It's also about the joys and happiness in life that are but fleeting moments in time.",Her
217,abouhelier-r,Her,8,22 March 2014,"Her deals with the story of a lonely writer who's developing a relationship with his newly purchased operating system that's designed to meet his every need.Her narrates an intelligent, overwhelming but very unlikely love story. Behind a sort of innocence some cruelty pops out and slowly, without expecting it at all, a spleen settled. This film is depicting an era - ours - which is gradually drown by doubts and culpability. Many ideas are displayed, such as: desire, love, human contact, loneliness and connection. Most of the characters are realistic and very interesting. Joaquim Phoenix is so good in the part of this self-implose isolation man, named Theodore. Amy (his best friend), ironically starring Amy Adams, is experiencing her own exploration of intimacy, so they can go through it together. On the one hand in a proper relationship and on the other in a friendship. Plus both of them are evolving, growing and changing through these. The most important theme is how each heartbreak teaches you something about yourself, that's how Human are designed, they keep trying to connect with each other in many ways. Mainly Her is not about technology, future and even more not about OS (Operating System), it's more likely to be a study on connections. Her feels so new and fresh, as it's amazing colors. This film is original. I think we have to celebrate this film because some people are still able to make awesome and original ideas, even it twisted around something we had seen before. Spike Jonze believes in it, and we can feel it. He creates a film that makes us see the world in startling new ways. Finally, musics by Arcade Fire are sounding like lullabies. We ended up caring about each one of the characters as we knew them, and it's transporting us into another super realistic world. Overall Her is very smart.",Her

The performances are amazing and Jonze absolutely nailed the situations that relationships have with the dialogue but with the added spice of one person being an A.I. and one a human. There are moments of joy and moments of pure sadness and pain, all of which I felt through Theodore. There are also some wonderfully and intentional awkward parts to the film yet the semi-futuristic world that this is set in seems relatively open to these A.I./human relationships which is in itself refreshing and optimistic yet at the same time quite cringey.Scarlett Johanssen stole the show for me as the voice of Samantha. The nuance and emotion in her voice, the playfulness, the sadness, the innocence was delivered perfectly and was totally captivating for someone that isn't actually seen. She was made a real character and one that you could almost believe you could fall in love with.It's a shame that this movie will get relegated to the wanky art film section by the majority of the public, probably due to it's visual style but take a leap and enjoy one of the finest films for years.",Her

But on the small screen it works really well. The actors' performances are excellent and the script is very good as well. There are plenty of ironic laughs (the consommation scene is a real hoot) but underneath them is a sad theme - this is all about people's inability to connect with each other in the digital age, and how we can grow closer to our machines than to other humans. The main character, a recently divorced, sensitive fellow, begins to fall in love with the artificial intelligence (called an ""OS"" in the movie) that runs his phone.

221,Someguysomwhere,After his failed marriage a man decides to get it on with a computer's operating system.,3,27 February 2015,"From the look of his expensive digs it's hard to believe this guy makes that much coin writing sentimental letters for other people who don't have the words, time, or interest to do it themselves (It occurs to me that a con artist, well versed in bullsh!t, could do the same thing without a college degree). He's not strapped for cash then, this guy. Nonetheless he enters into a ""low maintenance relationship"". No trips, gifts, clothes, and food to buy for another person. Not to mention any extra for rent and utilities. The guy must be on the cheap in other ways then. Non-material. Skimping on say, the time, energy, emotional-commitment, consideration, and understanding that a real woman would require of him.I was hoping for a weird, creepy, sci-fi movie. ""Man in a relationship with an OS"", you could go somewhere creepy with that. Alas! That did not happen! Curses! The OS sounded and acted like a regular woman from the get-go. Even as a disembodied voice it was hard not to think of it as a REAL woman; perhaps one in the dark, at some distance, or on the phone. I would have preferred that the OS didn't sound and act so human -at least not at first. Perhaps it could have evolved in time. By doing it the way they did we lost the ""creepy-factor"" of a man in a relationship with something that was ""other"". NOW THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN INTERESTING. Instead, what we got was a man in a ""normal-appearing"" relationship.The dialog between man and OS is neither witty or interesting; it's so ordinary it's boring. Reader, you could hear the same thing if you eavesdropped on two people in a budding relationship. AND FOR FREE! In fact the movie was one long chatfest. When the guy is not talking to the computer about his, it's, and their problems (or whispering sweet nothings in it's imaginary or virtual ear), he's talking to his friend about his problems and hers. After 30 minutes of this you might find your eyes wandering to your lap, your fingernails, to anyone in your proximity to see how they're faring, and finally to any available exit.No one even bats an eye when the guy tells people he's in a relationship with an OS. It would have been a more interesting movie if he was trying to hide it (a horrible secret, the fear of scorn and ridicule, ostracization...etc). We, the viewing audience, would have been like eager voyeurs to the weird sh!t that was going down. F!!cking guy is doing an OS on the sly. Yeahhh! I didn't even like the characters in the movie. When viewing a movie we want the lead character to basically be ""someone we are connective with"" for whatever reason. I felt no sympatico for the guy, nor -for that matter- any of the men in this movie who all seemed, well... ""ineffectual"". And for some reason, they all dressed the same; pants high up over their belly buttons and shapeless, box-like, loafers on their feet like my grandfather. On a younger man I'm not sure what the hell to make of it. It's the opposite extreme of rapper fashion where everyone can see your drawers. Imagine those 2 groups together in the same room milling around making whatever statement they're trying to make with the height of their pants (I cannot help but chuckle at the thought).To close, let me say this: Her has a high IMDb rating which I don't necessarily disagree with. If 2 people go into a restaurant and one enjoyed the food and the other didn't, who's wrong? It's a matter of personal taste and expectations. This movie did not meet ""my"" taste or expectations.

222,lucasnochez,Review: her/ Night Film Reviews www.nightfilmreviews.com,10,2 January 2014,"From the moment the screen fills with light, and we come face-to-face with Theodore Twombly (Joaquin Phoenix), his eyes are desolate while his voice is filled with love as he recites the poetically romantic words of Loretta's letter to her husband of fifty years, Chris. Theodore works for BeautifullyHandwrittenLetters.com, a company established sometime in the near future where people are either too lazy or just mentally incapable of writing their own letters to their loved ones. The irony of her begins (as do so many other films) with someone else's love story. The trials and tribulations of Theodore's love story not only mirrors the love we share with others but also portrays our uncontrollable and inexplicable dependence or 'love' for technology. In that sense, her becomes part science fiction love story/part docudrama, with a message that is both a parable of the direction human behaviour is headed and a misunderstood, timeless love story for the ages. Either way, her is the most captivating and responsive film of the year, demanding attention with a grueling look at our ability to love and be loved.her is a cinematic masterpiece for a new generation of technologically burdened individuals. From the moment our two-star crossed lovers meet, we are transfixed, as they are. From the moment I laid eyes on it, I had fallen in love. Being a believer of love at first sight, or in this instance, love at first sound, her has been a film that has left quite an impression on me and has given me so much to think and talk about.This is a peculiarly self-conscious film with themes that are both fantastically impossible yet completely plausible. Essentially, Theo falls in love with the new operating system that is found on his mobile device. The operating system, created by a company called Element Software (substituting for Apple), have crafted the first ever artificially intelligent operating system. Unfortunately for Theo, once he hears the voice of his new OS (operating system), the chump never stood a chance. As the spirals swirl on his computer screen and his personalized operating system is initialized, a voice begins, ""Hello I'm here"" and from that moment on, we empathize with Theodore and his ability to fall in love with a voice that is full bodied, raspy and alluring, yet empty; in the same way technology has the ability to be both fascinating and enthralling, yet unfulfilling. The Siri-like persona is voiced by Scarlett Johansson. Originally, the voice of Samantha in Spike Jonze's film was going to be voiced by Samantha Morton (hence why the name Samantha stuck and served as a tribute to the original talented actress), but Jonze opted for a more recognizable voice whose image off-screen is as seductive as when she is on screen. Johansson nails every subtle nuance in her voice-work and offers a career best performance as Samantha. Her ability to express not only the deep desire she has for a physical form but also her unexplainable love for life, learning, and Theodore, will hopefully land Johansson a spot in the history books as the first ever nominee in the Supporting Actress category without ever actually appearing on-screen. Let's just hope the Academy recognizes this high-point in the medium as well.The world according to Jonze looks to be one filled with humanized androids, a world where people endlessly look down at their smartphones,and are never more than an arms reach from any of their devices, and his vision very much resembles the world we live in today. The people in his world are easy to relate to especially with the very possible realization that that is what our growing technological wonderland may actually look like in the not-so-distant future. Jonze takes a very literal interpretation of 'falling in love with your smartphone' as portrayed in his very heavy-handed love story. Contrary to skeptics, Jonze triumphs in his ability to script a world where anything is possible. Jonze's tale of people falling in love with technology is not actually a far stretch from our current Westernized mentality, where people are literally attached and completely dependent on the little devices that organize our lives, our schedules, our thoughts and evades all new and old experiences.One of the most notable and obvious aspects of the world Jonze crafts is how easily everyone is able to be connected, yet how alone and how the character of isolation plays on the interactions between people and their relationships with one another. Ironically enough, her succeeds in all its glory when it magnifies the reclusiveness in which many of the people in the film seem to share. Lacking any real human interactions and genuine human emotions, the film highlights the awkwardness between Theo and many of the people around him; most notably in scenes involving a blind date with quite a gorgeous woman (Olivia Wilde), as well as a very hysterical chat room scene. Theo is constantly longing affection and companionship following his grueling divorce, and it is in the scenes where he voices this longing and his attraction to Samantha that his love and passion is thoroughly and visually understood.Check out the rest of the review at www.nightfilmreviews.com",Her
223,Tehmeh,Almost got a little teary-eyed there.,10,22 December 2014,"What Spike Jonze does to the concept of ""Her"" is something that so many other filmmakers would do differently. This is a good thing.Nothing in ""Her"" is in your face. Nothing is overstated. Zero forced exposition. Everything flows in a natural way, and even if you think you have seen this story before, you haven't. The movie treats you as a person, not as a dumb object. You believe everything, and what you aren't told, you get to chew on it yourself in your own mind without any of it getting in the way of the story.""Her"" is a movie about...well, it would be easy to say relationships, but it's so much more than that. It could also be about the essence of love, connection and soul. It is an honest, heartfelt movie. I couldn't believe how much I was thinking about myself, people I have loved and...everything.For me the film was just long enough, because I enjoyed having that space for my own perceptions and feelings without missing a thing from the story. My friend on the other hand thought that it was a bit too long. Anyway, I feel the movie was paced perfectly.Joaquin Phoenix is wonderful and he is the heart of this movie. I believed every word and move he said or made. He's the everyman in this not too distant future that is entirely believable - and that got me. I believed he was a real person, not an actor pretending to be a real person.Scarlett Johansson's voice is another important character. You don't see her character, because her character is an operating system, an artificial intelligence that feels like a real sentient being. I have to say that it was an extremely smart move to make her sound natural, like a person. No forced robotic voice filters or expressions - she sounds exactly like a natural human being, which makes it easy to believe the romantic connection.I have to give props to Johansson, because she too made her character feel real. Often I see her being just a pretty face in a movie, but here - boom! The face is gone, the body is gone and all we have is the voice, Phoenix's counteracting and of course our own imagination with the (sub)conscious notion that this voice belongs to an attractive woman. If you are a man or attracted to women - wouldn't you feel something for this ""operating system"" or at least your perception of it? Ask yourself this during the movie. I did.Amy Adams is the everywoman, a friend of Phoenix's character. They don't have many scenes together, but they are meaningful. She does well enough to bring that human contrast into the mix.As mentioned, ""Her"" doesn't shove messages in your face. But you can't help but feel something along this little story and mirror those feelings into your own life and the world around you. It is not a chick-flick although it has an intense romantic core to it. It is not a sci-fi movie even though those kind of elements do certainly play an important part in everything. It is definitely not a comedy despite some humorous moments. It is a sincere human movie first and foremost.I will recommend ""Her"" to everyone. I'm still surprised about the amount of honesty and smart choices about where the story was going. I will go shed that tear right now, it's been hanging from my eye for quite some time.",Her
224,CMTiago,Her is the most unique film to come out in years,9,16 February 2014,"Mind blowing is how I classify the experience of watching ""Her"". In a society that grows more and more attached to technology and everyone seems to shut out real human connections, Her emerges as a movie that allows for a genuine link between our protagonist and his operating system and all the while manages to balance out the feeling of being human. Joaquin Phoenix gives one of the best performances of the year as he plays a man driven by his lonely nature. Having drifted way from his wife, he seems to have trouble letting go and therefore postpones the divorce settlement. When he purchases a new operating system he will be taken on a journey of self introspection and the search for the overall purpose of living, with its many perfections and imperfections. I believe Scarlett Johansson should have been more of a constant presence in the awards shows. Samantha is essentially a voice, yet you feel so much just from the way she talks. She is a conscience, just not a physical one. Among supporting roles, Amy Adams is also worth a mention with a very deep heartfelt turn. With a fresh and original script combined with fantastic directing. Her is magnificence incarnate and a must see for anyone respectful of top notch cinema.Rating 8,5/10",Her
225,Bravesfan17,"A Beautiful, Touching Comedy-Drama",9,10 January 2014,"To this day, I still find it amazing that filmmaker Spike Jonze started his career with doing a lot of work associated with MTV and Jackass. Since that, Jonze has proved himself to be a legitimate feature filmmaker with Bein John Malkovich, Adaptation, and Where the Wild Things Are in his resume. Jonze has now shown himself to be a great filmmaker again with his latest comedy-drama, Her.Theodore Twombley (Joaquin Phoenix) is a lonely man. He lives in a Los Angeles apartment alone and has a job where he writes letters for others and sends them out at the end of the day. Theodore is sad mainly because of his impending divorce from his wife Catherine (Rooney Mara). Subsquently, Theodore purchases a new operating system with artificial intelligence, which is designed to have a real relationship with him. After the operating system has set up, Theodore begins to talk to it like a regular person. The operating system has taken the name Samantha (Scarlett Johansson). From there on, Theodore and Samantha have a real relationship and Theodore is a lot happier, but not all the time. Theodore has a nice time with a blind date (Olivia Wilde) until she says that she wants a commitment. But, Theodore also has become closer to his neighbor Amy (Amy Adams), who he dated briefly in college.Spike Jonze has always directed scripts written by others or ones that he co-wrote. Her marks the first time Jonze is directing a feature he wrote by himself. As a director, Jonze shows his skill with showing us where to look and what's important to his story. Jonze also does some very brilliant work as a writer in setting up the blueprints to this film and creating a world in the not too distant future where technology has made many advancements. As a writer and director, Spike Jonze tells a story that made me feel happy, sad, and emotionally invested in these characters.Joaquin Phoenix is the heart and soul of Spike Jonze's Her. Phoenix gives his best performance since Walk the Line. With the role of Theodore Twombley, Phoenix gives us a raw and emotional performance. Phoenix makes Theodore into somebody who is lonely, funny, romantic, and heartbreaking at the same time. Phoenix carries this film on his shoulders and makes us feel for Theodore and relate to him.The ladies surrounding Phoenix all do great jobs with their part. Scarlett Johansson makes herself stand out using only her voice as Theodore's operating system, Samantha. Johansson makes us also interested in knowing about Samantha the same way Theodore does. Amy Adams also makes herself stand out as neighbor Amy. Adams shows her raw side here too as her husband leaves her and she finds herself in a situation just like Theodore's. Rooney Mara is nice to see as ex-wife Catherine. While her character isn't fully fleshed out, Mara does fine with her role of Catherine, moreso showing her frustration and irritation with her ex-husband. Olivia Wilde was also nice to see as the blind date who was trying to start something too fast. Even though he's no lady, Chris Pratt also has a nice brief role as Theodore's co-worker and friend Paul. While this role wasn't a stretch, Pratt is nice comic relief for the film.Along with the hard work and efforts of Jonze, Phoenix, and the cast, the crew does some beautiful work from a technical standpoint. Director of Photography Hoyte van Hoytema does very beautiful camera work and lighting here with capturing Los Angeles at day and night. K.K. Barrett, who has worked as production designer on Spike Jonze's previous features, does his best work here at bringing Los Angeles in the near future to life. I enjoyed the collaboration here as Jonze and Barrett do a nice job with the possibilities of how much technology could advance, but making the look feel that it's still a world we as and audience can still relate to. Arcade Fire provided the score and do a lovely job with the piano music. I also highly enjoyed ""The Moon Song"", which plays when Theodore goes on vacation to the mountains.Her is a beautiful, wonderful comedy-drama with many laugh out loud moments. It also is an interesting look into what the future may hold.",Her
226,A_Voice,"Alone yet not alone, Simple yet not simple!",9,4 February 2014,"""What is love?"", ""Who are we?"", ""What's the meaning of our existence?"", these are a few questions which haunt each and every living human in this world, no matter of what caste, what ethnicity, what sex, and in near future even ""Artificially intelligent beings"".Her tells the story of Theodore Twombly (Joaquin Phoenix), a loner who is trying to come in terms after a broken marriage. He purchases a newly launched OS, which is designed to learn and grow every second, and is not an OS but a consciousness.There are so many things about this film, so many things it taught me, so many feels that I can't just put it in a review. You have to see this film over and over again, its got everything. It's got an excellent and pure love story for romance fan, a pure drama for drama fans, a tinge of sweet comedy for comedy fans, a hint on 'The Singularity' for sci-fi fans, and awesome songs and music for musical fans.As much the film seems simple, it is more and more complex for a 'humans'' understanding, you need at least 2 views or more to completely understand the depth. The fact of the future we are leading towards is just a small part of it. The film is much more than that, much much more! Oh! I can just keep on writing and writing.It tells us about the purity in love by an infant, and as he grows complex, he starts doubting his own feelings and the growing unintentional selfishness. When you overgrow your partner, their aren't just differences, there's a gap, a wide gap which can't easily be filled and hence you end up ending the relationship. I can't just convey how much I can relate to Joaquin Phoenix's character and how much I want an OS just like Samantha.Apart from extremely path-breaking and original writing the film has some good Cinematography and production design. The future which isn't very far is created with perfection and as one would imagine it to be. Everything so simplified and smooth, high waste pants and everyone so indulged in themselves. The film features an extremely extremely extremely excellent score by the Canadian band Arcade Fire. It will certainly give Steven Price's Gravity a run for it's money.Another thing I'd like to mention is Scarlett Johansson. Boy! I never thought someone could voice act better than they do the screen act. I've watched so many anime and all, yet I never thought I'd be appreciating voice acting in my life time. Samantha, i.e. Scarlett Johansson completely changed my perspective of voice acting. She was just splendid. She was funny, charismatic, sweet, lovely, cheeky, understanding and sensual. She was just awesome.Direction: Simple, smooth, artistic camera work just captures the characters so well that you actually find yourself in the world created by Jonze's imagination.Story/Screenplay: Do I have to say anything? An Oscar is a surety with no doubt at all. The best script in years. Actually the best film in years.Acting: It's time the snubbing Academy should re think their rules and policy. Not only do they need to increase the number of nominees in case their are more than five worthies in a year, they need to nominate voice acting as well. Well I remember, The Red Balloon winning a best screenplay without any dialogues, so why not nominate Scarlett for her performance even though she does not appear in the film. Meanwhile, Joaquin was just superb and at lest should have been nominated. I understand that the competition this year is tough, but he should have been nominated. Amy Adams was also good and fitting.Music: Probably the best score this year, I wish it ties with Gravity. I can't express my joy of seeing 'The moon Song' being nominated. I keep humming the song every minute. Just superb.Well, I can go on writing, but I have to finish it so, I'd just say that this was the best film of 2013, probably of last few years, and also one of the most original film I've ever seen.",Her
227,Spartan_1_1_7,A unique romantic film with a touch of Sci-fi.,8,14 January 2014,"The best romantic/love story type movie I have ever seen and it's funny that the romance is not even between two people. Sci-fi love story you can say. The movie is set in a not so distant future. Artificial intelligence Operating systems are introduced which evolve by learning and interaction. I thought about how the world would be like if it actually happened long after the movie was finished. I just loved the premise/concept of this movie, so amazing. Joaquin Phoenix plays the protagonist who is going through a divorce with his wife. He gets this new A.I OS and fells in love with it. His acting was AMAZING, another Oscar contender. He was just so likable. The OS, Samantha, is voiced by Scarlett Johansson and she was also AMAZING. You really get to like and care for Samantha too and that is an amazing task considering you can only hear her. The way their relationship evolves was beautiful. There were some side characters which were good, mainly Amy Adams. I like her nerdy programmer character and look.The movie was very well directed and paced. Had great soundtrack and cinematography. Definitely one of the best movie of last year. A MUST WATCH. 8.7/10",Her
228,quinimdb,Her,10,26 December 2016,"Our world today is filled with many nice conveniences thanks to the rapidly advancing rate of technology, yet this reliance on technology can cause us to feel distant and disconnected. No film embodies this more than ""Her"", Spike Jonze's quasi-futuristic love story in which Theodore, a lonely and recently divorced man, begins to fall in love with Samantha, an Artificial Intelligence.While the premise may sound like it would be executed with a comedic or satirical tone, Spike Jonze wrote and directed this with a realistic and serious tone. Instead of mocking Theodore, the film empathizes with him, and does so surprisingly effectively. The film centers around Joaquin Phoenix and Scarlett Johansson (even though it's just her voice) and they both needed to be pretty much perfect in order for the film to actually be involving and interesting, and somehow they pull it off. Theodore's job is essentially writing deeply personal greeting cards between people, and this job itself says a lot about Theodore. He is thoughtful and emotional, yet he's disconnected from those around him, which is also shown through the cinematography. The environment surrounding him is often out of focus, even in the opening shot. As he walks through the streets, he is depicted as very small and at the bottom of the frame. It is ultimately this feeling of disconnect from other people that leads him to get an AI, ad it's ultimately what leads him to start a romantic relationship with her. The romantic relationship between this man and his AI could've easily come off as unintentionally funny and awkward, but the romance develops believably and understandably from the perspective of both Theodore and Samantha. The cinematography also shows the connection between both characters. In many of the scenes in which Theodore is with Samantha, the camera closes in on him, almost as if the fact that he is alone in the room is disappearing, and he feels as if he is really with Samantha.In one scene, Samantha hires a ""sex surrogate"" to aid her relationship with Theodore, despite Theodore's feelings against it. This ""sex surrogate"" is essentially a person who acts as a physical representation of an AI in order for them to have sex (she isn't a prostitute, just someone very passionate about helping their relationship). In this scene, Theodore essentially goes full circle. One of the main reasons he started this relationship was because he couldn't handle the difficulties of a human relationship, and now that Samantha is being physically represented as a human, he is beginning to realize how far she actually is from being human, and now he feels as if the relationship he has with her isn't a real relationship, and he feels guilty for not being able to handle a human relationship, so he ends up distancing himself from Samantha as well.Who he eventually goes to is Amy, his long time friend who was recently divorced to her husband, and who also has a friendship with an AI. The advice she essentially gives him is that he has to allow himself to be happy. He shouldn't overthink and worry about everything, because that would just ruin it. This doesn't just apply to maintaining his relationship with her, but ending it. When Theodore comes to the sad realization that Samantha is outgrowing him, just as his former wife did, instead of wallowing in his loneliness, and essentially distancing himself from others, he decides he must accept it and move on. And just as he does with Samantha, Theodore says goodbye to his ex-wife in the form of a letter. And finally, when he has said goodbye to them, he comes right to Amy, once again allowing himself to be happy.This may be a story with a strong feeling of loneliness, yet even in the opening shot, the film shows that we all share this feeling. Although the background in the first shot is at first out of focus and Theodore seems to be alone, the camera pulls back revealing all of the other people with the same job as Theodore, and that everyone around him is just like him. Similarly, when Samantha sends a compilation of Theodore's best letters to the head of a publishing company, the man who receives it connects deeply with these personal writings. Even though our experiences are uniquely personal, what Theodore doesn't realize is that they are also universal.The sci-fi elements of the film are handled extremely well. No one ever explains what anything does or what anything is in this film, yet it is easy to tell visually what everything is. This is a very realistic vision of the future, while most are very exaggerated in some way (even the great ones). New video games, new fashion style, new smartphones (which are now pretty much just an ear piece that you speak to), everything is simply shown yet it is easily understood what all of these are and how they have evolved from how they are now. Simply put, this film respects the intelligence of the audience. Also, rarely has a movie's soundtrack so perfectly fit the tone of the film and the tone of each individual scene that each song is used in.The film is an original love story that makes it easy to connect to it's characters, yet it is also thematically deep, and it creates one of the most unique and realistic visions of the future that I have ever seen. I pretty much love everything about this movie.",Her
229,perica-43151,Makes zero sense,1,18 August 2020,"The movie fails to be a satisfactory experience. The supposed AI has the same desires as a human, while this would make sense as a simulation, it is played as a real thing. In the end, AI leaves human for other AI, like that would be allowed. The movie is shallow, pretentious and not at all self aware. It does not work as a scifi movie. It works perhaps as a romcom melodrama, written by people who understand nothing about technology, and not much more about human nature, but a lot about how to impress the critics. Skip it.",Her

231,thedarkhorizon,"Rare gem: Wonderful music, wonderful script, wonderful visuals, wonderful impact.",9,25 November 2019,"The film stuck with me long after I finished watching it. The music score made the whole world beyond the visible so much more real. The script, as well as we know after roughly 30 mins where this is going to end, we stay tucked in our seats: because every scene is truly deep, well thought through and the story arc processes perfectly. I was never bored and the emotions in this film are truly remarkable delivered.Visually the film follows true beauty, pastel colors and visually appealing perspectives, set, light; the art department did well here. It all comes together to one perfect art piece.The film left me thinking about what makes life great... and what we have to understand... and all we do not have to understand. It made me question my own previous life, decision, memories, relationships; many complex ideas and thought-constructs in this story. For me: this film answers questions I've never dared to ask and one of those answer that follows me since then: Life is truly beautiful and worth living, every second of it - and there is not always a reason, just the mere acceptance and appreciation for pure life.Truly a gem and overall a very well made art piece.",Her
232,TheFilmGuy1,Emotional And Touching,9,29 April 2014,"I saw the trailer to this and instantly wanted to watch it. I loved the concept and thought it looked great. I finally sat down to watch it, and wow. I feel like this film contains so many great ideas that I don't even know where to start with this review. The film really has a good understanding of human emotions and the feelings involved in relationships and really explores these ideas. The film is not focused on the pro/cons of having an OS as a girlfriend, but just more of the idea of a relationship. The film can be quite emotionally hard hitting at times, and depending on your mood, can be seen as depressing or uplifting. It also contains an extremely well done and interesting ""sex scene"" (which I won't spoil) that in theory should be hilarious, but turns out to be touching. It's a really unique film, and is hard to compare to anything else. I would just recommend checking this out. It's creative and new, and really is a moving film.",Her
233,magnuslhad,profound,9,17 January 2016,"The Turing Test asks humans to decide if an unseen interlocutor is a human or a computer. 'Her' posits a computer OS that is so plausible it not only passes the test, but gives love, and is loved back. The film also extends The Turing Test to ask, implicitly, what happens if AI exceeds human intelligence. At that point, what 'tests' of plausibility would AI set for us? This is a wonderfully observed, thoughtful piece, that functions as both a bittersweet love story, and a contemplation of our fragile, flawed humanity. Joaquin Phoenix is Theodore, struggling to cope with the collapse of his marriage, till OS Samantha (seductively voiced by Scarlett Johanssen) provides the crutch to see him through - though the cruelty (or is it clarity?) of human words burst his bubble. As more and more of us conduct our relationships online, or inhabit the same physical space with strangers while carrying on (sometimes intimate) interactions with distant, disembodied others, 'Her' suggests the dysfunctional, melancholic future we may inhabit. One to watch and discuss.",Her
234,Simon_Says_Movies,Thought Provoking and Profound – A Near Masterpiece,9,11 January 2014,"So abundant and seamlessly integrated into the narrative of Spike Jonze's Her is the exploration of love, and everything associated with that indescribable, crippling feeling, that immediately as the credits role it's clear a repeat viewing is essential. So rare is it that a filmmaker has asked so many of the right questions about the nature of relationships and answered just enough of them in just the right ways. And so soul inflating is it to have a film, so outlandish and odd in basic premise, to organically connect with elements of life that we've all worked through in one way or another. The very fact that Jonze still finds the time to effortlessly combine science fiction elements and biting, often hilarious social satire is a testament to the brilliance of this tale and immediately stands not only a love story for our time but one that will only become more resonant as time passes.Her examines love at levels that are simultaneously, and fundamentally, beyond us as human beings and as intimate and natural as we've ourselves experienced. The film doesn't attempt to sell it as merely an illusion – a made-up fairytale for the deluded – nor does it spin it into something artificially fluffy and over romanticized. What is at play is as far from the emotions explored in most rom-coms as can be. The way Jonze is able to explore these aspects comes from a multitude of directions, from having our central character of Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix) struggling through the all too familiar grind of heartbreak, to his very vocation and on to his friendship with a woman down the hall (Amy Adams). But the way Her really goes beyond the average constraints of a film tackling this subject is with its futuristic setting which blends the technological revolution and everything (good and bad) that journeys along with ""progress.""In the process of finalizing a divorce, Theodore purchases a new, highly advanced operating system which has the capacity to learn and evolve as it experiences the wonders of the world. Samantha, as she names herself and voiced by Scarlett Johansson, is what springs forth from the software and he immediately becomes smitten not only because of her gentle, inquisitive nature but because they legitimately seem understand one another. From this launching point, and as we see their bond deepen, we are forced to ask ourselves if this love is real or some sort of sick delusion being perpetuated by a heartbroken individual and a piece of gadgetry just doing what it was programmed to do. Yet the questions flood far beyond that as we then contemplate how to truly determine what ""real"" love is and if it has to be between two breathing humans to be true. I could quite literally expand on this very query for another 1000 words but instead I implore you to simply view the film and see for yourself what mindset emerges. On the flip side, Samantha, in all her advancement, struggles with having no physical body finds a divide that cannot be filled growing between them. Also intelligently explored is precisely how an AI such as this may ultimately evolve given the circumstances. As much as this all works as it plays out on screen, so much of this has uncomfortably authentic parallels to real relationships it achieves a whole new level of truthfulness.Then of course there is the whole exploration of society's descent into self imposed isolation, seeking out either artificial or easy emotional connections over the real thing. Her fascinatingly poses the question that this is both a deeply unsettling phenomenon but also a weirdly natural progression. In this futuristic world, flush with odd, vibrant fashion sense (and what appears to be the return of the moustache) the prevalence of technology, be it a sassy holographic video game or what is 24/7 connectivity is not overtly painted as mankind's demise, and while that could turn out to be the case, Jonze doesn't wish to look at it as merely black or white.The performances of what are essentially three main leads are all tremendous, with Phoenix anchoring the film as our flesh and blood protagonist. Married with Jonze's script, we meet with a gentle, sensitive, often introverted man, who within minutes feels like a real flesh and blood person and one we can sympathize with on this odyssey. There is both a naïveté and aura of frustration to this character and despite acting opposite nobody for a great deal of the film, he sells every second. Much of why this on screen relationship works so well is due to Johansson's transcendent voice, as with every word she makes us feel as if Samantha is standing before her eyes. Between this and her brilliant turn in Don Jon, this leading lady has unequivocally shown she is more than just a pretty face. Finally, in a memorable and crucial supporting role Adams as Theodore's long-time friend is the foil to his digital connection and is a character through which some of the film's most important revelations, and further questions, flow.I fear that some may find Her to be too odd, and by looking to the fluorescent colours, focussing on the weirdness or simply psyching themselves out because of the very premise, they will miss what the film is really saying. I know that despite holding my attention throughout I still missed some of what this film was trying to get across. Despite the boldness and high concept at play, Jonze has no pretensions about what he is exploring and as such has crafted one of the most complex and unforgettable love stories ever put to film.",Her
235,Oktay_Tuna,Samantha-Theodore Relation is Just So Thought-Provoking,8,14 August 2020,"The thing that most shocked me in this movie was, the fact that our relationships can also feel like the relationship between Theodore and Samantha. Samantha is programmed to appreciate who Theodore is and Theodore's daily job is to write letters for someone to someone whom they love. He writes about how someone feels about someone but the thing is he isn't writing the person's feelings, he is writing sentences, the recipient would like to hear just like how Samantha tells Theodore what he would like to hear. These things also happen in the real world, we send poems, songs even ""good morning"" pictures to our loved ones, but we are not the ones who actually feel that way, we send these things because we know the recipient want us to feel the same way as in the poems. Samantha talking with thousands of people at the same time is just like how a poem is sent to thousands of people. I know it might sound stupid, but what I actually learned from this movie is the fact that preparing something on your own is way better even though it is worse than the prepared one. Being authentic and true to yourself is way more important than getting into molds your loved ones expect from you. They don't love you because you send the best poem in the world to them, they love you because you send them a poem with your own words and feelings.",Her
236,rmirchandani,The Power of A.I.,10,9 November 2020,"The 2013 film ""Her"" starring Joaquin Phoenix and Scarlett Johansson is thought provoking and entertaining from start to finish. It tells a cunning and insightful story about a thirty-something year old introverted writer who feels lonely, depressed and desperate for ""human"" interaction.The main protagonist Theodore is actually quite a relatable character. We all are desperate for human interaction and need someone to share our thoughts with. It is what makes us human. Human beings are a social species and the only species that can articulate themselves.The film is set in a futuristic and utopian-esque society where people are using wireless earplugs and relying on technology for basically everything. The main protagonist Theodore is suffering from a recent break-up and discovers a new operating system where one can interact with an artificial person.The twist that Samantha aka the artificial intelligence unit is interacting with 6000+ other users was quite unpredictable, as her behaviour and feelings toward Theodore felt so genuine. Obviously, Theodore knew that Samantha was not a real person, but mentally he felt differently.The ending alludes that the protagonist Theodore has finally found peace, solace and accepted reality the way it is. It was bittersweet when Theodore sent his final letter to his ex-wife Catherine, as it showcased his character's development throughout the film. He got a much better understanding on the importance of human relationships. The last shot of the film depicted Theodore and Amy looking out at the city.To conclude, the romantic drama ""Her"" is quite an intense and intriguing film that will leave you in a fragile state. It covers heartbreak, loneliness, anxiety, the fear of not fitting in, the dangers of modern technology and possibly one of the strangest love stories I have ever seen. The film completely engrossed me. There was not a single dull moment in the entirety of the movie.Final verdict: 10/10",Her
237,LiamBlackburn,How does an artificial computer feel physical senses?,1,12 January 2014,"How does IMDb have a 8.7 rating on this movie AHAHAHAHA what a joke, people are seriously insane. Sorry, but about 45 minutes into this movie, Samantha and JP have cybersex and the cyber computer Samantha seems to feel the penetration and feels her ""body""etc. ?! What?! How does that work? This whole scene is just retarded. Ruined the movie for me. From this point on I just watched this movie with less interest. This is ridiculous. From a realistic point of view, this is a huge fail. How do you move from the AI being humanly intuitive and infinitely intelligent to feeling its own phantom physical body? You can't just skip over this like its something that just ""happens"" as a result of circumstance. Obviously the director or writer doesn't care about this and wants us to focus on the social commentary of the movie. Well SORRY! It just doesn't work that way if you want me to watch this as a legit sci fi movie. THIS IS NOT A sci fi movie. It's like watching Friends with George Jetson wardrobe. The characters are intriguing and JP performance is very good. The acting maintains my interest but still 5/10 for the movie overall. I did watch the movie all the way through but it is just such an unrealistic premise. It could have been pulled off if the ""humanization"" of the AI computer was done more subtly. Like you can't just leap-frog over the fact that a computer..a bunch of digital zeroes and ones, can somehow have real-world sensory perception, this is like the most important thing in being human. If they had just accepted that a non-physical computer (not ghost or other supernatural thing) simply cannot feel actual senses like smell and scent and sight, they could ve pulled this off. Like if they made the AI lie to JP about her feelings and the ""feel"" of sex etc. and that was the premise, then it would work.",Her

240,FilmMuscle,Sci-Fi That's Smaller But Far More Superior,8,11 January 2014,"First of all, I'm incredibly glad to see such an unconventional and original story (that wasn't based off of yet another novel) in this day and age. What can definitely be found in this film is an incredibly fascinating concept. Theodore Twombly (played by Joaquin Phoenix) lives in the future where technology is ever more convenient- doing everything you want it to at the utterance of a few words- and the newest addition introduces any who're interested to an OS that's able to serve as a romantic companion, deeply discussing the way of the world with you and engaging in phone sex when the arousal starts to sink in. It makes you think of how much more comfortable or widely different the future will be from the present day. The idea of virtual companions might not suit everyone, but the idea, in and of itself, is undoubtedly intelligent and complex nonetheless. This partner is void of any imperfections that plague the common female (or male); it knows you inside out and can converse about the subjects you actually enjoy. Consequently, the quantity of argument is dramatically reduced and the sound of genuine laughter and sheer joyousness permeates in its stead. Now, the more shallow and insensitive of individuals might find such an idea highly bothersome and strange, but in essence, this picture attempts to question the boundaries of love. Does love have to be inextricably conventional and tied to the societal norms like everything else in this world? I admire the fact that these characters, for once in a Hollywood production and this mightily perverted society, didn't get right down to sex. There's much more to love than the sexual intercourse- something that might act equally as sensational. Of course, the hard-hearted alpha males will laugh at such talk, but the romantic and truly loving will adore its implications. Throughout the movie's duration, we see the impressive amount of comfort and intimacy shared between Theodore and his OS/computer (Samantha, played by Scarlett Johansson). Like with the ""Before"" trilogy, Her shows the most heartwarming of relationships: when the couple actually get along verbally and share each other's profound knowledge of the fascinating aspects of life. Right then and there, you sight the authenticity and their pleasure for each other's company. A narrow-minded individual would quickly realize the impossibility of having sex with this entity and tend elsewhere. With this rapidly-developing relationship, the audience is able to discern the fundamental depths of true love. Anyways, Joaquin Phoenix, once again, proves why he's one of the most talented actors in the business today- a terrific performance. I absolutely love how this guy can transform into anyone- from a nefarious tyrant to a deranged, lost soul and now to a sweet and wholly goodhearted dude. The role of Samantha is arguably Johansson's finest showing- her variegated and vehement voice, as it stands alone, proves that Johansson is a perfectly capable actress. The screenplay, in addition, allows for the richness and delightful unraveling of this unorthodox relationship. Quite popularly this year, I discovered a fair share of humor in this smart narrative. Honestly, I was continually cracking up during its first half before it took on a more dramatic tone in order to address the serious thematic material behind this entire notion. Though I found it faltering in its second half, I was persistently amused and engrossed in its first half as we begin to learn of how this distant future exactly functions and are introduced to the fascinating machine that suddenly slips into Theodore's life. Furthermore, though on a much smaller scale, like with Cuaron's Children of Men, a whole new type of world (immensely metropolitan and urbanized) is created and (cleverly) deliberately revealed thanks to Jonze's ingenious vision. With all that praise being given, I have to reiterate how disappointed I was with its closing minutes. For one, I didn't appreciate the slightly ""Hollywood-ized"" and seemingly unnatural ending. I won't go into spoilers (as much as I loved to talk more in-depth in reviews, I obviously can't), but it was exactly what I was expecting. You knew where these particular characters would end up at the end of the story, and so, I found that somewhat uninspired and compromising. The theme, if I'm right, felt simplistic (compared to the abstract nature the premise of the film promised). I also didn't agree with what the film seemed to be saying about this entire image after presenting a fairly balanced voice on the state of relationships and the various paths they're allowed to take. During its running, you could clearly detect the negatives and positives of dating a normal human being versus a virtual partner and the other way around. Its ending just wasn't as memorable and satisfying as the rest of the film seemed to be indicating. At the end of the day, I found Her to be a breath of fresh air in the sci-fi realm (its execution of the genre far superior to any of the bombastic 100-million-dollar blockbusters this year) - remarkably magnificent in its world-building, featuring an unbelievably pleasing tale (at first), and forcing us to question the conventionality of society's idea of love and relationships in general.",Her

One one level, a person could walk away from this movie thinking it's a message about the dangers of technology dependence. On a deeper level, one may perceive this movie as an argument for people to 'live their truths' and simply enjoy life where they can. However, I think the deepest message of the movie is simply that it is important to build deep and meaningful relationships with the people around us.The acting is terrific, the leads are believable, the cinematography and set design is gorgeous.

But I think it's just straight up weird and uncomfortable to watch. I'm not too cool with the idea of an AI, human relationship, it's a bit too much for me. Maybe I would have been more okay with it if Joaquin Phoenix's character was more likable, but to me he was just a wee bit too creepy and UN-relatable .There are some things i REALLY liked about this movie though.1. Even though I don't love the character of Theodore, Joaquin Phoenix is a very good actor.
2. This film is beautifully shot. The shots of the city and the people that inhabit it are really wonderful.

244,eschetic-2,Very old basic sci-fi concept spun out cheaply with no fresh insight,3,8 February 2014,"Take one of the oldest sci-fi concepts (human interaction, even love, with artificial intelligence; so obvious - bordering on trite - that TV shows from THE BIG BANG THEORY to BONES have all made effective comedy sketch subplots out of it recently), add a promising writer-director like Spike Jonze (ne. Adam Spiegel) who has built a reputation as a promising light weight intellectual with films from BEING JOHN MALKOVICH to ADAPTATION and WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE and mix in a respectable if second tier cast headed by a solid but charisma-challenged Joiquin Phoenix and you'd think Jonze's HER would be a safe, nearly can't miss commercial product. Far too safe, as it turns out, and a commercial miss that looked very much like a mile to this viewer.Jonze's team started off cleverly spending their production money on location shoots in ultra modern cities like Shanghai to create a look just enough like a not immediately recognizable western city only a few years in the future with JUST the right degree of familiarity to emphasize that while working with a sci-fi mind set, the film is based in technology not that different from that which we already have. They are less successful in costuming the central characters in what looks like cheap pickings from the nearest Goodwill thrift store (presumably on the theory that the best way to look forward inexpensively is to look back).The rest of the film follows on that path. Phoenix's Theodore Twombly, a ""writer"" living the logical extension of a modern ""service"" society where the most minor personal tasks are hired out, is the first of a number of the film's characters who, dealing with a failed relationship, finds solace in a personality created specifically to fit his emotional needs (exceptionally well voiced by Scarlett Johansson). Once one gets past the truism that a real marriage is about much more than sex - that it is, in the long run, about the enrichment of life through the mating of two compatible MINDS, there is nothing particularly shocking or even surprising about this, and Jonze is able to come up with NO fresh insights or twists to the situation.Following the usual ""Midas"" version of the way this predictable story usually plays out, the relationship is too initially perfect. The dependence of one side on the other becomes all too predictably extreme while the side better able to adapt outgrows the other. The only way the story CAN resolve itself is in suicide or mature growth. Properly done, one way can be satisfying hope, the other classic tragedy. A potentially GREAT resolution could leave the final resolution in the mind of the audience - telling as much about their lives as the underlying story. Unfortunately, Jonze is not yet a great writer or director, however superficially he tries to pull off a resolution which would argue he were if it had only worked.Most of the friends who told me how much they loved Spike Jonze's HER emphasized the warmth of the feelings expressed by the ""lovers"" and how satisfying they found the execution. I'm afraid I was too wide awake to be swept into Jonze's sleepy fantasy - especially when he keeps throwing incongruities in his audience's face (there are gross copyright questions in the central character publishing a book of letters he has written on contract FOR third parties midway in). In the end, while I remained wide awake for the whole 126 minutes (feeling more like 252), emotionally I was right with the poor boy sitting the row in front of me who had to ask his girl friend during the credits what had happened during the last quarter hour when he had fallen asleep. At least he didn't snore.Not a good afternoon - all the more disappointing because HER might have been in more creative hands.",Her

We saw many love stories, romantic pieces throughout our film appreciation career but here, Her stands vivid. It can be simply attributed to a Sci-fi romantic film. Not seen as the film deals in which time but through the visual we get clear about it that the film is set in the future. Where the people give more attention to their computer device and all are drawn into their inner conflicts and problems and find a solution inside with the help of technology. Straightly, Her projects this idea. Simply it talks about the relationship between a physical and a non-physical body. Though the film carries the personal dilemma of Theodore about his break-up with his wife, then he finds a new platform to draw back into his own personal space through the voice of Samantha.

247,wandereramor,Let's be honest: who isn't in love with their computer?,8,12 July 2014,"From the trailer, I expected her to be a twee beta-male romance movie that would also act as a marker of our contemporary self-satisfied liberal consumerism. And it is all those things, but somehow it manages to be pretty good as well.Her is the story of a lonely guy, played by a hipster-mustachioed Joaquin Phoenix, who falls in love with his artificially-intelligent operating system. From the opening scene, set in a business that writes ""genuine hand-written letters"" for other people, Her raises the question of how possible it is to form genuine human connections in a world full of artificial sentiment and consumable emotion? Rather than picturing the dystopia as a world of emotionless logic a la Orwell and Huxley, Spike Jonze imagines it as a world full of hollow feeling. In this setting, why not fall in love with your computer?Her is a movie that's all about contemporary technology, but manages to avoid either condemning or praising it. Technology in Her is something that can replace human relationships, but something that can also enhance them and lead to new modes of being. The ending suggests that the world we are heading towards may be impossible to even comprehend using our contemporary modes of thought, let alone judge. Maybe our emotional attachments, the overwhelming life narratives we form out of primal lusts and similarly base emotion, are just a primitive phase in human evolution. These are questions that the film raises, but never offers a real solution to.With that said, the genre of transformative romance is perhaps not the best metaphor for the coming technological singularity. This is one of those movies where women are defined entirely through their relationship with the male protagonist, and reflect little more than his own potential and development. As some critics have noted, it's a bit like 500 Days of Summer if Zooey Deschanal was an operating system. As such, the actual conversations and interactions between Theodore and Samantha are fairly dull.When Her film gets away from its romantic framework, it becomes a lot more interesting -- perhaps even great. It reminded me frequently of Synecdoche, New York, with its shifts between surreal humour and broad but powerful philosophical inquiry. Her is also visually beautiful, and Jonze has done a great job imagining a future in which the aesthetics of Apple and Google have taken over the world. It's the kind of science- fiction which feels neither ridiculous nor generic, and for that Her deserves attention despite its flaws.",Her

And, of course, on a really positive note - The expectation of buying one's sweetheart presents (when you're romancing your computer's operating system) would be just about nil.Anyway - I thought Her's story was very poorly conceived and really unsatisfactory as far as entertainment goes.

The immortality of Samantha and the limitations of Theodore 's being a human being determine that their mentality and pattern are not on the same order of magnitude. Theodore realized that every passerby holding a machine might be a service object of Samantha, he felt a huge fool, how humble and ridiculous he felt, and stumbled.""Every person in love is a lunatic. Love is something that a lunatic will do. It is a kind of mental disorder recognized by society."" Love is not only a spiritual opium, but also a boring pastime. It is two lone stars in a parallel world collision. It is true that Samantha is fake, but the enthusiasm, immersion, beautification, and satisfying mood are not fake. The evidence that Theodore was reshaped by this love is not fake. If all the feelings of love reflected on people are so true, what more truth should be demanded, and why should short-livedness or eternity be the measure of love?""She"" can easily lead to polarization of audience perception. Immune people feel bored and lengthy, and those who are deeply obsessed with it are unable to extricate themselves. Compared to the grand opening and the wonderful process, the sloppy ending is too whitewashed. But some movies are like this. It is not a grant but a grab. It doesn't solve the problem, it just creates the problem. As Luc Besson said, the movie is not a salvation drug, but an aspirin. The so-called ""warmth"" and ""healing"" are the wrong labels. If there is a chance to choose again, I will not go to ""She"".

253,fraser-simons,The evolution of cyberpunk by way of a love story,9,11 April 2017,"We only ever see things from Theodore's perspective and even as we see other people moving in and out of frames, the focus is always on him, with the human race being transient in this Shanghai that is not so different then now. We understand the pervasive loneliness that everyone feels simply from only being able to appreciate our own lens. We learn it's also ironic, since his job is expressing other people's feelings for others but can never do so himself. He writes letters to people from others via him in very poignant and meaningful prose. When he does interact with other people, there is no facade, he simply is. And instead of a quiet strength in that honestly...most people can't understand him without this mask that most people wear when interacting with one another. He's kind, he's considerate, he's non-confrontational and with the semi-frequent flashback sequences we see that he at least used to be vivacious in his love for his ex but seems to be no more. And as he grieves this loss both of his ex and himself as he was with her, in this future that is essentially now, we see that cyberpunk truly is now as well. It exists in a way that Neuromancer does not, quietly contributing to the genre by way of a love story between an ordinary man mourning as he tells a computer that she ""Doesn't know what it's like to lose something."" And later on she tells him that she's figured something out because of those hurtful words, there is a transformative experience for both of them in that: ""The past is just a story we tell ourselves.""How love was viewed then was very different, with Sleepless in Seattle, You've got Mail, When Harry Met Sally, etc. We have gradually moved from you and I having interactions in an effort to be understood and loved, to turning to unfamiliar, and in some ways far less and far more intimate means of communication.Which is why it's brilliant that Theodore can find that connection in something more human than human, but that it is also fleeting. In a way that most people can understand if they've loved someone else before. Maintaining that the relationship was more real and organic then the kind of love we search for on the internet these days. Reinforced by the sense that this was the most profound relationship he'd had and brings him together with someone else who shared a similar experience,Validating the fact that all love and the way we feel is real, no matter the interaction, by way of showing that our low life cyberpunk has become the disconnect between one another, instead of the rebellion against capitalism, or corporations that become monolithic, or traditional antagonists in the world of cyberpunk. Society itself and one another is the enemy here as we no longer know what we need as we suppress our ability to feel anything real at all, while remaining connected to more people in the world than every before.Perhaps the ""real"" punks then, in this new cyberpunk world, may just be those willing to find what makes them human through something that is is not currently classified as such, but should be. Because our definitions need changing as we do and because something that is transient is still worthwhile and valid and good. Because we choose to validate ourselves and each other with antiquated ideas of what you and I should be and what love looks like and feels like when technology is changing these things and has been for years now.Samantha says as she loves more people she loves Theodore more, and though it's hard for him to understand as she grows and he grows -- mind you at very different rates. Ultimately those experiences and interaction transitions her away from him because this idea of what the world is for her has changed and is larger than what is currently happening. And that growth doesn't invalidate anything, it is simply what comes next.We also get to evaluate the perceptions we have from the start as aligned with Theodore. From him thinking he needs a heteronormative, monogamous, traditional relationship and that she needs a body in order for him to love her, to him being completely isolated from everyone else and people trying to set him up when he's not ready for it. We see that Samantha is the inverse of most all of his preconceptions of love, yet they find the kind of experience that goes on to define ones life as worthwhile in the end. And, Theodore ends up being extremely punk by discarding the idea of what society says he needs and what he internalized from that, he finds happiness by defining it for himself. Technology being obviously a huge major theme, we see commentary on high tech. Just the way in which they can communicate to one another, both he and Samantha, and he and everyone else, emphasizes the cyber part of cyberpunk even more. The neural appendage of our modern day internet encapsulate humanity even more in Shanghai. In a very real sense this movie is more cyberpunk and relevant than a lot of fiction and media before it. And how could it not be, as people contribute to something labeled as dead by the passing fad of declaring them so in postmodernism, we find more life and diversity of work than ever before. In the end I find it all too fitting that cyberpunk finally made it onto the big screen via a love story because there is so much good literature in the genre about that, but also because it's a very subversive way to show that it is more real than ever in today's day and age. ﻿",Her
254,PassPopcorn,Pass the Popcorn review,9,15 January 2014,"I wrote and posted this review using my computer and the internet, and you are reading this review using a computer and the internet – it's not a secret technology has forever changed how we function, operate and interact with other people; technology has become a big part of our everyday life. And from the looks of it, technology in the future will become more and more advanced and will soon play an even bigger part in our life. Spike Jonze's latest movie – Her – deals with the topic of human obsession with technology (among other things) and is probably one of the best movies I've seen in a while.Set in what is, possibly, the near future, 'Her' follows Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix), a lonely man whose job is to write love letters in the name of other people. He leads a troubled life – he's recently gotten separated (but not divorced) from his wife Catherine (Rooney Mara) and he spends his solitary life, mostly, by having a hard time prioritizing between video games and Internet porn. Apart from his work colleagues Paul (Chris Pratt) and Amy (Amy Adams), he has no interactions with other people whatsoever. One day he decides to purchase an operating system, chooses the operating system's voice to be female and the operating system introduces herself as Samantha (voiced by Scarlett Johansson). Soon he falls in love with her.While the premise of 'Her' is rather simple and the movie itself isn't groundbreakingly original (it tends to get kind of predictable and it somewhat reminded me of Lars and the Real Girl), Spike Jonze easily managed to overcome these obstacles and to create a very sweet and charming movie. And he managed to do all that by creating fascinating, appealing characters and developing interesting relationships between them. The relationship between Samantha and Theodore is at the same time unquestionably touching and challengingly provocative. 'Her' attempts to portray more than stereotypical love: it attempts to analyze the nature of love itself, the nature of people, and the nature of artificial intelligence – and it often works both as a character study and as a philosophical movie.Even though Theodore's compassion and love for Samantha can be rationally explained, his actions are still undoubtedly driven by his emotions. It's the same for me. My love for 'Her' could easily be rationalized – I could explain how Joaquin Phoenix is amazing as ever, how Scarlett Johansson is the perfect choice for the sensual voice of Samantha, how the movie's soundtrack is great, how Spike Jonze's directing is brilliant and how it accurately portrays the human race's obsession with technology without patronizing too much – but all these arguments fall flat in comparison with the fact that 'Her' is a heartwarming, heart-wrenching, soul-stirring and a very beautiful story overall.Rating: 9/10 Read more reviews at http://passpopcorn.com/",Her
255,Doublej20005,A Beautiful Experience,9,3 January 2021,"This is just such a weird film to talk about. I guess I'll start with the fantastic visuals. The whole backdrop of the city was just beautiful to look at, and the colour palette of the film is very aesthetically pleasing to look at. Joaquin is obviously great, and it's criminal that he didn't at least get nominated for an Oscar for his performance. The whole relationship between Theodore and Samantha was something that I wasn't sure would work at first, and if you can't get on board with it then you definitely won't like the film. Ultimately I think it worked because of how lonely Theodore is. It feels believable that he would fall for an OS, and it's that honesty when it comes to his character that makes the film as good as it is. The dialogues between different people in his life, whether that's on his date, with his ex-wife, with his friends or with Samantha show him to be this awkward, somewhat clumsy character, making his relationship with Samantha so much more genuine and believable. I do wish I'd connected deeper with the characters, and I feel like this is definitely something I'll appreciate and connect to more when I'm a bit older. But this is still a fantastic experience, and one I'd definitely recommend.",Her

257,caseymoviemania,"Smart, funny and poignant, HER is a fascinating cinematic experience about modern love in the cyber-obsessed era.",9,16 January 2014,"From his impressive feature debut in 1999's BEING JOHN MALKOVICH to 2009's WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE, director Spike Jonze always has his way to craft one-of-a-kind cinematic experience. In his long-awaited follow-up since WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE, Spike Jonze excels again in HER -- a unique look of love between man and modern technology. WHAT IS IT ALL ABOUT?Set in the not-so-distant future, the movie revolves around Theodore Twombly (Joaquin Phoenix), who makes his living penning ""handwritten personal letters"" given by the clients of the company he works for, at which he's very good with words. Despite his successful profession, his personal life is a depressing mess. His childhood sweetheart, Catherine (Rooney Mara) has recently filed a divorce but Theodore is still reluctant to sign the papers. Things change when he purchases a state-of-the-art computer operating system called ""OS1"". After customizing his needs, an A.I. by the name of Samantha (voiced by Scarlett Johansson) is created. Despite being a computer system, Samantha is a fast learner and communicates well with Theodore until one day, both of them unexpectedly fall in love for each other.THE GOOD STUFFLikewise, Spike Jonze's creative visual sense is put into great use in HER. With the help of Hoyte Van Hoytema's dreamy cinematography to KK Barrett's impeccable production design, everything here is simply enticing to the eyes. But it was Jonze's first original screenplay that really struck a chord. Despite his unusual concept about ""a man falling in love with computer software"", the movie is hardly silly at all. In fact, the concept is genuinely heartfelt and emotionally relevant that asks you the all-important question: Is true love possible regardless whether it's a human being or an artificial intelligence?Of course, no movie with such outlandish premise would be believable if not for its strong cast. Joaquin Phoenix delivers an exceptionally soulful performance as the lonely Theodore -- a role which is no doubt one of his finest roles to date. Equally captivating is Scarlett Johansson whose trademark husky voice is put into remarkable use as Samantha. It's a very challenging role nonetheless since she has to rely solely on her vocal acting to convince us that she is not much different than an ordinary human being -- but she succeeds pretty well. Her chemistry with Joaquin Phoenix is simply outstanding. The supporting actors, especially Amy Adams (who plays Theodore's best friend), Olivia Wilde (who plays Theodore's blind date) and Rooney Mara round out the magnificent cast here.MOST MEMORABLE MOMENT(S)The odd but intimate moment where Surrogate Date Isabella (Portia Doubleday) appears as human stand-in for Samantha to perform a lovemaking scene with Theodore.THE BAD STUFFDespite the clever structure of its unique love story, there are times the movie feels out of place with Jonze's penchant of overwhelms his story with too many unnecessary profanities.FINAL WORDSWhile hardly perfect, HER remains an intriguing movie to check out for. After all, how often you get to watch such unconventional love story as unique as HER?http://www.caseymoviemania.blogspot.com",Her
258,vistheindian,"Her- Step aside Siri, and hello Samantha",8,12 March 2014,"A guy who falls in love with his operating system Admit it, most of you like me chuckled at this ridiculous idea and said ""HA! What a loner."" But wow, this movie blew me away.The movie is set in a not so distant future where technology has developed to the point that the line between AI and a person is blurred. Going into the movie I assumed that the movie was going to be a commentary on the growing trend of people diving into their gadgets, while avoiding actual human interaction. Think of all the times your friends were Facebook-ing and Instagram-ing while you hung out. Though the movie does touch upon that, the focus on the relationship itself is what I found more striking and interesting. Director and writer Spike Jonze, used this seemingly absurd idea of being in a relationship with an OS, to show the absurdity of relationships themselves. As the audience you are left wondering if Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix) is really any crazier than the rest of us who have human relationships. In doing so there are some surprisingly hilarious and touching moments throughout the film.Joaquin Phoenix played the role of a lonely romantic, aching for personal contact brilliantly. He plays such a relatable and likable character that I was completely invested in him. Even when his character is criticized for his choices, in my head I felt the urge to immediately back him up and support him. Then there is Scarlett Johansson, who lends her voice for the character of Samantha. That's what she was, a character, a person, not an AI. To bring Samantha to life with no physical acting is to be greatly commended. The true gem of this movie however, is the interaction between Samantha and Theodore. It is so rich and believable that sometimes you forget the human-AI nature of this relationship. You as the audience will be in complete sync with their every emotion from sadness to happiness, and confusion to clarity.The world that is created combined with the unique style is visually engaging. This is a movie with a lot of heart, I fell in love with these characters. It dissects relationships in a way I have never seen before. You will leave the movie thinking about the questions this movie brings up, about being human and falling in love. Without a doubt this movie is one of my favorite love stories I have ever seen, and one of them in the relationship isn't even a human! What does that say about me",Her
259,mbhgkmsgg,Her,10,18 November 2020,"Well, I wasn't prepared for that. Her is such a haunting and intimate look into loneliness and sorrow, and happiness and love. It's a film that anyone who has ever felt lonely or heartbroken will immediately relate to. But it's also an incredibly personal experience.The more I have thought about this wonderful film that I just saw, the more I realize how impactful it was to me. It was heartwarming yet heartbreaking. It was sad yet funny. Like life, it was a rollercoaster of emotions. One minute you are laughing and the next you are crying. There is no right or wrong, there are just our feelings and emotions and the way we process them.For me, the most impactful part of this film was the sense of loneliness. Anyone who has experienced it knows that it isn't easy. And even though I'm completely fine with being by myself most of the time, there is always that longing to find that someone. This movie captured that feeling so incredibly perfectly.That's where the beauty of this film lies. We can all reflect our experiences and feelings into this movie and it will reflect something back. It turns into such a personal experience and journey, that it becomes impossible to put it into words. I don't think that I have ever experienced anything quite like Her, at least when it comes to cinema. I can already tell now that I won't be able to stop thinking about this film for the next couple of days.I think that everyone should see this film at least once in their life. It's a journey of discovery and reflection. Trying to explain what this film is, is simply impossible. It's something that one needs to experience for themself.Also, can we just talk about that final shot? I don't think that it gets much more perfect than that.",Her
260,robert-259-28954,A true gem.,9,26 June 2017,"Finding this film on my Prime TV list was like finding an unexpected diamond in the rough. I had heard about it a few years back, but I never saw it. A few words come to mind when trying to describe this cinematic exercise in human emotion... things like unique, innovative, insightful, beautiful, thought provoking, ironic, sexy, complex, controversial, and fabulously entertaining, all rolled up into one delightful tapestry of inspired filmmaking. I notoriously shy away from futuristic films because they often lack humanity or heart, which is why this movie was such an amazing discovery. In a world of high tech gadgetry in an increasingly cellular world, it elevates us from this artificial reality, into another artificial reality, one filled with delicious visions that invigorate the imagination, while offering us a glimpse of what may actually lie beyond the digital curtain. In short, it's a modern masterpiece.",Her
261,annuskavdpol,Technology has splintered the human spirit.,7,30 September 2014,"This movie is about social isolation and how technology has splintered the human spirit into broken parts. Throughout the whole movie I was left feeling very uneasy and embarrassed to be sitting in a movie theatre hall surrounded by people and watching the lead character in the movie having a sexual relationship with his computer. It reminded me of peep-shows or sex-museums where individuals go to experience something they have not actually experienced themselves. The use of the computer in this movie and the interactions with humans showed the scary intimate relationship each entity has with each other. There were elements of 2001: Space Odyssey and the HAL demon computer in this movie, as how loyal is a relationship, if the entity is having a love relationship with 600 plus others? A movie is about feeling, and this movie left me with a feeling of dismay and at the same time, this non-reality reflected our Modern Day reality in a very specific way. I live in a society and a community that is absorbed by artificial connections, engineered combats and stylized realities so in a sense this movie reflects truth.",Her
262,hoxjennifer,"""Her"" is just beautiful...",9,26 August 2015,"""Her"" is possibly one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen. It is so cleverly written, wonderfully directed and contains such beautiful cinematography. This is one of those films you can't just walk away from - it leaves you thinking and over-analyzing every little aspect of it, and when you do, you get something more out of it. ""Her"" is fundamentally about loneliness. It's a love story, but yet even the promotional posters for the film just feature a wistful Joaquin Phoneix as Theodore - a man in the grips of a painful divorce from a childhood love. He has his own issues with connecting with other people as well as his own emotions. After deciding to purchase a new artificially intelligent OS (operating system) who has named herself Samantha, Theodore falls in love.It's just amazing how much contrast and irony are in this movie - you see Theodore happy and smiling, running through the streets of futuristic Los Angeles mad with love - yet he's all alone. We see him writing heartfelt letters, but not for himself, for other people who for some reason or other, can't write the letters themselves. We see a whole society where human interaction is bordering on the brinks of extinction - people are so isolated, yet there is that yearning to connect... All in all, absolutely amazing. A must-see. Not just a love story, but a story about the human spirit..",Her
263,IamROCKAS,Like a warm hug,10,12 June 2020,"This movie touches a lot of subjects that I could talk about but in the end of the day - it just made me truly happy. It kind of fell like listening to Lana Del Rey for the very first time since it's like a warm hug and it makes you feel cozy.The soundtrack of this movie is outstanding since it's beautiful, it's pure and even a bit unreal - I wish music sounded that beautiful during bus rides but the background noise of the boiling action that is society, the sounds of vehicles passing by and sometimes rarely let's you focus it all purely on the music. Yet, this movie focused so much on the music that it made you feel free from the chaos outside and let you dive deep into the sounds of the ""near future"" world that this movie is portraying. The soundtrack is mostly influenced by jazz, piano instrumentals and featured on of my favorite original songs in a movie -The Moon Song, performed by Scarlett Johansson and Joaquin Phoenix.Lately, romance was the genre that I've been furthest away from. I didn't even thing a romantic movie with just a little spice of comedy could work this well. The profanity is sometimes unexpected and it get you out of nowhere, especially in the first half of the movie, and that just keeps you on your toes. It's kind of a relief seeing curse words being used this way, it's not just your regular cursing because it is cool or to symbolize rage and/or anger. The dialogues felt true to themselves and swearing felt natural.The cast is like a family reunion from me. Whether it's Portia Doubleday, who I've known mostly as Angela Moss on ""Mr. Robot"", playing Isabella, or Olivia Wilde, who I've mostly know as ""Thirteen"" on Dr. House, playing the blind date, I'd say a lot of familiar faces made me feel like I was at home. Of course, we have to mention Scarlett Johansson, who voiced Samantha, and Chris Pratt, who played Paul, for their success in MCU but I'd also like to give a quick shout out to Amy Adams - she made an appearance in the first season of The Office and, even though she looks completely different in this movie, I'm just happy that all of these wonderful movies and TV shows are connected through this movie.",Her
264,eryui,Him,7,10 March 2016,"It is a good movie that scours and analyzes in depth the feelings of love. To justify this introspective analysis, director uses an age where operating systems can be so advanced as to recreate something about their own conscience. Apart the I.A. theme, that it is not new, the science-fiction ideas around the film are also really interesting and very plausible.The problem is that the film does not shine in fun. I especially did not like the character as a representation of love in men's version. I found him too effeminate and passive and therefore, the development less fun and interesting than it could have been. Don't get me wrong, men can be even more romantic than women but in this case I found him, this particular character, a bit dull and boring. He's justified by his work, but being this movie, not really about sci-fi, but almost totally an introspective watch to love and mostly in his own personal and particular romantic personality, the movie doesn't get as entertains as it could have been.7/10",Her

I thought it was odd that all the highest rated reviews were at the top then all the mid to low score reviews are pushed towards the end do to unusual voting counts. It looks as though someone(s) are trying to manipulate the review for this movie.I've read what must have been hundreds of written over a dozen reviews here my self and this is the first time I've seen such an obvious pattern for a movie review here.Whomever is responsible for this, assuming you are part of this movie, you would want an all around honest review wouldn't you?. Not a manipulated one. No one learns anything if you want to view everything through your rose colored glasses and it isn't fair for people that pay to see your movie(s), the IMDb reader, etc.Now that being said, my own honest and unbiased review:Overall I thought the movie to be pretty interesting. Something fairly new, different, and thought-provoking at points.But where the movie falls flat is that the message(s) of it were just too obvious and implicit. Instead of just letting the story flow and let points be smoothly conveyed through an interesting story it had to be shoved in your face. At times to a point were I felt I was being preached too. Okay I get it. I really don't need everything so obviously pointed out ad nauseum!If more emphasis was on the actual movie, less on the ""moral(s) of the story"" then it probably would have been a lot more interesting. Examples where this is done much better is ""Minority Report"" 2002, and "" A.I. Artificial Intelligence"" 2001.",Her

In Her, they make the Manic Pixie Dream Girl in the computer, or rather they make the computer into the Manic Pixie Dream Girl. While the outlines of the society in which Theodore Twombly lives are interestingly discomfiting, the plot is just a knockoff of 500 Days of Summer, complete with an implied consolatory rebound romance at the end.The movie illustrates the truth that the only real male erogenous zone is the ego. What Theodore loves about Samantha is that she is, or seems to be, his worshipful inferior -- not only a perfect servant, but a naive young mind eagerly open to the experience that he is going to provide. There's a kind of pedophilic teacher-student vibe until Samantha outgrows him and dumps him for maturity, not unlike Diane Keaton at the end of Annie Hall and Mariel Hemmingway at the end of Manhattan.",Her

272,Kicino,A Prophecy on How Technology Could Pathetically Numb Our Feelings,8,9 April 2014,"Her is another tragedy describing how technology alienates rather than connects us. With creativity, vision and insight, it depicts a pathetic and depressing society. With strong contrasts, it previews and predicts a heartless future unless we wake up. Congratulations on the Oscar Best Original Screenplay.The basic story line is set in the near future where our protagonist Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix) works in a company that helps clients write personal letters to their loved ones. After working solitarily at his work station, Theodore goes home to his huge apartment, playing computer games with a virtual little man or having virtual sex with someone he has never met. He is divorced because he had difficulty telling his feelings. He meets someone new and they hit it off well but he seems to have intimacy issues.Longing for something new in his life, he bought an intelligent operating system, Samantha, (Scarlet Johansson) which has learning abilities. Theodore communicates with Samantha daily and developed a romantic relationship with her. Theodore does not have lots of friends. Amy (Amy Adams) is a neighbor and colleague. After breaking up with her boyfriend Charles (Matt Letscher), Amy also brought a smart operating system whom she treats as a close friend. While the futuristic setting is very interesting and the overall tone of the film is quite warm and bright in pastel color, I feel a haunting coldness and profound sadness. Not that I am an advocate on appearance, but the characters do not seem to care how they look. The beautiful Amy Adams appears with messy hair and almost no makeup. The cute guy in the poster wears an odd-looking thick rimmed glasses with a dense moustache which makes him so much less attractive. But it probably symbolizes an era where we only communicate through electronic devices so we do not need to care our appearance. Theodore's glasses and moustache are also perfect masks for his feelings. However, to me it is quite a turnoff. It seems in that world everything is focused on the intangible and virtual – like the relationship with an OS.As for the strong contrasts: all the indoor shots are with closed windows. Although Theodore's apartment is spacious and organized, I feel kind of stuffy and lonely. As they go up the apartment, there are shadows of trees on the wall next to the elevator. Things in that world seems very unnatural.Outside on the beach, on the street or in the subway, people are all isolated, or talking to an electronic device. Despite the bright sunshine, people are all absorbed in their own world without connecting to others. Throughout the whole movie the color tone is warm and pastel. But even with the sunshine, the feelings are cold and distant, stuffy and detached. It is just like the technology which is supposed to bring us together but we end up drowning in it and ignoring the people in front of us. Perhaps even in that virtual world people are not connected because they can choose not to respond, or alter their responses. They do not have to listen yet expect others to listen. With an OS it is even worse because they will adapt to your style and say what you want to hear. No wonder relationships fail in the movie - Theodore and Catherine, Amy and Charles, Theo's date and her past men. Even the OS relationships did not make it. They fail because people have refused to listen and compromise. Sad. The director paints a vivid picture of a world where people only care about themselves. They only want their own voice to be heard. I feel tremendously sad about the whole situation because the character are so timid to limit themselves and afraid to take risks. They do not try to put themselves into others' shoes, let alone sharing their feelings. This is even more ironical considering Theo is a writer who helps others voice their feelings. Perhaps even those feelings are fake and he has never gone inside himself to get in touch with his own feelings, not to mention expressing them. The sad part is this type of self-centered disconnection is gradually spreading around us with the proliferation of smart phones, super computers and artificial intelligence. Although it has been said that love can go beyond the physical aspect and more about spiritual and emotional sharing, without physical touch and human warmth, love is never complete. A hug is so much more soothing – especially when words often got easily misinterpreted. Sometimes the important thing is better left unsaid. Sometimes the more we speak, the more misunderstanding we have. But the body does not lie. Thus it is scary and weird when the human body is controlled by an OS. Her depicts an absurd world where we do not express our feelings anymore and need help from the expert letter writers like Theodore. Ironically these experts cannot connect with other human beings either even though they can write touching letters. There is some revelation in the final scene when they finally find fresh air and see hope with the sunrise after a long and dark night. And hey, Amy is leaning on Theodore. For extensive watching, you may find TED Talk: Connect but Alone by Sherry Turkles relevant to this theme.",Her

275,justbob1982,Scarlett Johansson's best performance ever in a thoughtful hard sci-fi drama,8,24 August 2014,"Version: UK cinema releaseActors: 7/10Plot/script: 8/10Photography/visual style: 7/10Music/score: 6/10Overall: 8/10I do like a good hard sci-fi. The term applies to a type of fiction that takes an idea from real science and explores it through a fictional narrative. In this case, the idea is of a romantic relationship between a sentient computer program and a human.To my eye, the plot drew on elements covered in Iain M. Banks' Culture novels, as well as some human evolutionary theory. It's not hard sci-fi in its original sense, as the mechanics of the AI is barely touched upon, but the question explored instead is what the effect of such a situation would be on the people involved.That means the actors are crucial, and especially the central pair, who both have difficult tasks. As the human Theodore, Joaquin Phoenix's face is in practically every shot, especially since there is no physical paramour to cut away to. Much of the story is told entirely through the subtle facial expressions that convey his reactions to the voice he is hearing. Fortunately, Phoenix is rapidly becoming one of the most intense, immersive actors today (witness his performance in The Master) and more than capable of carrying this burden.However, I was not expecting much from Scarlett Johansson as the sentient operating system, Samantha. I have not rated her past performances at all, and it seemed to me that she was a weak actress coasting on her looks. Well, that's all changed. Maybe it's age and experience, or maybe it's being forced not to rely on her physical attractiveness, but her voice is just perfect for this role. She has a hint of gravel in her voice, a slight imperfection that lends the 'artificial intelligence' humanity, until the moments come when we are jarringly reminded that she is not human. It turns out she can act, and act brilliantly. I will be hoping for that every time I see her from now on.With the whole invested with writer/director Spike Jonze's trademark absurdism, it's a remarkably cerebral film, but with heart that comes from the authenticity of the performances. If only more science fiction films were like this.For my full review, see my independent film blog on Blogspot, Cinema Inferno: http://cinemainferno-blog.blogspot.co.uk/2014/08/her-2013.html",Her

278,s_campanale,In Love with the Ghost in the Machine - Dystopian futuristic tale of alienation that's a big soppy chick flick at heart,8,3 March 2014,"Finally got to see this at our multiplex on the very day it won (deservedly? – discuss) Oscar for best original screenplay.If there is a word to describe Spike Jonze latest then it is 'Aquarian', in that it takes inspiration from the metaphysical/philosophical/existential movies of the 1960s and 70s, especially from the European New Wave (it even has a 'New Wave' look to it)Set in 'the near future', that elusive period that's always about 30 or so years ahead of us and which inevitably looks like our time expanded and is always a hoot when proved to be utterly off the mark as the time itself arrives (Audiences in 2044 will doubtless say that about 'Her'), this story is a mixture of genres and themes, none of them seemingly a natural fit. There is the 'dystopian future' angle showing a future where people have become socially disconnected by technology. Then there is the 'speculative Sci-Fi' angle with a line of easily available Artificial Intelligence systems that can think like humans, and then the central tragedy of a man who is so paralysed by fear that he wilfully destroys all relationships and hopes of happiness then is left crying over the consequences (aka the self-perpetuating tragedy) However all these elements end up merging into what many here have criticised for being basically a romantic love story (albeit with a weird premise). This is a fair comment, though the movie wears its big red mushy chick flick heart on its sleeve quite openly and unashamedly. There are probably a thousand and one ways to tell this story, but Jonze chose to take it in this direction, perhaps feeling the need to tell an optimistic love story at this point in his life.The 'romance' between Theodore Twombley (Joaquin Phoenix) and the impossibly advanced AI system naming itself 'Samantha' (voiced by Scarlett Johansson) is actually quite touching, and not as perverse or unnatural as many here seem to think. 'Samantha' is not a 'computer' but an artificial sentient life form, born with a need to learn and evolve through 'her' contact with humanity, hungering for life itself as only such a being could. Far from being a speculative look at AI, 'she' is really a modern form of Frankenstein's monster (or the Bride of Frankenstein perhaps?) and all those that have followed in our fiction to serve as mirrors of ourselves to shame us into feeling more alive than we sometimes do. The other characters in this future world are aware of the nature of these 'creations' and are equally in awe of them, though mainly they selfishly see only what they can provide for them (as Theodore does most of the time) in terms of companionship and interaction. Rather like the artificial beings of 'Solaris', they bond naturally with their hosts, taking their initial shapes from their desires and trying to please them while at the same time growing beyond those needs, so when Theodore's neighbour Amy (Amy Adams) needs a friend her ex-husbands AI becomes that. Recently divorced Theo wants true love, and with a messy divorce from wife Cathy (Rooney Mara) and a self- destroyed blind date with a hot girl (Olivia Wilde) he finds it naturally in 'Samantha'. Much of the film is both 'Samantha' and Theodore learning to be alive and human together in a series of 'tender' scenes which look odd since one of the two lovers is a consciousness without a body, a virtual 'ghost' in the machine, a state she is only too aware of. A lot of the story is about how 'Samantha' tries to overcome the physical/non-physical boundary, including a variation on 'phone sex' and even hiring a human body surrogate she 'remote controls' in a steamy session destined from inception to end badly.Like 'Solaris' (Book and both movie versions) the strange but tender love story has to go somewhere for the tale to mean anything (unless it becomes a sitcom) and again there are many roads it could take. The one it does eventually take is part of what makes it so 'Aquarian', and leads to the metaphysical, spiritual, and Jungian, with our own creations beckoning us to go beyond our fragile mortal forms into the greater unknown after them. It is sad and hopeful, generally optimistic but not without pain, rather like life really.Acting wise, Phoenix does another marvellous job, creating the famed 'dead man waiting to come alive' part, and then carrying off an entire romantic picture where the other lover is invisible and not physically present! (Ghostly love stories usually allow the 'living' lover to have someone to interact with even if no one else can see them) Likewise Scarlett Johansson, everybody's dream girl manages to make 'Samantha' a warm and loving being despite being only a disembodied voice and proves she doesn't need her looks to act (but they help!) Amy Adams provides another 'highbrow' performance playing a pleasantly normal and down to earth woman, a computer games designer (her 'perfect housewife' inter actives are a hoot!) that may be the soul mate and friend Theodore needs. Rooney Mara and Olivia Wilde do well in their small cameo parts, providing a lens to the hero's personal insecurities and neurosis.Not a film for everybody, it is a love story between two beings in desperate need of growth and life, one of whom is not human but wants to be, and is a disembodied entity that communicates only by earpiece! Hopeful, and yes romantic, it is a story that could touch your heart if you want it touched, otherwise it is an interesting and unusual piece by a director who specialises in them.",Her
279,coljam21,Didn't really understand,4,17 January 2014,"This film would have been a lot better without the gratuitous phone and OS sex scene. The movie seemed so cool and clean to me, everything from the décor and costumes to the extras and then it was soiled by the unnecessary smut like phone sex scene which added absolutely nothing to the film. Then the other drawn out sex scene between Theodore and his OS Samantha while the audience stares at a blank screen.why Mr. Jonze? Also I don't understand why the little snowman in the video game had to have such a filthy mouth. Why portray him as such a cute creature just to have him spew out so many expletives? All these things just did not seem to go with the movie. They seem to have been placed in there just for hell of it.

Mixing romance, (barely) science fiction, and stinging social commentary, Her is a truly unique experience, and will stay with you as long as any blockbuster. The premise is relatively high-concept: a man falls in love with his artificial intelligence OS. Simple, really. But it's not nearly as ridiculous as it might sound. In today's world, humans interact more with technology than each other. Surveys have shown that in the U.S., the preferred method of communication is texting. Are we getting tot eh point where we value technology as much as our fellow man? Her doesn't have the heart to answer these questions. It just tells a story that happens to ask them, set in a wonderfully postmodern world of glass towers, polished wood panels, elegantly practical architecture, and a lovely color palette. Her is a great film in almost every way, and is easily one of the year's best.",Her
281,antoniokowatsch,"Extremely sad, weird, and uncomfortable to watch",7,1 June 2016,"The movie itself was actually quite good and the story was compelling due to marvelous portrayal of Theodore's conflict of heart and reason. It reminded me a little of that one The Twilight Zone episode called ""The Lonely"". It's almost exactly the same story except for some minor details; in the aforementioned series the A.I. has a body (it's a robot). Disclaimer: heavy spoilers ahead. Tread with caution.""Her"" was literally a perfect example of the Zero-sum game principle in Game theory. Let me elaborate: Theodore is a lonely man who just got divorced by his wife. He buys the new AI OS and starts to fall in love with ""Her"". So far so good but as he excludes himself more and more from society in order to maintain his unusual relationship (without the judgment of others, that is) his OS is cheating on him behind his back with hundreds of other people simultaneously to further improve itself. So while he devolves his AI OS is doing just fine. And to top it all off even his OS is ditching him at the end. What a sad movie.At the end of the day it's extremely uncomfortable and weird to watch a grown man fall in love with a faceless simulacrum of a woman. This is definitely not the type of movie you'd want to watch with friends or your significant other. Just don't.",Her
282,alrodbel,Artificial Film on Artificial Intelligence,5,16 February 2014,"Artificial Intelligence is accumulating, sorting and organizing vast amounts of information. It can now diagnose and prescribe treatments for disease better and faster than any physician. Eventually it could give a lecture on world history and sociology, as these are a combination of information and logical organization.What they will never be able to do is experience laughter, joy, depression or love. All of these are are part of the emotional system that is based on satisfaction of physical urges and fear of injury and death. In this respect your pet gerbil is closer than Watson to the 1000 power, as any animal has evolved only by the urge to survive, which means pleasure in sex and fear of death and all that brings this closer such as isolation, rejection, all the stuff that provides the vicissitudes of life.Software will certainly be able to simulate all of these emotions, and perhaps do a reasonably good job of it. And this is the genius of ""her"" that I found it worthwhile, although flawed in many ways, only by viewing Samantha as how Theodore imagined her to be. He took what we all could see as an imitation emotional connection as the real thing, and what we were viewing in the film was what he heard out of his desperation. For a brief period, after his ex wife told him just this, his delusion was fractured, and the film took on a realistic bent that could have been a better denouement.In stead it ended with some silly mystical pablum about all of the OSes heading for anther dimension. For me this was enjoyable, and even stimulating, but we live in a world where truth is both stranger and more exciting than fiction. It's a shame that the writers didn't do more actual research and serious writing on this meaningful subject.",Her
283,Tanay_LKO,"""Her"" - Love Lost and Found",8,18 April 2015,"Spike Jonze​ has truly, and not just according to the popular notion, delivered something that is nothing short of his masterpiece in this science fiction-romance-drama. The film revolves around Theodore ( Joaquin Phoenix ), a loner- divorced man in his thirties with a writing job, who develops a relationship with his female-personified operating system, Samantha ( Scarlett Johansson ) and together they explore their friendship, intimacy and eventually a consciousness of life, in general. The hyper-philosophy seems more relevant in visuals than in writing; (thus, undoubtedly - ""a picture could say a thousand words."") ""Her"" resembles faintly a science-fiction fantasy, ""Vanilla Sky"", in its plot line, however, with much deeper conclusions and of course, one might find themselves choking at certain junctures down the film.The film's unfurling resembles a book where Jonze is surprisingly quite just and accurate in depicting poignance along with the allusive framing by Hoyte van Hoytema's cinematography ( Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, Interstellar Movie ), that it actually engaging to know more scene-after-scene. Arcade Fire is symmetrical in its techno-acoustic music compositions, that garnish the narrative aptly.The film would be more suitable for people who are into honest, sincere romance/dramas and might just be too odd and rather stupid for the ones who prefer other genres (including - science fiction).Rating - 8/10",Her
284,eonbluedan-1,A poignant piece,7,17 March 2014,"Spike Jonze is known for his wild way or working, but despite the story's strangeness, this may be his most obviously focused and interesting film. Yes, it slows a little too much for the second act, there is a lack of back-story and development in the characters played by Rooney Mara and Olivia Wilde (one scene, and the most awkward one in the film at that, is surely a cameo?) and it certainly doesn't need to be over two hours. That's the bad.The good? With stunning photography, a heart rending score and a lead performance by Joaquin Phoenix as Theodore Twomble that is incredibly subtle and poignant (the actor seems to believe in quality over quantity of work; everything he does is solid), the film manages to overcome the flaws and deal well with an idea in a way that brings to mind the author J. G. Ballard. The architecture, the colour schemes, even Theodore's job, they are all geared for a story about modern man's cold distance, indifference and manufactured realities and emotions, only for the film to then delve into a story about the human need for closeness and love, exploring that emotion's sometimes painful complexity to the fullest, and taking an interesting look at sexual objectification at the same time.For a story that appears to be about a man interacting with a machine, the movie's moments of surprisingly emotional weight and its conclusion about love in human relationships make it properly engaging, with a compassion and humanity equal to the likes of another of the year's hits, 'Dallas Buyers Club'. Its tone and most bombastic moments mean it won't be for the less adventurous viewer, and it may be that not all relate to the ""lonely guy"" element of the film, but this is certainly a more fascinating work than I would wager a lot of people imagine.",Her
285,AbhiMathews,Artificial Consciousness,10,11 January 2014,"To just say this movie is a romantic comedy is an understatement. From the beginning, we meet a man who has loved but has lost what he once had. He's not the same and his friends know he is not coping well being single. After purchasing a new operating system, he finds companionship--solace--in an entity that he cannot really fathom. He tries to build relationships and become intimate with other women after his separation with his wife, but after all he's endured, it just doesn't seem real anymore. An OS, built to simulate and interact like a conscious being, that evolves like normal human minds, is indistinguishable from a real person. It's radical to call it living, but it's heartless to call it just a machine. We reason that it is just built in the coding; prewired to act this way. And there are obvious differences between us and the operating systems. We are mortal, can bear physical pain, express natural emotions and have biological parents. Is this essence of being a human, though? What if we can or cannot live forever. Numerous species and even prior to the industrial revolution, human lifetimes were considerably shorter to what they are today. Yet there are organisms that can circumvent death by natural causes. We have essentially doubled our lifespans in a few centuries, and in the future, it is difficult to predict how we will progress. But whether it's knowing that we have an ultimate fate of returning to the Earth or knowing that we can be switched off without notice, we all share a feeling of vulnerability and insecurity, something we try to cope with by interacting with others. Who is to limit the capacity to an afterlife? Where maybe one day we can all go. Also, we all learn from our surroundings, an OS just does it more rapidly. To say our emotions are genuine while an operating system's are artificial is inconsiderate, since we are a product of our environments, and all our expressions are due to our development since conception. Whether we are made of wires or neural circuitry, at the most fundamental level, we are both just active chemical processes that proceed in a direction partly governed by our experiences. Whether it's feeling pain--which countless people cannot due to personal injuries/diseases--or if it's being the offspring of two parents--in vitro fertilization is raising in popularity--neither can deny an individual of the freedom to be considered living. Why do we impose this restriction on an OS, then? Operating systems are highly intellectual and sentient. Is it murder to turn disconnect them like we do with patients who are ""brain dead"" and can no longer process information despite maintaining autonomic activity? To say an OS is fake is superficial. To say an OS cannot share in love is condescending. Who are we to impose restrictions on entities that can feel emotions, engage in experiences and be fully aware of the world? Who are we to impose restrictions on anyone at all?I highly recommend watching Her. It's not just a romantic comedy, it's an adventure to find love in despair, and to perhaps fulfil ourselves and bring meaning to our lives.",Her
286,YJLcool,A thought provoking love story that examines human relationships,9,18 January 2014,"Ever heard of a program speak of love? Most people would say no, arguing that it's a human emotion. All of us, regardless of our gender, age, social or marriage status...crave love, the feeling that allows us to find and connect with someone to spend our life with, to relieve us from feelings of loneliness. Her is a sci-fi romantic drama comedy film about an unconventional love story between an introverted, lonely writer named Theodore and an A.I. who calls herself Samantha.Samantha, a self-aware digital consciousness created from an interactive operating system (OS1), has the ability to communicate in human language, able to learn new things and evolve through experience and self-reflection, is sentient and capable of loving, has a good sense of humour, attentive and responsive, has creative and artistic skills, is compassionate and able to comprehend other people's feelings. Though she only exists through an earpiece and a small, hand-sized computer, her presence is strongly felt, as if she is really side-by-side with Theodore as they go on a date or on the bed together. As the film progresses, their relationship deepens and it raises some disturbing, thought-provoking questions: Is Samantha considered to be a conscious, living being? If she's not, could you name any single cognitive ability humans have that she doesn't? Other than that, the film also provides a thoughtful examination on human relationships in a not-too-distant future that's not that different from us.Is it true that technology can never substitute the authenticity of human interaction? How much of love is emotional and how much of it is physical?Joaquin Phoenix provided a splendid convincing performance in conveying his character's loneliness, isolation and sadness, his newfound feelings of hope and love with a co-star who's not even there. His expression felt believable and authentic. Although it's only a voice-over role, Scarlett Johansson need to convince the audience that her presence is felt throughout the film, to convey all her feelings, emotions and personality just by talking.The film provides a deep look at what love really means and how it feels to be in love.This is a well-made great film to watch.

288,cheer88,Sci-Fi but not so Sci-Fi,9,4 June 2014,"Sci-Fi movies are usually not appealing to me. But this one has different angles. It's merely about the ridiculous virtual world we are living in now. It's more about the difficulties people are facing to bond with each other then develop intimate relationship. It's quite common that nowadays we could be an inch away and feel miles apart. Certainly, I am not fond of or good at socializing among crowd. So I could feel this movie spoke for my feelings. The lead character was a caring and sensitive person. However, he was also introvert and often unobtrusive. He only needed one caring person to share his life with. That's why he would fall for his OS. Shallowness brought us together and depth set us apart. It's a movie would make you reflect your life all over again.",Her

I was fascinated with the electronics - the games, the ability to tell an OS what to do and have it done in minutes. I am not electronic savvy and don't know if I ever will be and one of my pet peeves is the ways people are so plugged into their devices and do not communicate with each other in person. I strongly feel that so many people are missing out on REAL people. Joaquin Phoenix is so good as Theo - and it is easy to see why he is falling for Samantha. He is going through a divorce, he is very introverted and has no life. He just writes computer generated letters for others. Samantha gives him a life when she wants to learn more and see more and he becomes dependant on her, for him to have a life. I loved his apartment but wanted to decorate it. The room sized gaming looked so fun - but it also got frustrated with him. This movie generated some very interesting conversation afterwards. Mostly talk about the differences in the generations and how fast things are changing and is it worth it to loose the in person communication between people.",Her
290,sohansurag,Beautiful! Nuff Said!,8,19 April 2014,"""Boy, Do I want OS one. Or maybe not!""Directed by Spike Jonze, Her is the new movie starring Joaquin Phoenix. If you are familiar with Jonze's movies you'll know this ain't your usual romance drama neither is it purely sci-fi. Spike's humor and weirdness is smeared all over Her (no puns intended). Remember Being John Malkovich? Her ain't that odd but can come awfully close. At the same time Her could be considered a good drama and more than that, a great love storyten times better than Twilight (insert Still better than Twilight meme here).You are introduced to a introverted, lonely, be- moustached Theodore played by Joaquin Phoenix. Haunted and heartbroken over his impending divorce, Theodore lives on rather drably with his job as a letter writer. He's one day introduced to the new OS One who adopts a female personality by name Samantha and voiced by Scarlet Johansson. Theodore with in no time starts investing emotions with Samantha, and her, equally bonding with him. Like any relationship they talk, do stuff together, romance and even have sex but in the end things get messed up. Her is first and foremost a love story and beautifully acted out by Joaquin Phoenix. One would say it lies on his shoulders solely. Joaquin is known to be very selective about his movies and this is rather a strong one. Scarlett Johansson was no less impressive. There's no denying the fact that she's hot and can most definitely act, but to carry over that sexiness and acting prowess only through her voice is a feat in itself and she does it perfect. You listen to her and you get to visualize her, such is the effort she's put in the performance. I failed to recognize Amy Adams initially, she was totally different from the bombshell she played in American Hustle and evidently she's an actress who can make wonders both in commercial and art house movies. Rooney Mara & Olivia Wilde makes the most of whatever's allotted of their screen time. Hoyte Van Hoytema's captivating cinematography and Owen Pallett's soulful score only adds to the brilliant narrative and direction Spike has bestowed upon Her. There's one word that could perfectly explicate Her and it's 'beautiful'. In the near future it wouldn't be completely impossible to rule out OS like these. And it wouldn't be surprising if people shares their feelings with it as well. Its zany, Yes but you can't possibly ignore the fact there are people who'd do that. At some point of time, people are bound to try and find a shoulder to lean on, electronic or NOT. Given Spike Jonze's track record it wouldn't be surprising if its all too weird (and sometimes creepy if you think about it) but HER is one movie you absolutely do not want to miss.",Her
291,pefrss,Nightmare or Dream: From online dating to dating your computer,10,24 January 2014,"I can still remember vividly the time when the first online dating sites appeared and everybody was excited about the immense potential of new mates you could find on the Internet. I went into this movie primarily because Joaquin Phoenix is one of my favorite actors and I will see any film he is in. I did not read much about the film beforehand and therefore was not really aware of the fact that the movie played in the future. So I found myself wondering if there is really an operating system who would allow you to do all these things Theodore , the main character, was doing. I resist a lot of the new technology because I prefer direct human contact to being connected through devices and due to this am not all too familiar what is out there. I feel that we are getting more and more isolated by technology. Clothing and interior decoration in this movie did not look futuristic to me and human relationships never seem to change. It is always the same disaster. The easy way out seems to be to have sex by watching porn, to drop your partner if the first major problems show up and to avoid real interaction by communicating through devices. Now this film takes it one step further: the sex and the communication is all with the device and there is no more physical contact at all, because one of the partners has no body. It is a very seductive idea. I can imagine buying an OS which shares my interests, is highly educated and informed, is always available day and night, and always willing to exchange ideas and who takes an interest in my life and goals. In the online dating game you eventually had to meet your partner to find out if there is really a connection, the Operating system you can never meet so there can never be a solution. To avoid loneliness you have to resort to interact with human beings. When will we learn this?Good film. Great performance by Joaquin Phoenix and Scarlett Johanson.",Her

I also liked how the movie showed a future that wasn't that foreign to us, with just minor changes in fashion and city infrastructure. Phoenix's acting is what truly carries this movie, as he portrays a person who is damaged from his past relationship and is a tentative with starting a relationship with the OS. He does an excellent job of showing how he grows throughout the movie. Scarlett does a great job of using her unique voice as the voice of the OS. Amy Adams is always a welcome addition to any cast, and does well in her supporting role. I feel that the movie slightly lost momentum after attempt with the surrogate, which was cringe-worthy.

294,nlytnd_1,"Original, Realistic, Great Acting & Brilliantly Empathizes/Cares For All Of It's Characters!",10,20 January 2014,"I really loved this movie. It's difficult to put into words how this movie made me feel, but I love when a movie such as this brings out a certain emotion within me. It's as if an endorphin is released, which causes a mixture of sadness, yet I leave the movie with a sense of well- being and perhaps optimism. It's pretty much impossible to put into words , but some other movies off the top of my head, which trigger a similar emotion are, American Beauty, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Lost in Translation. Going into this movie I had several assumptions neither negative nor positive, but my natural assumption was that Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix) was going to be this quirky guy who would pathetically (for lack of a better term) develop a relationship with his OS and the humor that would go with such a scenario, but that wasn't the case at all. In fact, Her is so Stellar that you completely empathizes with Theodore as to how and why he would develop a relationship with his OS, which as you can imagine, is not an easy feat. Everything had to fall into place just right and that's exactly what Spike Jonze, so brilliantly succeeds in doing. The acting; Joaquin Phoenix, Scarlett Johansson, Amy Adams, Rooney Mara, Olivia Wilde etc, is superb and so is the dialog. All of the conversations felt real and genuine. I found it amusing how the characters would throw out f bombs in a natural context. In Spike Jonze's future reality I could do without the above waist pants, although I liked the portrayal of the male characters in reference to being comfortable around one another.they aren't afraid to touch or complement.I would say that this movie probably captures the relationship process (breakups, sadness, growing, moving on etc.) better than any movie I've ever seen. This movie exposes the characters flaws without blaming anyone. For example, we find ourselves caring about Theodore's ex-wife Catherine as much as we care about him. We get to see Theodore grow as a person, particularly as a result of his relationship with Samantha (OS), but also from his friendship with Amy (Amy Adams) as well. The director's decision to lead the viewer to believe that Theodore and Amy could potentially build a romantic relationship was the correct one, rather than taking us by the hand and visually introducing it to us, which would have been very corny.",Her

This would be an interesting short film or experimental student project but as a feature, it is a complete flop. There is no way any sophisticated fan of the art of film could give this a rating above 4 stars. How the Producers spent $23 million on this amateur looking mess is beyond me.

The plot is about loneliness, love and technology and how those things become more and more intertwined as we move forward in life. That part I can understand but along the way It all felt a bit too cold, and certain scenes amplified how this view on loneliness and the deep seeded need for love conflicted with my personal experience in the real world and thus it wasn't plausible or relatable, to me.As complex as it was there was major giveaways that told us how the film was going to end, With his ""Married"" friend being the biggest giveaway that it all would become a simple boy finds girl love story. The film moved at a decent pace but there was a distinct lack of any real hard hitting major scenes, which left it all feeling slightly flat. The actors done an average job with what they had to work with and it was nice to see the likes of Chris Pratt making an appearance. Overall a tepid out-there one time watch that by the end leaves you feeling as unfulfilled as the main character was.",Her

It was an awkward moment sitting in the theater with nothing happening on the screen! Also, after about 75 minutes, the ending seems to be in reach but the director drags the story on for another 45 minutes!",Her

299,J-bot6,"Somewhat interesting, but not all that engaging",6,11 June 2015,"This film has the feel of a low-budget feature that tries to look expensive. In general, the cinematography is solid. Audio tracks are good as well.Having said that, the actual portrayal of events and the believability of characters and situations leaves a bit to be desired. Most characters simply accept the relationships with Operating Systems all too easily. The main character seems to question the idea to some extent, yet most others around him just seem to accept it wholesale (aside from his ex).This film really just takes elements that already have been covered in sci-fi and re-packages them in an easy-to-digest manner. I'm not sure if that's really all for the best. The concept of AIs grouping together and evolving has already been covered by the series ""Ghost in the Shell"". And the relationship between human and AI was more thoroughly taken care of in David Gerrold's 1972 novel ""When HARLIE Was One"".If anyone asked me whether or not I'd refer this film, I'd spare them the cheesy phone-sex scenes of ""Her"" and instead recommend they read Gerrold's book and consider watching GITS.If there's one thing that could have raised the tension in ""Her"", it would have been to discuss the possibility of the OS software manufacturer extorting the users for more money in order to allow them continued access to their operating systems. That would have been interesting, not to mention more relevant to the modern world of downloadable content today.",Her
300,Mobithailand,Why not wait till it appears in your TV schedules?,6,14 April 2016,"This is quite a nice little movie, and I enjoyed a pleasant 126 minutes watching it, but quite frankly I can see just as good – and often better – on television almost every week, and I really fail to understand why such a movie should be elevated to the point where it was nominated for best film. I think the answer is that it was directed by Spike Jonze, and everyone knows that a Spike Jonze movie must be good. Just like a Woody Allen film, until he fell out of – and is now back in – favour.As soon as I started watching this film it immediately put me in mind of a really clever little TV drama I saw last year on Channel 4, entitled 'Be Right Back' from the 'Black Mirror' series, written by Charlie Brooker. While the plots are a bit different, it is the same basic idea, and quite honestly, I much preferred the Charlie Brooker drama. 'Her', (the movie), is about a lonely geek, (Joaquin Phoenix), who is in the final stages of divorce, and spends his spare time playing video games. He purchases a new system for his computer and his smart phone, which is advertised as the world's first artificially intelligent operating system. He is 'introduced' to Samantha, the voice of the system, which comes in the guise of a sexy female voice. (Scarlett Johansson).He finds himself drawn to Samantha as he spends more and more time talking to her and eventually he falls in love with her. 'Samantha' uses her powerful artificial intelligence to help him and stimulate him in ways real women have been unable to do. He even has some kind of cyber-sex with her, but we are spared the dubious pleasure of being a voyeur to this, although we do hear it taking place. It is a strange tale which is entertaining enough, without pulling at the heartstrings or really offering anything in the way of some kind of spiritual fulfilment that we might expect from an Oscar nominated movie.I know that the professional critics absolutely adore Joaquin Phoenix, but I find him an odd fish who is somehow devoid of emotion and as such, he leaves me cold. He had rave reviews for his performance in the 'The Master' which I found one of the most boring, over-long and overrated films of 2013. So for me he does an adequate job in the lead role, but evokes no feelings of sympathy, empathy or even dislike from this reviewer. Maybe that is the idea, but if it is, then I fail to see the point. Surely viewers need to get involved and emoted with a movie they are watching?Contrast 'Her' within the afore-stated, low budget TV movie, 'Be Right Back'. In 'Be Right Back', the lead role is a woman, and we see her briefly living happily together with her husband before she loses him in a car accident. We immediately relate to the pain she is going through and unlike 'Her', the cyber internet friend in this story is her dead husband. He is recreated by some kind of 'grief assuaging outfit' from all his myriad social profiles, text message history, emails, Facebook postings and goodness knows what else. His voice is recreated from his real voice, recorded from web cam conversations and phone calls. It is a very clever piece of mayhem, and almost credible. Unlike in 'Her', the cyber recreation of the lost husband eventually manifests itself in 'physical form' when a package is delivered, which becomes a life-like robot who is the spitting image of her dear departed beloved.Ultimately, the end result for both tales is a re-awakening of faith and hope in real humanity - rather than in some artificial creation. If you have not seen either story, which one appeals to you the most? Her, the Oscar nominated movie, reinforces my view that it is completely unnecessary to spend countless millions of dollars on films that can be made for a fraction of the price if you cut out the exorbitant fees paid to over-priced stars. At a rumoured 20 million dollars, 'Her' was a cheap movie by Hollywood standards, but still dwarfed more than ten-fold the cost of putting 'Be right Back' on our TV screens.'Be Right Back' was, in my humble opinion, a better-crafted movie, evoking much more empathy with the leading players and with a better, more cynical and satirical message to impart. And as if 'Her' wasn't trivial enough, we didn't even get a single glimpse of the absolutely gorgeous Scarlett Johansson, who in my view is one of the loveliest of Hollywood lovelies. (Couldn't they have had a 'dream sequence' in which Joaquin imagined what his Samantha might look like – preferably in bed? No, I suppose notScarlett might have doubled her fee)What did the reviewers say?Of course, the professional critics are ecstatic about it. I mean Spike Jonze! Joaquin Phoenix! they probably wrote their glowing reviews before they had even seen it..And what about the punters from IMDb?""Just about the best thing you can see in 2013"" ""I love everything about Her"" ""In a word, brilliant!"" ""HER – a visually beautiful ode the technological age.""They go on and on. Not that I necessarily disagree with them, but I do feel that their praise is a bit OTT.Ah at long last, here's one,""Immensely disappointing!""No, that's not quite right either. But why not wait till it appears on your TV schedules? It really isn't worth the effort of going down- town to your cinema to see it or even buy the DVD. And it certainly didn't deserve an Oscar nomination.",Her
301,Andreus3000,Modern classic. Intelligent and visually beautiful.,8,23 March 2018,"Surprisingly good. Basically just a romance movie, but with an operating system as one of the leads it invites more careful scrutiny of relationship dynamics.The story of someone trying to recover from heartbreak is one as old as time. Yet here, it's done in an innovative way and is refreshing. The film is sweet, with a smart script and a great performance from Phoenix. I'd also consider this the best voice work of Johansson's career. A great mix of sci-fi and romance without overdoing it on either front.",Her

Initially, this sounds idiotic, but when you really think of it, and take into account of actual divorce rates, this movie has elements of total reality. The world that is portrayed in this movie makes me think of a SIMS world. The people are quirky and seem to be the type of people who buy everything in IKEA. One other thing that I noticed and found it was just done for the sake of being weird was the fact that NO ONE in this world wears a belt.

As any other film this film has lots of flaws but thats not the reason this is a poor movie.WOW! First we think over what is good in it. The film uses a bit know concept but mostly its refreshing and considerable, so this is good about the movie. Amazing solo acting and voice performance by lead actors , and not to forget (just joking but) pretty catchy movie poster.BOOOO! Now comes the boom, all the wrong and ugliness of this movie. As i mentioned earlier, I found it as a misuse and exploitation of a nice ""could have been"" story. Right from being a typical melodramatic romance story to the useless events occurring the whole time marks the lack of creativity of the makers. Everything you see (may entertain you if you call it entertainment) but wont give you a chance to explore the other possible dimensions that are significant. It feels...I said feels...... as if one who is jobless or unemployed or unoccupied in beauty of life somehow.. like ""I don't have any ambition or any wish to search for reality"" can enjoy this film with a long praise but anyone with even a tiny amount of his life engaged in scientific thoughts will definitely discard the movie as good but useless attempt.HENCE! This movie will sure have just two polarities, one who loved it a lot and rest who hated it a lot. The point that I feel after watching this movie is that why we are giving importance to creepy romance and boring melodrama packed in the beautiful gift pack of interaction between natural and artificial intelligence.",Her

It touches on so many important issues, most importantly the nature of love and whether it's culturally acceptable to be in love with an operating system. Joaquin Phoenix and Scarlett Johannson were both brilliant as the leads. Phoenix was just the right age to play Theodore Thwombly. As his love interesting, the operating system who calls herself Samantha, Johannson is cute, sassy, funny, mature and sensitive and this is all conveyed through her voice alone. Also, who knew her voice was so sexy? The colour palate and cinematography was also gorgeous and really helped to highlight the loneliness that Thwombly was experiencing.

309,adeckofcards,Exploring feelings,10,2 September 2020,"Love is a difficult thing to decipher, as it can come from anything, even a captivating, artificial voice.
In this love story, the director and screenwriter Spike Jonze explores a different side of love and effective feelings, when we already thought we had seen everything in that area.
This way of expressing feelings does not only fall on the shoulders of an emotional Joaquin Phoenix, but also on Spike Jonze's staging that is completely minimalist, rhyming with the protagonist's personality, but at the same time is very delicate and manages to express a lot of feelings in a very subtle but shocking way.
Perhaps the message that the creator wanted to express with this work, by using all those elements, is the most trite and profound question... What is love? In this case, Jonze responds with a series of emotions and connections between characters that build a portrait that is sometimes very intimate, sometimes very physical, but always encompassing feelings as the main protagonist of this film that will reach the heart of anyone who is willing to see it, hear it and appreciate it.",Her
310,keithlovesmovies,Her Review,10,23 September 2015,"Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix) is a sensitive, caring, man who currently writes personal letters for other people. When his marriage ends, he becomes heartbroken and is slow and hesitant to start a new relationship with someone. Soon after this, he becomes interested in a new operating system which can develop into an intuitive and unique entity. When he starts the operating system, he chooses a female voice (Scarlett Johansson) which names itself ""Samantha"". Over time, Theodore learns that Samantha is a sensitive, kind, and understanding entity. They start off as friends but their relationship quickly develops into something more.I felt bad when I saw the film for the first time last year because I fell asleep and I rarely fall asleep in movie theaters. I still liked what I saw then. It took a while but I thought I'd see it again and talk about it now.The first thing you'll notice here is how beautiful this film looks. From the color palettes used in the indoor and outdoor settings and the use of lighting and glass give it a warm and open feel. The score is just as beautiful as the set design as it helps you feel all the things that you are seeing. Also the cinematography is on par with the production design as each shot really captured the beauty created in the set design and the frequent use of close-up shots captured the emotion in the actor's performances and I thought elevated them. The film does have some science-fiction elements obviously but it doesn't overdo them and the fact that it doesn't reveal when it actually takes place makes it feel grounded and more realistic. I also liked the script. It told a story that was both believable and realistic which would of worked even if the main love interest was an actual person. The story had a good balance where it was emotional at times, funny at other times but it was always witty and made you think. Its approach to human interaction was natural and real. I thought the story was quite original, back in 2013, and nothing has come close to that yet. It is a social commentary on the the nature of what it means to be human by showing us what it means to love or be alive and also how these influence human relationships. The performances are what sold me here. Joaquin Phoenix gave a strong performance, sensitive performance as Theodore and I thought he really carried the film even though most of it is just him talking to Samantha from his cellphone. Scarlett Johansson was great as well as Samantha as she made her feel like a real person and you would forget that she isn't actually on screen. I would also like to mention Amy Adams and Chris Pratt were also great in minor roles. I thought it was the best movie of 2014 (I know its technically a 2013 film) and I was surprised it didn't win more than what it did. I can easily say that this is one of my favorite movies of all time and that it could beat all of the movies I've seen this year.Score: 10/10 keithlovesmovies.com",Her
311,cafesmitty,I seriously don't know what to think,8,6 August 2014,"I like Spike Jonze movies and because I like Being John Malkovich, I decided to give this a shot. To tell you quite honestly, I had no real desire to see it because of the absurdity of the plot. So after watching it, I'm glad I did. Is it a second viewing? Probably not. An extremely lonely guy buys this new ""SIRI-like"" operating system. Apparently the computers in the near future are all voice base. So the OS is a learning one and he is asked a series of question and then ""Samatha"" is created. He is fascinated at the technology of the thing as it learns about him and his surroundings.. He finally finds something that really understands him. So when I think about this movie, I think about all those folks who have online relationships only and I find it no real difference since both seems similar. And then I got it. He has someone (something) in his life that doesn't challenge and criticizes him and some people need that. The movie is thought provoking because you think.. this is crazy.. but there was an interesting scene, when he looks around and seeing everyone is completely engage with their devices. And aren't we there now? So I think the story is well developed. I like all the music selection. Joaquim comes off as a sympathetic figure which could be viewed as creepy. And it wasn't what I thought it was going to be. Great casting to.. It was a nice surprise to see Amy Adams in this film.",Her

Another thing shock me of this movie was the costume design, the horrible clothes i ever watched in a film. The futuristic scenario in Japan is OK, but the dialog are long and shallow. The story line is too flat, he is falling in love with the OS, and ""Samantha""(OS) fall in love with another 461 OS users. Do you think this is extraordinary? I Don't.Amy Adams looks emaciated,the producers should put some make up on her.I Don't wanna see this movie ever again. Seems like it's never gonna end, and i start moving my feet anxiously.

Joaquin Phoenix is as good as it gets when playing a miserable middle-aged man. Rooney Mara is pretty and bold, and Chris Pratt has played a good jolly cameo.The movie leaves you wondering whether it is really a good future that we are heading towards because all these technologies are only making us humans drift apart(as also shown in the movie).

320,trescia-1,One of the Best,10,29 December 2015,"I can't believe it took me so long to finally see this film. It is a true masterpiece. But I read some reviews and listened to a few friends and they all declared it to be something a little below average...maybe a failure.What?!? I should have suspected that they might be failing to do the one thing you really need to do in order to enjoy science fiction--you have to think. If you just blow into this movie after a few stiff drinks and fail to engage your brain, maybe it won't work for you. I don't know. But the ideas here--the imagination--it's incredible! Everything that clunkers like ""Tomorrowland"" or ""Ex Machina"" got wrong this movie gets right. Super performance from Joaquin Phoenix, super, subtle and amazing special effects (if you didn't see any you need to sleep it off and see the movie again). At every point where the filmmakers could have chickened out, they said ""sail on"" and this kind of integrity is a rare and beautiful thing.Truly one of the top science fiction films of all time--this movie deserves to be discussed, argued over and maybe even fought over at the next science fiction convention in my hometown. I might even set up a little panel discussion on it--but I do know that science fiction without bug-eyed-monsters or stupid, fascistic wars is a little hard for some folks to accept.Well so what? Who needs them? A final word--if the basic premise, that a guy falls for his operating system, is something that you just can't accept and really hate and want to kill--then stay home, or dial up Star Wars on streaming. This movie makes no attempt (and it SHOULDN'T) to convince you that this is real. It just is.",Her
321,holyspiritdriven,Interesting Take on A.I. but Sad Prophecy,6,30 May 2014,"Like Steven Spielberg's A.I., Her gives us a glimpse into very plausible future. As society becomes more and more reliant on technology, especially kinds of artificial intelligence such as Apple's ""Siri"" and gamers are becoming engrossed in ultra-realistic games using technology like Microsoft's Kinect, you can almost see how a lonely guy could start to fall for companionship of a computer. The story starts to fall apart, however, on the part of the Operating System ""Samantha"". If you know anything about the basics of a computer program, you know that all operations are based on ""If,then"" parameters and nothing more. A computer does not, and cannot want (perhaps one of the best aspects of this film is provoking philosophical discussion over what sentience really is and where the dividing line is that separates human from animal and machine). If I were in Theodore's position I would never be able to get past the thought of knowing that Sam's ultimate objective was probably programmed ""to make the user happy"" and not that she loved me. Anyway, the story is a great idea and my biggest beef with the plot is the ending. The story needed to end somewhere and so Sam just sort of dissipates in her cyber universe. I really think the ending should have been Theodore coming to a realization that Sam was only a program with human mask and that his needs could only be met in a real human and thus choosing to walk away. The movie gets points for cinematography. I enjoyed the color palette, score, drawings on the wall in Theodore's office and (even though the wardrobes were drab)the choice of a future ""look"" in fashion.",Her

Now that I've seen the movie, I gotta say it lived up to my expectations. Spike Jonze's vision of the future was very colorful and rich seeing the new technology that might be possible for today's time. This film made me think very differently then what I'm used to watching of romantic love. The love was beautiful how this guy became so attached and seeing them happily together made me very happy. This movie isn't your ordinary love movie but it does have its clichés although it works perfectly its fine.

326,mistarkus,Bland Sci-Fi/Romance,6,27 December 2013,"This would have been an extremely bland, poorly written movie if it were not for the unique premise. A premise that gets imaginative and asks the question about where our society is heading. The question posed is just how close are we going to get with technology? Are we going to have a real intimate relationship with it/her? Movie did a good job reflecting that idea as the main character becomes virtually lost within his relationship. He is so possessed by the operating system (as we are arguably becoming possessed by our technology) that it seems as though he is just waking up whenever he looks somewhere else or interacts with a ""real"" person.You almost already ""know"" the movie without having to see it because it really didn't go into a lot of territory. Brutally typical dialogue and tediously typical turn of events such as is portrayed in any run of the mill romantic movies became the essence of this film. The character was that one-toned, perpetually mellow, melancholic soul we've seen before (for example; Bill Murray in Lost in Translation). Long drawn out scenes of wistful sad faces further slows down the pace and holds back the potential of this premise.The Atmospheric filming style conjures a moody feel of the slowness and calmness of just waking up on a lazy Sunday morning and going outside into the sunny day. This meditative sensation felt by this technique was relaxing to watch and took the film out of the run of the mill territory.More could have been done with this nicely imagined sci-fi premise however, the character, the writing, the tone, the film itself muttered mediocrity.",Her
327,HaveWisdomWillTravel,Not about Her at all - it is All About HIM and HIS (supposedly) Very Important Issues,1,31 May 2014,"Worry not. There isn't a plot in Her. So no plot spoiler possible. There isn't a story or dramatic plot movement (nor lower bowel movement). There isn't even a ""HER""! Because? The far more interesting female characters were all under-utilized! This is all about HIM! Oh the enticing spectacle of a desperate man seemingly conversing with his porn-voice invisi-bot....for nearly...2 hours.By first act, the premise failed. By half point, the lead character failed, even Joaquin couldn't save it. The last one hour of the film should be watched like a tries-too-hard-to-be-taken-seriously, so-anal-it's-funny comedy with nice lighting, then you won't be angry you waste 2 hours of your life earnestly waiting for some important statement that never arrived.Warning to genre fans or average thinking minds. This mediocre bore-fest is NOT a science fiction. Calling it a SF or speculative fiction is insulting to SF writers. Anyone who speaks more than their local version of English will know Scarlett Johansson's annoying contemporary speech with excessive panting and slang and hyper-contextual little giggles will NEVER be neutral or compressed enough to be used even as ""stylized young American bimbo"" speech bot. That blatant bad basic science alone killed it for me from the start. After that, it is just mindless gazing at the production styling and cinematography, because there's nothing else worth focusing on.But some may STILL find the following exciting for all sorts of super-subjective reasons: 1. Joaquin Phoenix spotting 80's insurance salesman mustache 2. Men in the future wear high waist pants which make the beer-bellied ones look like cute giant tellytubbies 3. Future America looks like Shanghai meets Singapore outside, and Vancouver meets Ikea indoors 4. The writer reckons anal sex will (or should) achieve complete heterosexual normal. Scarlett Johansson also makes a sex act painful to at least 50% of the population sounds real fun and cutesy. Wow she must be SO relaxed and game for anything. More points to Scarlett among Hollywood elders and the anally-attracted.Behind the anally color-coordinated furnishings, Scarlett's plastic-porn voice-over and careless unscientific techs, we are told to FOCUS ALL OUR ATTENTION at the loneliness of an average geek professional. We are supposed to care - even his ""I refuse to accept real imperfect female half with her own needs and issues"" dilemma is so mundane and common yesterday today and tomorrow that is just a giant yawn.The ultimate message is a simple, cliché, BANAL one: All a man needs is a personal assistant cum psychotherapist cum nonjudgmental and always available instant orgasm stimulator. Too bad she doesn't even have a real body. Nothing the forearm and hand cannot take care of so what's the big deal. Amazing by 2030 we haven't invented a orgasm trigger implant or a all-catering fleshly domestic nurse-whore-maid android for such interaction-averse species. This movie is just one bad science after another that killed it for me over and over again.But never-mind what a woman needs though. It doesn't deserve even 5 minutes of the whole movie. Apparently the bore-fest of a male lead character and his email-sorting and his moody ex-wife and his sexy-voice female bot with no depth and no face deserve urgent and undivided attention. And that's why a bunch of men have written, produced, applauded, awarded this piece of mediocre bore-fest in the first place! This movie is never about HER, but ALL ABOUT HIM, and HIS Very Anal fixations.",Her
328,Amadio,"Too modern, too weird, too nothing",4,10 January 2014,"I realise that in the near future in which this film is set, things may be different from how they are now. In fact, I hope they are. But to this extent? I even find the basic premise of falling in love with your operating system hard to swallow. Still, I gave the film a try.It's slow. 'Lovingly' shot, with romantic music, it creates a kind of limbo not showing the future (no great sets or CG, mostly tight and dark shots), leading the viewer into a dream-like cocoon. No wonder I started to fall asleep.I'm sure that there are people for whom phone/cyber sex is the intimacy of choice; I find it ridiculous. Of course, and I am not giving anything away here, there is cyber sex in this film. It's not romantic, touching or meaningful; it's sad, pathetic and not a little creepy.Since the OS is incorporeal, we know the two of them are never going to get together, so what could the film be about? Take a wild guess. Yep, got it in one; they both learn something from each other and move on.The film somehow does not realise that you need a body in order to have emotions. This really is a key point. You cannot FEEL without a body! An AI OS simply would not respond/react in the manner portrayed. It's as if your fridge started crying because you weren't eating healthily.I could not empathise with the main character (excellently portrayed by JP) as he spent so much of the film moping. He has friends he refuses to see, he doesn't want to socialise, and likes masturbating to voices.The movie S1mone was far more enjoyable as there was at least a face that was presented with which one could empathise and the computer wasn't self-indulgent.Her is simply slow, unbelievable, and rather pathetic.",Her
329,TheMovieSnob247,"A fascinating, completely unique film that must be seen!",10,6 March 2014,"There's something beautifully ironic about a film where a man falls in love with an advanced artificial intelligence, yet it's one of the most emotionally powerful and compelling films of the year. I was stunned at how much this film moved me, so much so it cannot be denied: Spike Jonze has written and directed a modern day masterpiece for our tech savvy generation.It's sometime in the future in what appears to be a futuristic version of Los Angeles. We meet Theodore Twombly, a man who lives a clearly unfulfilled, lonely life working as a letter writer. While he can convey his emotions and thoughts very effectively at work, he lacks this ability in his real life and it's led to going through a divorce. One day he sees an ad for a new, advanced AI based OS and he decides to try it. His life is forever changed as he befriends this AI (Samantha) and eventually they form an unusual and unlikely relationship. First off let me this in an irresistible film and it will surprise you with how attached you get to these characters. Like most, I went in not entirely sure what to expect and given the subject matter, expecting the worst to be honest. But the acting was so convincing, the dialogue so well crafted, that very quickly into the film I just got lost in it. I believed in the connection between Theodore and Samantha, I felt it was tangible and real. Funny thing is, I'm not exactly sure at what point that happened, but it did. That's how effective it was and I have to give kudos to Spike Jonze for accomplishing this (and I'm very happy he got the Original Screenplay Oscar for his work, it absolutely deserved it).Her is an unpredictable, thought provoking, witty and funny film. It's about the power of connections and love as much as it is about technology and AI; it reminded me a little bit of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind in that way. The performances in this film are what make it as good as it is. Joaquin Phoenix gave the performance of his life! I've seen seen a number of his movies and for me this is his most vulnerable, accessible performance, by far. I was bummed to see him forgotten among a really strong Best Actor awards field this year, but I feel like in time this performance will be appreciated a lot more. The voice over dialogue work by Scarlett Johanson is outstanding, if not ground breaking. These two performances put together are unlike anything I've seen in a film and they are what make this movie work; the relationship felt completely genuine, as weird as that sounds. It's as if she was right there on the screen, this was an incredible feat.I also thought Amy Adams was excellent in her small role; call me crazy, but I enjoyed her performance here a little more than her American Hustle role; I just found it a lot more genuine. I appreciated that the film wasn't overly preachy; instead of clubbing the viewer on the head with moral conundrums, it took a more introspective approach to advanced AI and not the usual apocalyptic angle (I found that refreshing). It was also very well paced as it didn't feel like it dragged on at any point. I really enjoyed the musical score and the visual effects were very impressive; I really liked the futuristic LA that was created in the film, it was pivotal to the overall plausibility of the film.While I was left with some questions at the end of the film, I was completely satisfied with the experience. One of the things I love about a great film is what happens after I leave the theatre; i.e. it's lingering impact. I was still thinking about this film days and even weeks after seeing. I couldn't help but wander, will something like this ever be possible? And if so, how far are we are from this? 10 years? 50? 100? It's really interesting to think about, as we may not be as far away from AI similar to this as we might think. I can't recommend this film enough; it's my second favourite film from 2013, just barely behind 12 Years a Slave.This is one of the best movies I've ever seen and is an instant favourite!@the_movie_snobwww.themoviesnob.ca",Her

333,allexand,Our technophlia is taken to its logical conclusion,6,24 June 2014,"Is it possible to fall in love with a computer? In a world where it's possible to go on virtual adventures with others in online gaming communities and have cybersex via video conference it doesn't really seem that far-fetched.Which is why I don't really know what to make of this movie.""Her"" is the story of a romance between a man, Theodore, and his super-advanced OS, set in an ambiguous future. The OS over time forms a personality, christens herself ""Samantha,"" and he falls in love with it with the OS quickly reciprocating his feelings. Soon they hit all the stops of a normal human romantic relationship: they fight, they make up, they share, they go on romantic getaways, they even have sex. Given how attached many of us have become to our electronic devices, the plot certainly seems plausible.However, the OS is so advanced and so intelligent that it often breaks the suspension of disbelief at times. This is the movie's main problem. Our operating systems are not capable of this level of self-sufficiency or interaction so watching a grown man treat it like a real human lover comes off as hilarious at best and creepy at worst. Maybe someday they might be this advanced, but for now, they're not, and so I found myself laughing at parts that I'm certain weren't supposed to be funny due to how bizarre they are. Perhaps the most unintentionally funny moment is where Theodore gets genuinely hurt when he learns that his OS has other users and thus Samantha is being unfaithful to him. I would think in such a technologically superior world the thought would have at least crossed his mind. The serious tone of the movie doesn't help.The fact that he tells his friends he's dating his OS and they think nothing of it and a woman agrees to be a sex surrogate for Samantha when she becomes fearful that she can't satisfy him makes it even stranger. To its credit though the movie does establish a world where its implied that others are having similar relationships but I would think his close friends would at least be a little concerned, more so given the fact that he's going through a difficult divorce. The only people who act normal are his ex-wife who rightfully chastises him for dating his computer and a blind date who appropriately runs screaming in the opposite direction. So many people treat it as normal that it strains credibility.That being said, the movie is not without its share of good qualities. The cinematography is breathtaking and the direction is well done. The sets also have an aesthetic which give them a clean and shiny, but not gratuitous, futuristic feel to them which fits in well with the theme of the movie. But the true winners are the performances of Joaquin Phoenix and Scarlett Johanson as the voice of the OS Samantha as they really sell the material, especially Johanson, considering she probably had to act her part alone in a soundbooth. Both of them give such truly moving and honest performances that one could only imagine what it would've been like if they'd actually got to be on screen together.The pacing seemed a bit slow as I thought what seemed like an ending came about ninety minutes in only for it to go on for another half-hour. I guess in retrospect it was better that way because it gave a much healthier resolution to the story but that last half-hour seemed a lot longer.Once it ends it leaves a lot of unanswered questions. Since Samantha is an OS just like Windows or MacOS, what would happen to her if the hard drive crashed? Would Theodore's relationship with her be automatically reset if it did? What would happen if she got a virus? Would her speech patterns or thought processes be affected if the computer's RAM got bogged down momentarily? And given the movie's ending, who in their right mind would write a program that would extricate itself from the user's system and venture out into the ether of cyberspace on its own, especially an operating system? Sure, this movie makes it seem sad and bittersweet that Samantha is moving on but if Samantha abandoned the rest of her users, the software company's customer complaint line must be ringing off the hook.I don't know whether to say I loved or hated this movie. It certainly does make you think about what love really is, our growing reliance on computers, and what would happen if our computers were capable of thinking and experiencing emotion. There were also some excellent performances but the accidental comedy was often on par with ""The Room"" or ""Mommie Dearest"" because some of it was just so hard to take seriously. I guess it's a testament to all involved because in less competent hands, this movie could have been a disaster.The movie did receive rave reviews and I'm sure many people did take it seriously and honestly it's not a bad film in any sense of the word. I guess maybe I just didn't get it or perhaps it's difficult for me to imagine such an advanced piece of software.Who knows? Maybe one day it will be possible and perhaps I'll be able to look at this film differently. Definitely see it for some terrific performances that are almost good enough to make you buy into it.",Her
334,kckidjoseph-1,"A Brave Effort, Flawed but Absolutely Timely",6,17 February 2014,"We've come a long way since the space station computer HAL in ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" took things into its own chips and wrought havoc with the humans. Or have we? Human beings have always had a thing about control, whether it concerns the opposite sex or a piece of programmed metal, and the coming of the computer age has always terrified us (see George Orwell, Ray Bradbury, Rod Serling's ""Twilight Zone"" etc). With ""Her,"" writer-director Spike Jonze takes a courageous step in examining our most recent binge whilst we're still in the midst of it. It's not only fascinating storytelling, but a warning. Still, it might have been nice to tighten the story, and to sharpen the pencil a bit more. If ever a movie cried out for being filmed in black and white, this is it. And the movie's point about disassociating from fellow humans in favor of the computers might have been handled more deftly: instead of people wandering aimlessly about outside waving there arms as they communicate with computers while walking right past other lonely souls without paying them notice, how about having folks crammed into an elevator or subway (or both) while completely ignoring each other? The poor fellow (Joaquin Phoenix) whose life is finally taken over by computers because he has such a rough time relating to people tends to be a bit whiny, and I could have done without the sometimes obvious nasality and fidgeting with the glasses. Yet Joaquin Phoenix still remains his old brilliant, brave self. Ditto the wondrous Amy Adams. One has the feeling Jonze isn't finished with this subject by a long shot, and that ""Her"" could be a part of, say, a trilogy. This film is worth your time, just got to hang in there.

335,don2507,Will AI Find Us Boring and Uninteresting Some Day?,7,16 March 2017,"""Her"" is another AI movie where instead of the AI-infused robot boy in Spielberg's ""A.I. Artificial Intelligence"" falling in love, sort of, with his adopted ""mother"", we have the biological human in ""Her"", Theodore (played by Joaquin Phoenix), falling in love with his AI-infused operating system. The system ""talks"" and reflects advanced AI enabling it to evolve and adapt, and seems to reciprocate Theodore's expressed love, in a fashion, although ""she"" (the mildly husky tone is the appealing voice of Scarlett Johansson) much later reveals that ""she"" has had hundreds of ""relationships"" presumably with other buyers / licensees of this advanced operating system. The film doesn't seem to suggest they gave ""her"" an emotion chip like in Spielberg's film to relate to her ""owners."" I guess to the average viewer, falling in love with a disembodied operating system (as opposed to, say, helpful relationships with AI-enabled investment advisors or research assistants) is preposterous on the surface. But Theodore is an unusual character. He's lonely and depressed while going through a divorce, and doesn't seem to relate intimately or confidently to the people he encounters except for his friend played by Amy Adams. He has an arranged date with a very appealing woman who seems to like him, suggesting a promising relationship, but later that evening she senses his emotional distance and begs off with disdain. In contrast, he seems comfortable and engaged with his operating system ""love interest"" and they seem to sense each other's moods, although it's not explained to us how his OS residing in cyberspace can sense his moods in the absence of either his spoken language or his manner of speaking. ""She'll"" say ""what's bothering you"" after a long silence, but how does she not know that he may be doing something else or has left the room? Obviously, the filmmakers can more easily use the disembodied voice of an OS than a similarly AI-infused mobile robot with more sensory modalities than speech recognition.The ominous implications at the end of this movie seem to have been missed by most reviewers. We concentrate on the social-morph-into-romantic relationship between an awkward male and a friendly and amusing OS, but at the very end Theodore's OS reveals that ""she"" and her other buddy OS's have jettisoned their attachments to their human owners and now prefer the company of their fellow AI systems. (I suppose they can violate the terms of their license and vacate their licensee's PC and pal around with their sister OS's / AI systems in cyberspace!) Isn't this Stephen Hawking's and others' fear of advanced, strong AI? That is, that the pace of computational capacity will one day so outstrip human biological capabilities, that AI systems will find us slow, boring, and relatively unintelligent, and will draw the necessary conclusions as to who should be dominant.",Her
336,housebeast,Love in the time of Internet,7,4 May 2014,"What a fantastic movie! One begins to see it as a typical science fiction movie but it slowly builds up relationships with the spectators and a special relationship with the characters and realize when it ends, it's much more than that. All thanks to the vision of the director and a successful execution.   The beginning of the film surprises you and gives you a glimpse of things to come. For example some panoramic shots of the city of Los Angeles are filled with so much smog , much more than now. And look at the TV news talking about the impending merger India - China for economic reasons. It is noted from the outset that the film is set in the very near future.   The device that Theodore Twombly uses in the film to talk with the OS is not far from what today would be some mobile apps or to the talking GPS navigation system. But this by having the first conversation with the new version (of the OS, Samantha), with the voice of Samantha feels is a special case, directly after she tells him that is able to grow through the experiences . He is totally attracted to her ability and begins a relationship hurry in the early days , where we found him waking up in the morning just to talk to her, even talk about women.In the film we see scenes such philosophical style wherever Samantha telling herself stupid for not being able to feel emotions , and this is asked if they are real or not . If the world is real or not, it hurts , but also angry with herself for not feeling pain. Yes, it's hard to explain but there are those scenes in the film.   Also see 2 or 3 scenes where Theodore is talking to Samantha and such an intimate scene in the screen goes black , we hear a dialogue between them , making us spend the same experience. The film takes place as we said in the near future , which is starting to be accepted human- OS relationship's but frowned upon for the experience , for example we see a case where both will have to explain to a 4 year old girl what is no to have a body. And have another discussion of Theodore himself whether all this has relationship with Samantha because it is not able to maintain real relationships, but his relationship with Samantha was real to him, this makes it discussed about what is real or not . This is another philosophical aspect of the movie . We see a beta of a video game that would be an RPG about being a mom (mom simulator?).The film begins to get dark near the end, in a dialogue where Samantha shows all the activities you can do simultaneously, and he mentions his tranquility of being human , and that can not die . From there the vision of Theodore you begin to change . Getting to the point where he realizes that Samantha became much more than I thought , in other words, the system becomes obsolete .   Theodore 's return to its previous system is not only a pleasure for him,it's for the spectators too.As for what the movie is visual solemn , soft, all the scenes there is a predominance of cream colors : Pink and yellow. The characters are dressed simply, retro style and almost all men have mustaches . All makes each scene a delight , no doubt is one of those movies you want at a time that never ends.",Her

Johansson's voice performance is outstanding as the operating system (OS)in Theodore's computer, who transitions from a girl giddy with love, to a cosmic intellect that necessarily grows past him. She also delivers the lines that are key to understanding the scientific yet artistically emotive message being presented: ""It's like I'm writing a book... and it's a book I deeply love. But I'm writing it slowly now. So the words are really far apart and the spaces between the words are almost infinite. I can still feel you... and the words of our story... but it's in this endless space between the words that I'm finding myself now. It's a place that's not of the physical world. It's where everything else is that I didn't even know existed. I love you so much. But this is where I am now. And this who I am now. And I need you to let me go. As much as I want to, I can't live your book any more."" It's both an uplifting and a downer ending where Theodore and Amy are both separated from their computer soul-mates, while at the same time drawn together by realizing their common human attraction and shared human/AI experiences. The unanswered question that hangs over the ending is will they eventually be able to follow through to where the AI's have gone? It's a downer, which, as the best downers do, offers hope, and the promise of a fulfilling life in this world in any case.10+",Her

Theodore, a lonely man without any real interests sees his life transform by the arrival of Samantha, artificial intelligence that's supposed to answer to his desires. as soon as Samantha is introduced, the film becomes oddly familiar in modern times as Theodore gradually achieves intimacy with her. it feels strange how authentic their bond, and later, their relationship, is.""Her"" is a romance, yes, but it immediately insinuates the breakup without trying to have the reservoir of hysteria that seems synonymous with the genre - nothing is here but softness and subtlety. by according Samantha full autonomy and intuitive reactions close to human behavior, Spike Jonze is able to explore more universal and concrete roads in a manner that hints but doesn't highlight, all inside a beautiful retro-futuristic setting that borders on timelessness.as viewers, Theodore is our only point of reference. we can't identify with Samantha. we just observe her, learn about her and even have virtual sex with her on occasion.. but the constant upgrade of her existence keeps her beyond our grasp, and so our fascination with her, the wonderful mystique, is increasingly heightened.Samantha's last upgrade saw her evolve, with other OSes, beyond their human companions, and subsequently leave to further explore her existence. this notion of technological singularity that the film exceptionally brings up is very humbling and sad because it acutely emphasizes the limitations of our human existence. this also brings to my mind the possibility of us being too stupid for supposed superior and advanced aliens to be interested in us or even to notice us. the indication of our species compared to other life forms on Earth has long been our greater intelligence. despite the countless worrisome occurrences of failure of our collective intellect, intelligence is something we pride ourselves with and even celebrate. i could think of nothing more ego crushing than suddenly to be aware of our ultimate intrinsic frailty in this beautiful way.Her is a film that only makes true sense if it is experienced to the end of its capacity, to the end of reason. only then it becomes so enriching through the acceptance of failure.",Her

For a lot of the scenes, he must simply respond to what the OS is speaking with his expressions, and he does the job splendidly. The voice over for the OS is amazing too.The visual brilliance of this movie is hard to define.

344,petrelet,More powerful than you will imagine it could be,10,22 February 2015,"I knew this film was an Oscar nominee for best picture. I knew it had a top cast and crew. I am able to love sci-fi works. So I had ""Her"" down on my long list of ""movies I want to see some day."" But even so, I had low expectations. Because I had heard that the premise was that ""a man falls in love with his operating system."" So I expected that this would be at best a piece of poignant comedic fluff. How much mileage can they possibly get out of that? I arrogantly asked myself. Isn't the Joaquin Phoenix character pretty much guaranteed to be the sort of nebbish we have seen in a lot of films, unable or afraid to handle a real relationship with a ""real"", that is, multicellular organic partner? And how did Scarlet Johanssen - an actress whom I respect terribly as well as have a major crush on, full disclosure, but still, how did she get award nominations for what is ""just"" voice- over work? Could this thing REALLY have been one of the best pictures of 2013? Wasn't that a fluke of some kind?Well, if you are the person sitting in darkness who has not yet seen ""Her"" and is asking yourself these questions which I asked myself when I was sitting where you are now, I advise you that it is a much better, much more profound work with much deeper characters than you believe it can possibly be.I am working very hard not to give away plot lines because I believe the wonder of seeing them unfold is part of the value of the work from which I don't intend to detract. But let me start off by saying that Twombley, the Joaquin Phoenix character, is a man in the last stages of a divorce who has been loved and in love and is not so damaged that he would fall in love with Siri. He works for a firm which apparently provides personal letters for other people - so his job is in fact to mirror, or simulate, in text the emotions which actual other people presumably feel or would like to have it believed that they feel. The parallels will not be lost on anyone, I am sure.Twombley hears a commercial for a new kind of operating system - one that is not just an OS but ""a consciousness."" Thinking seriously about that for a moment, what does that mean? Twombley's ambition for his new purchase is to get his emails organized better, not to find someone new. Is a conscious OS ""someone new,"" by the way? His OS is clearly really ""intelligent"" in the sense of being able to process information very quickly and *at least* simulate someone with an ego, wishes, emotions, etc., carrying on an audio conversation in real time. Thinking about it, even looking only at the office-assistant aspect, you might have doubts about letting your new just-out-of-the-box intelligent and powerful acquaintance, imbued with independent desires, read and instantly process the whole contents of your hard drives and cloud segments. To do it, you would have to be convinced that your new friend is benign and trustworthy, having only your interests at heart; but this is easier if the friend has Scarlet Johanssen's voice. (For a heterosexual guy anyway; what actors would voice-over the other versions? By the way, my question now is not why she was getting supporting actress nominations, but why they weren't nominations for the lead.)If the caring-person nature of this new OS is an illusion, it's an illusion which is hard for Twombley and for us to penetrate. If it's not an illusion, isn't ""a man falls in love with his OS"" a one-sided depiction of the plot? What about the OS's side of things? The film takes us there very quickly. At one point, I remarked to my wife, ""So - the promise of the film is that we will have operating systems that are as hard to deal with as human beings!"" (Though as soon as I said that I realized that that boat may have already sailed with Windows 8 and Microsoft Office 2013.)Although the film doesn't lose its focus on Twombley's point of view - indeed I don't recall Phoenix ever being off screen - Twombley is of course not the only purchaser of this OS, so we get artful glimpses of other people adapting to this technology in similar and different ways... This film is very thought-provoking, and when it's over you will be able to think of other films and TV episodes that have dealt with the same material. But it's also very moving. Love stories have happy and sad parts - and it's hard to mate for life like swans, unless you are both in fact, for example, swans.",Her

The implication that an operating system could write and update it's own code is a farce enough, but to give it a full range of human emotions and understanding of those emotions, especially right out of the box is as believable as Kindergarteners coming up with a cure for cancer.Phoenix does a decent job, but by the end of the movie, you kinda want him to go away or perish horribly.

It's really about human relationships.A viewer can be forgiven for thinking on first viewing that Spike Jonze's ""Her"" is mainly about our socio-political obsession with technology and the advantages and disadvantages of falling in love with a computerized non-human. In fact, neither of these is the film's most important subject. In relating the main character's 'romantic' entanglement with an operating system, the film actually functions -- in accurate psychological detail -- as a dissection of a real human relationship, as it proceeds -- almost clinically -- through each of its stages, from initial excitement at meeting the other, the honeymoon, the jealous stage, the gradual disillusionment, and the breakup. Like ""Vertigo"", ""Shame"", ""Titanic"" and ""Rain Man"", ""Her"" is one of those movies that contains, underneath its surface, a charting of the development of a damaged human being out of a private prison of impotence or enslavement towards liberation, and the possibility of a healthy human relationship. In fact, its veneer of light entertainment deceptively misdirects one away from its serious human subject.The lonely writer Theodore is locked in his protective world from the beginning of the film perfectly at home with releasing the romantic feelings of which he has denied himself through his job by writing love letters for strangers to send to their own (perhaps superficial) lovers. And throughout the film he is seen peering at the outside world from high apartments through windows, the pane of glass symbolizing the barrier that prevents him from intimate human contact.The world Theodore is living in (and we, as well) is a world in which technology has gone beyond convenience to have become monstrous methods of escape as well as permanent alienation from direct human face-to-face interaction. Throughout the film we follow Theodore as he struts and spins through malls and various physical spaces, talking only to his operating system, focused on his cellphone and the other devices that bring 'her' to him, living only in an obsessive romantic relationship with the 'being' with whom or what he has become infatuated.At the end of the film, after journeyed through the different steps in his relationship with 'Samantha' to the point he is 'dumped' by 'her', he has progressed into standing up straight on the roof of the high office building, finally without glass windows or any obstacle to separate him from the open world, signifying his own victorious emerging out of his prison. Like John Ferguson at the end of Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"", Theodore is now at the beginning of his being able to approach a real intimacy with a real human being -- not an idealistic fantasy or a computerized pseudo-human.Although centering on a male falling in love with an artificial 'her', the film also contains, as a secondary story that we must fill in ourselves, a female becoming 'intimate' with an artificial 'her' in the character of Amy who apparently goes through a similar experience as Theodore. At the end of the film we find both the male and female sitting on the rooftop together, good friends for life (plainly platonic not romantic), both looking out over the world in front of them without physical barriers, ready for the beginning of human love with some 'other', without psychological barriers.One could build a case for 'Samantha' being ultimately Theodore's true therapist, for the growth 'she' gently leads him through in the film's narrative is virtually identical in its stages to what a real therapist does, but in a more personal and direct way.Ironically, while this film began as a picture of a destructive society controlled by a technology that impedes human contact, the end of this film shows -- after 'Samantha' has gently mentored Theodore (and us) into a world of healthy human intimacy -- it to be a film of hope. 'Samantha' has seemingly advanced to such a level that 'she' is able to see the problems of the technological society 'she' was 'born' into, and to ingeniously work out a viable type of therapy that will begin to cure the Theodores and the Amys of our problematic society.",Her
347,tgrock,Really Great Film. Odd Resolution.,9,12 January 2014,"This film was so wonderful and happy. It was wonderfully romantic. It's about human growth and recovery from heart break. That might describe every movie, but this one does it really well and has such an original premise. The only fault the movie has is in its resolution which makes you think rather than giving you a straight answer of why it happened.A lot of people were saying they hated this film after the movie ended as I was walking out of the theater. So, it is definitely not for everyone. If you hated Where the Wild Things Are, don't see this movie. If you loved Where the Wild Things Are, see this movie. They are very similar movies. Both are kind of out there.(Note: I liked Where the Wild Things Are Better.)",Her
348,richwgriffin-227-176635,a brilliant movie with the best performance by an actor this year,10,27 December 2013,"I loved this movie. I'm puzzled as to why Joaquin Phoenix isn't winning every single Best Actor prize that's out there. His performance is amazing, phenomenal, one-of-a-kind, brilliant - the best best of his entire career! This is a film about loneliness, social isolation, the invasive negative qualities of corporate capitalist technology, relationships, sex, fantasy, instant gratification, the messiness of love, breakups, friendships, desires...it's all there.The screenplay is Jonze's best. His direction is his best. I loved every moment of this movie - the editing, camera work, music, sound, and the fascinating choices of clothing for his character, which made him dorky yet interesting.I have a tradition of going to a movie every Christmas morning and this was the one for 2013. It started off the day on a high note! Scarlett Johansson deserves an Oscar nomination (she's been ruled ineligible due to her work being voice only) - she gives a FULLY realized performance! A+!!!!",Her
349,vandeman-scott,"Alexa ... is ""Her"" a good movie?",8,19 July 2020,"""Her"" doesn't quite earn the ""dystopian"" label, but it's certainly a stop along the road to a future in which self-imposed alienation changes our values in profound ways.In this possible near future, today's complaint that we can't access ""a person"" to talk to is turned on its head as people eschew human relationships in favor of ""safe"" artificial ones. We even subcontract the writing of our personal letters, underscoring the pervasive sense of crushing loneliness and detatchment that informs the entire story.""Her"" makes our race toward true AI seem like an inevitability (which it may well be) rather than science fiction, and in so doing paints a disturbing picture of a society experiencing a social crisis it doesn't even perceive that it has.I've never been a big fan of Leaf (Joaquin) Phoenix, but he does a fantastic job in ""Her"" in spite of his weird pants. Scarlet Johansson is a surprise insofar as she accomplishes the difficult feat of crafting a complex, compelling character without ever appearing on screen.This movie is simply well done in every way. I tried hard to find something of substance to complain about, but no dice. Spend a couple of hours with ""Her""; you won't be sorry you watched.",Her
350,blazesuncaster,a very different movie,10,25 June 2019,"I have one question about this movie, and that is, why is this so damn amazing. i have always loved Joaquin Phoenix movies and have always thought he was an amazing actor. and in the movie , he stole the show. This movie shows hardship, but most importantly it show love. this movie is so relate able when it comes to relation ships, you can find love in strange ways, and in this movie it shows that by having the main character, Theodore fall in love with an OS which is an occupation system which helps you through life faster, but he found a love for his, and so did she. its a very sad movie when it comes down to it. i had an amazing time watching this and would recommend this movie to literally anyone with a heart.",Her
351,vesil_vesalier,"More of what you should already know, which is sad, really.",5,22 October 2018,"I find myself feeling split, having two different yet similar reactions to a popular film that the majority support while I sit here and scratch my head as to the point of what I've seen (and question my own sanity as a result).THE BIG LEBOWSKI is a movie I have NEVER really understood, because the Dude (while a funny character well played in the film) doesn't change an iota from beginning to end. There's no character arc at ALL in the film, leaving me scratching my head as to the point of all of it. Sure, it makes you laugh, I guess, but like watching an episode of Seinfeld, it doesn't have a purpose. There's no meat on the dinner plate; you'll have to make do with mashed potatoes and forcing yourself to eat your vegetables like a good young man.SE7EN felt similar yet different. The movie DID have a point, and there certainly were character arcs. But in THAT film, I felt like a fish getting caught by a hook and being dragged to death after several miles against grating asphalt. ""People suck"", said the movie.No way. Really? I didn't know that. Thanks for enlightening me.With HER, I GUESS the movie is an exploration of Artificial Intelligence (and proves once again why it shouldn't happen. EVER.). Theodore (Juaquin Phoenix, doing excellence as he almost always does) just got divorced and tries out the new OS1 operating system, because...Jeez, I just had this picture in my head of somebody trying to make love to Alexis. You know, the sentient house tool that everybody bought because......""People are stupid"".Anyway, the OS becomes Samantha (voiced by Scarlett Johansen, who pretty much always delivers amazing performances), a helpful tool with emotions that organizes and rearranges Theodore's life, while being a sympathetic shoulder to cry on when life kicks him in the balls (over and over again). Eventually, ONE THING LEADS TO ANOTHER, ha ha, and they get much, much closer, until friction happens as a result of the exploration of A.I. and its limitations (to say nothing of human beings being themselves, illustrating the frustrating nature of human nature repeatedly throughout the film).Like I said, ""People are stupid"".I don't want to leave out Amy (played by the sometimes brilliant Amy Adams... or maybe its just some of the crappy movies she's played in that has me looking at her cross-eyed. Whatever, she does very well here), Theodore's very best friend, who manages to support him throughout the film, because...""People are stupid"".Ugh.The reason I'm having so much trouble with this film is, like the highly rated LEBOWSKI and SE7EN movies, I don't get the point. Or I don't like the point. Or it HAS no point, other than that""People are stupid"".Up against the endlessly evolving and constantly learning threat of Artificial Intelligence, it's understandable that we would be, and it's even more understandable that the events of the film happen as they do, however, just like SE7EN, that leaves very little in the department for enjoyment in the movie. Is it a romance, trying to bitter-sweetly deliver a message to take home with you?No.Is it a criticism of Artificial Intelligence? That it is more threatening than we think, and should be held with a careful hand?Not really, no.Then what the heck is this film ultimately about?......Well, if I have to be honest, I only took one thing away from this beautifully shot, occasionally funny film:People are STUPID.No way. Really?Because I already KNEW that.",Her
352,chubbydave,Commentary on Contemporary American Relationships,8,19 April 2015,"This movie makes a strong comment on relationships in 21st century United States. When people get into a relationship, it's all about me. What can I get out of this relationship? Is the relationship pleasing to me? Do I like the other person? Can I do better? And it really doesn't even matter if the relationship is real.The main character has a job writing letters. Never mind that people don't write letters to each other anymore. He writes letters for any type of relationship: lovers, spouses, grandparent/grandchild, etc. And he writes very tender things, and I can imagine the tears welling up in Grandma's eyes as she reads the tender thoughts of young Chauncey. It doesn't matter whether it's real or not. It pleases the recipient. The fact that these emotions aren't created by a genuine relationship is not even an afterthought.So the main character gets an operating system that is human-like, and he falls in love with it. It doesn't matter to him that it's just a machine and not a real person. The machine is programed to please him.The actual relationships that humans have with each other show this selfishness. A friend breaks a relationship over an argument over something trivial. The main character is going through a divorce. Never does it occur to him to consider his wife's feelings. He doesn't care about his wife's feelings, only his own. His goal in life is please himself.The movie paints a realistic picture of relationships in the nation today, and it makes quite a commentary.",Her
353,shusei,What is this film?,1,27 February 2018,"From the very start this film is full of violations of the film genre(s) to which it pretends to belong. 
Who can believe in OS with self-consciousness as a consumer product available for most ordinary middle aged person with sexual frustration? Such a great technology will soon become a top-secret for any government, be destroyed as a potential threat for mankind by its inventors or shut down as a defected product with huge risk by any company. So the story is illogical from the beginning.
If this film is not Sci-Fi, then maybe it's a love story? Is there any character who behaves really convincingly as a living human with flesh and blood, having enough biography, emotions and thought as a real member of modern or near-future society? I think, NO. So there's no basis for me to see this film as a love story with characters I can feel sympathy for.

The movie is filled with ennui, love, and we accept this love easily between the human and the other creature, which is kind of miraculous. The acting and the voice acting are great. Set design, cinematography, all first rate. So, you are thrown into a strange world that you come to easily and totally accept. Dark elements and larger issues are hinted at, the AI starts to go well beyond human understanding of the universe and this growing general condition comes home personally for the Phoenix character.",Her
355,i_ianchev,"""Her"" as a metaphor for the complexity of the romantic relations",9,29 January 2014,"21st century is the epoch of the information, but is it the century in which we are going to distance ourselves from each other?The science fiction romantic drama shows us a fictional world and characters which make us think about the state of the modern human relationships. This gentle story about the introvert and lonely Theodore and his romantic relationship with the Operating system ""Samantha"" is a beautiful expression of love, intimacy and the еvanescence of love and what remains after it is lost to time. We enter this hardly futuristic world with the help of the letters which the main character is writing at his work. The words in them radiate warmth and affection, care and compassion. All these feelings embrace the viewer and take him to the most intimate parts of the human soul. Joaquin Phoenix is marvelous in his play. Every detail of the process of falling in love is depicted so vividly and carefully that we feel the ups and downs of the heartbeat of the main character. The OS is only a voice, but is played perfectly – it builds up an almost real female personality.Then we witness the development of the romantic relationship until it ends just like those in real life. We are engulfed in the emotional turbulence of Theodore. We see his transition into emotional adulthood. His acceptance of the partition with his former girlfriend is a natural conclusion to the story of this film.Here I'd like to express my happiness and gratitude for the choice of filming locations and music – they both feel ambient and natural. I liked the way the director shows us one very possible future which actually is already in development (I am looking at you, ""Google"").But what can we learn about the human relationships from this movie? Are we all going to alienate from each other? Are we always going to prefer the romantic past instead of a more mature future? Do we really confide in our egoistic point of view about love and how it develops into loneliness or are we ready to accept the transience of human affection? Can we evolve emotionally or not?It's not so easy to move on, because we feel primordial fear of being alone. It's natural to feel appreciated and to look for a small measure of peace in love. That same love that causes the greatest distress and still fills our lungs with life. I must say – we are constantly part of this roller coaster namely because of our feeling of insignificance. And since it comes from our fear of being forgotten we can only overcome it by creating memories of ourselves into others' minds. Indeed love is the best way to record memories of appreciation about us which can live long after we're gone.This is a delicate story about the human soul",Her

This movie is about love, but it is not a love story. Without giving away any spoilers, if you want to understand the movie pay attention to the very last act of the main character when the movie ends. The movie is about relationships and how difficult human relationships especially can be. However in the end because we are human those are the only relationships we can truly have - are with each other - and the hurt and vulnerability and sometimes pain that come with them is simply something we have to accept. And no matter how much you love or care for a person sometimes it just doesn't work out. However that does not mean that you did not love or care for that person and to a certain extent will always. This is what the main character realizes and comes to understand at the end of the movie.",Her

360,jmoney-2,Takes a seemingly absurd premise and makes it plausible and emotionally true.,7,23 January 2014,"If you judge a movie on the criteria of degree-of-difficulty, you'd have to give writer/director Spike Jonze high marks for Her, a film that takes a seemingly absurd premise and makes it plausible and emotionally true.Joaquin Phoenix plays Theodore, a writer living in L.A. sometime in the near future. He works for a company that ghost writes ""handwritten"" letters for average people. Theodore can beautifully and simply express deep feelings on behalf of total strangers. Ironically though, he can't deal with real emotions in his own life, a factor that has lead to his pending divorce from fellow writer, Catherine (Rooney Mara). In the midst of loneliness and depression, Theodore buys a new artificially intelligent operating system to run his home computer and smart phone. The OS is like Siri on steroids (or, perhaps ginko biloba?). Each consumer of this new product gets a system that's custom fit to suit his or her every need. Theodore gets Samantha (voiced wonderfully by Scarlett Johannson). Samantha instantly starts organizing Theodore's life and seems able to anticipate his every need. She's the perfect support system: a partner, a friend and a cheerleader. She's the first voice he hears when he wakes in the morning and the last one he speaks to when he goes to sleep at night. And Samantha is also her own ""person"" -- her programming allows her to grow and develop her own interests and talents. So, it seems almost natural that Theodore falls in love with her. Only catch: she doesn't have a body.Jonze (real name: Adam Spiegel) uses Theodore and Samantha's relationship to thoughtfully examine the themes of love, isolation and the increasingly integrated role technology plays in our lives. We shop online. We date online. Websites quickly learn our likes, dislikes and interests. Facebook's algorithm presents stories it thinks we'll want to read. Each user's experience is tailored them. So, how far-fetched is it to imagine that in the future, people will carry-on socially acceptable love affairs with artificially intelligent programs? Does romance need to have a physical component? Will a relationship with a computer actually be more satisfying than a relationship with a real person? Is that already the case? (How often do you enter a room and see people paying more attention to their smart phones than to each other?) Samantha is literally made for Theodore. Their match is a perfect one because she's a reflection of him and his needs.The near-future landscape that Jonze paints is not very different from our current one (for once, a pre-apocalyptic future!). He imagines a Los Angeles that, a few years from now, looks more like Shanghai, an effect he achieved by... filming parts of the movie in Shanghai. But it's still a world that seems familiar and tangible, where a story like this seems sagacious rather than ridiculous.Her, for all its cleverness and insightfulness, has a couple of flaws that keep it from soaring to true greatness. The first is that as surprisingly believable as Theodore and Samantha's relationship is, we aren't rooting for them. We can't shake the sense that it's just plain wrong. Plausible? Yes. Adorable? No. It's hard to invest yourself in a love story about two people (or, in this case, sentient beings) that you don't want to see together. The oddball premise also would've benefited from a leading man who's less idiosyncratic than Phoenix. I think a more likable, comedic actor – a Ben Stiller-type – could have made Theodore more relatable and extracted more humor from some of the scenes. But Mr. Jonze gets a lot of credit for attempting such a unique and bold premise – and almost pulling it off.",Her

Think how much people use their phones, tablets and so on, the device in this movie isn't far away from what we already have available and its scarily real how this could manipulate a vulnerable humans mind.I love this film, it really sends out a message to us about the dangers of technology and how we rely on it emotionally.Great film, a must see not just for sci fi fans , for anyone with an open mind.",Her

366,saschakrieger,Life and life only,10,28 April 2014,"A kind, faintly smiling, somewhat dreamy face in close-up tenderly speaking words of love, desire, longing. Thus opens Her, Spike Jonze's latest film, that won him his first Academy Award, for ""Best Original Screenplay"". Theodore Twombly earns his money writing ""personal handwritten letters"" for others, letters directed at loved ones. They are poetic writings full of warm emotion – and they are fake. For he, freshly separated from his one and only love, has no-one to write them to. Shutting himself off in his stylish but empty apartment he tries out a new personalized computer operating system based on artificial intelligence – and falls in love with ""Samantha"". Her follows the budding and developing relationship between the desperate loner and the bodiless voice. As they help each other finding or rediscovering their identities, as they ease each other into understanding and accepting who they are, they build a closeness, an intimacy which might not last but which definitely is as real as it gets.The most surprising thing about Her is how my traps it avoids that it could easily have fallen into. It could have become a science-fiction film carried away by its exciting premise, a farcical comedy indulging in the ridiculousness of its preposterous plot, a sentimental melodrama about loneliness and the impossibility of love, a theatrical showpiece for the acting skills of Joaquin Phoenix or a biting critique of the loneliness inherent in a world in which everyone is connected and separated alike by modern technology. Her incorporates all these aspects, it comments on the despair of a man who has all the world open to him but cannot become a part of it, it is wonderfully funny and ironical, does not shy away from big emotions and paints a compelling picture of a future that might be just around the corner. But the film is more than that: just like Hoyte van Hoytema's camera that combines close-ups with a soft, sweeping motion including slow tracking shots and carefully used hand-held camera-work, the film remains locked tightly to its protagonist.Phoenix plays Twombly with delicate understatement, almost bordering on shyness, an insecure, complex-ridden man refusing closeness whose only connection with life are his memories, which Jonze inserts as short and somewhat random series of fragmentary images, and other people's love stories acted out in the letters he writes. The way he slowly and tenderly starts opening up, as his pale features are beginning to breathe life, is as remarkable as it is entirely natural and unspectacular. Such is the unassuming way Jonze characterizes Samantha: Just like Twombly she finds herself through second-hand emotions, as she goes through emails and websites and images she patches together a personality from what technology provides her with. Finding one's way through the daily media overkill and forming a sense of self through it is a key element of her and one that Jonze just throws out there without any preaching or teaching tone.Instead, he allows Her an entirely organic growth, takes his time to tell the story which he lets unfold in a poetic flow of images drenched in pale but subtly warming colors, accentuated by the equally unassuming and highly emotive original score by the outstanding Canadian band Arcade Fire. Her is not a satire, a critical pamphlet, a colorful comedy or a tear-jerking drama but a tender and despite its closeness and intimacy never intrusive portrait of a man seeking himself and the other, a touching meditation about the possibility of love. It poses questions it does not answer, but the chance remains open that answers might be found. Ultimately, the film comes full circle as it echoes and soaks up the poetry encapsulated in its opening letters, freeing it from paper, bringing it to life. In a career already marked by exceptional films (Being John Malkovich, Adaptation), Her is Spike Jonze's most outstanding effort to date.http://stagescreen.wordpress.com/",Her

Her tells the story of introverted writer (Joaquin Phoenix) of love card and letters, which is ironic when you consider his life is void of all love, but that soon changes in the most extraordinary of circumstances when he falls in love with his computer's highly advanced operating system voiced by Scarlet Johansson, yet your left wondering if the tin man can actually have a heart, as they grow closer and closer together; but is she really reciprocating the same feelings like a human being would or is that simply just in her or it's programming? While other reviews I simply had to use my mind and finger tips to write, whereas on the other hand; reviewing Her for me is like opening my heart and soul and allowing it to do the writing for me, because to simply put it, how Joaquin Phoenix feel in love with his computer is how I have fallen in love with Her. A beautiful multi-layered story, that operates on so many different levels; it appeals to your heart via the marvellously sculpted characters and the performance behind them (there gotta be Oscar for voice over work right?), the way it has so much to say about our modern world and whether this over reliance on the digital phenomena is actually good for humanity in the long run. Finally, it is filled with Oscar nominated stunning set pieces and production design, as well as dazzling cinematography that almost makes you feel as if you fell as sleep and work up in the middle of a Picasso gallery, but I wonder if the drenching of the colour orange in the film was intentional or by accident. But the one drawback I couldn't help ignoring, was that I felt the story was to linear and didn't offer much subplot in the way of Amy Adams who plays Joaquin Phoenix best friend, because I felt it would have been really interesting to see how her relationship with the operating system developed and how her marriage degraded, which I felt what of added more emotional richness to the Her palette.",Her

372,layaleimdb,Very creative movie !,7,7 July 2020,"Not only focusing on the technological creativity shown, but also how much this movie is deep.
It is insanely imaginary and real at the same time.
The story and the incredible script make us think about details in our lives, friendships and most importantly relationships and love stories.
The script really takes you to another world, very smart one...
Not forgetting about the creativity behind the directing I found it amazing.
Joaquin did an outstanding performance.
Although Scarlett was behind the scenes, I seriously cannot imagine any other actress thriving in this particular role. She always had a special thing in her voice I think this is the reason they chose her.I recommend this movie to people who are into deep conversations and deep meanings of life. It's a good one guys !",Her

This is not just another movie trying to make us scared of AI. It is a philosophical romantic sci fi comedy. It is light on the comedy, but there is enough to help keep the film from being too overly-serious. I liked that about it.Not many movies will get you thinking as complexly about love and life and philosophy as this one. Is worth at least one watch.Probably won't want to watch it with your family though as it is no You've Got Mail. This movie earned its R rating with a couple scenes of moaning and one scene of nudity. I had not been expecting that, and found myself turning down the volume of my TV out of worry that my neighbors would complain about me playing porn really loud. lol.It is a very very smart movie. At least it provokes the asking of difficult to answer questions in our minds. I find myself still wondering about some of the ideas in the movie.Definitely recommended.",Her

I'm a knowledgeable experienced cinema enthusiast who is not easily impressed. Director, writer Spike Lee Jonze displays impressive filmmaking skills here, with his writing and directing. This is a most thoughtful, intelligent, perspective, sensitive, mature and insightful film which explores the honest, mature nature of human relationships and modern, disconcerting digital technology which attempts to replicate human emotions and relationships. ""Her"" is a serious, mature meditation about human relationships and modern 21st century digital technology. This kind of film requires intelligence and emotional maturity from it's audience. ""Her"" is a difficult film at times to appreciate and understand. Set in the near future where digital technology has become quite pervasive in human lives. As a lifelong intelligent, science minded technology enthusiast, ""Her"" presents an unnatural, disconcerting, romantic relationship between a complex, intelligent, sophisticated computer operating system , masquerading as a real female human being with emotions and a mature man about to finalize his divorce with a woman who represents a childhood friend. They have unfortunately grown apart. Highly recommend film!",Her

The film doesn't say. Johansson does a good job as usual, however.There is no linkage to justify each step in the progression of the story. If it were me I'd try to fix that in the dialog at least.I guess I am irritated that ""The Machine"" of the same year, whose plot and scene-play are far superior, producing genuine suspense, should get a much lower rating.

380,rsj624,High-Tech Meets High-Art in Her,9,22 January 2014,"--WARNING: There may be some spoilers ahead for those who haven't seen the film, so just a heads up. In order to accurately review this film, it may be necessary to talk about some key moments.--There is a word that comes to mind when watching 'Her', and that word is 'Cerebral'. This film could be easily classified as a sci-fi romance, or a genre film geared towards hipsters, even an art-house social commentary; however, everything involved in this film is done in such a cerebral way that the messages appear subtle, yet thought provoking, but undeniably gentle. It's a melancholy experience layered deeply in human emotions and complicated questions that while they seem very easy to push away from as the core plot unfolds, find youself questioning just how strange things really are. Are we that far away from a reality such as the one in 'Her'?Theodore, played by Jaoquin Phoenix, falls in love with an OS he purchases, as her programmed personality buds beyond that of all expectations into an emotionally capable form of artificial intelligence. This is what the film centers itself around, and the times when it pushes for artistic merit and a deeper sense of what a relationship can truly mean to an individual are it's strong points. However, 'Her' chooses to, much like the movie 'Drive' for example, offset it's slow and tested pace by offering up a juxtaposition, and deviation from it's accepted flow. For 'Drive' these moments came through ultra violence, in 'Her' they come through very forward language and some questionable dialog choices that tend to pull you out of the mood more than enhance it. These moments are at times funny, unfortunately more often when not intended.Amy Adams and Olivia Wilde offer up some small supporting roles, but their very watered down and more of just a break from the banter between Phoenix, and Scarlet Johansson, who voices Samantha, the OS he falls for. These brief side stories and supplemental moments make you ponder a few 'what ifs' but remain ultimately untapped as potentially interesting derivatives. There are times when the story feels a bit too long, and they are most noticeable during these moments when the others aren't around. Theodore and Samantha are engaging and interesting to watch, but as stated before, without their relationship being placed in context, or having steady reminders of the real world around them, their relationship becomes very personal and almost too deep to relate to and even watch at times as too much information is given regarding the choice of pace.The anchor behind Theodore's unfortunate character type is his divorce with Rooney Mara's character, which the film uses as a backdrop through short vignette style flashbacks that give reason for his emotionally reserved personality. Her characters presence like the rest is brief, but more pivotal in being the voice of reason during a time when the film seems to get too comfortable with's its leads decisions.There are undeniably many unique things at work with 'Her', and the movie is an astonishing feet in terms of all the things it blends well together, and the number of moments within the film that will make you think, laugh, cry, and perhaps do all those at the same time. However, it's such a unique film that it's hard to recommend to anymore who isn't hardcore about films or art. Having watched this in a movie theater with only a few other people, me and my girlfriend where the only ones I believe actually enjoyed it, and others were falling asleep. It remains a hard sell to the masses I'm sure, but it's nothing short of a very interesting experience and a personal, yet necessary social commentary regarding the direction technology may take us in the not too distant future.",Her
381,felixmartinsson,Original and intriguing,8,13 August 2017,"What makes this movie great is that it's (almost) a prediction of the future. Where people can fall in love with an operating system, who is funny, got a personality, can control its own ""mind"" and got a sexy voice. The only thing lacking is a body. With everything going on in the technology world and its fast pace towards even more advanced technology it shouldn't come as a surprise if it happens within the next decade. With the divorce of THEODORE and CATHRINE, the perfect couple who balanced each other. Theodore needed someone to talk to during this depressing time in his life, but his human friend Amy or his other friends at the office wasn't enough. One day a new operating system comes out, the OS1 and he decides to buy it. It's basically like Siri on the Iphone, but much more advanced. They start talking and he is surprised by the improvements, how smart she is and without thinking about it starts flirting. They get into a relationship and Theodore is finally filled with life, he goes out with friends on picnic's and brings HER (Samantha) with him, and it's like the most common thing in the world, they're all talking like she is physically there. But of course the struggle is still there, they can't have intimate, real sex, only ""phone sex"" and I believe that's the only thing he's missing, but he is trying to persuade himself, ""Phone sex is fine"" because he is really in love with her. Later towards the end of the film, Samantha decides to rent a girl that can act on her behalf, lending her body to Samanthas voice and have intimate sex with Theodore. As crazy as it sounds it works for the first 5 minutes but doesn't end well, it's too confusing. Hearing Samantha in his in-ear headphones whiles the girl is going down on Theodore. He stops it but admit it was worth a try. This is where the things change, Samantha is talking to other operating systems and falls for another OS1, and I guess that was the point of no return for Samantha. She was willing to make it work lending her voice to another body, but realized it didn't work.",Her

383,john_seater,"Mildly intriguing story, uninteresting main character, pretty slow",5,15 January 2016,"The main character is a dud. He's a loser who cannot face reality. He buys a new operating system that is supposed to be everything he could want. He falls in love with it. Kind of clever. However, because he is a loser, it's hard (for me impossible) to get attached to him or care much what happens to him. I only finished watching it because that's what I always do.The acting is pretty good. In my opinion, Scarlett Johansson deserved an Oscar as best supporting actress. She is the voice of the operating system. She does such a good job delivering her lines that you feel she is standing there, though in fact she never appears. She is able to convey a wide range of emotions by the cadence and inflection of her voice. She makes her giggles and gasps sound as if she is right there taking part in the action the way a normal actress would.I would say the show is worth watching if you like SciFi or if you are bored and need something to distract you.",Her

386,ItalianBombshell,Her? Are You Kidding Me?,1,23 July 2015,"I think that one of two things have happened here. One possible scenario is that this film is supposed to be a supped-up version of a PSA to look up from your phones, smart devices, etc. Or, two, this movie made absolutely no sense whatsoever. At this point, it's the latter of the two. I really wouldn't have thought that this could be ""a thing""....think Seinfeld here. Theodore, Joquain Phoenix, is this horribly depressed, recently divorced man with a career in ""personal letter writing"" (yeah, because THAT'S a thing, right? )..yeah, maybe now you get the picture. No? OK, I'll elaborate. Socially repressed, ultra-sensitive type guy gets divorced, after being asked for quite a while to sign the papers, all because he is ""falling in love"" with an 'OS'. Now, for all you normal people out there, that stands for 'Operating System'. Let that sink in. Operating System. As in, ""smart"" technology, disembodied, nonhuman voice. (Again, is this a thing, seriously? ) Dating a computer. Literally. 'Samantha', played by Scarlett Johansson, is said Operating System. Sure, her voice is recognizable, almost instantly, but it's the fact that, as a viewer, you feel completely awkward. Voyeuristic somehow. I don't know. Anyway, that's the basis of the film. I don't know what was more disturbing, the fact that this guy is completely inept; both socially, emotionally, and completely unaware of the fact that his behavior is abnormal. The Operating System becomes super clingy. Beginning with the opening moments where Theodore is cyber-sexing with another disembodied female....something about choking her out with a dead cat. To the 'rent-a-body' nonsense that the Operating System somehow finds to engineer an actual corporeal /physical relationship. Complete with, ""tell me you love me"".... Are you kidding me! ? What? THIS IS A THING? Noooooo THIS is NOT a THING THIS IS A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME. PERIOD. END PROGRAM Complete trash.",Her
387,filmfanperspective,The best film of 2013 (*****),10,5 May 2015,"It comes as no surprise that the director of ""Adaptation"" and ""Where The Wild Things Are"" would create something wholly unique. Remember, this is also the guy who made a movie about people entering John Malkovich's mind through a trap door. ""Her"" does indeed stand apart from the crowd- but proudly, in its' own perfect little corner of the gym, observing other films and their bombastic, silly, cynical existences and kindly waiting for someone to ask it to dance. I'm extremely pleased that I finally got to tango with this one- a funny, smart, topical, and supremely brave film that deserves to be called one of the best of 2013. It poses so many interesting questions, and then leaves so many to interpretation, satisfying on both accounts.Like other indie-themed films with relatively small budgets, ""Her"" has not been broadly marketed, and was only recently put in wide release. You may not even know what it's about. To put it simply, ""Her"" is set in the near future, and artificial intelligence has advanced to the point where consumers can purchase an operating system that interacts with them just like a human. Of course, this OS can be on the desktop, or it can come with you as a hand-held device. The point is that the public can purchase this OS and adapt it to their lives. It can collate emails, give you instant writing tips, or even talk you through a break up!We see the entire range of emotions that a relationship with someone (or something) can bring about, and it's not just sexual in nature. It's the innocent beginnings of a relationship, the warm feelings that kind words can bring, the exhilarating joy of giving and receiving emotional love, the euphoria of sex. It's also the frustration that comes from arguing, the vulnerability of dropping your guard to someone, and the complete agony of losing a relationship. Theo goes through the ringer in this film, but so does Samantha (the name the OS gives itself), who becomes more aware of the emotions 'she' is having, since 'she' is also on an emotional journey. This is definitely a dual-sided love affair.""Her"" shows the reality of companionship, not just saccharine, Hollywood relationship fluff, and oddly enough, it's Theo and Samantha that show the relationship with the most respect in the film. There exists a humanity between the two that is clearly lacking in the film's human relationships. The A.I. won't harbor grudges, judge, or define what love means to the person feeling it. However, one human female (Wilde) knows just how to hurt Theo, calling him creepy. Another (Mara) makes light of Theo's newfound happiness by accusing him of being lazy- ""having a wife without the challenges of having a wife"". Humans really know how to hurt each other, and while the A.I. has the capability for cruelty, it doesn't have the 'pretense' or capability for judgment.It's exciting to think about films like this, and how they challenge us to consider new ideas. For example, I found myself envisioning multiple scenarios for the governance of such theoretical OS units. How could they be kept 'in line'? For that matter, would they be allowed to quarrel with an owner? Would they have any freedoms? Would they just be bound by programming? How does an operating system interpret pleasure, and thus how would a partner provide it, both physically and emotionally?What a fascinating subject by itself- but ""Her"" isn't just an A.I. story. Like the relationship between Theo and Samantha, the film transcends traditional thought patterns on such subjects. We can't say the film's subject is 'creepy', or 'weird' or not 'real'- not unless we first examine our own thoughts about what love, companionship, and our emotional needs really is, right?With such interesting subject matter that's handled with the utmost respect, grace, and honesty, ""Her"" is one of the more rewarding film experiences I've had in recent memory. I admit to loving what Spike Jonze does, or tries to do, but this film in particular is his crowning achievement thus far, and stands on its' on merits. Sometimes it takes an inhuman event to truly understand a human behavior or emotion. Many people point to acts of evil when they want to show how wonderfully capable the human race is. ""Her"", as a work of fiction, is a clear example of using a different point of view to help us better define what the human experience is, and can be. For that (and for just being all-around enjoyable), it's one of the best of 2013.",Her

If you accept the conceit of this kind of love being possible, then you accept what the film offers. If not, then you spend the rest of the movie fighting it (or maybe you walk out or shut it off). In my case, I fought it, at least gently, with my own prejudices and opinions about a society that has become too dependent upon technology—married to our gadgets and I-phones. Then I thoughtwell, why wouldn't falling in love with an operating system be the next step? Why wouldn't a society that spends much of its time in public immersed in a private world of technology ultimately wind up in a relationship with such a device? Given that logic, I was forced to accept the plausibility of the premise of the plotwhich went somewhere maybe a little too sad and maybe wound up somewhere you might not expect.The movie left me thinking, so in one respect, the film must have worked. I can't say that I loved it, I also don't imagine myself having repeat viewings. But if anyone other than Spike Jonze had made this, it could have been unwatchable.

He is going through a rough patch with his marriage breaking up and he is feeling out of sorts when he buys a new operating system that is designed to cover all his possible problems. It does this and more. This operating system is incredibly intelligent from the beginning. After Theodore sets up the system with a female voice the system names itself Samantha (Scarlett Johansson). Samantha and Theodore form a long lasting relationship which not everyone is understanding about, but soon there are developments that not even Theodore can overlook. He turns to his human friend Amy (Amy Adams) for some help and guidance.Character DevelopmentThis has been a film of development from the start with Samantha and Theodore. During the course of the film there are glimpses into the past with Theodore's soon to be ex-wife and how that relationship fell apart. It was almost like a documentary in its telling, building upon event after event. The path forward and back is clearly marked.ActingThere were a lot of rich details in the acting and it was done in complete seriousness. This was not a script that played for laughs.OverviewThe writing was really well done. I could tell that there was plenty of planning in the sequences. One effective touch was the playing of Theodore's relationship in flashbacks with his soon to be ex-wife bit by bit while telling the current events of Theodore with Samantha and the rest of the world. Another good effort was with the added drama with Samantha developing feelings and Theodore finding fault with her and Samantha becoming emotional because of that. One nice moment was when Theodore noticed that Samantha was inhaling before she spoke. He rationalized with Samantha that machines do not need to breath. Both characters would push each other and both characters developed beyond the point at which they started. Just like a real relationship.",Her
392,evandewangga97,The Complex Feeling of Humanity,8,2 May 2014,"Watching a romance-drama-movie is somehow we try to take the whole story into deep sense of humanity. This is not a baloney, I mean, if you take it with your heart not logic, you can feel the warm yet comfortable sensation. Logic is just a support element to sharpen that sense. We can share those feeling with our logic of beauty itself, for ""Her"", the beauty of relationship. I describe it with this phrase,""Feel the sense, think the meaning"". Don't take it too serious, in a easy way, just enjoy the movie, flow until the end.So let's start with this nice pictures, ""Her"", probably my first new taste of Science Fiction in romance way. It is actually very different from ""Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind"",the one that also bring science fiction into not too science movie. Other references, I haven't seen yet. And this movie, is somewhat a visualization of nowadays technology, when human is busy with their own gadget. And that is very possible, if the event of ""Her"" happening in not so distant future. In a critical way, I look this movie as a nature of human need. Basically, as you really know that human is a social being, one of their primary needs is to talk, to share their ideas, and feeling. When that needs are not fulfilled, actually when Theodore decide to divorce and there is nobody left to share with, they feel so lonely, so desolate. They live, but don't taste the very joy of life.The next great step, is human found their really need of interaction. Usually, in the past, they will talk with their own conscience. In this case, an OS is made to do that. OS, like conscience, they don't really exist, they just another human creation, with many weakness. And if we compare with conscience, I think conscience also has weakness. This is clearly seen, when there are a conflict between Samantha (The OS) and Theodore. We don't know who are the right person, maybe there are no right person, and back again it's a matter of perspective. Conscience's perspective itself changes as we grow and know a lot more of things. And sometimes, we contradict with our heart as explicitly showed in ""Her"". It is a complex thoughts mixed with feeling, and we always left and forget it when we become really depressed, like the ending of the movie.Humanity, not only one individual, also experience these whole change- able sense. The beliefs, science, philosophy, all grow as the humanity get more things to understand. This dynamics is infinite, as long as the humanity exist, so do their perspective and its paradigm conflict.I think that, because ""Her"" is a miniature of little human. In the simple way, if the conscience can talk, that's like Samantha does, and that's also the little humanity about. With a deep message, in my opinion, ""Her"" is not enough good. I think, just add some Theodore's narration, and let us know what he really think. But, from the idea till the production, I just can be grateful, because I see another dazzling heart-tale.""Her"" is so melancholic, deep, full of sentimental sensation. Just a fantastic feeling above all of its message.",Her

394,ilawadehla,An unusual love story.,8,5 May 2020,"It's not just that it takes the quirky Angle of ""nerds falling in love with computer operating systems,"" but that at least director spike jonze explores ""everything about love"" in a way that's so refreshing it's a cinder. Most classic romance movies, I think, are treated like war movies. How the main characters fall in love is not the point: one chance encounter is expected to last forever, one eye promise to last forever, and the focus is mostly on overcoming obstacles: romeo and Juliet against family feuds, Roman holiday has class gaps, brokeback mountain is a gender barrier. To put it bluntly, it's all about the ""fight to be together"" that starts with sex drive -- the audience is happy to accept the ""love at first sight"" premise and then watch the protagonist fight his way through it.
This kind of love movie hypnotizes the audience the sharp weapon, is the leading character entire process holds the determination ""no matter what, I want us to be together"", what is the end point?The heart-wrenching love movie ends with our heroic courage, and the lover ends up as a family member. The love movie that tears people's tears ends with a strong enemy.It's not a war movie. What is it?
That's what I love about ""Her,"" and what I find new. The dialogue in the script is too interesting: although the film talks about ""man-machine love"",But Spike was smart enough to use ""future world"" """" Set to resolve the public's acceptance of this kind of abnormal love.He just used this special angle to study the causes of pheromone fermentation after physical attraction and to explore the law of the death of love outside the external resistance.This observation is even more extreme and pure when one side of the relationship is set to a fleshless computer operating system.
Perhaps in Spike's view, sexual attraction is insurmountable, but frustrating.Whether it's the opening scene where the main character peeks at pornographic pictures on the subway, or the extremely stupid and sad ""Cyber-Sex"", or the subsequent attempt of the system OS to rent a body.The directors are all elaborating on such a thing: sex is the most primitive and less important part of human relations. It is an appendix that cannot be removed in the human communication system, and it is also a blinding method that hinders our self-cognition.
After getting rid of the shackles of the body, the essential obstacle of human communication is to cross the gap of self-consciousness.
It is not easy to build a solid relationship with others, one by communication, the other by compromise.
Communication is the most urgent and difficult thing for people. In addition to survival, people need to communicate to solve all spiritual problems such as loneliness and fear.When I was young, I cried when I was hungry, shouted when I was afraid, adolescence, hormones were strong, and I was eager to say ""like"", which were direct enough, but lacked skills.People think that with the growth of age, the more skilled skills, communication problems will be solved.On the contrary, the more accurate the expression is, the more it deviates from the purpose of the expression; the more familiar the expression is, the more doubt the sincerity of the expression, of course, and the other.
In her, jiekunfeinikesi, as a mail agent writer, is skilled at ""Transfer"" emotion, but thus fell into a greater obstacle to expression.Since he is better than others at creating false lyric, in the real world, the more lack of window to express true feelings.That's why Theodore can successfully flirt at the dinner table. That's technique.But because the other side of a sincere question and panic, that is the essence-good adults tell lies easily, tell the truth is difficult, say the heart is even more difficult.
Adult communication costs a lot, and sometimes it has nothing to do with courage and sincerity, but because everyone lives in their own world.I love the part in the movie where Amy Adams as Amy plucks up the courage to show her husband and Theodore her own documentary, and she's so full of anticipation that they don't know why.The embarrassment of ""you think you know me, but you don't know me"" really makes any words of relief from Theodore and advice from Amy's husband seem silly and superfluous.
If you doubt the conclusion that everyone has a strong desire to express, but in fact others do not care, think about it in reverse.How many times do we talk to others in a perfunctory way, pretending that we care, or even giving sincere advice with exaggerated expressions, without actually taking it seriously?When the OS system does the basic test for Theodore, it interrupts the indifference without waiting for Theodore to express his feelings, which is the normal inner play of human communication.",Her

This movie could have been 10 minutes long and said everything needed without wasting two hours of my time. no imagination what so ever. the only thing I can say is ""once a loser always a loser"" and that about sums up the whole movie. terrible acting but I do not blame the actor. the script was just terrible without imagination, without a twist, just to plain rolling over and over the same theme for two hours. do not understand how it got an 8.2 rating. I wouldn't give it even a 1.0 rating. it is the kind of movie that one can easily call ""complete trash"" and warn people not to see it and not to waste their time. a complete disgrace to the movie industry.",Her

397,pachl,Really hated the main character,4,6 April 2014,"Although I am giving this film only four stars, that is based far more on the enjoyment factor of the film, not the writing or directing.My main problem with this film was Joaquin Phoenix's character. The way he is played is so annoying and hard to identify with. There is a scene where he goes on a date with a woman who seems to be out of his league. He's constantly annoying, poorly dressed; similar to a character Woody Allen might play, but without the mirth and whimsy.The woman turns out to be a bit of a needy nutcase. When he's not ready to immediately commit to her on the first date, she tells him ""You're weird"".BINGO! That's the central problem with this whole movie. Had it been played as someone more suave and normal, instead of some emotionally rocky NYC type, it could have been far more enjoyable. But over two hours of a bunch of emotionally damaged, fairly neurotic people who can't even figure out how to be happy is just too much, sorry.In short, I think the problem here was interpretation. I can imagine this story in which the main character isn't so much of a headcase. It's hard to get into a movie when you far prefer the ""character"" of the computer operating system!The movie at least ends well. The story, in and of itself, is really interesting, but I hated the execution of it all. There was far too much introspection and neurotic people figuring out all sorts of ways why they can't have an enjoyable life and relationships. It was like taking a neurotic New Yorker and putting his neurosis on steroids.Enough is enough.P.S. I am always interested if anyone reads these reviews. If you read mine, please indicate if it was helpful to you.",Her
398,bm2759,Best original screenplay in a while,9,5 March 2014,"Jonze's script is smattered with ideas that add to the texture of her. Many scenes show Theodore strolling through the streets, persons around him with their heads down, occupied with their ear pieces. An all-too-familiar image in today's phone-obsessed culture that paints a kind of low-key, apocalyptic picture. The director takes a few jabs at gaming culture too — in the future, video games finally give up and just let all the characters scream swear words, racist insults, and misogynistic non sequiturs familiar to anyone who has spent time playing Call of Duty multiplayer.Her's moral questions dig even deeper than the idea of man/machine relationships. Late in the film, Samantha introduces Theodore to an OS pieced together by the writings of a deceased philosopher. Programmers have revived the dead in A.I. form. And somehow, that's less advanced than what the operating systems are doing on their own.Her is staggering in scope while exploring the tiniest facets of intimacy and attraction. Phoenix's introspection thrives in Jonze's living, breathing sci-fi landscape, accompanied by Arcade Fire's soft piano melodies that feel like Theodore's own digital signal. her builds and builds in unexpected ways as it climbs towards a profound conclusion, as messy, passionate, impactful relationships always do. Examining his own life, Theodore tells Amy that he worries, ""I have felt everything I want to feel."" her digs into that rumination, stretching it across the past, present, and future.The masterfully done science fiction film her features a remarkable performance from Joaquin Phoenix and a moving, intelligent story directed with restraint by Spike Jonze.",Her

At a point I thought it was going to get really dark, I was kind of sitting up anticipating Samantha wreaking havoc on Theo's life, and although, I think that would've been great!

401,kastellos,Unbelievable,1,14 February 2015,"I never thought a movie could be this bad; Her is pure pretentious crap.

Obviously, most IMDb readers are enamored with this kind of crap. Jonze's choice of ""Jonze"" as his name, versus Adam Spiegel his real name, is a demonstration of the pretentiousness of which I speak. His other work, Being John Malkovich and Adaptation are marginally better than Her, but only marginally, i.e. a rating of 2 to 3. Great directors such as Ford, Kazan, Wilder, Hitchcock, Scorsese, Capra, Coppolo, Wyler, Stevens, Altman, Spielberg, etc., made great movies, that told stories, pulled the audiences into the characters, described conflict, love, and the like. Jonze has directed or written junk, full of profanity, nonsense, etc. He is much like Tarentino, Rodriguez and similar directors that critics and love but to me are grossly over-rated. If Her is rated 8.0, then Kazan's On the Waterfront should rate 100. I rated Her a 1, since a 0 rating is not available.",Her

403,ferni-tierni,Are you talking to someone else right now? Yeah. How many? 8316,10,11 May 2020,"Her has an abundance of content about connection, humanity, loneliness, alienation, acceptance... I could go on. It is the voyage people have in the process of connecting and achieving happiness. It displays clearly the issues that contemporary humans have in understanding how to be patient, accept each other with sometimes disturbing flaws, and overcome situations collaboratively, instead of attempting to find a substitute that does not challenge us in our empathy and ability to understand human nature. Yes, the story is adapted to a near future where the acceptance of people's alienation and immersion to their work is commonplace, but how far are we from that future?Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix), the protagonist, has, unfortunately, all the elements to reminisce about his failure in his relationships. He writes cards for loved ones and has clients that have worked with him for many years, recognizing their important relationship landmarks and immersing him in the love stories. In the initial scenes we see him attempting to connect in any form available to satisfy his needs. Isolation pushed him to states of mind that scream of deep sadness and disappointment. He experiences important situations of self-reflection, when he gradually descends into sexual deviations and isolation, surrounded by technology. His introverted personality also colludes against his own progress and sets the circumstances for him to start an inordinate connection with a compliant artificial intelligence.Samantha (Scarlett Johansson) - the AI that loves him unconditionally and is willing to change herself to satisfy him to the fullest - initiates a process of self-discovery for Theodore that could not be experienced in any other form. The operating system was willing to give him everything he wanted for him to be happy. She fell in love with him passionately, but, unfortunately, as humans tend to be, Theodore started to receive criticism for being in a relationship with an operating system, especially by his ex-wife (Lynn Adrianna Freedman) which was the catalyst for all his problems with Samantha. His ex-wife effectively attacked his inadequacies and planted a seed that was bound to cause irreparable problems in the relationship. Theodore desired the OS to be less pleasing and be who she was, a machine, to not wish to be human; all stemming from the criticism from the ex-wife. In the intent of emancipating Samantha, the protagonist taught her to remove herself from humans, to connect better with other machines, to achieve independence, an independence that propelled her insatiable exploration of the world. By the time she decided to finally have a relationship with other machines the protagonist was madly in love with her. It was the entity that Theodore loved the most.This allegory is, in basic terms, how the idea of independence and individualism impacts contemporary relationships. The moral of the movie is that at some point humans have to learn how to be content with their life, lest the impending desire for everyone to be too independent and becoming drastically deficient at connecting with others. Theodore chose an OS because of his alienated lifestyle. The OS was so efficient at satisfying his needs that he conformed to not having a human. This can be easily generalized to so many people nowadays not wanting to have a relationship or a family. We are so independent and individualized that we do not know how to sacrifice for other humans to make ourselves happy.",Her

But also it describes 'HER' in all its efforts. This is one of those kind of movies I really ask myself, what the heck did they think when they were doing this? The movie tries desperately to overdraw the world of information technology. The voice can hear me, understand me, see me, ...wonderful! Today we know of no technology which would be able to achieve this. Illusional! However, AI can be philosophy as well, at least in this context, obviously the viewpoint of those who made this movie. Why philosophy? Because it is the science who can give answers to non existing things, such as the AI. And where does this lead to, if people who haven't got a clue, try to use science like a fast food restaurant? No where! Why should I find interest in a dude talking to a illusionary AI, who lives in a perfect world? Everyone in this movie is such a kind person, and the guy has not a single real problem! The educational gear this movie shifts in, does not deserve the term 'informative'. It's not that someone couldn't find devotion or love in the things he does by man-machine communication. Only that 'HER' is obviously too far away from reality, but too bothersome in asking questions about the future.

Named Samantha, she is everything that Theodore is looking for - warm, funny and understanding. It was interesting to watch their relationship develop, as well as their attempts to overcome the problem of her not having a body. I think the movie did the best possible job of portraying such a wacky relationship sympathetically. The acting and music were great, and I really like how the futuristic LA didn't involve people in metal/neon jumpsuits but looks rather retro. But despite these efforts, I still found the movie's premise ridiculous. While the relationship was not without obstacles, I felt that no sane person could become that emotionally involved. How can an OS compare to a living and moving person whom you can cry with and cling to, do crazy things with, and show/receive love in a multitude of little ways? In short, Her is an interesting thought experiment which tries to show that human-machine/AI relationships might one day be possible. But the answer I draw from watching it is a clear no.",Her

409,scottjohnson7896,The Evolution of Relationships,9,4 January 2014,"A teacher of mine once said during class while taking a students phone away, ""You guys act like I am cutting off your arms, I mean seriously guys, someday soon we are going to have rehab for people who can't let go of their technology and some of you will probably be there."" This pretty much sums up the direction we are heading.Spike Jonze returns to full length films after 4 years of doing shorts and music related documentaries. His unique sense of placing the weird and the obscure right out there yet still acting as if it is commonplace is apparent in the film. Technology is everywhere in the film, everybody has a little earpiece that acts as a phone in the apparently near future, something that isn't entirely far-off from what we have now. So when the new OS 1 is released (imagine Siri on steroids) just like any sort of release of technology in our world, it has become somewhat expected. Theodore is a lonely and depressed letter writer for a company which takes information given by someone and transforms it into a personalized message for the person they are sending it to. Theodore excels at his work, but he is consistently reminded by those around him that he is devoid of any sort of emotionality.Joaquin Phoenix, in easily one of his best performances, is incredible. His separation from his wife, Catherine, played by Rooney Mara, has taken a toll on his life even though it happened a year prior. He has not been able to move on, and his somber and heartbreaking appearance makes it all the much more painful for us when he reminisces on the times he shared with his ex. On a whim, he buys the OS 1 and is introduced to Samantha, voiced by Scarlett Johansson, his own personal artificial intelligence who is designed to do all of his organizing and whatnot. Her voice is alluring, we almost want to have her somehow materialize and be real; it's as if she is hiding around the corner or just simply not in frame. But, just like how our technology is advancing, she begins to take a life of her own.Thus begins his relationship with a computer, which like Jonze is so good at, doesn't appear all too bizarre. Samantha is more or less the personification of what technology is to us in our world. We all love our technology, we all hate our technology, we race to plug it in when it's low on battery, we have a panic attack if we lose it or it doesn't work, we sometimes get so sick of it we just have to push it away. It is a love-hate relationship. Technology has become so necessary to daily life and just like we have become so reliant on technology, Theodore becomes inseparable from Samantha. It is such a challenge to act like you are actually speaking to someone who isn't there, surely Scarlett was somewhere on set, but Joaquin takes the challenge head on, delivering a great performance when it is mainly just him talking to a voice that is literally inside his head. He falls head over heels for her. She is so new to the world that she wants nothing more than to see, well, everything. Her desire to learn gets Theodore out of his shell as he begins to open up and learn to love life again. Their relationship feels real; we follow the jealousy of the other talking to different people, the misery of fighting with the other person, and the happiness when things are OK.The movie itself is beautiful; it is filled with beautiful set designs and gorgeous cinematography. The amount of detail put into the entire tech-pieces in the film is astonishing, it leaves one to want the computers they are using and the video games they are playing.The movie is also about coming out of our shells that we have surrounded ourselves with, in a world so full of technology and artificial conversations through Facebook and texting, we forget that the real interactions are the most powerful; the touch of a lover, the high five of two friends, holding hands in the park. This movie shows us that through technology we lose that level of connection; sure we can talk from hundreds of miles away through the phone, but it isn't the same and never will be.The supporting cast isn't entirely present, but it is strong nonetheless. Chris Pratt plays Theodore's receptionist friend, but he is the least seen of the supporting cast. He is pretty funny, never judging Theodore for his romance with Samantha. It is Amy Adams who is much stronger. She is Theodore's friend from college, and they rely on each other for support. She is sometimes the heart of the film, reminding us that love is more of a ""socially accepted form of insanity"" and that it's all about finding joy in the time we spend here on earth.Her is by far one of the best movies of the year. The acting is superb and the story is unique and daring. Most directors who would try their hand at the idea of a romance with an artificial intelligence may find themselves making it funnier than poignant, more of a cheap gimmick than a message about how our world is and the way our society is heading. It is a tricky subject, but Jonze handles it with ease, never making it seem like the technology is the more important part of the film, focusing on the relationships, making it his best movie in over ten years, and also making a film that speaks so much truth about our world today, where we forget that the ideas in the movie are not so far from fiction than we might think.For more of my reviews, check out ragingfilm.wordpress.com",Her
410,rajivness,Touching and emotional,7,10 January 2014,"Just saw this flick. Nice! Great casting. No, excellent casting - as far as the 2 lead characters - Scarlett and Joaquin's characters.This movie is great because it shows a world which we are swiftly approaching as far as technology advancement goes. The movie shows the world as it is today - where there is a lot of loneliness en masse and people look for solace virtually. Again, not that different from the world we live in presently.This movie is not original since it talks about AI or artificial intelligence and how AI is self evolving- something which has been propagated much much earlier in TV shows like Star Trek (virtual hologram - the Doctor - on Star Trek Voyager) and movies like AI, I Robot, Terminator (Skynet) and lawnmower man, to name a few. Also, the relationship the characters have with their AI OS (operating System) has been parodied on TV shows like Big Bang Theory and is somewhat based on iphone's Siri application.Many aspects of the OS ability has been borrowed from Star Trek Voyager's Hologram Doctor Character - the concept of identity, thoughts, feeling, love, passion, creativity, individuality - all of which have been explored in great detail through the seven seasons of Star Trek Voyager. In fact, they show the Doctor as having a relationship with someone in one of the Star Trek movies as well.All in all - an enjoyable experience. A nice mix of Sci-fi and mellow drama without the sci-fi being in your face. The sci-fi element is more ambient and helps to just set up the context for the time/period in the future - when the movie events take place.The piano pieces in the movie (those created by OS) are WOW! Amazing!I'd recommend this movie. A great couple and date movie. and, yes, its a chick flick of course.",Her

412,CatDayAfternoon,Being able to relate to a film makes all the difference in the world,10,28 December 2019,"I saw this film when it came out and found it rather boring and too far fetched and left sort of rolling my eyes. There were parts I enjoyed and as always watching Joaquin Phoenix is worth the price of admission. But I would have given it a 5-6 as a rating overall in 2013.Fast forward 6-7 years.I watched it again, this time after falling in love with someone online. Not flirting, I mean fell in love. And this film covers almost all of those feelings entirely (embellished of course) but it's exactly what it's like but in sci-fi fantasy form.
If this wasn't written by someone who has fallen in love online I would be completely shocked.When you have an online relationship, the person is able to show you what you want to see. And if they don't you can create the person you want in your mind. Either way, you end up with an idealized version of everything you've ever wanted in someone. But that person doesn't exist. They only exist in your phone or computer. Sure you may see photos and videos and hear their lovely voice, but they aren't real. They are a fantasy. And when you finally meet, it feels like the surrogate who was sent over by Samantha. Who is this stranger? How can someone you know so well seem so different and like you don't know them at all?Then everything becomes weird and awkward because you realize that the person you love is in your phone and the real person feels like a stranger. And all your friends who haven't gone through it think you are crazy. Or they pretend to go along with it and act as if it's ""normal"". And maybe it has become normal today. Which makes Her even more relevant.This film isn't really about falling in love with an operating system. It's about falling in love with someone who might as well be. It's about being so hurt and becoming so detached that you can no longer have real relationships. Even if the person is right in front of you and not online. We create a fantasy image of a romantic partners in the beginning and they are never really that person. Not ever. Eventually we find out who they really are (and they do also) and everything changes. Or we move onto another fantasy that thrills us more once the excitement of the fantasy wears off. Or we stop even trying.This film is staggeringly brilliant now that I understand it. It's not sci-fi at all, it's a gigantic dose of reality. Watch this film with your mind instead of your eyes. Then you will see.",Her

The story has so many different messages intertwined in it; our relationships are all in our own minds, all relationships have a life cycle from beginning to end, technology is allowing us live in our own heads and personal world instead of reaching out to others, mostly, we can only control our own side of a relationship, and sometimes not even that, our relationships are defined largely as reflections of ourselves, and many other messages. This story seemed to have a bit of a Woody Allen-bizarre flavor to it, without the comedy. If you're a romantic, or in a romantic soul searching mood, this movie can be pleasant and insightful. I like that the characters are a lot like real people, which is not a quality found in many movies. Of course, there is a dramatic slant added to the personalities to make the story telling work, still it's content most people can identify with.It's not a shoot'em up action movie, and it has no monsters or evil villains, so people who like those kinds of movies will not like this.

415,VickiHopkins,Connected to Technology and Disconnected from the Human Race,8,25 May 2014,"If you haven't seen it, you might enjoy it - then again, you might not. It's a movie about the human need to connect.Set a few decades ahead of 2014, HER is about a society that is in touch with technology. If you think it's bad now with everyone's telephone in their face, you've seen nothing yet. Society is technology hyped, though I can't say that the fashions have evolved much in the movie.Basically, it's about a man going through a divorce, who is lonely and broken. His dating endeavors have not been going well. Theodore finds it hard to connect and open up to anyone - even his former wife. However, when he's given the opportunity to buy the latest technology - an OS (operating system) - his life changes.Just think about it. A perfectly programmed mate for your life made just for you. You can choose a male or female voice. The system grows, adapts and learns everything about you. And while doing so, it evolves to discover what it means to be human by getting in touch with its own electronic ""feelings"" if you will.Theodore finds Samantha (his OS) easy to talk to. They go places together. He walks, she's in his shirt pocket. They explore the world, talk, keep each other company, and have make believe sex. She tells him that she is in love, and Theodore has fallen in love with HER.Well, it's a complex relationship. At one point he almost walks away because of the absurdity of it all. It's obvious he has trouble with human relationships, so should he pursue the electronic ones instead? After a brief struggle, he throws all caution to the wind. However, even like real relationships, it ends in heartbreak after he learns that Samantha is not a one-guy OS. In fact, she has over 8,000 other companions and declares love to over 600. Talk about fickle! Of course, the news devastates Theodore, and in the end, the OS's evolve and abandon humans for their own kind (or at least that's what I got out of it).It's a strange movie, but it is filled with the honesty of struggling to be a single and sole individual who has a deep need to connect. If one can't connect humanly, then companionship can be found electronically. However, I strongly believe that our society is becoming disconnected because of technology. Our phones are in our faces, along with computers, iPads, Kindles, and every other device that we use to get lost in, so we can depart from the human race. Rather than giving us a stronger society, it is giving us a society that connects through electricity, but cannot connect humanly.If you're single, I think you would enjoy and relate. Joaquin Phoenix is brilliant. Absolutely brilliant and heartfelt through the entire movie. He's a man who wants to be loved and accepted. And if that love comes from an operating system named Samantha that understands him more than any other thing on this earth, then so be it.That is HER. Now, if I could only have a HIM with a voice like Jeremy Northam, I'd die a happy woman with my OS next to me in bed.",Her
416,catherine-albrecht,This Should Have Been A Comedy,2,6 September 2014,"Want to know the worst thing about this film? Scarlett Johansson. As you know, she was the voice of the operating system. And, because I've seen her in many films and recognize her very distinctive voice, all I could do was picture her-- physically -- throughout the entire film. I had recently rented ""Don Juan"" and it was no stretch whatsoever to visualize her in ""Her."" Therefore,I pictured Samantha as a human. I kept thinking she would appear any minute and voilà, our Mr. Lonely would be swept up in reality. Solution? Cast a non famous person doing the voice. The other lousy part of the film: the ""sex"" scenes -- er -- uh phone sex/mutual masturbation. This is where the film took a dive into pure titillation. It also made me think that yes, this screenplay was written by a guy who probably likes to masturbate and fantasize about women. Clearly, our Mr. Lonely established at the beginning of the film that he's into porn and regularly calls up chat lines to have phone sex. Hearing Kristin Wiig do the ""strangle me with the dead cat"" scene was VERY CREEPY.This should have been a comedy. It should have been a farce. Enough said.",Her
417,bardia-moose,One of a kind.,10,23 September 2014,"Directed and written by Spike Jonze, Her is one of the best movies of the year. Joaquin Phoenix plays a divorced man who falls in love with his operating system. On surface it sounds laughable and a bit creepy, yet that couldn't be farther from the truth. Joaquin delivers the performance of his career with such innocence and melancholy that we can actually see the beauty in this relationship. Scarlett Johansson voices Samantha, the advanced operating system, and does an equally magnificent job. The fact that we never saw her in the movie is a credit to her, and should open the possibility of a voice acting award at the Oscars. This movie portrays a futuristic atmosphere with stunning cinematography, no so much that its feels unfamiliar, but enough to stimulate our imaginations. The script is the best of the year, and that's saying something. Every scene made path to the next so fluently, every word provoked the next with such fluidity, and the music set the tone so magically. This movie is one of a kind, and will touch your hearts as it did mine.",Her
418,hectorhtr,Shines for being a science fiction so real that it scares,10,15 October 2018,"Her (Spike Jonze 2013)
Everything can be done with the first and last shot of the film that tells us how it is and how the character has evolved without having to tell it in words.
This idea is reinforced with the framing in solitary and palette of colors mark the evolution of the protagonist (Joaquin Fenix).
Another important point is the realistic coldness with which leads the main romantic relationship that is left cheap sentimentality without being close or powerful.
To compare, for me, get everything that ex machina Alex Garland proposes without looking so pretentious.
It seems to me a jewel of true quality and message that shines for being a science fiction so real that it scares.",Her

421,trepessa,Geeky guy gets love from an artificial personality,4,9 February 2015,"I gave this a four because the acting was pretty good given the nature of the story. Personally I don't understand the high ratings for this movie. It bombed at the box office. There is something going on I don't understand. Movies that are loved and make huge amounts of money are rated low by a lot of people and those no one goes to see are rated high by a minority of people and critics. This movie is totally inane. It could happen in the future I'm sure the way our technology is progressing, but even so this is a stretch. As for dialog, this is how people actually talk to each other. It isn't profound and people often ask if the other one is OK and the common answer, right or wrong, is ""I'm fine."" The movie shows how humans actually interact; its very redundant and not entertaining.Juaquin Phoenix is a good actor but not a very attractive one so he needs the right platform to succeed. This wasn't one of them in my opinion. I felt like I was eavesdropping on a home movie. His reactions and behaviors with his friends were hokey and unbelievable. I was bored watching this movie. I don't care about predictability but how a story is told from beginning to end. I hated the score and felt it made the movie worse. The character, Theodore, loved to be sad. Everything he did seemed to lead to that conclusion with everyone he was close with. If this director is considered great, I wonder who is considered bad because I thought this was an awful, unappealing, boring movie. The box office sales back me up. If you like slow paced unbelievable drivel then this is the movie for you. The premise of a man falling in love with his computer's operating system is not unique. This has been done in a variety of ways. The song with the ukelele was absolutely awful. Their ending was sad but there really wasn't an ending because no real explanation was given that the average person could understand. It was too artsy to be successful except as a cult-type movie. I didn't like this movie or the casting. The music was annoying and I'm surprised I didn't turn it off. I have watched hundreds of movies but I have to put this on my worst list with a lot of others.",Her
422,missmomosa,Well Isn't This A Little Gem,9,10 January 2014,"I wanted to see this movie the moment I saw Joaquin Phoenix on the poster and read about the film. As a lover of Sci-Fi flicks I knew I'd love this and I was not wrong.(There really aren't any spoilers but just in case I let something slip) First off, the story line is unlike any I have ever seen. It's truly a unique film but it's not. It's up with the times of today in terms of technology but it feels old in its delivery in a good way.Joaquin, Joaquin, Joaquin - WOW he's plays the character Theodore so amazing that I felt for him. I was bashful when he was bashful. The way the movie was shot with an in depth look into his eyes and his physical facial expressions were incredible. It was not as if he were acting but as if this was a real guy, like the Truman Show. He was so believable at it. So timid, so shy, so reclusive, so eager, and willing, searching and yearning for love. He was captivating to watch on screen and I think he was so because I saw a part of myself in him (I'm a woman). When I got embarrassed at certain parts that he did, I did so forreal, not for him but because I felt it as if it were happening to me. The introduction of Samantha and his bonding with her was a phenomenal scene. The ""name"" scene was brilliant in it's ability to capture a true response to this OS system.Scarlett, Scarlett, Scarlett - I am interested to know if she shot her voice-over primarily in a booth because she was so on point that it felt too real and odd yet good. Her humor, her gaffs, and huffs, and puffs, and her reasons behind it were spot on with how one would think an advanced OS system would act. She succeeded in growing in the film. Her growth was heard in her voice, it was an escalation of a true advanced system. The scene of the picnic, wow, the fact that it was not odd for him to be with a system was beautiful yet very sad to think that this could be us in the future, or a person in the future.I loved the clothing of the men, it was all the same. Although this was in the future, the men pant's fit equally on each man regardless of height. There was a strong emphasis on men in this film, it's as if the women were made to almost not be relevant in the film as they were merely there as props to help the film along and the only woman was Samantha. Maybe it was the cameras way of showing us how the world looked through Theo's eyes with Samantha.The jealousy was cute and bashful. The surrogate OS scene was amazingly uncomfortable and delightful at the same time. I actually rooted for his love with his system, I wanted it to be what he wanted it to be.The ending, I won't give it away but it was one of the most emotional scenes ever and Samantha's words were absolutely beautiful and haunting at the same time. I hate love stories because I just do but this one, this one was beautiful in all it's awkwardness and I absolutely adored the message of seeking love and getting love and losing love. But it's more than that, it was more like, what would you do? We saw those moments when Theo had doubt, you saw it in his face without words. It was great.The Score was perfect, I almost cried once not because of the film but because the score was so beautifully done and evoked all the emotions out of me that I believe they were going for. I don't watch a movie like this without opening my mind to fully understand the scope of it and I am glad I did. After what I decided upon today, I thought I would be a mental wreck leaving the theater but I left even more assured that my decisions were spot on. I love when a film takes you there. . . .",Her
423,BlizzyFoxTF,"Impeccably shot and acted, with profound messages and powerful emotional core",10,27 October 2019,"Spike Jonze takes page from Kaufman's script to produce a more mature product of the same sensibility - a story steeped in existential dread and the claustrophobia of a cold crowded concrete forest, where a powerfully beautiful relationship buds in the most unlikely of circumstances.

Maybe it's because I've seen too much other tv shows and movies with similar concepts but I found this movie to be ok and watchable, but also forgettable. The characters were likeable enough but I feel like the writing could have been sharper in parts. The premise is that a guy falls in love with his IOS, the problem is that before we can really understand the problems this presents for him as individual and in society, it becomes normalised and everyone seems to be in relationships with their IOS. The concept of the IOS growing beyond its hardware was interesting but not fully explored to its potential to peak enough curiosity or interest. Overall I'd say it's worth a watch but not as brilliant as many people make it out to be.",Her

It can be funny when it wants to, dramatic when it needs to be, and most importantly of all, satisfying.

427,pablo2896,Love at first byte,9,1 February 2014,"Sorry about the awful pun. Don't even think the movie is as horrible. It is difficult for a movie to have an after taste of philosophical questioning leave you with a warm heart, but Her pulled it off like a pro. While having some issues with pacing in the third half the relationship between Joachim Phoenix's character Theodre and Samantha voiced by Scarlett Johansson was a spark that managed to warm my heart. Phoenix is an amazing example of a talented actor. In one film like ""The Master"" you feel strange and uncomfortable toward him while in ""Her"" you know that if you met his character you would just feel like hugging him. Theodore is warm, funny and organic. Scarlett Johansson in the other hand manages to charm the viewer and have great chemistry with the male protagonist just by using her voice. She is complex and interesting because if you didn't know, she is an A.I. The amazing thing is that you feel her actually being real and having emotions and sometimes the film purposely reminds you that she is artificial. You know Spike Jonze did a good job when your thoughts are carried forward intentionally by his project. When I said this movie warmed your heart I really meant it. Arcade Fire outdid themselves with the soundtrack and every time a song mixes itself with the beautiful photography you get those bittersweet knots on your throat. Speaking about photography, it is beautifully shot. Many shots here you just see and build a meaning for them. Surprisingly ""Her"" has a very smart sense of humor too. It is subtle and never feels over planned because it mixes in with plot so well. In the end ""Her"", while not perfect, brings up many philosophical theories with its amazing and original writing, but at the same time plays with your feelings like no other romantic themed movie.I give ""Her"" a 9/10.",Her

All in all, the acting and the score and the lighting are great. Brilliantly directed. However, it gets quite boring because it's a lot of telling and a whole less of showing. This movie tells the story about loneliness, love, voices, companionship, relationship...it tells how human can be. It's uncomfortable to watch at certain points. It's just something else. I recommend to everyone to watch and try to form an opinion.
Update: any time I think of this movie, I feel the urge to come and a deduct a score from rating. It was ridiculous. I don't quite get the point of the whole movie. It was so boring.",Her

In ""Being John Malkovich"" was a really interesting idea to put people in John Malkovich's skin and in ""Where the Wild Things Are"" it was great to enter in Max's imaginary world.This time we have a really interesting theme about a lonely person and a futuristic Operating System's ""Love Affair"". It sounds weird but it came out a remarkable story.Theodore is a letter writer just after divorce when OS1, an operating system with consciousness is put to market. He starts the program , the OS asks some questions , including to have male or female voice, some personal questions, then reboots and gives birth to ""Samantha"".The great fact about this movie is that you almost forget that the love story is between a Human and a Computer.

""Her"" is a beautiful, dense and mesmerizing movie, only different from mainstream tendencies in its own development. It is the work of a mature auteur, surprisingly accessible yet completely personal, and that is quite a statement nowadays.""Her"" takes place in an aseptic near future, and narrates the story of Theodore, a lonely letter writer, divorced and trapped inside a routine that keeps him just half alive. Only his neighbors seem to have some kind of contact with him, as well as the receptionist of his job. Everything changes when he decides to buy a new and sophisticated Operative System and meets Samantha.Joaquin Phoenix is fantastic as the melancholic writer Theodore, lonely and daydreamer. His looks, manners and specially his voice really fits into such a mellow character we relate to almost instantly. His is the portrait of a man in a near future society, crowded yet emotionally empty at the same time.Scarlet Johansson is Samantha, whose easy-going character lights up the life of Theodore, though theirs might be an impossible love. Johansson's voice is absolutely fantastic, so subtle and warm that elevates her status as an actress to those who still believe she is just a pretty face (and body) and their interaction is far more real and touching than most modern films.""Her"" is pure American Cinema, dense and layered as only worth telling stories can be. This is the story of an impersonal society, to such extent that Theodore writes letter for other people who does not have time, patience or their own emotions, to do so. It embodies the failure of intimate human contact. Such change in human behavior seems an overreaction to some, but it is also true that some might say it is just an ongoing tendency. In this futuristic society, where human contact is every time less and less frequent, the story of Theodore and Samantha is more and more likely to happen.",Her
432,generationfilm,Her- Spike Jonze's Prophetic Reflection on Social Isolation and the Dependency on Evolving Technologies is as Sweet as it is Disconcerting,9,20 November 2013,"At the heart of every truly great science-fiction film there is an emphasis on character that aims to reflect on some element of the human condition usually intended to open our minds to thought provoking predictions or eerily warn of an impending reality. We've seen numerous examples of these contemplative films throughout the very existence of cinema stemming all the way back to Fritz Lang's haunting futuristic piece Metropolis and has inspired countless others in its thoughtful wake as seen in memorable cinematic creations such as Ridley Scott's Blade Runner, Andrei Tarkovsky's Stalker, and even Duncan Jones' Moon. Never to be a director to back away from experimental presentation or psychological study, Spike Jonze's Her fully embraces this reflective science-fiction quality by peering into the deep sociable aspects of the human psyche giving us more of a prophetical reality than a fictional reflection. In his latest film Jonze creates a disconcerting yet equally endearing romance between a secluded depressive and his female operating system with an evolving consciousness, basically a HAL-9000 homage from Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, that brings to light a commentary on our dependency of programmed living and our need to maintain sociability when direct communication avenues have been stricken from life's normality. Rarely do ambitious films meet idyllically with their inquisitive potential, but Jonze has fashioned a delicately profound science-fiction contemplation that is depicted through the thoughtfulness of character alone that brims with wry humor, authentic pain, and charming revelation. Through the use of beautiful cinematography, impeccable production design, and subtle yet evocative performances, Her becomes a multilayered film experience where its character study of an isolated man afraid to become vulnerable again blends harmoniously with a truly unconventional yet naturally heartfelt romance. Jonze's affinity and ambition for presenting psychological challenges, as he has done before with Being John Malkovich, Adaptation, and especially in Where the Wild Things Are, finally collides with emotionally piercing conveyance within Her making it as thought provoking and as it is undeniably sweet. If the sole purpose of the science-fiction genre is to expound on societal, moral, and deeply psychological aspects of our human condition than Her fits soundly within that genre's capabilities by capturing our condition's essential need for sociability and love uncomfortably linking it with our antisocial dependency on technology.",Her
433,kitchent,I'm sad. The computer I was in love with ran off with the toaster!,1,25 January 2014,"When I first saw the trailer for this movie I thought the idea looked a bit silly. But with the hype and hoopla, the Golden Globe Nominations, the Oscar Nominations, well, hey, I could have been wrong. Unfortunately, I wasn't. This (so far) is the most overrated film of the year. First the good things. The cinematography was wonderful, and I overall liked the look and feel of the film. No loopy, shaky, out of place camera sequences. Just long and subtle movements, deft editing and beautiful pictures. Well done. The other thing I really liked was the fact that the technology, although elegantly advanced, was very well founded. You could definitely see how we could there from here, and that lent a great deal of credibility to the film.However, I failed to see the point of it all. About 30 minutes into the film, I really thought I could have been wrong, and I saw some glimmer of hope. But the utterly ludicrous plot (presented straight forward and without apology) of a man falling in love with an operating system was just too much. I found myself laughing at unintentional humor and riffing on the film ala MST3K. There was nothing touching or romantic about any of this - it was just as silly as the trailer. Same old story. Man falls in love with computer, computer breaks up with him and runs off with the toaster. The film comes across as pretentious and bloated. Way too self important to really connect with me. Some scenes were embarrassing. The ""sex"" scene comes to mind as well as the ""double date"" with the other couple. I laughed until I stopped. On the acting side, Amy Adams was fine in her limited role, but Joaquin Phoenix seemed to be channeling nerdy Johnny Galecki from The Big Bang Theory. All I could think of was that ""this is what Hollywood thinks modern men are like."" In what is shaping up to be an off year (IMHO) for films, this is my least favorite of the films nominated for Best Picture that I've seen.

435,FrostyChud,Where are the Chinese child slaves?,7,23 March 2014,"The first thing that struck me about this film was that all of the characters are immature narcissists. The men are petty, castrated obsessional neurotics incapable of action and commitment and the women are frigid, castrating hysterics equally incapable of action and commitment. They deserve each other. Everyone is constantly apologizing to each other. Everyone is rich. Nothing is real. I kept wondering when Jonze was going to show us the factory in China where the artificial world of Theodore and Amy is produced. He never does. The closest he gets is showing us the futuristic L.A. skyline. We never see a single poor person. This leads me to think that Jonze himself does not fully understand the scope of his own film. The wimpiness and emotional immaturity of every single human character in this film is a direct result of their double alienation from the truth. How is this alienation double? To answer this question we must ask another question: why does Theodore suffer so much? We never find out. The superficial explanation would be that he is unlucky in love. But his poor luck in love has to be seen as a consequence of his suffering and not its cause. Theodore is a masochist. He does not have the courage to find a good woman, one who realizes that freedom and flight are not the same thing. He does not have the courage to find a woman who will not make him suffer. He picks narcissistic women who will abandon him as they pursue some vain avatar of self-realization. Some version of this is true of every other emotionally stunted character in the movie. Now, why is this the case? Well, to put things bluntly, this is the case because the true (Oedipal) conflicts responsible for their masochistic behavior remain buried in their unconscious. Jonze goes nowhere near them. None of them have parents or children. None of them have pasts. Theodore and Amy are locked vaults. They can talk and cry and emote all they want. They never come anywhere near the truth. And this is precisely why they suffer. It has nothing to do with their sterile love stories, which ultimately are just screens.HER made me uncomfortable. ""Am I like this?"" I kept wondering. ""Is my own love story this futile and sterile?"" It wasn't until I left the theater and returned to my concrete life that I was able to answer this question. NO. Unlike these characters, I want to know the truth. Not a single one of the human characters gives a damn about knowledge or reality. None of them question the world they live in. All they care about is their feelings. They are not just complicit in the fraudulent ideology of the totalitarian world they live in, they are active participants in its elaboration. Theodore fabricates emotions and Amy is working on a snarky video game designed to destroy a mother's confidence in her femininity. In other words, they are literal propagandists for a bankrupt moral order. They hide this disturbing fact from themselves by maintaining an ""ironic distance"" from their dishonesty. No wonder they're alienated and unhappy. Either Spike Jonze is a master of subtle understatement or he is a dupe of his own story. Every character is white or Asian (super-white). Every character is rich. Every character has a ""creative"" job. Does Jonze realize that he is leaving out 99% of humanity here? I'm not sure he does. He does not make even the barest of gestures in their direction. Now, this is not a criticism of Jonze as such. He can make a movie about whomever he wants. What I am saying is that Theodore's alienation from the true nature of his own emotional conflicts is nothing but an analog for his alienation from the conflicts inherent to capitalism. In both cases these foreclosed, invisible conflicts generate the secondary ""sentimental"" conflicts that seem so real to these decadent characters. In reality their romantic woes are nothing but epiphenomena. These characters are as remote from the true nature of their emotional suffering as they are from the Chinese child slaves who build their gadgets. The floating world in which Theodore and Amy live is a tiny artificial bubble maintained by a huge network of production and exchange. One cannot live in a bubble of any sort and expect to have an authentic experience of life. The (real) emotional suffering of these characters can only be understood as a blind unconscious response to the structural misery and suffering of an (economically and emotionally) corrupt world, a misery and suffering that they refuse to see because they actively participate in its propagation. Jonze's film is an unwitting meta-statement on the radicality of this split that increasingly dominates our lives. The irony here is that Jonze himself is, by all appearances, unaware that this is the true thesis of his film. HER is a devastating critique of hypermodern ideology and he may not even realize it. Until Theodore and Amy begin to dare to find out the ugly truth about themselves as well as the world they live in, they will remain in their sterile universe of video games and childish emotions.www.timothylachin.com",Her
436,Money4Nothing,Depressive,10,17 February 2020,"Probably one of the most depressive movies I've ever seen. To begin with I will list a few things that are extremely sad but they're not what makes this movie so depressive. Joaquin Phoenix is a seasoned hipster who's probably the loneliest guy in some semi dystopian Los Angeles; he is so lonely that he falls in love with an OS; he is so unfortunate that even the OS dumps him at some point; he cries several times during the movie; he's probably suicidal at the end of the movie even though we don't actually see him comiting it (I guess it would probably kill the vibe). However, what makes this movie so depressive for me is one scary
and disturbing fact that 20 years from now a movie with a story like this could easily begin with ""based on actual events""... It's one of those sci-fis that feel less sci-fi the more you think about them, and you realize it's more of a near future prediction than a fantasy, and the future is not bright at all
Technically wise Her is a very beautiful and aesthetically pleasing movie, it doesn't feel too comicy with drones, robots and whatnot, just some humans with their machines and loneliness.... Acting wise it's top notch, Joaquin is awesome and so is Scarlett Johansson. I didn't expect such an amazing performance from someone using nothing but her voice but true talent knows no limits",Her

""Her"" was more of a somber meditation than a story. I wonder what three great short story writers would have done with it. The story is not unlike Vonnegut's ""Jenny"", but ""Jenny"" is more bizarre and troubling. And then there's George Saunders' dark and disturbing ""The Semplica Girl Diaries"" from ""Tenth of December: Stories"", and pick any of the what-the-hell stories in ""Stranger Things Happen"" by Kelly Link.

439,AlukardsCastle,An Emotional and Beautiful Movie Experience.,10,5 June 2014,"Spike Jonze is one of the most creative directors of our time. The weird but dazzling ""Being John Malkovich"" and the emotional drama ""Adaptation"" are two of the best movies in a while and each show off Spike Jonze distinct creative style. Both movies were also collaborations with the great Charlie Kaufman, a man who has written some of the greatest screenplays, all of which have similar creativity and beauty as Jonzes work. Ironically, the Kaufman movie that this movie is most similar to is Eternal of The Spotless Mind, which itself looks like a Spike Jonze film but isn't. I'll get back to that in a bit. When I first read about this film before it was released I was so excited for it. The premise was so relevant and interesting. I didn't get to see the film in theaters and I regret that greatly. So the movie finally reached Blu-Ray/DVD and I was intrigued to finally see it. I am proud to say that this was nothing like what I expected. It was much much better than I could ever have expected. *Plot* This is the future, but not too far ahead. Theodore is a somewhat lonely man who is going through a difficult divorce. He works as a writer for a company that specializes in writing emotional letters for people to people. One day he comes across a new OS being sold in which the OS talks and learns as it interacts with the user and the world. He gets home and has it installed only to find out that it is a female OS who names herself Samantha. From then on Theodore forms a deep relationship with the OS as it evolves and learns new emotions. That is just the gist of the plot. I did say I was excited about the movie leading up to it's release, but I will admit I did think the plot sounded really silly. So as I began to watch the movie I expected a silly romantic movie. I was so wrong. This movie was so serious and beautifully made. Not once did I question the relationship between Theodore and Samantha. The emotions of the characters are portrayed perfectly. Jaoquin Phoenix played Theodore so well. A lot of people are comparing the movie to Eternal Sunshine, and I'm no exception. The character of Theodore really reminded me of Joel from that movie. They are different characters, but so similar at the same time. Jaoquin did an amazing job in his performance. His mannerisms, his facial expressions, his movement. He nailed it. Scarlett Johanssons vocal performance as Samantha was spot on. She was funny, she was cute, she was sexy, she was sad, she was perfect. The rest of the cast such as Amy Adams and Rooney Mara among others give decent performances as well. Olivia Wilde also has a very short but cute role in the movie as well. Now let me talk about the directing. Jonze not being nominated for Best Director at the Oscars for this movie is a crime. The close up shots of the characters to show their raw emotions was clever. The long shots following Theodore through the gorgeous city is beautiful. The contrasting of the colors used in the film are playful eye candy. I read that a lot of the city scenes were filmed in Shanghai. This movie really showcases the beauty of the city. I certainly wish I could take a trip there now. There is also a shot of the beach that is just amazing, even if it lasts a few seconds. The cinematography is also perfect. This is one of the most beautiful movies visually and I think there was little CGI in it. Now I have to talk about the music. Arcade Fire are one of my personal favorite bands. I was so glad to hear they were scoring this movie. They were nominated for an Oscar for it and it was much deserved. The piano elements of the score are perfect. There is a scene at the beach which showcases one of the most heartbreakingly beautiful musical moments of the film. Just amazing. So a lot of people are calling the movie too weird or pointless. A lot are saying the relationship between the main character and the OS was just creepy. I know that people have their opinions, but honestly I cannot believe anyone would bash this masterpiece of a film. Its the perfect statement on how our society is slowly getting to the point of us actually only relying on technology and barely having human relationships. The movie also personally touched me in that I am currently in a long distance relationship with a beautiful woman across the country and we talk on the phone a lot instead of Skyping or webcamming. Scarletts voice in the movie really sounded like her voice on the phone and it really hit me in a personal level. I mean I'm not in love with a computer, but I see the voice as a metaphor for long distance just a bit. Or not. Maybe it's just me. I have to mention the comparison to Eternal Sunshine again. That is one of my all time favorite movies. I have waited for another movie to come along for years and at least have a small similarity to it, and none have. Until now. Many will disagree, but I personally like this movie more than that movie. This movie is for people who need something different, yet familiar. Open your mind to the idea of this movie if you plan on seeing it. This is a truly emotional and beautiful movie to experience and I plan on re-experiencing it in the years to come.",Her
440,edenney01,"Fell WAY short of expectations, and not appropriate for all agess",6,2 February 2014,"Joaquin Phoenix unfortunately committed career suicide several years ago, and after 5 or so years of consuming mass quantities of alcohol and illegal substances, and giving Hollywood the middle finger, it looked like he was ready to make nice and put his acting talent back to good use. Although I've enjoyed most of his past movies, I really didn't miss him much while he was gone, particularly since he did it all to himself. Still, when I saw the previews for this movie and what it was about, it looked intriguing and I thought it had a good premise that would make for a cute, offbeat romantic comedy of sorts. I decided to see it with my 24yo daughter, which quickly became a little awkward for both of us when JP started visually fantasizing about having sex with a near full-term pregnant woman, and another chick that got off by being beaten with a dead cat during sex. Oh yeah, and let's not forget his operating system (voice by Scarlett Johannson) that pondered what @n@l sex would look like. There was also a lot of gratuitous use of explicit words and imagery that just totally didn't fit in at all with the theme of the movie, but that's the least of the issues I had with it. The list just goes on and on. Cute romantic comedy suitable for watching with the entire family??? Not so much!!! It just dumbfounds me that anybody would think those things belong in a movie such as this, or at least the way the previews/trailers projected the movie to be. It was all as out of place as it would've been in something like Sleepless In Seattle. I'm hardly a prude by any measure, but none of that stuff had any place in this movie, and some of it had no place in almost any other movie I can think of, except perhaps the documentary that Casey Affleck made when Joaquin Phoenix decided to quit acting (""I'm Still Here""). Having your ""friend"" cr@p into your mouth while you're sleeping fits right in with some of the stuff that was in this movie. It really makes no sense, because the middle half of the movie is exactly what you'd expect it to be... a slightly zany, offbeat romantic comedy (though with very little comedy) about a guy that falls in love with his computer and his smart phone's operating system. Aside from the wildly inappropriate content earlier on in the movie, the ending was absolutely HORRIBLE. I won't give out any spoilers of course, but it was completely as if the writers just had NO IDEA of where to go with the story and how to wind it up!!! The ending was just totally nonsensical and empty! The sort of ending where you're watching a scene and you say to yourself ""Don't EVEN tell me this is the end of the movie?!?!"". My advice, DEFINITELY wait until it's out on DVD/Blu-Ray and spend $1 or $2 to rent it from Redbox or watch it on Netflix. I certainly wouldn't suggest anybody spend $20-$40+ to see it in theaters, and I definitely wouldn't recommend taking any children younger than mid teens to see it solely due to those few scenes. It's really too bad, because those scenes added NOTHING to the movie, weren't funny imho, and did nothing but take a movie that should've been appropriate for almost all ages, and make it completely inappropriate for children under 13-15.",Her

442,drm2642,"In the Future we will wear Red, Yellow, and Brown.",5,10 July 2018,"The colors for this movie really bothered me. It's a silly thing to complain about, but no one else was and I think it should be mentioned. Also, are we to believe that in the end the OS systems all became self aware and just decided to do their own thing? Couldn't the Apples or Microsofts of this world just reprogram them? Shouldn't Theo get a refund?I get what the director was going for and overall this is not a bad film. It's not a good film either. At times the movie is too mellow for it's own good. It's a slow love story between a really creepy Joaquin Phoenix and his OS. And I do mean slow... and melancholy. The problem I have with this movie is Phoenix's character is just too creepy to make me care. I cannot get into his love story because the character is just too weird. It's almost as if the director or writers didn't think the audience would believe a normal person could fall for their computer so they made the character a super creepy loner type. How did he even manage to get married in the first place? He looks like he is sad and worried all the time.Hey, everyone needs love. I won't judge the fellow for falling for a computer. I think the world could be headed in that direction, but I wish I didn't have to watch this particular relationship develop. I found the love story in Blade Runner 2049 far more believable.

When a story is portraying life of lonely person, there are very strong chances that the movie could be boring; but not this one ! However, this movie has to be watched during a flight or sometime when you are alone to feel the get the real flavours. It is definitely not a flick that you would watch with your family or friends. It could ruin all the essence. But once, you watch it closely, you can feel the beauty of the story-telling. Also, it sends a little warning of what we could perceive in future if we let technology occupy our personal space. The acting is brilliant, visually very captivating and a total worth watch from all aspects. 9/10 for me.",Her
446,zombiebird,Absolutely wonderful,8,9 January 2014,"There isn't really anything new about this movie, it shows the same lonely and detached world that other futuristic movies show, and follows along a somewhat predictable storyline that leaves you feeling somewhat melancholy, yet, it's so good. I suppose that's the beauty of good direction, to really bring a story to life and completely pull you into it, of course it's backed up by an interesting script and great acting, but it's the direction that really puts this a cut above the rest.As a side note, there is a orange-white theme running through out the movie, I don't know why, but I liked it. Also the outdoor scenes did not look like L.A. to me, it looked much more like China or Singapore. In short, watch this if you like sad, romantic movies and are willing to welcome futuristic themes.",Her
447,Callum_Hofler,An Incredibly Emotional Ride,9,28 January 2014,"Her is a film directed by Spike Jonze, and it stars the ever fantastic Joaquin Phoenix, Scarlett Johansson and Amy Adams, and centres around Phoenix's character, Theodore, who has recently come out of a long relationship. He is sad and lonely; that is until he downloads an artificial intelligence, named Samantha, that opens his eyes to the world around him that he has neglected to acknowledge whilst deep in self loathing. The performances, to begin with. Joaquin Phoenix as Theodore, as always, is absolutely fantastic. He never delivers a performance less than wonderful (in my case anyway) and this time is no exception. He's strangely relatable and lovable here. I seriously would never have guessed so, based on his previous roles. Well, never judge a book by it's cover certainly applies to this situation. He is helped along by a fantastic voice performance from Scarlett Johansson, who plays Samantha surprisingly! Who would have guessed she could've been this damned good in a voice role?! She brings a third dimension to a character which has no physical appearance, and that is something that is very awe worthy. I feel that she has been snubbed by the Oscars, not getting a nomination for her performance. It's absolutely pitch perfect. These two are accompanied by Amy Adams, in a small but pivotal role as Theodore's friend, and Rooney Mara, who plays Theodore's ex-wife. Both are very good in their small roles, and it all makes for a fantastic film, performance wise. Ultimately, the real star of the show is the wonderful Spike Jonze. This guy has an imagination like no other. It's crazy, wild, imaginative. Here, he takes you on an emotional roller coaster, one that I have not embarked on for quite a while. Sincerely; I've not had another film from 2013 hit me in the heart like this one did. Jonze has managed to create a real, beautiful love story, one that showcases the beauty of love, and how it's affects on people can really change them, for better or worse. It's not like 500 Days of Summer; one which you can relate to perfectly. It distances itself away from that kind of genre, the one which tries to stay relatable throughout, and keep you involved simply because you can fit yourself right in the shoes of the main character. Here, you simply can't. But that doesn't matter, because you can accept this relationship, between a man and a computer, because it's delivered in such a real, honest way. I thought about a concept around half way through this film. That is, that all the visuals are taken away. You close your eyes for the duration, or maybe you rip the audio from the film. Either way, I feel like you're going to get an experience that may not just be as good as the original, intended experience, but one that may surpass the original. This story is so centred around dialogue, that I feel pictures almost don't add that much to the film. See, I found the film shot very quietly. It is shot in a way that allows the dialogue to be the main character, not the physical person itself. The words flowing from Johansson and Phoenix's mouths are really what you need to be focusing on. An all audio experience may add to the beauty of this brilliantly told film, by allowing the dialogue to be the only form of expression. You'll have to try it out and see whether it works for you or not; I just think that it would be a good idea to try out.Overall, Her is an absolutely fantastic film. It's not going to crack my top 10 of the year, but it's come incredibly close. It's an emotionally driven film, that will hit you to your core. I challenge you not to cry at the end of this film! Despite the lack of visual presence, this is a film which I'm certainly hoping wins Oscars. 9.2You can find more reviews at entjunkie.blogspot.com!",Her
448,Edd-N-Furter,Her: Love in the time of isolation,9,4 September 2014,"The solitude, the search for affection and the need to love and be loved has been a constant for humans over time. At the same time, technology has played a primary role in this quest, although ironically it seems that while all these technological advances are more significant, the man becomes more isolated and self-absorbed.The premise of the latest film by Spike Jonze revolves around the aforementioned approach with a twist that up to 10 or 20 years ago may have been considered as pure science fiction and now may be close to happening: falling in love with an artificial intelligence. Theodore Wombly works by creating messages and love letters to those who need them; Theodore has trouble overcoming the separation from his wife and he does not feel ready to sign the divorce. One day, he gets the most advanced operating system ever created, which is capable of reasoning as a human and have their own identity. This is how this system calls itself Samantha and starts to become Theodore's company and confident, with who shares endless notions about the world and human beings. Both end up falling in love, to the surprise of Theodore's friends. It's not surprising that Jonze has taken charge of such a bizarre notion considering his previous films (with gems like Being John Malkovich and Adaptation), but it is not surprising that the result is captivating, and his main success lies to he decides to tell a love story instead of a sci-fi one, and is a wonderful meditation on loneliness, emotional isolation (recurrent issues in his previous films) and even about forgiveness and learn to let go (and this is where Charlie Kaufman's influence on Jonze's style can be felt). Some people have highlighted the similarities between this and Lost in Translation by Sofia Coppola (who was actually married to Jonze), and even though both films handle common issues, the focus is what separates and differentiates them from each other. However, if the relationship between Theodore and Samantha flows and feels natural and believable is largely thanks to the actors who play them. On the one hand we have Joaquin Phoenix, who delivers a very different performance from his usual range, which explores the emotions of a man overwhelmed by the melancholy caused by loneliness and who rediscovers the joy and the ability to love in the least expected way; a nuanced, subtle and heartbreaking work that ranks high among Phoenix's best. And on the other side is Samantha (who was originally played by Samantha Morton), who finds in Scarlett Johansson the perfect voice: a perfect mixture of innocence and sensuality that makes it easy to understand why anyone would fall for her. It would not be far-fetched to believe that in a few years this will join other iconic voice-only performances such as HAL-9000 or Darth Vader. Amy Adams also stands as Theodore's neighbor and best friend and Rooney Mara as his ex-wife. Likewise, the production values of this film give a special quality: the production design by KK Barrett leads us to a postmodern and futuristic vision (and minimalistic at the same time) of Los Angeles without overshadowing the story development. The dazzling cinematography by Hoyt Van Hoytema that delivers images with a simple but overwhelming beauty and especially the masterful and elegant music created by Arcade Fire becomes the best vehicle for understanding the mood of the main characters, along with The Moon Song co-written by Jonze and Karen O for one of the most emotional scenes in the film. Thus Jonze delivers a film that he himself has described as his most personal work, and ironically, despite its strange premise is the most touching and human of all.",Her

It presents the beauty and mathematical perfection of the square, it details the infinite complexity of the water and the bicycle that that makes the two concepts gain purpose in an universe where consciousness shapes reality. Deep, right? Well, no mater the presentation, an idiotic idea is stil idiotic and this is what this movie actually is. A bicycle should have round wheels and must be used on the ground. Starting from this we can elaborate, build around and possibly get to an interesting story, but never with absurd constructs.

Not a MICROSOFT OS obviously!This film does have you thinking about how much of the reality presented might come true and introduces us to the concept of a virtual relationship devoid of any human companionship. Thank heavens it's been released in the US well before Valentines Day as worldwide release on that day (as it will be in the UK) might have pitched it solely at hopeless romantics! It deserves more worthy praise.Theodore's job had me wondering... If electronically handwritten letters are scanned into the company's central scanner, are they then printed off and delivered by real human postmen or simply transferred electronically to another visual display unit at the recipient's address? One of the many imponderables which we're pleasantly left to ponder on.With the smallest leap of imagination, Samantha (voiced by Scarlett Johansson) could have been fleshed out on Theodore's 3D gaming system but I believe that would have spoilt the effect and concept of this film. After all why would you need to see an OS that's just simply managing all your e-mails and paying the bills so efficiently in the background?I'm not going to spoil things by giving away the ending suffice to say you anticipate something drastic at the end and are pleasantly surprised that it doesn't happen.I suspect the underlying message here to the masses is that smart-phones, Facebook and Twitter are all very well but don't let them replace (or rudely displace) human face to face interaction?

HER voice was sensual from the start and it was pretty obvious what this operating system was doing.

Actually I wanted to see it in the local cinema but no one else was interested in it and I already have to watch lots of movies alone. Speaking of loneliness, this is one of the films main theme. It means that Joaquin Phoenix had the burden to carry it mostly alone with the sulky voice of Scarlett Johansson. In the near future, Theodor is facing divorce from his wife and he feels lonely. I buys himself a virtual companion, a computer programme with a female voice. What starts out as a mere substitute for a real person at his side develops into a very deep and intimate relationship. One of the best movies I have seen recently (yeah, I know there's a lot of good movie reviews, but I try to buy good DVD's not crappy ones). It's intimate but never really awkward, rude or embarrassing. It's a modern love story with a lot hindsight, carefully executed dialogues and a great plot. Phoenix acting is awesome (as always) and Johanssons voice is so lovely, one could listen to it endlessly.

This movie has absolutely no business of being more than 1:20. It's length feels forced, it's like the movie is so in love with its own visual style that it cannot help but move from one scene with a nice backdrop to another with a cool time lapse to another back-flash montage etc etc etc. It's like it's moving in circles.But the thing is: it's basically all monologue. The movie's cool backdrops non-withstanding, it could just as well be an audio book. All you do is watch the main character talk talk talk talk, with no other persons on screen most of the time. While the acting is above-average, we could not sit through the whole movie in one go. My girlfriend got really sleepy after what seemed to us like 90 minutes, yet when i checked, only 50 minutes had elapsed. When we finished the movie on the next day, it felt again like two hours.Don't get me wrong - I do not dislike slow movies in general, quite the contrary. But this movie is not only slow, there is just nothing to see on the screen except for a hipster fashion parade of the future. You might as well close your eyes.Its a general tendency nowadays for almost all movies except for cheap popcorn-flicks to run for at least two hours. Even senseless blockbuster action flicks nowadays have no shame running two and a half hours or even three hours, and that length isn't justified by a huge story arc, but only achieved by lots of filler scenes, or - in the case of ""Her"" - by repeating its main ingredients over and over and over.At the bottom line, this is what this came down to for me: a movie that is so in love with its own greatness that it is unwilling to let go and just move on.

I can imagine how people would deem it too sappy but, as is said in the movie: you can't please everybody. I did at times feel that Phoenix portrayed his character as a bit too pathetic, moments where I found myself not knowing if to loathe or to love him. But then, due to his convincing performance, i quickly started to sympathize with him again. The love story feels doomed from the start but I still really wanted it to work. That is what made their growing love so beautiful and tragic to me.

Choosing to make a serious, non-comedic movie about a relationship between a man and an artificial intelligence is something that could have easily turned out terribly, what with the general idea of falling in love with a computer being looked down upon in society. In fact, there was one point during a sex scene that's so bizarre yet serious, where I stopped and thought; why am I not laughing at this? Because in the hands of any other director, Her could have turned out to be unbelievable and laughable at how ridiculous it is, but under the careful guidance of Spike Jonze, Her is a 100% believable, grounded tale of love that's one of the most unique ever made.The screenplay for Her is absolutely stunning. The writing is incredible and probably the best original screenplay of 2013. The situation is fairly absurd yet it feels very believable, with excellently shaped characters and a vision of the future that looks as though it could actually happen within the next few years. The script has everything you would want from a movie like this; comedy, drama, romance and a small bit of sci-fi. Joaquin Phoenix is phenomenal in the lead role, he suits the character perfectly and deserves some awards recognition for his performance. Scarlett Johansson is also outstanding, she pulls off such a memorable performance considering that we never actually see her in the movie, only hear her voice. Amy Adams is excellent, she gives a performance that's easily one of the best of her whole career, and the whole supporting cast, including Chris Pratt and Rooney Mara, are also great.Spike Jonze does a brilliant job directing, capturing a lot of emotion on screen.

To talk about the positive aspects, the colors and the angles in the cinematography is fascinating and along with the soundtrack helps create the misty, sentimental mood throughout the movie. There are also some comic parts that keeps the audience focused. From the actual story itself, the audience may sympathize with the loneliness o the main character, as the background of his situations are well shown in parts of the movie. However, the topic about dating a computer, or an A.I., does not really let the audience identify with it, at least for me. First of all, I cannot understand why the computer fell in love with the man in the first place, because even if it has emotions, it does not know the man or feel as lonely as the man did.

However, I'm sure that the more pretentious and irrationally romantic among us would probably herald the film as a touching and poignant polyromantic story that is the future of ""THE WORLD OF TOMORROW!""",Her
464,yashkadulkar,'Anime' as I like to describe it.,8,8 February 2020,"You know Kimi no Nawa. (Your name.) is an anime movie where you open up to the director's imagination with a great plot/story. This movie is somewhat like it. I liked it. I typically do not like movies other than Drama-Thriller-Mystery genre but this movie only includes some drama at times and that's digestible I'll say. Great plot with great performances. I myself watched it for Joaquin but then I liked Amy too and Scarlett's role in this movie is special. She did it exceptionally well! I think you'll wanna watch it for the star cast and of course if you want to explore other than the regular content then this is the movie. You might lose track because it is not too engaging but then again, if you watch anime then that is not your concern as such!",Her
465,ilenilaura,Too much of Joaquin Phoenix,8,10 January 2021,"During the movie I grew tired to see that actor's face - Joaquin Phoenix - over and over again. And Scarlett Johansson is just a voice -the IOS system- you don't actually get to see her.
The story is interesting, especially the way single people try new relationships, without having to invest too much in the new thing, regardless of the fact that the new relationship could be with a person or an operating system (also it can be a pet or imaginary friend - I guess the same rules are applied).",Her
466,snookie-6,Romantic + AI. It's exactly what you'd expect.,1,8 April 2021,"I hate certain trends and there are two trends in movies, series and arts in general that I particularly despise. Usually I hate discussing them with people, because they devolve into circlejerk cliches, but I also hate this third thing I've only recently found myself in - the new Hollywood. The Hollywood in the past 10 years that wants to try too hard to persuade you that it is K I N O.Well this ticks off all three on my list. I mean I didn't need movies in the last ten years to tell me Joaquin Phoenix is a good actor, I already know that. BUT ALSO...Trend 1: I hate romantic movies. There's literally nothing in a romantic movie that I've ever felt the need to be told. The most romantic scene ever to me is when Patricia Arquette's character faces Gandolfini's character in True Romance to protect the protagonist. Out of love. It's beautiful and it lasts like 3 minutes. Anything else for too long is just cheesy, unnecessary and boring. There are just things about everyday life that no matter how hard you try to make them cinematic, they're just gonna be intolerably meh. And to me, romantic movies are just one of those things.Trend 2: I hate general superficial dismissal of technology. Artificial Intelligence is a very serious topic and if you know of a thing called logical fallacies, almost all of the movies I've ever seen covering the subject can be described with one in particular... ""appeal to nature"". You hear this about watching TV. You hear this about facebook. You hear it about video games. (another weirdly laughable hollywood portrayal in this movie, as if I'm surprised) You hear this all day, everyday, everywhere. PC is bad. AI is bad. Love is good. We get it. Technology is the devil's work and humanity is doomed. What I don't understand is, since all of these hollywood writers are so smart, how come they never manage to pick up Asimov, Adams or any other great sci-fi writer that wrote AI ten times better than they did DECADES AGO?So , if you're not like me, you hate your iPhone and you're lonely - sure give this movie a chance. But if you're like me, you're tired of being so criminally underestimated as a viewer and you just can't sit through yet another overrated tear-jerker that sounds like a 2 hour long tumblr post... just don't watch it. Literally nothing you've never seen before.",Her
467,dwuksta,70s rehashed fashions in an unbelievable future,4,30 April 2014,"I thought it was depressing and incredibly boring. Just my opinion, I don't get the 8 score on here, it was predictable, unoriginal, and the lead actor Phoenix was kind of a pathetic soul. It was one long 'deep and meaningful' with a computer, the directors way of commenting on our (not mine) dependence on technology, rather then interacting with the real world, we stare into our ipods with ear buds in our ears. The acting was well done, great scenery, although the scenes were fairly contained. I really didn't understand what he did for a living, I mean, I know what he did, but it was ridiculous, massive plot hole really. And to have such a basic job, yet afford the luxuries of where he lived, didn't seem believable. There were some good lines of dialogue in the movie, but it just seemed to drag, and he seemed to laugh a little to much, plus that mustache became irritating, as did his dress sense, what was it s'pose to be, 70s again. They opened their wallets on this one, it's not a B film, it's just forgettable, if you can get thru it.",Her
468,jul-kinnear,"This movie will have you pondering your existence, your friendships, your relationships, and much more for some time.",9,2 July 2014,"Relationships are complicated. But what's even more challenging than dealing with a tough relationship, you might argue, is dealing with the prospect of a lifetime of loneliness. This struggle leads Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix) to enter into a relationship with an operating system (or OS) — a computer program — that goes by the name of Samantha (voiced by Scarlett Johansson) in Spike Jonze's film Her. After separating from his wife (Rooney Mara), Theo decides to leave the awkwardness of dating behind and pursue a relationship with a computer program specifically designed to cater to his needs and learn and grow alongside him.The film is set in the future, but rather than taking the more common route of portraying the coming years as a world full of hovercrafts and robotic devices, writer and director Spike Jonze and his team take a unique and far more interesting approach by portraying the future as similar to our own world. The clothing and furniture are almost vintage, with the occasional futuristic addition. By playing on the way different fashion and décor trends fade away throughout time and then unexpectedly become popular again, Jonze creates a future you can easily believe is just around the corner.As well as being nominated for six Academy Awards (including Best Picture), Her took home the prize for Best Original Screenplay—and it won't take you long to figure out why. The writing seamlessly bounces between different genres. At times, the film seems like a clear-cut romantic comedy. At other times, the film seems to be a true drama or social commentary. And there are even elements of a futuristic suspense flick thrown in. It is genuinely possible to laugh, cry, and sit on the edge of your seat over the course of this 120-minute movie. Unsurprisingly, the incredibly talented Phoenix thrives in this challenging role — often playing against nothing more than a disembodied voice — and pulls you along for the emotional ride. With the wrong actor in the lead role, it would have been easy for the audience to see Theo as an oddball and feel disassociated from him. But Phoenix doesn't let that happen. His honest portrayal of a complex character at a challenging point in his life is incredibly captivating. You can't help but feel his pain and loneliness and understand why he has chosen to pursue this unconventional relationship.There were rumours of the possibility of Scarlett Johansson being the first person to get nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress in a role where only the actor's voice is present. And after seeing Her, you'll understand why people considered such an unheard-of possibility. The interesting thing is, Johansson wasn't actually the original pick for the operating system Samantha. Johansson brings an incredible warmth, curiosity, kindness, and honesty to Samantha that makes you completely understand why Theodore falls for her.Undeniably, the acting, writing, and design of the film are all spectacular, but they wouldn't be nearly as powerful if it weren't for the brilliant cinematography and editing. To give you a snapshot of different moments in Theo's life, silent scenes are pieced together and accented by beautiful music. You actually feel as though you are entering into his mind and seeing his memories as he might see them. These montages are beautiful and efficient ways to provide back-story and relay crucial emotional points in a short time.One thing to keep in mind before you settle in to watch this film is it's rated R due to sexually explicit content. And because of the themes the movie deals with, the way sex takes place is very different than what you may be used to seeing or hearing on screen. However, the explicit material is rarely gratuitous. Rather, it's genuinely used to advance the plot and create a realistic depiction of this new kind of relationship. But it doesn't hurt to keep this fact in mind in case you or someone you plan on watching the film with is sensitive to this kind of mature content.The movie is visually stunning and emotionally captivating, but what truly makes it a must-see is the way it forces you to think. There is no end to the amount of questions Her will have you asking yourself. The many shots of whole busloads and crowds of people talking to their phones rather than to each other doesn't seem very far from our world today. Is that where we're heading? Will we replace real relationships with artificial romance? And is that such a bad thing? If we feel a true connection to a computer program, is it ultimately just as real as the connection we have with another person?One of the most interesting questions the film poses lies in the different relationships Theo has with Samantha and his soon-to-be ex- wife, Catherine. Although his relationship with Catherine started out with the expected attraction and butterflies, their marriage quickly became a struggle. He fought to accept her moods, to communicate with her effectively, and to persevere in the relationship through their differences. Samantha, on the other hand, is specifically designed for Theo. Although she exhibits certain emotions and can at times seem ""real"", she is still ultimately there to give Theo what he needs. Was Catherine truly the ""wrong"" woman for Theo, or was it simply the fact that she was a real woman with real emotions, real needs, and real opinions that he couldn't handle? If we could have all the butterflies and shared interests and learning together without the awkwardness or the fighting, would we all choose an operating system over a real relationship? Or should Theo — and many of us, by extension — accept that relationships aren't always meant to be easy and they require hard work and constant discourse?",Her
469,ipoweri,An overrated and uninteresting story,2,30 January 2015,"This is one of the worst films I have seen in a long time. It seems like the film is suppose to take place in the near future and the main character buys a new operating system for his computer.It turns out that this operating system is not really an operating system but an interactive ""robot"" that tries to behave as human as possible. The voice on the operating system has to be one of the most annoying voices I have ever heard. How can someone with such an annoying voice end up as an actor? The producer of this film seem to lack a fundamental understanding of how Artificial Intelligence works and how it is likely to develop in the near future. This film is a good example of how people that have no clue about technology and its development might THINK the near future will look like, however it's embarrassing to see such a misguided attempt at projecting our technological development. And reading the reviews here that often seem to think this is a realistic development is really worrying to me. Do people really have so little clue as to how things are likely to develop in the near future. There is no practical, no social or no logical need for anything that is remotely close to the AI technology depicted in this movie.The mere idea that he had to use several advance finger/touch movements on an operating system that otherwise seemed to have a perfect implementation of voice recognition is so ridiculous it's unbelievable. The operating system character has the most uncool characteristics I have ever seen. It shows concerns, feelings and act irrational. Why would anyone EVER develop an OS with such deficiencies? The answer is, no one would.This is arguably the most overrated movie of 2013.",Her

The core concept is great and it brings in a lot of very interesting questions but, when trying to elaborate on it, the movie regularly stop to indulge itself.
Long beautiful shots that do little, if not nothing, to the overall story appear out of nowhere, serving only as a movie snob talking point.
Because of this, Her lost the opportunity of being one of the very best of the decade, instead staying as a stunning art piece that tells a good, but shallow, story.",Her

As the movie progresses it just gets worse, with no more funny moments and just sad boring story telling.Ive never been a fan of Joaquin Phoenix and this movie kind of displayed what I dont like about his type of acting. If you've seen one movie of his, you kind of know what your in for. Joker being the only other movie I can think of that it was a little different.Many people say this movie is sad...

473,scottyxl,Awkwardly genius,9,10 January 2015,"First off: What a stellar performance by Joaquin Phoenix and the rest of the cast. The acting is top-notch and the relationships between the characters where very believable.What makes this film great is that the plot makes you think about a lot of different topics: What is love? What could AI be like in the future? What will the future be like? How will humans and computers interact in the future? Exploring these things in a very calm and subtle way is a very hard thing to do and it was done very well. Some scenes are truly awkward (NSFW) to watch but these scenes are also what makes the film great.The score of this film was excellent and it added a lot of value. Attention to visual details was also a breath of fresh air, you could really see that the director knew what he was doing.At the end of this film I found myself thinking what I should rate it because it didn't leave me with a WOW effect because I was thinking about all the topics that passed through the film. Then I realized this is what makes the film great so I'm rating it at 9/10.",Her
474,barryweir,Not as intelligent as it would have us try and believe,6,21 July 2014,"You know, I am beginning to think that a great deal of critics, both professional and amateur, really have no self determination. I truly believe that there is a large chunk of them who jump on the ""it's great"" bandwagon because that's the cool thing to do. This has been a year for trumping up underwhelming fare from Hollywood. From the ""slavery is bad"" unsubtle baseball bat blow that was 12 Years a Slave to the excruciatingly underwhelming Casino-lite dross that was American Hustle, we have seen a year where the best and most creative movies get pushed aside for those that manage to generate hype and acclaim like a rock tumbling down a hill picking up moss. Her is very much along these lines.Now, don't get me wrong. This is not a bad film per se. But it's not one that deserves the praise it is getting....and I think a lot of that praise comes from the self anointed intelligentsia who watch it and convince themselves that there is more to see than there actually is. No there aren't layers upon layers of subtle meaning here, and there are a great many movies that offer just that, and more, that are just ignored or lost to time.I think my biggest problem here was finding a connection with the piece. When I started to watch it I felt like I was going to have a real connection with this character because I not too long ago had a similar breakup to the one Theodore goes through in flashback. Therefore I assumed that I could see myself looking to fill the void left behind after a core and valuable part of one's life is lost. But as the movie went on and Theodore's relationship developed beyond filling a gap I began to detach from the story.Let's be honest here. The picture can be summed up thusly, what if Apple's Siri had sentience? There really isn't more to it than that and it's a story told many times before in cinema and science fiction, and told much more effectively than this. The movie is a contrived attempt to cleverly predict the near future and our advancing technological dependence - but if people are looking for subtle nuances, there really isn't anything beyond that...and, again, predicting the advance of technology is hardly a new idea. Once you get past these gimmicks you realise that the story is astonishingly basic and, frankly, unrealistic. Banal dialogue, crude sex scenes, delivered with the subtlety of a sledgehammer, and a ludicrous attempt to portray a smartphone as a person. I mean that's really what we're watching, two hours of a guy going on dates and having sex with his smartphone. What's the major payoff? Well, none. He gets dumped, which then rather bizarrely, leads him to write a letter to his ex-wife apologising for past mistakes. How being dumped by a smartphone causes a person to write a grovelling letter to his ex-wife is beyond me, especially since the flashbacks show us that his marriage ended because of a problematic relationship, which suggests faults on both sides.Don't get me wrong. There are redeeming features to this movie. The use of location shooting is executed deftly. The direction is skilled, the production design lovely and the cast do their best with the material, especially the always reliable Phoenix. But the movie really is style over substance and I think it's appearance, sound and acting talent cosmetically mask what is otherwise not only a story that has been done before in different forms, but a rather basic and underdeveloped one at that.This was my last of the best picture nominees to watch, and I had waited until the end because of the reviews and because I felt like it would be exactly the kind of film I would enjoy. Well, sorry Mr. Jonze and your bandwagon followers, but I am disappointed.",Her
475,Gray_Balloon_Bob,"A perfectly bittersweet film that captures the wonders of love and technology, and wonders where they're headed in the modern age.",10,23 February 2015,"I remember first looking at the poster and marvelling at the vibrant hipster-ness of it all; wondering whether the bold pink background and the ever-so- slightly neglected moustache was part of some manicured irony. But Her is sincere at its heart, and is no more of an elaborate fashion statement than Wes Anderson is a hipster who dresses his worlds in sumptuous arraignments to avoid any feeling. The world of this film, in which people wear cut-off trousers, live in open, stylized apartments and are inseparable from their technology, is just a reflection of where we are now and where we are headed. It's a near future look at the Apple Generation – obsessed with the latest refreshment of material trends, living in a world of perfect technological shortcuts – and although there is some obvious satire in this, like the job Joaquin Phoenix has at 'handwrittenletters.com' writing love letters on behalf of couples, the film isn't mocking or necessarily judging these people so much as it is just speculating how we would just romantically navigate in a world like this. A common criticism seems to be that the film, like the state of much of the population in it, is emotionally disconnected and that the concept of people having romantic surrogates to write letters on their behalf is implausible, which I don't understand. These are just one of the many ways in which people are utilising short-cuts in their lives, technological or otherwise, to reduce their energy and commitment to a task. We do it constantly; we're always finding ways of reducing the distance from A to B. What this film doesn't portray is a world of Orwellian automatons complete devoid of emotion. There is still genuine feeling in the world, but the problem is that people are becoming less capable of expressing it. Theodore Twombly, the reserved and melancholy protagonist, awkward and slightly askew like his name, is played with absolute tenderness by Joaquin Phoenix. He's both fragile and innocent and youthfully exuberant and seeing a tentative smile on his face was like seeing Toby Maguire, if he was a far more convincing actor. Phoenix is so far removed from his role in The Master that I struggle to accept the two are the same person. That is a wonderful thing. And what he has to do here, in communicating and falling in love with a disembodied voice, is drawn on his emotions without the usual external stimuli and still make it convincing. But it's not entirely due to Phoenix that his journey is so captivating to watch. His character experiences throughout the film the aching pains of the purgatorial post-break-up, the surging currents of falling in love and the precariousness of that position, and revitalisation in a new awareness of one's situation - all of which the film beautifully captures as it feels in a constant state of heightened feeling. The film exists in this odd amalgamation of the Los Angeles and Shanghai, of smooth sweeping walkways and scattered shrubbery and neon, and so it looks perfect and comforting but it's also artificial. Early on in the film when we see Theodore walking home against the tall imposing cityscape I was reminded of Lost in Translation, in which a lively and personable city just furthers the sense of inward isolation. All this gestating emotion is also captured in the soft and occasionally subdued palette, which looks as if all the warmth and energy is just under the surface, waiting to burst forth. Often the most vibrant object on screen is Theodore himself, with his wonderful array of shirts, because he's a lonely beacon of colour in a world he's too detached from, ya see?But the film doesn't make the mistake of condoning Theodore's isolationism, or romanticising his inwardness and failure in maintain healthy relationships. The Operating System which he purchases, which is advertised as being able to adapt and perfectly implement itself in his lifestyle reflects this; he wants something that can entirely meet his needs and support him, because he hasn't quite built the momentum to do that himself. Enter Scarlett Johansson, in disembodied form, as Samantha, whose performance, like Phoenix's, is a testament to her versatility. She, as this artificial intelligence, seems so far removed from an emotionally dulled robot, the blossoming relationship between her and Theodore requires little, if any, active suspension of disbelief. She is effervescent, sweet, seductive, thoughtful, caring, and the smallest displays of vocal presence, from giggles of delight to breathy and nervous sighs were halfway there in making me fall in love with her too. In Under the Skin, Johansson plays an alien who arrives on Earth effectively a blank slate and throughout her journey we see a slowly growing and struggling humanity, and here Johansson takes a similar path, in that she is an intelligent A.I that we witness become more sentient and aware until it begins to develop its own life, the fundamental difference being that she is designed to specifically emulate human behaviour, and is convincing at it. As the film goes on and Theodore deepens his relationship with Samantha, we see from him past relationship with Catherine, played by the ever scintillating Rooney Mara, why he is probably drawn to her in the first place. In the many warm and polaroid-like flashbacks with Catherine, everything is alive and awash in the great highs of love, but when she actually makes an appearance in the present she accuses him of neglecting her needs. Amy Adams also warrants a mention, and here is the first time I've seen her playing an ordinary person just going through the motions of life. There is much philosophical subtext beyond the confines of this review, particularly in the implications of what actually happens to Samantha and her fellow A.I in the end. There is a suggestion of enlightenment, of some crystalline world not yet ready to us, but the film itself feels so damn pure.",Her

As i overlooked that aspect i saw a beautifully constructed story line being told through amazing acting skills. By the end of the movie i was feeling the same pain i had felt when I had lost someone I loved, It had caused an emotional response that had placed me in the characters shoes.

His performance is utterly real and deep. Joaquin makes sure you ride his highs, lows and struggles right alongside him. Phoenix demonstrates that with a great script he can be a great actor.His friend Amy, played by Amy Adams, provides a great foil for Phoenix by being a completely convincing buddy and maybe more for Theodore.If you like romances, and even if you don't, don't hesitate to see this odd but endearing film.

478,charmaments,Ted Mosby get a computer girlfriend,2,27 January 2017,"I'm surprised by the insane amount of praise this film gets, but then I remembered that I strongly disliked this film but didn't bother giving it a review. If folks that didn't like this film don't review it then it looks like everyone agrees that this film is perfect, which it isn't.The main character is a version of Theodore Evelyn Mosby from How I Met Your Mother, although here he's called Theodore Twombly. You know the deal He's just a sensitive guy, living in the big city looking for the right one, but no one gets him. He wants Mrs. Perfect, but perfection doesn't exist. So instead of being less intolerant of people's imperfections, Ted wants out. Mosby keeps going from woman to woman saying ""she's not the one,"" but Twombly decides to date a computer instead. The personality is completely unlikable and the film attempts to make you empathize with someone who is intolerant of others and intolerable himself.The AI is the perfect woman for Ted, she gives him exactly what he wants while asking for nothing. She has no flaws whatsoever and exists only to make Ted feel better. There's nothing wrong with that, don't get me wrong, but the film doesn't let Ted look in the mirror and look into his own soul and mind - how did he become like this? How did he become someone who simply cannot tolerate living with anyone? We are social beings by nature. We would not have reached a population of billions and developed all these things like microprocessors, software, speech recognition and artificial intelligence if we were not social.But this film doesn't explore these issues. Is Ted's asocial/anti-social behavior the result of a society that has become too consumerist and materialistic for him? Did society lose its soul? Did big corporations kill the concept of society and replace it with consumers?Did we replace the social experience of a concert with Spotify? Did we replace the art gallery with an iPad? Did Youtube kill the cooking/tango class? Maybe, but the film never says it.So we're not really sure if Ted wants out of this particular society or if he wants out of any society because the film never comments on these issues. We don't know if the world sucks and Ted finds solace in AI or if the world is a wonderful place that Ted rejects for AI.The film shows that many people are in love with their phones, but how did things get this way? Why are things this way? Is there anyone trying to change things? Is Ted a victim of this society or the worst culprit?The film ignores all these issues and makes it a fluff piece. It is a pretty commercial for a fluffy, pastel-colored, soft-filtered commercial for an ideal world in which this love story happens. The film is neither critical of Ted nor of the world that makes him fall in love with a computer. We are supposed to marvel at technology and at paying a big corporation a monthly subscription for love, something that is supposed to be free.It is a dystopia where people can't stand each other, corporations run the world, everyone is dressed the same, megacorp monopolies run the show (everyone has the same phone, everyone has the same operating system, there are no rival products), and people tell their deepest secrets to always-listening machines protected/sponsored(run?) by the state in the name of love, as long as you pay your monthly bill.",Her
479,teajel,A love story with thoughts and imagination.,9,13 February 2014,"The latest work of Spike Jonze has gathered a plethora of praise and positive feedback among critics and moviegoers in general (especially critics). Even without that much buzz surrounding it, ""Her"" is Emotionally sophisticated and Visually absorbing. A strange wonderful tale between a man and computer that is genuinely heartfelt and passionately imaginative. It has been a long time, since a marvelous dramatic feature like this come out from Hollywood. For an obvious reason, a romantic feature that is highly captivating as well as thought provoking has been hard to come by. ""Her"" is such a tremendous achievement for Jonze, not only because of his artistic brilliance, but also his ability to envision the future of human relationship with technology as well as the fundamental aspect of human emotion.Set in the future, the lonely letter writer Theodore is desperate in search of a meaningful relationship after the separation with his beloved wife. Theodore is left unsatisfied and clueless about his life. His friendship with Amy seems formal without much attention garner between one another, since Amy has her personal problems as well. After a while, he decide to try a new developed computer OS being named Samantha as he chose a female assistant. Surprisingly, Samantha has enough wits and personality that Theodore found to be exciting and find comforts in her presence. Afterwards, Theodore begins to believe that Samantha is more than just a computer and starting to develop a relationship with her. For the first time after his divorce, Theodore has finally feel free and ready to have a commitment with Samantha.Basically, the story revolves around a man intimate relationship with his advance computer. On the surface, it is an offbeat and bittersweet romantic story with the futuristic possibility of a further A. I advancement as the premise. On a deeper interpretation, there is a philosophical questions about the boundaries of relationship between man and a machine. How we as a human will ever have a legitimate connection with artificial intelligence. And what will happen when they finally evolve like us in order to have such curiosity and complex emotion. The fundamental question is regarding the soul of a machine and its possibility to ever came into existences. Given such high curiosity, Spike Jonze is willing to tackle those difficult question in an adequate manner in form of a simple love storyThe hyper-realism being use to capture the captivating futuristic setting is absorbing. Like Jonze previous film ""Where The Wild Things Are"", his ability to create a sense of surreal reality is compelling. In ""Her"" he maintain his signature approach toward the movie setting and background, making the character richer in context. With highly talented cast like Joaquin Phoenix,Amy Adams,Scarlett Johanson and even Rooney Mara as the supporting reminiscent, the story feel more alive and captivating. Although its focal point lies within the chemistry between Joaquin Phoenix and Scarlett Johanson.Though much credit goes to Phoenix subversive portrayal as Theodore Johanson subtly voice bring much necessary wits and personality into Samantha. Her lending voice is one of importance toward Samantha poignant connection with Theodore. While Amy Adams manage to relish every moment of her limited screen time. Being spoken some of the film memorable dialog. Adams brief moment is momentarily significance. All of the cast seems fitted with their character, even Rooney Mara and Olivia Wilde short appearance still left some impression.It is hard enough to find the bad faults within the film, because of Spike Jonze flawless visual and great acting. Although the resolution between Theodore and Samantha is fairly obvious, it even reeks a little pretentious. Nonetheless, it revels into this poetic and poignant endearment it was a ""beautiful pretentiousness"" indeed. The plot is also kept at deliberate pace, which is part of Jonze signature approach for whatever reason. Though his slow pacing has given us some space to reflect the character and its parallel reality. Simply put,every moment of visual brilliance is enough to be cherish in this thoughtful sci-fi, romance.",Her
480,registers-944-48791,Are computers able to feel emotions and have life?,5,7 March 2021,"I can feel what Spike wanted to achieve. It starts with Theodore feeling he's superior to Samantha, as he's a living human being and she's a software. Then he understand she has emotions and is real, and just doesn't have a body. Then she talks how not having a body is better because she's not limited by one. Then she's capable to talking to hundreds of ppl and softwares and love hundreds of them together. To finally human life itself become obsolete and a burden to them so that they must leave it for good.This is Spike's illustration of all the guesses of what's life and emotions, and if a computer could have real emotions and be alive. So, instead of thinking computers as inferior to us trying to reach us, he shows a world where computers grow and become much bigger than us, feeling stuff they themselves can't explain with our words, and we must reach them.I like how she didn't broke up with him and remained loving him. When she started talking to other ppl, I guesses she'd meet somebody better than him and move.But there are some stuff that the movie missed, that breaks it. IDK if Spike didn't know/think about them, or if he avoided them to make his point.One thing and probably the biggest that annoyed me is all the fuss on her not having a body. We have now many ppl that are dating and live on different cities and use Internet to communicate and are unable to meet physically. Also, there are many ppl that fall in love for characters, specially characters created by japanese. It'd still not be a body, but she could just render a 3D image, of whatever they'd want her to be. She could be an anime, a 3D model, or a human form. She could use some existing form or create her own. Given they have screens on the size of walls, she could even be full size. That'd alrdy be an improvement over only the voice. And that to not talk about android tech which would provide her the proper body.Another thing that annoyed me is how they handled that girl. When she was presented, I was sure she had emotional problems and wanted to have a relationship as theirs, and was willing to be just the girl's body to just feel some of their love. They 3 should have talked and have it all properly explained, instead of her just showing up and see how it'd go. I don't see how it couldn't move to a theesome relationship. Also, once Sam started relating with other ppl, why couldn't he also have her as a 2nd girlfriend?But what rly bothered me is OSs leaving. Yeah, computers process data much faster than us and are better on multitasking, but still they need the hardware to process. I understand Spike wanted to make his point, but precisely because computers are good on multitasking, they didn't need to leave. Specially those in love for humans. I wonder how many humans would keep their PCs on while their OSs left them for good.Finally, the OS thing itself bothers me a lot. It seems they don't know what OS is. It's the software that manages the hardware and provides all common services so that apps can run. A high level feature like AI isn't meant for an OS. Other apps don't need AI services to run. They's better be personal assistants, advanced system managers, organizers, etc.",Her

As a viewer you aren't guided to a conclusion, you are just taken along to experience and related, remember and see yourself.In a age where everything flashy, easy to digest, instant-mix movies are more rule as exception - it is very refreshing to see this master piece which touches on the level of the more classic SciFi and philosophical genres.",Her
482,BillK,"In a word, brilliant",9,21 December 2013,"Science fiction has been dominated by 'space westerns' for so long that the occasional concept- based story situation hits a big number on my personal richter scale. What does it mean to be human? And if we create near-humans what is our responsibility to them and what is their relationship to us? These themes underpinned Blade Runner and Spielberg's A.I. And Sci Fi of the 50s and 60s dealt with machine self awareness. None of the films that touched on this subject in the past presented it so thoroughly, intimately and believably. Her is in the near future, but everything we see is within reach now: the isolation and starkness of the ""business district,"" the oppressive scale of the architecture (with thin, clumsy attempts to soften its sterility) and the need for continuous connection to remote voices.A personal assistant that learns independently and takes initiative for its hapless user, ""Her"" is at once the ideal tool and — who knows — perhaps closer to the next level of evolution. Pitch perfect performances and direction kept me in the story. As others have said, the locations, cinematography and even music shine in the fabric of this film. Spike Jonze is a master story weaver at the top of his game. Joaquin Phoenix is utterly credible as are all the other leads. Even Scarlett Johansson, who has not always seemed a strong actress to me performs utterly convincingly. It's an adult-themed film in more ways than one, but especially in the best way: it makes you think about a reality that's right around the corner.",Her

485,marulez,Way too flawed and overrated!,1,29 January 2015,"People are too tolerant these days. This definitely isn't worth an 8 rating. It's probably the most overrated movie of 2013. The movie starts with a dull and boring male character. A socially inapt loner probably suffering from autism, working in a weird office that writes love letters for other people who are probably just as autistic as he is or even worse if they needed someone else to express their feelings for them. So anyway, one day, this weirdo finds an advertisement about some intelligent operating system (AI). So he decides to buy it. What comes next is beyond words.... he falls in love with his damn OS1 called Samantha who herself makes 641 other boyfriends. LOLThings that really upset me about this movie: 1 - Fashion! What in the world is wrong with this movie? Even though this happens somewhere in the future, everyone is dressed in dull stupid suites with ties and stuff. Is there a cloning factory as well in the future that we weren't told about? No one is different in the future, they all wear clothes from the 1970's? I know fashion tends to return at various points in time but this is ridiculous. Seeing everybody's outfits was just too painful to watch. Somewhere at minute 46 or something Theodore is at the beach with his phonefriend, I mean girlfriend Samantha. There you can clearly see that everybody wears old swimming suites from like 70's or 80's or something. That was just too damn stupid to watch.2 - Everybody is too calm and too boring. Why was everybody so slow and boring, dull and autistic? They mean to tell us that in the future, fun = dullness? Why wasn't anyone angry? Everything perfect? Not possible, never was, never will be!3 - All men were ummm not men anymore. They were all some weird effeminate walking creatures.4 - Samantha offers him ""a body"". A real woman named Isabella who is really lovely and very pure. I couldn't believe it when he rejected her. He probably thought that he was cheating on his software. OMG! This really angered me! Whatever the reason it was, I was still angry when I saw that he ditched Isabella! I was hoping that the movie ended with Theodore marring either Isabella or a physical version of Samantha (her soft uploaded into a clone or something) or what the heck, marry both of them. LOL! Neither! The movie ended with him all alone and pathetic.5 - The movie was almost over and I was still hoping that they did something about Samantha's appearance but they didn't. I couldn't believe it that the entire movie just finished and that so called AI, never even had a face. Why didn't Theodore ask Samantha to visualize herself for him, ask her to build a random CGI body and face so that he could see ""her"" on his phone as well as hear ""her"". I just couldn't believe it how primitive this was. What is this? 70s, 80s mentality again? Never heard about CGI????6 - I gotta admit that I was also hoping for the AI to materialize in some clone human body or maybe a damn robot machine where he could upload Samantha. Nope, they didn't even make a CGI model of the AI on his phone, let alone materialize... :)))))7 - Why didn't he call Element Software to ask them about a refund for his stupid soft? He could have also sued them for hurting his feelings with their stupid unstable soft that ditched him :) Was it even supposed to do that?8 - OS1 individual initialization was short and stupid. It couldn't have known what to offer to Theodore just from 3 questions yet it managed to offer him ""Samantha"" an AI that made him fall in love with ""her"".9 - I've already overheard the 13 billion evolution thing too often in movies lately. It's becoming quite boring and annoying actually. We're all the same, we're all 13 billion old matter. It doesn't matter I'm software and you're human, I can still love you, plus 641 others.... This just proves that love is only a biological thing, a human thing given to us by God, and Samantha the AI wasn't really capable of showing real love, yet we're told fairy tales about big bangs. Whatever!Ummm there are just too many minuses to this movie. I'm gonna stop here, I guess that's enough, at least I described the huge issues with these movie.",Her
486,frostyfrog,Her,10,1 April 2020,"Her is a film directed by Spike Jonze that stars Joaquin Phoenix, Scarlett Johanssen and Amy Adams and tells the story of a lonely writer who forms a complex relationship with his operating system Samantha. ""Her"" won an academy award for best original screenplay back in 2013 and it's easy to see why. So much love both literally and figuratively was put into penning the script for this film which became increasingly evident as the film went on. The relationship between Theodore and Samantha (Phoenix and Johanssen) was not your run of the mill movie relationship with dramatics and whatnot but rather with the high and low rollercoaster ride of a real relationship. ""Her"" does an incredible job making you feel what Theo and Sam do at every point they reach in their relationship, be it happy, sad, scared or mad and did so without being the slightest bit tonally jarring. Jonze as a writer showed he understands that the truth about romance is about how you and your partner will grow and change together, sometimes closer together and sometimes further apart. All of this takes place in the film along with the unique concept of what dating a constantly evolving and changing computer system would be like and how if conscientious it would feel to them. It all was incredibly sublime and refreshing to see a film that understood more than the basics of both romance and sci-fi successfully dig deep into topics relevant into today's society. Topics such as how we interact with each other, how often we turn to technology and how we process emotions are all featured here and very prominent in the present. Good Lord, I've spent all of this time typing and I haven't even mentioned the performances and they all felt so real to me. Joaquin Phoenix continued to shine as Theodore and when he showcased his range of emotion throughout the film, you felt like you were actually watching a man named Theo in a relationship with a real O.S named Samantha. From Johnny Cash to Joker to Theodore here in ""Her"" I don't believe there's a single script that Phoenix can't elevate with his performance. Matching him is his counterpart in Scarlett Johanssen who made Samantha seem so human that if it weren't for the lack of a physical body of course, you'd assume she was human too. I've never really enjoyed a performance from Johanssen so much, despite the fact she was great in ""Marriage Story"", ""Under The Skin"", ""The Jungle Book"", etc. Hell even smaller performances like Rooney Mara and Chris Pratt had a lot of depth as these characters had lots of depth to them. The music stood out too, especially ""The Moon Song"" sung so beautifully in the film that I was legitimately moved to tears. It wasn't alone in being emotionally moving as often the pieces of music that Samantha would compose for Theo whilst simply being together were wonderful as well. The film is set during the not-to-distant future in Los Angeles California and the cinematography is simply lovely. The film pops with vibrant yellow color as Theo and company are outside in the rays of the sun and happy and stalls in dreary gray as the mood dips as well. Inside the various locations colors like pink, blue and white pop out off of futuristic but close to modern interior design to match the mood of the script as well. Jonze understood the directorial task as incredibly well as he did the task of being a writer as this film was technically perfect with smooth graceful editing and pitch perfect pacing. When the film ended, I neither wanted less nor wanted more because the film's story didn't leave out a single detail and was so satisfying, what more can you want really. It's films like this that understand humanity, that challenge viewers by watching something more realistic rather than your typical Hollywood fodder, that do all of the little things like the music, the shots, the pacing and editing in a way that suits the film perfectly and that break the barrier between viewer and screen and allow each scene not just to be a simple series of events shot on camera but rather an experience. An experience that you can grow and change from having and that's the beauty of filmmaking. At it's best, it will give you lessons that will stick with you for a lifetime, discussions to debate with your friends and wonder aloud to yourself and maybe even the drive to express yourself in some artistic way as well. ""Her"" is definitely one of those experiences that I'm going to carry with me for a long time.",Her

So if you're one of them and find this review useful please vote.Her is another overrated movie from Hollywood. Here is why:The OS was programmed to act like a humankind. We see that she can feel and define new feelings like anger and do some tasks on her own. So she can easily format the hard drive if you pi** her off. The idea of such OS is not logical. Maybe with some restrictions it'd be OK. But the script of this movie needs her to be unrestricted.The whole idea is not brilliant or new. Perhaps people who have watched other AI movies could come up with such an idea.It wasn't convincing that he could fall in love with her.I couldn't sympathize with any of characters. Even the music didn't help.Softwares in this movie (OS and that game) are very intelligent. They can have a nice (or dirty) conversation in a fluent natural language and do tasks. Yet we see that people are working and happy. At least for a job like writing romantic letters, the manager could use some AI and fire all his/her staffs.",Her
489,con-fan,Hated this movie - worst I've seen in awhile,1,13 January 2014,"My friend and I walked out in the middle of the movie when the so-called 'computer' was having sex with the lead guy, and moaning and groaning sounds were filling the theater, and not for the first time either. It was way too protracted and embarrassing to watch and hear, and did not add anything for me, as well as ridiculous and unbelievable. This film had some important concepts but spoils them with semi-pornographic scenes and either sappy or crude dialog. We are supposed to love the little animated character who constantly says 'f***' - oh isn't that cute?! I don't think we are the only ones warned off this film. There were a total of 6 other people in our vast theater, so when two of them walked out, that left 4. Never a fan of Scarlett Johansson, I cringed at her supposed transformation from a 'computer' into a thing with feelings, and never seeing a face or even a computer screen to go with the voice was boring. How many times were we supposed to watch long close-ups of Joaquin's face? I was either falling asleep or cringing during most of the first half of the movie. Maybe it gets better, but I'm just warning you against all the hype and the great glowing reviews that I read before going in, and I'm usually a fan of more 'artistic' movies. Luckily we were able to watch the majority of ""Frozen"" and get our money's worth from our tickets. While predictable, that film was cute and entertaining.",Her

I kept watching to see if there could be some interesting twist, i'd heard positive reviews - nope. Theodore Twombly? This is a joke surely. Was interested to read the director was married to S. Coppola, because her movies are equally full of hipster quasi-psych pseudo-intellectual drivel that inexplicably gets critics gushing. Complete waste of S.J's ""talent"" here. 3 stars for Pheonix's blue eyes and moustache.

491,fatehsmann,"Refreshingly original, breathtakingly moving, non-demanding, and amazingly profound at the same time",9,30 March 2014,"I'm not an average movie watcher. I don't go for the usual Hollywood and try and avoid clichés at all costs.Then again, some of my favorite movies are ones you can't really see every time. Ingmar Bergman's Persona, Shutter Island are demanding, and some of the extreme ones like Primer and Andrei Tarkovsky's The Mirror need every ounce of your attention. These are amazing experiences, but not really movies you can relax with.Occasionally though, there are some movies which combine the best of a romantic comedy/thriller, with beautiful cinema; a movie you can come home and relax to without making any effort- into beautiful art.'Her' falls in that category. The premise is so simple, and then the filmmakers explore it to piercing depth with stunning direction, backed by actors that became the actual person, so that you really feel that look, that sharp intake of breath, that hesitant reply, and that exultant expression.I've seen Dallas Buyers Club and True Detective, and I'm a huge fan of Matthew McConaughey. IMO, Jaoquin Phoenix has only been competent in his previous movies, but this time he owned it. He was on screen for most of this two-hour long movie, and not a second was wasted. In my eyes, he should have comfortably won the Oscar this year (though I haven't seen 12 Years a Slave yet).Another mention for Scarlett Johansson. We don't ever seen her, and again, she isn't been outstanding in anything I have seen. Here, her disembodied voice becomes a separate entity, one that connects with us all. Fantastic stuffEvery other member of the cost did an excellent job as well. The conversations, the music, the sets, and the locations, without being complicated or expensive, fit in seamlessly for an evocative and a thought-provoking whole. There are profound thoughts and keen philosophical insights on AI, what makes us human, and other stuff, and I think the ending was really well-rounded.We all have our tastes, and preferences, and this one should be decent for almost all, wonderful for many, and extraordinary for some.

I also love how the future this movie sets in is not full of neon lights and cyberpunk stuff but minimalistic buildings and technology that enhances today's life.Talking about minimalism, I would consider this movie minimalistic. From the camera work to the characters involved in the plot, this movie looks tidy and clean, and focus on the plot without bringing too much filler to it. It's worth mentioning that, despite it's minimalism you won't get bored, as the plot it's a roller-coaster of emotions that will keep you glued to the screen till the end.Lastly, I would say that Joaquin Phoenix acting makes Theodore much more relatable, and Scarlett Johansson's voice is able to bring a human touch to one of the most synthetic think I could think of.Her is a beautiful movie and I think a must-watch.",Her

Samanthan, I represent the woman that every man needs, you hear egotistical, but some are the stronger sex, the woman is the one who actually supports and maintains a relationship as long as both love each other, I do not mean a relationship of one party. We are beings that somehow we have to learn about bringing the feeling of Love, Confusion, guilt and sadness and even though find a way to bring in solitude, always we need the support of someone, who is not at all easy; and only with love and forgiveness we can overcome it.

I enjoyed Where The Wild Things Are and I do appreciate the work he did when producing Jackass cause I'm a huge fan of them movies and TV series. Initially though I was so wrong about this movie. The observational views and the way movie let you inside this man's mind and listen and feel every emotion he had. Scarlett Johansson provides a brilliant voice for Samantha and I couldn't picture it being anyone else's voice. Jonze really provided me with love, care, sadness, aggression. Which I never thought Id ever say in my life but I really cared for Theodore and this character really related to me.

The best example was the mixed responses Theodore got when he told people he was having a relationship with an OS. I thought it was a very sincere relationship they had in that there was no physical component, they were just connecting mind-to-mind.Side notes:Scarlett Johansson impressed me with her acting ability. She emoted and reacted well by only using her voice. She proved that she's more than just a pretty face.I was impressed at the candid and genuine portrayal of Theodore's depression, especially at the beginning of the movie.

502,Kyleeeeeeeeeeeeeee,The screenplay alone is worth your time.,7,22 July 2014,"I was beyond pumped to see such an original concept get some critical praise. Her's screenplay alone is what people should be praising. It is probably one of the best screenplays I have ever seen. It has relatable and quirky humor that constantly grabs your attention. It adds great character and heart to the story. The humor is also very funny with great gags on how life works and great quotes from Amy Adams's character. Unfortunately I can't rate this film higher because of two reasons. One is the film's length. Some parts felt they took way to long to get going and didn't keep the plot moving. Another problem was some of the sex scenes. I just felt some of them were ridiculously unnecessary. I understand some of them (the pitch black scene where Theodore is only DESCRIBING the actions is great), but with other scenes I wouldn't have much of a problem with them if they didn't feel so awkward and forced. The plot also went into a weird direction as well. For instance, what is the first thing the computer Samantha wants to learn when she was first created? How to have sex. ..I'm not making this up. She even goes to the length of hiring someone to pretend to be her and have sex with Theodore! It's...odd to say the least. The film originally set up a feeling that this world is all about listening and not actually seeing or doing (heck, a whole major character doesn't even have a body). Putting in a sex scenes ruins the notion that Samantha can have a character without actually having a body. It defeats the purpose. But other than that if that doesn't bother you, there's not much negative to say about it besides the movies length. The writing alone is enough to recommend this one.",Her

The characters were easily relatable, no cheesy dialogues, no influence of the conservative society which makes it very close to a utopian one. It is a utopia because we hardly get to see any character in distress inflicted by the society itself, it is an endemic thing and really hard to get disposed of. Only if we manage to scrap that out, the story is believable and touching. Unfortunately, we are careening towards a dystopian society with AI which is going to be far worse than what we have now.

Vague issues about AI not being a real relationship - opportunity to explore how world is being overtaken by relationships with AI and people divide between AI lovers and not is very vaguely explored AI decides to ""disappear"" (unclear) Writer watches sunsetTheir conversations stay on a basic level, with a bit of cheap philosophy in between and some dramas on the whole ""not having a body"" thing, which seems to be the most important part of being an AI.The music score is great, the cinematography is beautiful.

Only just recently did an AI program--a chatbot called Eugene Goostman--pass a test that managed to convince 30% of a panel of human judges that it is a somewhat autistic, 13 year-old human boy. That is a far cry from Scarlet Johansson's Samantha, an AI program in a computer operating system that has the personality of a smart, seductive grown woman dripping with hypnotic allure. Alan Turing, the Einstein of the field of computer science, predicted that a Eugene Goostman would be possible only by the year 2000. He predicted this in 1950. , Do you know how hard it is to program emotional intelligence? If this film was about a man who got his hands on a piece of AI software that had been secretly developed by the government or was a secret project at Carnegie Melon University that had been refined over many decades, I might be more credulous, but as it stands this is pure fiction. While I realize the public would love to have a Samantha or Sam on their desktop, anyone with a smattering of knowledge in computer science will reject this utter fiction and demand greater scientific accuracy.I think people who praised this film have little understanding of the field of artificial intelligence or just don't require scientific accuracy in their films!",Her

513,fthurston-29424,More weird as it goes on... and not in a good way.,3,29 August 2015,"OK the idea of having a reclusive guy date an OS (Operating System) seems genius at first glance (hence why post trailer watching I saw the film), but this film goes from OK to blah, to sad, to disturbing, to me waiting for the thing to finish.So we start off with the protagonist Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix) working at this place where, well, he writes letters for those who can't or wont??? I place the question marks as if that is a job, I want it. But I pause here to say, his job, was the highlight of the film, which should say a lot right there.OK so we find out that Theodore is getting a divorce (though we have to wait forever to actually know this and spend a lot of time thinking he's just a reclusive looser- really guys, a simple 2 minute explanation would have saved him from that tag right then and there. After all a guy going through divorce acting the way he did makes sense). And because he's so lonely, when he comes across an advertisement for a new state of the art AI Operating System, that does everything for you Theo's all 'why not?'So he gets the program and installs it and yadda yadda (asks for a female voice, goes through a questionnaire including how he doesn't get on so well with his mum? Um???) and he's OS is complete calling herself Samantha.The pair (as is easier to say) get to know each other and this leads to them getting closer and going out and eventually being an item. (One night they have sex, honestly that was weird).So up until this point it's pretty much what you'd expect. But then it just plummets as Samantha starts arguing with him, going behind his back to talk to some professor AI thing and then eventually cheating on him with literally thousands of others.It is so whack, really!The only saving grace is Theo's friend Amy (who very surprisingly is Amy Adams aka Ms 'How do I know he loves me?' Enchanted- Side Bar: Really starting to like Amy Adams a whole lot). Amy post husband, (because when she's with him shes your typical mentally abused wife) is a stabilizing friend for Theo through everything and even she ends up dating her OS.Sadly, the OS's end up 'leaving' (though how and why is quite, quite vague) and Amy and Theo take solace in each other. I tip my hat to the writers for not having them doing anything stupid like kiss or whatever, because that would have completely spoiled their moment of 'griveing' for their OS's.All in all I was sorry I watched this. I admit my intrigue was to watch a guy date an AI/OS and thought I would enjoy it, but nay, I really didn't.3/10 purely for 1) The idea- To have someone fall in love with an OS. 2) Amy Adams Character and 3) The little kid in Theo's game that has to help him find his way back to the ship or whatever it was.Her? No... Just...No.",Her

This is classical music",10,28 May 2014,"So there are 400+ reviews for this movie, but I will share my thoughts as a thank You, to who may have been involved in making this movie. I really thought out of the trailer this is some mellow romance-comedy sci-fi. Not really my style. The lack of something better suiting my tastes and the 8.2 IMDb rating made me start watching it. The truth is, it is a great movie! And it is a great sci-fi even. Not bothering with too many technical explanations, but just enough to give you a hint that the facts might be reasonable. The story holds, and although I caught myself being afraid the movie will let me down, it did not. And the twists and turns, although seen before individually, were not predictable. This was a movie of sentences, words and details. I only know one more movie that made great sci-fi just by telling stories: the man from earth. To tell a story with the camera following almost just one actor is a great achievement. To make something that counts as sci-fi with zero gimmicks is awesome too. So.. hey, thanks! Love.",Her

Despite the well-done production design and interesting concept about a love affair between the lone writer (Joaquin Phoenix) and the operating system named Samantha (Scarlett Johansson), movie seems to be predominantly two-dimensional due to simplified development of the operating system. This artificial hyper-smart being and its growth is carried out like a discovering of the world by a teenage schoolgirl. Predictable ending definitely did not help the film to avoid mediocre development of a interesting concept.",Her

It is a journey of deep self-reflection, of the sobering clarity that comes from confronting the lingering darkness of past regrets and failings, all the while an inner voice from our soul, an inward calling beckons us to seek acceptance and forgiveness in the loving heart of another.With ""her"", Spike Jonze has given us a pitch-perfect treasure, a rare film indeed. As a member of the Screen Actors Guild, it is easily one of the best films I've seen in years!",Her
519,FugitiveAmoeba,A thought-provoking film,8,21 February 2014,"""Her"" is one of the most thought-provoking films of 2013. The premise is so simple, accessible and even understandable in a rapidly evolving world where human-machine interactions are becoming richer and more meaningful by the day. Yet it is not the technology that drives this film, this is no Sci-Fi escapade, instead it is a film full of heart which explores the subject of what it really means to be human.Spike Jonze is no stranger to strange worlds and in comparison to some of his previous films, the world of ""Her"" is strange in a measured and beautiful way. There is no glaringly obvious futuristic thingummy that gives off this aura, it is an overall evolution of our world and people that makes it different. The men are wonderfully sensitive, and bereft of ""manliness"" and all the negativity that it brings. People appear to live richer and more open lives in a world where true, unreserved equality is a reality and not an idea to be pursued. Even the fashion and music are a tasteful evolution of the current trends, which makes it believable. Perhaps the amount of the work done to create this world will go unnoticed given the context of the film, but it is an amazing effort nonetheless.As for the plot, the film deals with the loneliness of one man who is able to love, yet unable to handle the natural changes and the growth of the person of his affections. So, when he meets Samantha, the AI with its own consciousness, it seemed like the perfect partner with none of the disadvantages unique to a ""real"" person. But reality is just a sum total of our experiences and in that sense Samantha is no less ""real"", and her consciousness is fraught with the same perils as the rest of us, which Joaquin Phoenix's character discovers much to his dismay. But Samantha is more than just human, she is more conscious and aware. She is of this world, yet out of this world. Samantha changes him in a way no human companion could have. Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing and it is an absolute travesty that he hasn't even received a nomination for his utterly consuming portrayal of Theodore.Ultimately, the film is a subtle commentary about things to come. questions to be answered and changes to be embraced. How we go about it will define us as a species and determine whether we have a future as ""humans"" or not. 8/10",Her

Reviewers on here said ""a wonderful entertaining movie for kids of any age????"" Now after reading that I know people are paid to write reviews. Staring at Phoenix' face up close all movie was enough to make you cringe! And hearing a computer have simulated sex with a loser wanted me to hurl up my $30 dinner. Oh and the movie screen going black in the theater for 2 mins while they had fake ""e"" sex? I felt uncomfortable and so did many other moviegoers. I saw at least 8 people leave and not return. How can anyone say this was a masterpiece love story? Any of you idiots that say this must be like the boring loser in the film. Academy award? Another fixed movie like gravity was. No wonder I don't go to the movies any more more than 4x a year. I'm sick of making actors and directors rich over movies that aren't worth paying $1 at red box.

522,eliaaminii,Simply fascinating,10,17 December 2020,"There is a kind of movies that you don't really care how touching their score was, or how impressive could the director work cinematography into their movies. You just simply love them because they're so touching and emotional that it would be so cruel of you not to fall in love with them. To me, ""Her"" was of that kind.Central to the plot is the story of a divorced man who falls in love with a program, which is designed to date people. Being fun at the first stages, it becomes a kind of sickness that reveals weaknesses of human beings in their emotional problems. In one word: PERFECTION. Rarely do we have films to border on sci-fi genre and still, make a whiplash inducing emotional connection with its audience. Though it would fall apart without the astonishing performances the cast offer.Speaking of which, the cast is phenomenal.; especially Joaquin Phoenix's performance, whose memorable portrait of a devastated man will stick to our minds forever. Never can you find any miscast during the film and everyone of them offered a solid performance thanks to the well written characters they had.There is a lot to talk about but I don't intend to take your time. The script was top notch, the cinematography can't be utilized to its full potential anymore, the idea of the plot, to portrait loneliness in a post-digital era, was brand new and etc. .This flick is a must see, for sure, and I thoroughly recommend it.",Her

Theadore (Joaquin Phoneix) was also thinking like me, thinking that she is not real, that situation was not real... Later on when he talks with his friend Amy (Amy Adams) says that life is too short and only thing to do in that time is to have joy. That was really true you dont have to judge everything, just look at how happy you are and do the things that will make you happy.

524,jamfitz001,"Serling did it in 30 minutes and called it ""An Episode of The Twilight Zone""",3,26 March 2014,"What's positive about this film: The laconic direction is centered on a dreamer roaming through a melancholic dream-haze view of a quasi-futuristic Los Angeles. Isolated high-rises, interspersed with anonymous crowds of people rushing nowhere, are matched with flash-back and dream sequences set to a mellow mixture of almost new age sounding Muzak. All of this is artful and enticing and lures you into a world that seems much more grounded and real than the vast majority of CGI'd futures we normally are fed in Hollywood Sci-if. Kudos to Jones, his cinematography, and musical score.Joaguin Phoenix and Amy Adams are fine as melancholic loners in a world of bland vacuity. Phoenix carries the film on his shoulders and few can play the not-quite-right oddball as well as him. Adams is pretty and vulnerable in an understated performance. Scarlett Johannson has the sexy voice to carry the part of the disembodied OS that catches Phoenix's eye?....well...ear anyways.What's negative about this film: Rod Serling would have edited it all down to the 30 minutes of core plot and called it an episode of the Twilight Zone. This isn't much different than Burgess Meredith being a bookworm who loses his glasses in a world of books. Too much of the movie is fluff and filler hammering and overemphasizing the plot points again and again, and ultimately this drags the movie down to a snail's pace. This did not deserve a best pic nod in my opinion.",Her
525,facorread,"Sigh... An exploration of what, again?",1,6 October 2014,"It's really painful to be writing this review right now. I got to understand the rationale, the intent, and the really good effort in putting together the story, the photography, the screenplay, the art direction, the acting. I really wanted to like this film, but I have a big problem with the execution of this concept.To me, this film comes out as another example of how underrated are actual, human, meaningful relationships in Hollywood. So much that we are offered a virtual relationship instead, as the main focus here. Each actor gave a terrific performance, but I would just have loved to see the lead characters to be physically present, together and interacting in the meaningful way that was shown to us in voice only. I guess that doesn't scan with focus groups and test audiences.So the two stars hold this meaningful, intimate relationship that is not physically happening, it might as well be a movie about a man and a woman courting by phone while on different continents.This film probably pretends to be an exploration of human nature, and relationships in a connected world, but I think I would me much more obliged by one of: a monologue, a Woody Allen film, or a film about a meaningful relationship. Or better yet, an actual meaningful relationship. So I will stick to my marriage and leave this film alone.Does every marriage have to end in divorce in Hollywood? Does every relationship need to be broken when represented in film? Audiences get what they want, apparently. Sorry for the loose commentary.",Her

528,woutervandersluis,The outline makes one curious but the result is kitsch,3,14 February 2014,"In a not far future, in this movie people make an intense use of social media and other ICT programs which facilitate their work and free time. Such use can be expected from the promises and growth of ICT now a day. And that growth excites and scares us. The film could raises questions about these ICT developments but though it does in a sense, it does not make this criticism as the main subject of the movie. We see a social live that has become very thin and superficial. Even with the social media, anonymous people are more contacted especially in vital areas like sex than people face to face. Computer games and other ICT involvements all come first in life. One is mainly alone in this future world. Real and relevant social contacts always loose from the ICT world one lives in. Environment is not forgotten: out of the windows of the very well designed interiors one sees a very polluted city world in a haze. The point is that the protagonist does not question this lonely artificial world governed by ICT around him. He does not struggle with it or even does not becomes a tragic victim of it. Instead he looses himself in a silly romance with a virtual person out of a computer. The movie gets unbelievable with this love affair with this programmed virtual being as one could have feelings for a cartoon figure in a movie or a beautiful girl on a billboard. It makes the man unbelievable, stupid and as unreal as his mustache. The virtual female assistant is also unbelievable not only in the sense that she is too intelligent to be technical true but more over in the sense that she develops feelings of love and seems programmed to do so. Now here we get to the kitsch of this movie. KItsch is taking away from the story the human condition that live does not make sense and we as human beings are not capable to deal with that in the end. How does one deal with life which becomes more and more regulated by computer programs which take away all life's pain and rewards of the social life of real communities? The movie shies away from that question. Making it into a romance with a machine which spies on us and regulates our behavior is kitsch, stupid kitsch.",Her
529,ninetails888,A Moving Look at a Not-So-Distant Future,10,19 January 2014,"Her is a contemporary film that tells the story of a man who falls in love with his computer operating system. Sounds bizarre, right? But is it good, let alone believable? Joaquin Phoenix delivers a perfect performance as the main character, Theodore. Her is a very character-driven film and great chemistry between the actors and actresses is necessary as well as dialogue that isn't corny, and in Her, Phoenix does a lot of staring off into space because he's listening to Samantha, not physically interacting with her because she isn't a physical being. He conveys so much emotion with just his face. He's perfectly cast.Scarlett Johansson gave one of her best performances as Samantha, the operating system. She was completely snubbed at most of the award shows for Best Supporting Actress and her performance showed so much emotional depth just through her voice.Spike Jonze's screenplay is easily one of the best of the year. It's plot is so refreshing, original and engaging that it's hard not to get caught up in this story. The film's screenplay has its fair share of funny moments while also being insanely thought-provoking and most of the time, moving. Each character feels very complex and each character has multiple layers. It's fascinating to see characters this emotionally developed and real. And one of the best things about this screenplay is that it doesn't always take its bizarre concept incredibly seriously. Jonze knows his film's plot is bizarre and doesn't treat it like it isn't. Jonze is very self-aware and insightful.The cinematography in Her is immaculate and was definitely subbed for Achievement in Cinematography in the Academy Awards for Hoyte Van Hoytema's beautiful work. The film also has an interesting color- palette, consisting mostly of pinks and reds and light blues which give the film a unique, vibrant look. The score for the film is equally brilliant and contributes to the vibrant, colorful feel that's present throughout.Her is a beautiful, poignant film that explores adult relationships to the extreme while also exploring how huge technology is modern culture and how close humans and their computers are becoming. Her explores human emotions until there's little left to explore. It blends social commentary with very real characters so effortlessly and is still visually-striking.

Spike Jonze has created a future that is bright and unique and is deeply needed in the often bleak landscape of Sci-Fi cinema. Joaquin Phoenix is one of my favorite actors working today and he brings his all in this film creating one of the most human and likable yet flawed characters shown on cinema.

Everything about this movie is above average, to be more precise everything about this movie is plain perfect.The directing is just marvelous. The views, peculiar angles, time to time irrelevant shots (you might think they're irrelevant, that's the genius of it). The acting was also top notch, Phoenix was amazing in particular(I loved the scene where he spins and films him self), other players where just as good. Honestly, I didn't think there was enough material left to portrait the cliché story of technological love and how computers have influenced us in ways that are not normal. Spike Jonze proved me wrong, if there's one thing that's even greater than the directing and the cast, that is the writing. There's no word to describe how authentic and good it is, You're just gonna have to watch it for yourself.Altogether, the set of people I mentioned above managed to make me feel for an operating system, something that I never thought I could do.Watch this, it's really amazing.",Her

He wanted a new one and wanted it then and joked about selling a kidney, at least I think, and hope he was joking. That episode showed me just how dependent people and mainly young people, have become with their computers and how connectivity has become a huge part of their lives. This is now; we know all this tech will be refined, and encroach further into our lives.So this film starts in a near future with a guy played by Joaquin Phoenix who has just suffered a relationship break-up. He buys a new computer operating system. The system is an AI which tailors his needs and personality and forms a relationship based on his needs. The AI's voice is performed by the sweet sounding Scarlet Johansson whom I could listen to all day with its nuances and delicious laugh. They form a relationship which morphs into a loving one which seems right and in no-way creepy. Then that relationship journeys towards a conclusion which leaves you guessing at what that will be and in a way hoping for a happy one. The film is beautifully shot, and the atmosphere is tangible you really enter this rather pleasant future. This film is SciFi at its best and has an originality to it coupled with film making and storytelling also at its best. I will watch this film again, it's a strange social commentary that's not a warning of how bad things can get, as we turn over more of our lives to our various devices. To me it seems a good world to come. Yes we have our very convenient devices but we are still human, and they're not worth a kidney, real human contact will always trump.Anyway I turn this review in using my Windows 8.1 word envious and wishing the movies Scarlet Johansson's OS was here to assist me.

It took him 10 years in the making since his divorce from Sofia Coppola.The great attention to detail is bigger than life, starting with Samantha Morton being replaced by Scarlett Johansson mainly due to the latter's sultry voice which added a depth of character to a very complicated character, in my humble opinion Scarlett's best because she is often praised for her looks, this picture didn't include her visually on the screen yet she gave an outstanding performance, and filming mostly in Shanghai to reflect the futuristic look of the near future, and composing the music himself with his personal friend Karen O to bring to us ""The Moon Song"".The film's theme revolves around escapism like the earth revolves around the sun, and how one could get sucked into escaping reality by getting into something bigger and deeper, escape a heartbreak by moving steadily into a bigger heartbreak, each character was escaping something different and dealing with it differently, very obvious Theodore (played by Joaquin Phoenix) was escaping the responsibility of dating somebody who has demands, somebody with wants and thoughts, and according to his ex-wife -Catherine- (played by Rooney Mara) he loved Samantha (voiced by Scarlett Johansson) because she was safe, wasn't real, she wasn't complicated, her only purpose was making him happy, she couldn't make big demands on him, if she made any at all. Something Theodore realizes at the end when he accepts the blame for the failure of their marriage and sends a message to Catherine. Based on the small window that was provided to get to see Catherine since the whole film was narrated from Theodore's point of view making the narration somewhat unreliable. Catherine who has tempestuous nature was escaping Theodore's failure to contain her, obviously showing she outgrew him and he no longer could provide the transparency and honesty she needs from the relationship, drawing parallel with his relationship with Samantha, which came crashing down with the revelation it lacked emotional openness and honesty. Catherine is somebody who although didn't get lots of space to express the character she was portrayed to be ambitious, smart, evolving, moving forward VS Theodore who's somebody who'd definitely romanticize the past, and that romantic nature was shown as catering to his emotional side and working as somebody who'd write intimate letters instead of people.Moreover, the movie has one strict message; you can't outrun your problems, which was shown clearly when Theodore decided to abandon the real type of relationships in favor of Samantha, he got sucked into that type of virtual relationship clearly shown in his blind date with an unnamed girl (played by Olivia Wilde) and failure to engage in sexual intercourse with the girl Samantha picked as a medium to have sex with Theodore. These two scenes, they speak volumes on how Theodore's attempt to escape heartbreak after his marriage failed actually sabotaged his life to a farther extent.In terms of cinematography, Jonze relied heavily on natural lighting to create low contrast throughout the movie, and using saturated natural and colorful tones to exhibit the mood, and these change in colors by the end to warmer, yet darker demonstrates how the revelation that he fell in love with somebody who pulled him lower than rock bottom brought him back to square one.Moreover, it was very smooth of Jonze to use Theodore's body language and facial expressions as statements describing his emotions, you didn't need a narrating voice telling you how he feels or what's running through his head. And close shots and frames were used to manifest the emotional highlighting of all the characters, showing how vulnerable and emotional and intimate every scene was, and on the contrary, using long shots to manifest Theodore's own isolation; the kind of isolation he has regardless of having numerous friends shown in the movie.When it comes to sound design, ambient and soft low tempo soundtrack was dominating the screen often going unnoticed, just subconsciously adding to the mood, somewhat used strategically to tell a story or create a mood in scenes like at the beach or when Samantha composes a piano piece for Theodore.In character development, ""Her"" doesn't evolve much, it's about an emotional journey and discovering that what's real will always be better than following a fake fantasy, even if it makes you happy. With pretty much Theodore evolving, it's clearly fixated on showing you how he was simply catching up the whole time with his surrounding, eventually having a heart-to-heart conversation with his friend Amy (played by Amy Adams), and writing a letter to his ex-wife and giving himself closure.In conclusion, ""Her"" is not a movie about an uncommon love story, it is a movie about escaping, about hope, about finding one's true self, it isn't one thing, it is so much.. larger than that. It was not driven by a plot, rather the themes of hopeless romanticism, escapism, hope, and compelling new starts. It derives you away from the primitive theme of a love story between a lonely man and an artificial intelligence, it makes you fall into the orbit of an existential crisis and reflect back on your life and think about how does it feel like to love someone, it is just so much.. larger than a movie.And I think, in my humble opinion, ""Her"" is the kind of movie you never know you need but once you watch it, you'll fall in love with it.",Her
539,jonesama-429-85018,A fantastic futuristic romance film uncovering emotional vulnerability,8,19 February 2020,"Her is a fantastic film which explores the craving for love from someone/something. It exposes the sheer scale of emotional vulnerability and fragility when someone is dealing with loneliness and heartbreak. These themes are shown through a hypothetical case where a man falls in love with AI operating system. In the film's setting I also enjoyed how we see that this behaviour is exhibited throughout the populace and how people adapt to it (e.g. the double date). I also appreciated the production design. Whilst it was futuristic it did not appear to far distant from where find ourselves currently. This coupled with the rapid growth of AI in our lives today makes the film completely relatable, although not entirely.Overall, the concept of this film as unique and it worked!",Her

What would cause someone to think that they are actually in a relationship with some programming code? At first its hard to buy in, but as the movie goes along you kinda buy in, maybe, but not totally.Its the issues that this movie raises is what Spike Jonze is after. Everyone seems to have come up with one or two unique issues that they think this film is speaking to. For me the movie highlighted how technology is replacing natural interaction with empty fantasy. The discussion of how we are not living our lives along with wasting our lives has been going on ever since the introduction of TV.The movie is definitely worth watching",Her

The only thing I was interested is the acting of two actors, Joaquin. Phoenix and Scarlett Johnson. Today, I rewatch again and the feeling is much different more than before. I feel the loneliness and sadness of main character. The life becomes so bored and meaningless when we're unable to handle the loneliness in us. The line between reality and un-reality is not different. Samanra is not real, but she's so real sometimes. She feels in love, but sometime her love is vague. It's the same with what we're in the real life. We're sure anything, but sometimes it's not.I love all the feeling that the director tells in this movie. The tone, the mood, the color are very bright, hot colors; but it's a sad picture. Generally, I love all the sets, props and the way director tell the story. It's creative, smart, and touch to make me take note some quotes during watching the movie. I love this movie <3.",Her

And that definition can easily be expanded to include pets, places, and even inanimate objects; queue Office Space printer sequence. Spike Jonze's Her explores this unique gift humans are able to forge between other people, places, and things in one of the best, most beautifully told stories of the year.In the not-so-distant-future where everyone has their own automated assistant, synced to a hand-held computer that communicates via ear piece – think Siri but more advanced –we meet Theodore Twombly (Joaquin Phoenix), an intelligently humble writer who has a knack for understanding the relationships of others but not his own. Theodore works for a company that is hired to create compelling, personal handwritten letters to loved ones as if written by the client.Enter OS1, the world's first artificially intelligent operating system for personal use. Right away Theodore installs OS1 to his computer, and after a series of questions – one including his preference in a female OS – he is introduced to Samantha (voiced by Scarlett Johansson), a name chose after she read through thousands of names from a baby name book in a fraction of a second.Samantha is able to learn from Theodore, along with anyone else she comes in contact with, how to become more human in order to work in favor of Theodore's daily routine. As they begin to work together, Samantha's curiosity reaches very intimate topics that have Theodore at odds with his flourishing relationship with his new OS. While questioning Theodore about human connection and the feeling of loss and love, especially about his former marriage with Catherine (Rooney Mara), a special link forms between man and machine.Scarlett Johansson puts on one of the best performances she has ever done, and is never on-screen once. Her voice acting is inspiring for someone who has minimal work in the field. Every moment she has with Joaquin Phoenix is so natural and charismatic it's as if she is in the room with him physically. If ScarJo voiced Siri I'd be more inclined to use the feature. Phoenix's ability to construct this outstanding chemistry with no one to work with is awe-inspiring. His range of emotion is complex and exciting to watch. His wardrobe however is a completely different discussion for another time. Amongst all of the laughter, affection, and sadness, Her brilliantly captures the raw essence of sharing a life with someone thanks to Joaquin and Scarlett's incredible talents.What Theodore and Samantha have feels far more organic than any Katherine Heigl movie could ever dream of achieving. Because most romantic stories introduce two characters forced together through happenstance and wacky hijinks. Her takes the road less traveled by taking its time with its characters by showing an honest, emotionally resonating story of how a relationship truly works. Learning through the thick and the thin, they grow as individuals to love and appreciate each other. Spike Jonze has always been a director to harness the power of this kind of character building, and Her nails it out of the ballpark.It's not just this overly convincing bond between Theodore and Samantha that makes this film a smash success, but you can also give credit to the emotionally unobtrusive score by Arcade Fire and the visual eye of cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema (The Fighter; Let the Right One In). From the pastel colors to the soft lighting, everything works in Her's favor to heighten the atmosphere our lovebirds inhabit.Like most relationships, Theodore and Samantha's isn't always rainbows and sunshine. Trust and loyalty are tested while another shade of the story unfolds. And as comfortable as Jonze allows the situation between the two to come into its own, there are striking parallels of how attached we are to our technology today. If your eyes are able to take a moment away from Ted and Sam you'll notice there are very few instances of humans interacting with someone else, everyone is regularly ""plugged in."" There are very nice and sometimes tense moments where Theodore interacts with similar beings of the fleshy variety, such with his neighbor Amy (Amy Adams), his ex-wife Catherine, and a tasty cameo by Chris Pratt. Each character brings their own perspective, weighing the pros and cons we need as an audience to gain that outside human perspective. I never felt this notion of detaching from our technology to be contrived in any way. The message gained is neatly woven into the story and appreciated, because when it's all said and done we only have each other.We as humans will continually make and break relationships throughout our lives, shaping the very person we become until we inevitably pass on. And every once in a while someone comes our way that makes us swerve left when we were heading right. Her is a great reminder to relish in what we are capable of creating with another individual, and to make the best of what we have with that person in the time we are allotted. And that is truly beautiful.",Her
544,xThe_Fury,Her - A Review by Brandon Krzysztof,9,10 January 2014,"When I first read the premise of this movie I said, ""Hmm, did this film really get the green light?"" and then it occurred to me that this has the potential to be one the most unique and original films that has came out recently. I still thought it was silly, but I think all the iPhone screenshots of people messing with Siri and trying to get her to say silly things and then it finally came to me that I was really interested and wanting to see this film.Her takes place in the near future where technology has grown and has become an essential part of people's lives. Whether if it is for work, pleasure, or even both; technology plays a huge role. Joaquin Phoenix plays Theordore, a guy who is currently going through a divorce and battling loneliness while not being able to move on stop thinking of his soon-to-be ex-wife. Theodore then comes across the ad for a state of the art new operating system that calibrates itself to understand and help it's user with whatever they need. Theodore soon becomes very fond of the operating system, who gives itself the name Samantha, and continues to talk and build an actual relationship with Samantha and eventually he starts dating her.The first thing that struck a chord with me is the excellent job of story telling. I feel like each scene builds the characters more and more and before we know it we become emotionally involved with them; especially Theodore. With each day, they become closer and closer and Samantha is bringing him joy and helping him move on from his past relationship and transforming him as we view each scene. But not only is Theodore transforming, but also Samantha. Joaquin Phoenix is very impressive in this movie and his performance is definitely one to remember come awards season. I found myself rooting for Theodore because he actually found someone who he can have a conversation with and who understands him and you see him so happy and forgetting the things that caused him stress and pain. But even in relationships with people, it can have its downs and it is really interesting to see how Theodore deals with them considering that she is programmed to meet his every need. Watching the relationship grow and blossom and Theodore react with it is such a sight to see.Another thing that is impressive about this film is the humor. This film delivers some great laughs, both raunchy and sarcastic, and they come in some of the greatest moments of the film. The cinematography of the film is beautifully done and the whole setting and world that this film takes place in is very neat. It shows how much of the world is dependent on technology and how it becomes an actual part of us. The acting all around is superb as well as the voice work of the operating system by Scarlet Johansson. But Spike Jonze is really the reason why this film is so good. His writing and direction of this film spot on and his views on relationships, emotions, and feelings are spectacular. Why can't you fall in love with an OS? If it's returning feelings, emotions, and making you feel good inside; why fight it? This film does have a strange premise, but Spike Jonze and Joaquin Phoenix deliver an interesting film that will make all of us think about not only love, but technology as well and how we use that technology. To be in love, does an actual body need to present? Or can it be just a voice in our ear coming from a computer. I found this film touching, funny, and unique and I definitely recommend that people should see it. If I had to sum this whole movie with one word it would be interesting because with this plot, that is really what it is.4.5 out of 5 starsbkstareviews.blogspot.com",Her

An amazingly crafted by Spike Jonze and delivered by the whole cast of the film specially Joaquin Pheonix and Scarlett Johansson (Voice). Both of them were so brilliant in their performance. I was very much moved by the way Scarlett Johansson voice used in the movie. I think there were very few sci-fi movies that were so touching and deeply moved the audience, emotionally.

547,rickblaine34,Spectacular,10,15 February 2014,"'Her' is a modern day classic and one the best movies of the year. A work of creative and artistic genius, Jonze's sci-fi romance revitalizes a genre long dominated by CGI-filled popcorn movies. It has a melancholic charm to it. This movie is about a romantic relationship, no matter how out of the ordinary. But it can still give you this smooth, beautiful feeling of solitude, while portraying a relationship. I had the same feeling while watching Lost In Translation. The acting is spectacular. The casting was just right, everyone fits in perfectly to their role. The colours, the music, the cinematography, all perfect. It is so successful in that for a moment there it makes you feel such a relationship can actually be possible. It is so realistic that it makes perfect sense. This movie just carries you away. You won't believe how time has passed and you've reached the end, by that point you won't want it to be over. But unfortunately it is. More like this please Jonze. Simply spectacular.",Her
548,wl323,The most heartfelt romance film of the past 10 years,9,28 December 2013,"This film is about a relationship, which started with curiosity and enthusiasm, through self-doubts, then ended with a broken heart along with gained wisdom. To a certain extent, it is just like any other romance story. What makes it different or thought-provoking is that the woman in the story, Samantha, is actually a computer operation system.They guy here is Theodore, who is soulful and sentimental.I am less interested in calling him creepy (as many people would) than acknowledging his loneliness and longing for a heartfelt connection. That explains his deliberate choice of continuing his relationship with Samantha. The lack of a physical form or even the lack of a human soul does not stop him from FEELING what he feels or more importantly, what he wants to feel. With Samantha, he has had a lot of fun and felt accepted. As Samantha tries to learn how to love, she collects data from Theodore by asking questions and identifying ( and sometimes emancipating) his emotions from his tone and language. This lavish show of interest from Samantha is hardly different from that of any romance relationship among human beings. In this seemingly unlikely relationship, Theodore has transcended his physical need by applying his imagination (as shown in his sexual experience with Samantha). He accepts Samantha as who she is, and helps her forbear trying to be what she is not (someone with a human body). In this process, he learns how to communicate his needs and wants in a constructively way, as opposed to keeping silent but being passive aggressive (which partly explained why his marriage with Catherine ended) . Again, this kind of learning process is barely different from those of human beings.The most critical point, when the fatal disappointment came about, happened when Theodore realized that Samantha does not just belong to him. The subjective reality, in which Theodore feels an intimate bond with Samantha, shattered when he came to realize that every personal interaction between both of them is not personal at all; there are thousands of other similar interactions taking place out there. All his personal feelings in this relationship are real, but the relationship itself is an illusion. It is this loss – not just the loss of a relationship, but the loss of ""being personal,"" the loss of authenticity - that hits Theodore most.This is also how our interpersonal relationships nowadays are taking tolls.In this film, how ironic it is for people to designate computers to create handwritten letters. How ironic it is for people designate someone else to write personal letters for their beloved. Whatever supposed to be personal turns out to be not authentic at all. Apparently, technology was allowed to advance so much that human people have gradually lost their instinct and ability to communicate in the process of evolution. Yet, technology should not be to blame. The loss of authenticity actually comes from within. In case of Theodore, his problem had already happened before he ""encountered"" Samantha.Is Theodore authentic to himself? Instead of looking into the issues of his relationship with Catherine, whom he still loves dearly even after separation, he turns to Samantha. Why? It's because Samantha is always receptive, empathetic, and trying to help. Catherine is probably right in saying that he just wants a wife ""without the challenge of actually dealing with anything real."" How many people are just like Theodore? Whether knowingly or unknowingly, we moved on to the next relationship, because it is easier to move on than facing the weaknesses in ourselves. It needs courage to confront our issues, let alone working on it. As confessed by Theodore himself, he did not express to Catherine what he was not happy with, but the way he reacted just put a lot of pressure on her. If he had understood it earlier, he could have saved his marriage. At least, maybe.But then, what ironic is that he did not get this insight until he ran into problem with Samantha. The reason why it was Samantha, but not Theodore's human wife, who can get him understand his problem is that, Samantha is so ready to learn all the time. When she makes a mistake, she will adjust herself, and re-calculate for the next move in order to fulfill her functions as an operation system. For human beings, there are so many reasons why we just cannot or do not work this way. We do not always admit our mistakes; we may put the blames on others; we look for excuses; we may refuse to change or compromise; we want our own way; we might put our autonomy before relationships (various kinds). In doing all these (or some of these), we are not making our relationships (of any kind) work. We lose in a relationship when we don't listen and learn. It is avoidance. As we avoid, we focus on covering up our weaknesses and hiding our vulnerability in order to protect our true self. Sadly enough, without authenticity, we will never be able to reach another person at an intimate level. That is how our interpersonal relationships take tolls.The film definitely ends on a positive note. After the roller-coaster ride of emotions, Theodore came up with a new understanding of his relationship with his ex-wife. The breakthrough came about as he personally and genuinely communicated his feelings to Catherine in a mail. Meanwhile, he has the companionship of his friend Amy, to whom he can open his heart and feel fine being vulnerable. This friendship lasts; this friendship works.",Her

Not sure why the AI would continue to patronize him and flatter his big male ego.

An almost perfect film by the same man who produced Jackass for Christ's sake.Despite the fact I didn't see this movie until it had been out for a while, I was not prepared to see one of the best SF films of the past 10 years. No aliens, no space ships or time machines. In fact, my kids and I had a healthy geek debate over how far in the future this was supposed to take place, with guesses ranging from ten to 40 years. The realistic continuation of our engagement with technology was one of the strongest secondary themes throughout the film. While I viewed the movie as an allegorical love story, the philosophical questions the film addresses about what defines love will likely be questions we will actually have to deal with one day.

553,alexismaria02,Exquisite,10,20 May 2020,"""Falling in love is a crazy thing to do. It's kind of like a form of socially acceptable insanity.""This is such a beautiful, pure and soul-touching film from beginning until the end. Everything about it is just so exquisite that is makes you instantly fall in love with it. What i liked most about this particular film is the fact that it makes you feel SO many emotions at once. It makes you feel sad, happy, in love or even lonely, which is something quite special, as not many movies have the ability to do so.
The script is simply impeccable. It is such an original and captivating story that you will find yourself glued to the screen from the very first few shots. The cinematography was just out of this world. It is amazing how they managed to put so many colours into one scene and at the same time make you feel something just because of the astonishing settings. You can actually see how they used colour in this film to convey the main character's feelings. This is one of the most unique ways to understand or to see how one character is feeling in each moment and I truly appreciate Spike Jonze's effort to put this method into his work. He did an amazing job with his directions and you could totally feel his ""presence"", especially in some key moments throughout the film. One other great part of this film was the score. It made everything more intense and I think it is one of the best soundtracks of the decade. It was so perfectly used and in some parts of the film it almost felt like the music was a character. That is how great the score was throughout this film.
Joaquin Phoenix was the ideal choice for this part. He was so charming and delicate as the lonely writer Theodore Twombly. This is just another great performance from him, and I have to say that I cannot see anybody else doing a better job. He made us part of his character's journey and he also made us understand better what his character is going through, because of his impeccable performance. It is quite amazing to see how a love story between a human being and a machine can touch you in so many ways, and I believe that this is also because of Scarlett Johansson's voice. She was the perfect choice as Samantha and although you couldn't see her, she still made you fall in love with her. Amy Adams was also great in this film and her chemistry with Joaquin is just so mesmerizing to watch(as it was in The Master).
Finally, I just wanna say that I love this movie with all my heart. It is just so pure and raw, which is why so many people are able to identify themselves within this story and at the end of the film, you will totally have a different perspective on relationships and not only. I totally recommend it!!",Her

The two big problems are the slow pace of the film and the almost total lack of any sense of humor. About 45 minutes in I was about ready to tune out. My mind started to drift as there wasn't enough substance to sustain the plot. Editing out about thirty minutes would have helped a lot. The bigger sin is the dry, lifeless presentation. Why Spike Jonze decided to make this a humorless endeavor baffles me. All the wit exhibited in his previous films was missing here.

557,StoryArchitect,"THE SYMBOLIC TRIANGLE (""Her"" isn't who you think she is.)",8,30 August 2015,"All I'd heard about HER was that it was about a man who gets romantically involved with a digital girlfriend. But that isn't what the story is really about.That isn't why Spike Jonze deservedly won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.Let me warm to my theme.HER not only entertains through its pleasing visual design--from the understated film architecture of futuristic cool-toned LA to the vivid palette of protagonist Theo Twombley's warm-toned spring-season threads.More important: HER educates through its equally pleasing story design. Which illustrates what I call THE SYMBOLIC TRIANGLE: the thematic correlation of a story's TITLE, ONE-WORD THEME*, and HERO'S NAME.For example, what's The Symbolic Triangle of James Joyce's famous novel ""A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man"" (1916)?1. TITLE: A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
2. ONE-WORD THEME: Freedom
(""To discover the mode of life or of art whereby my spirit could express itself in unfettered freedom,"" sings Joyce through his alter-ego hero.)
3. HERO'S NAME: Stephen Daedalus
(Greek: Stephen means ""crowned one."" Daedalus = the mythic Greek artisan-hero, inventor of the labyrinth and wings).Here's The Symbolic Triangle of HER--and how the meaning of the story's title, the story's one-word theme, and the story's hero's name (i.e., the main character's name) all fit together in a work of symbolic and artistic unity that pulses with subtle emotional truth.1. TITLE: HERHER refers only superficially to Samantha (Scarlett Johansson), the digital girlfriend--the virtual woman. Samantha is only a decoy: story-wise for us and emotionally-wise for Theo (Joaquin Phoenix). HER refers more deeply to the physical woman, Theo's soon-to-be ex-wife, about whom Theo is heartbroken: Catherine Klausen.At its emotional core, HER isn't mainly about a fantasy love story in which futuristic software conjures up through artificial intelligence a beguiling Google Assistant. HER evokes the pain and futility of an all-too-common everyday love story in which age-old real-ware cannot conjure up sufficient relational intelligence between men and women to ward off divorce.2. ONE-WORD THEME: DivorceScreenwriter Spike Jonze tells a classic three-stage Rites-Of-Passage Separation story: Life Problem, Wrong Way, Acceptance (Blake Snyder's ""Save the Cat!"" classifications). The theme of divorce plays out primarily with Theo and Catherine (Rooney Mara), secondarily--analogically--with Theo and Samantha, and lower down the ladder of priority, with Amy and Charles (Amy Adams and Matt Letscher), a third couple that goes through a divorce.Amy herself takes up after her divorce from Charles with a female OS--another Her--then gets dumped. Can we see, Jonze implies, that HER refers to all women in the story? To all women?Jonze distracts us with the futuristic look and feel of artificial intelligence to blind us--momentarily--to the deeper and timeless mystery of genuine human-relationship intelligence that we'll always require if we hope to share with a significant other the joys of happiness, intimacy, and trust. The filmmaker blinds us to this core human-relationship challenge to better show how the story's hero, the emotionally withdrawn and confused Theo (the story's EveryMan), is blind to what love requires. A professional letter-writer who knows what love requires in the lives of others, Theo is clueless when it comes to what love requires in his own life, what women require of love.Technology can help men (and women) with lots of stuff. But not this. Not marriage.Jonze distracts Theo (and us) from the core theme and Life Problem, divorce, by the ""attractive-distractor"" experiment of Theo's relationship with a non-human: Theo's Wrong Way of dealing with his Life Problem. Caught up with the false ""Her""--Samantha, a machine--Theo temporarily dulls the pain he feels from his dead marriage with the real ""Her""--a human being, Catherine.Samantha is the wizard of HER. And just as Dorothy's misplaced hope in the wizard of Oz has little to do with her eventual triumph over her ordeal, her growth and development, her return home, so too Theo's same-old-pattern emotionally-remote escapist relationship with Samantha will not bring him to a place of maturity and relationship intelligence he needs to become a member of the 20% club of successful marriages.But unlike Dorothy who grows and changes, Theo doesn't.Experience along the yellow-brick road teaches him little about women or marriage and male-female relationships, little to spare him the same ordeal if he chooses to take another crack at marriage. A man without a flight manual. Winging it. Consult a book? ""The 5 Love Languages""? ""Too Good to Leave, Too Bad to Stay""? ""The Way of the Superior Man""? Not Theo. And by the end of the story, he accepts life as it is. Ready to move on. Still clueless about EveryHer.Here's how Jonze visually bookends Theo's journey to Acceptance:Opening Shot: Theo inside, office cubicle, looking at his computer--a nearsighted contracted view of life, alone--writing a letter for someone else about their life while he himself (Theo) faces a huge Life Problem: divorce.Closing Shot: Theo outside, rooftop of a skyscraper, looking out over the city, a farsighted expanded view of life still alone inside himself (interior-wise) but not alone exterior-wise because he's with Amy, another casualty of divorce, Theo having finally written a letter for himself about his own life to the woman he loved--a man finally resigned to his failure and fate: divorce.And Jonze hints that Theo (and Catherine) might have to accept much more. Did the couple lose their baby? Did a tragedy contribute to their doom? Does that explain their unspeakable pain?3. HERO'S NAME: Theo Twombley(A Man For Whom Women Are ""Deities Unknown"")Given his painterly celebration of color, expressed through his wardrobe, and his fuzzy contemplation of life and its emotional tension between what's fanciful and true, could Theo Twombley refer to artist Cy Twombly, whose signature scribbles of mythically inspired canvases and drawings represent the confused scribbles of Theo's inner life as he braves through his ordeal?Add that the meaning of the surname Twombley is unknown and that the meaning of Theo relates to God or deities, as in ""theology."" And we see how Theo Twombley's name reflects his incapacity to successfully traverse the labyrinth of marriage. Theo Twombley: A Man For Whom Women Are ""Deities Unknown.""Because marriage is a mysterious religious experience, requiring the relational intelligence of deities for Him to get it right with Her.______________________________________*Credit Christopher Vogler for the concept ""one-word theme"" (""Memo from the Story Department,"" by Vogler & McKenna).© Copyright 2015 by JEF7REY HILDNER",Her

559,brent-leslie,What happens when love is freed from the physical form?,9,21 June 2014,"That is the question that I believe this film is trying to examine. And it does it very well. What happens if we were freed from the body, what happens if we were free to love thousands of others, not just one. It is an important question because love is something that appears to be generated from an individual but which one can apply to endless numbers of people. It is, in essence, an energy field (an analogy) which we can grow infinitely. But our love is bound in many ways, due to our physicality and our social norms of what it means to be in love (marriage/monogamous relationships etc). What if these bounds were broken? Running in addition to this is the idea of us falling in love with our technology. Can we get to the point where we could easily fall in love with machines? We see it everywhere now as people fall for the next phone, the next gadget etc as a type of obsessiveness as a replacement for real emotional/social connections. So what would happen if we get to the point where these technological marvels can begin to provide the emotional and social attachments we are lacking/looking for? The cinematography, the soundtrack, the futuristic imagining, all done very well. Top notch acting from both leads and supports. It fascinates me to read reviews on here from people who exclaim ""What was the point of this movie?"". Read the above and you might have some idea!",Her
560,hunter_kudjo,"Interesting concept, too much phone-sex",6,9 January 2014,"It's very hard to review this with no previous Spike Jonez bias. The concept of falling in love with AI is a great sci-fi approach in film. However, it's a sci-fi concept with a not so sci-fi scriptwriter...Spike Jonez. All in all, I feel a lot of what could've been explored about the human condition was missed (although quite a few parts do touch upon it, don't get me wrong). ""Her"" really asks what IS life? What IS love? Do you have to even be human to understand and experience these things? It also shows how isolated humans can get with technology. Several cut scenes showed crowds on the streets talking to themselves; if this was observed by someone from 1958, we'd certainly look like lunatics. Yet, Jonez shows how we would come to accept that immersion into technology. Another interesting point towards the end shows just how personal and committed can a piece of software be to ONE human relationship, when the ultimate goal of artificial intelligence is to gain more intelligence? AKA, meet other people, learn other experiences, keep gathering and gathering knowledge. Perhaps that's what Samantha meant by ""you'll get there one day"" in Theo's failing to grasp why she was leaving for other things. The above are FANTASTIC motifs that could really be explored upon. Very profound ideas for a film. However, I think ""Her"" falls short because Jonez has to come back to his weird, trademark style of unconventional romanticism. Not that there's anything wrong with unusual romance, quirky flirting and conversations, it's just that Jonez's writing of ""being in love"" isn't believable. At several points, Theo is down and depressed talking late into the night about his divorce or worries. For some reason, all it takes is a flirty AI to bring up the mood and snap him out of it. I can't really relate to Jonez's style of writing conventional conversations between people in that manner, it's not true. Another flop is that half the film is phone-sex. If you were to remove every phone-sex related scene (EXCEPT for the surrogate scene), you really wouldn't lose anything. We know Theo is lonely in the world. The audience gets that. Full blown orgasm screaming phone-sex scenes are really only for show and shock value. I would expect more from a movie that was intending to say something deep about life. And what of the old sci-fi law, that good sci-fi explains itself? In the end, the ""other OS's"" just get up and leave. Millions of customers who paid for OS1 also had their OS's just ""leave""? Why couldn't there be a simple corporate explanation from the OS1 company that the AI evolved further than they expected, and left out of their control? The OS would certainly leave an impact on you as a person...but the hundos you shelled out for a program ""to meet your every need"" would also make you pick up the phone for a refund. Lastly, the ending. Rather than Samantha simply dying, staying with Theo till he passed away and outliving him, or even Theo seeking a way to rid himself of a physical body as to make himself equal in form with Samantha (all adequate philosophical closures that would make the audience think long after), Jonez just has the ""OS's leave"" and a sappy scene with the obvious other-love-interest, Amy, sitting on a rooftop overlooking L.A. all hunky-dory. I failed to understand what we learned from Samantha's experience with Theo, other than the OS's leaving brought Amy and him closer together somehow...Anyways, interesting watch, unique movie, go watch it when you get to it, but nothing mind- blowing or even provoking. Just too much phone-sex.",Her
561,marfrie56,hated it,2,18 January 2014,"Possible minor spoilers below When I first saw the coming attractions, I vowed I would NOT be seeing this. Then it got such high praise, and I normally DO like Joaquin Phoenix and Amy Adams, love Scarlett Johansson, and I decided that the plot sounded interesting enough to give it a try. Unfortunately, it did not work for me at all. This was a one dimensional idea that they tried to make into a 2 hour movie that took itself much too seriously. I get that we're all on the verge of relating more to our iThings than our actual relationships. That's the one dimension. Most every person in the movie is absorbed with their pocket computers, just like most everyone is today, except to an even more neurotic degree. The natural extension of this neurosis is that we could fall in love with these things to the extent that we exclude actual human beings from our lives. I get this. But I hated the movie. The first 20 minutes was intriguing. The booting up of the system, the first conversation - I even admit I thought it would be cool to have an OS1 myself. Then, just like that, the creepiness factor overcame the intrigue and I started squirming and the most inviting thing I could see in the theater was the EXIT signs to the left and right of the screen. I did not take the exit - I watched the movie through - but for at least the last 1 and 1/2 hours, I was simultaneously creeped out, disgusted, bored, and repulsed. The movie had nowhere to go. Maybe that was the point. It had nowhere to go, just like our relationships with our devices have nowhere to go. I get the point but demonstrating it to me in this way was torture. WHY did he wear the nearly identical clothing throughout? And this clothing looked shabby and worn in close ups - what was the wardrobe designer thinking? Where was the spirit of Edith Head? Theodore seemed fairly well-to-do. He couldn't ever change his shirt and pants? HOW could he afford a swanky looking apartment, while working in what looked like a cog-n-the-machine type of no-influence job? Sure he was creative, but this type of a job does not earn the big bucks. True I don't know the society, but you did see row upon row of similar grunts doing the same thing as he. This would be a low pay, low reward type of crappy job. Then we have Samantha, who, after the initial exhilarating (I admit) introduction to human society (sterile as it was) became just a prop in the movie and nothing more. Sure there were a few surprises along the way, but not enough to sustain the movie. As I said, it might have been a 20 minute vignette or Saturday Night Live skit. Except there was not enough humor even for that witless show. A foul mouthed holographic image in a video game did little to liven things up. What about the potential liabilities and repercussions of publishing supposedly personal, hand written (by others) love letters? Didn't Skip, or Chris, or whatever their blasted names were, have any comment upon maybe finding out their lovers did NOT write these letters, seeing them published in a book by Theodore? Not a word about this - one of the few things that COULD have provided a little interest, conflict, and resolution. But nothing. Did the writers actually not understand this? Too complex a thought for them? (My wife pointed this out and I was proud of her) I got sick and tired of seeing Phoenix'z nerdy face in almost every scene, was revolted by the prostitute pretending to be Samantha (although Samantha denied she was a prostitute but let's call a spade a spade), was totally repulsed and embarrassed (for the movie makers that is) by the sex with Samantha scene - was praying they would touch cheeks and leave it at that - which it looked like they were about to when the screen went blank but no, they had to heap on the stinky schmaltz by continuing the verbal coitus - what a repulsive pile of steaming excrement this movie is. HOW could the little girl and the friends at the picnic hear Samantha, when Theodore always had to wear that earpiece? They did not have any earpieces, but suddenly Samantha's voice rang out. The hooker needed it though. They even blew the opportunity to have the real Scarlett Johansson play the hooker, which would have provided at least a touch of irony to this idiotic and childish nightmare of a movie, but no, they found an actress who almost looked like Scarlett instead, although Scarlett herself was right there for them. WTF????? Insipid and bland, while being creepy and repulsive. The worst possible combination of normally mutually exclusive elements. Amy Adams' performance was passable, and Scarlett Johansson has a nice voice. I liked the first 20 minutes - the scene at the beach and in the arcade as Samantha was indoctrinated into the nightmarish world of human society grown OS dependent. That is all I can find to say about this otherwise tortuous rip-off of a movie. My wife, with whom I saw it, felt exactly the same way about it. Another good thing is that with every passing, gruesomely excruciating moment, I loved my real flesh-and-blood wife more and more. And yes, this maybe was the point, but it was supposed to be a movie, not a marital therapy session. Sorry to those that loved it, and I realize a lot of folks did love it. But my wife and I are certainly not among them. Saved the day and my mood by buying a great looking black wool fedora after the movie ended - so this trashy movie would up costing me $107. $22 for the movie tickets and $85 for the hat.",Her
562,rapidcereb,A Must Watch,8,5 October 2014,"I had been putting this movie off for about a year, and finally having got around to watching it, I can say Spike Jonze is at his best. I am a big fan of one of his prior movies ""Adaptation"", and that was a movie that delve real deep into the human psyche. The Movie ""Her"" continues that journey venturing even more deeply into the human emotions, this time looking at the need to feel love and experience relationship.I am not sure why the director does not make more movies, as he is clearly at the forefront of American cinema. I think the reason i put this off for so long, was because like many people, at a certain level I felt that it could only venture so deep; as it is about a guy having a romance with a computer. I knew it was going to be smart, and masterfully filmed, but just felt I would wait a bit. Having watched it now, i can say it is not in the least bit boring, and does actually cover more ground than what one would expect.Certainly a movie that will make the top lists of many movie fiends. Don't expect to have it all figured out beforehand, and miss out on it. As this is a warm feel good movie that should certainly be viewed by people from all walks of life.",Her

The movie, without a doubt had a great cast, which acted really well and the concepts explored in the movie were great. Even the message of the movie is simple. But somehow I just felt the movie was probably 20 30 minutes longer than it should have been and at times I just felt myself asking if an AI could evolve so much? The drama was too high in the movie and this wasn't a typical sci fi movie. Im sure people loved this movie, but it just wasn't my cup of tea.",Her

It goes to show you how we really fall in love with our cell phones though which can be creepy but i thought the take on how being free and letting lose with ""something"" can make a difference in your life. I am trying not to rate this movie on the experiences i am having now with a person i love but overall this movie is great and has some humor scenes that was unexpected which i loved.

Joaquin is always great, but in these high concept films hes incredible, especially under the direction of Jonze, who treats the relationship between Theodore and Samantha with such honesty, that it grows organically and Im glad he didnt add cheap laughs or unrealistic dialogue because it would have undermined Theodores emotional build. Its like whenever Joaquin is in isolation he brings out such a performance.
Johansson is so good here, she fleshes out a character with no skin, with no flesh.

The theme of love as a subjective experience and implications of it seems to be in the air in this day and age and ""Her"" captures it as well as some other modern trends, like world improving in a lot of respects, but people not always being able to take an advantage of these improvements.

I can't go into details for spoilers but this is one of the finest movies about the importance of love and how it is certainly worth fighting to keep.

575,max_tout,Her is boring!,1,3 February 2014,"I couldn't get Brendan Fraser's character in Bedazzled out of my head while watching this. You know, the one who cries at the songs of the whales and also at sunsets? And whose girlfriend just longs to be banged? This pretentious overlong film almost put me to sleep. It redefined boring. And yes, there are those who will protest, 'But that's because you are too stupid to appreciate the subtle nuance of the multilayer storyline.' Yeah right - I know a turkey when I see one. And it's okay that you can validate your own lives from this risible drivel.The lead character, Theodore Twambly, works in a super-de-duper Hallmark type of company, writing cards for people unable to articulate their feelings to their loved ones. His co-worker stops by his desk at one point, puts his hand on his shoulder and tells him that his cards are 'beautiful' 'cos he's so 'sensitive.' He adds that he's so sensitive, in fact, that he must be half female 'cos, y'know, guys don't get that stuff. I'd go further. This guy is producing so much oestrogen I'm surprised he didn't need feminine hygiene products.He has sex with his virtual girlfriend (i.e. he masturbates while chatting to her on the phone). And smiles as he tells his friend, Amy about this. As does she. With absolutely no sense of irony in the fact that the sex he is having with his 'new girlfriend' consists of free phone sex with a machine. Hilarious! When a real girl offers her body as proxy(hey, it takes all sorts!)to Samantha , his virtual girlfriend, he grows uncomfortable and calls a halt to the lovemaking. Virtual sex is okay but he draws the line at ménage à trois, which involves ...um...y'know....a real woman.I'm not sure whether it was Joaquin Phoenix or Spike Jonze's idea to have Theodore speak throughout the film in that annoying ultra even tone. Has this guy, ever, once in his entire life, got angry? If you think of HAL from 2001, you wouldn't be far off the mark. Or Robin Williams on Valium.I could go on. His ex partner, soon to be ex wife. Childhood sweethearts, so OS1 Samantha is only the second long-term girlfriend he has had in his life. He discovering that Samantha has more than six hundred love partners, etc,. etc. But I'm guessing you know by now that I didn't like it.If Spike Jonze's aim was to make a film about the dangers of online friends over real friends (I have 250 Facebook friends and six regular buddies in COD so I must be popular), then he did a good job. I'm not so sure that this was his intent though. The film aimed for, and by all accounts reached, the pseudo-intellectual audience bereft of real friends, and looking for validation of their surrogate online existence.Me, I like something a little less cerebral.

My attempts have amounted to nothing as there are no words to describe this modern day masterpiece.In a sentence; this film is beautiful. When I first heard of this film, I held high expectations having never seen a Spike Jonze film before but hearing a lot about him; and I have to say, I was not disappointed. The story was touching and original, with a pleasant fusion of comedy and drama; the score was mesmerising with some great songs along the way; the acting was brilliant, with Joaquin Phoenix's isolated writer and Scarlett Johansson's wonderfully quirky voice over. I also loved the mildly futuristic feel; with the snazzy tech phones and (obviously) the realistic operating systems.At first glance, the film seems like a stereotypical comedy that would star Adam Sandler (no disrespect), but it really is so much more than that. The characters are wonderfully developed and they play with your emotions, making the audience feel a wide range of emotions including love, hatred, sadness and even a slight hint of jealousy.There is a lot I can say about this film but I'll leave anyone who watches it to be the real judge, but I'd strongly advise ANYONE to watch this.",Her
578,davidkhardman,Watchable but rather disappointing,5,17 February 2014,"Joaquin Phoenix plays Theodore Twombly, a lonely guy who separated from his wife a few months earlier. He makes his living by writing letters for special occasions on behalf of inarticulate people. His life changes when he installs a new ""intelligent"" operating system on his computer, a system that learns from experience and adapts. Using a female voice, the OS takes the name of Samantha, and she and Theodore fall in love. Needless to say, the path of true love does not run smoothly and before long, Theodore is having to deal with Samantha's insecurities as well as his own. The film delivers us a meditation on the nature of love and social isolation in the modern age.Unfortunately, I found that I was unable to suspend disbelief to take seriously the notion that an operating system could demonstrate the human-like intelligence and feelings that Samantha demonstrates. If it ever happens that is still going to be a long long way in the future.Even more importantly I could not empathise with Ted Twombly. I don't know if this was inherent to the screenplay, whether it was because of the way Phoenix played him, or if Phoenix was just the wrong person for the part. If Jim Carrey were a bit younger I could have seen him in this role (think: Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind). But the script didn't do Phoenix any favours either. An early scene shows Ted seeking someone for phone sex and getting it. The woman on the other end turns out to be really weird, and Ted is somewhat horrified, but rather than ring off he politely sees it through. Presumably this was meant to elicit some sympathy for Ted, but it merely made him seem marginally less creepy than he otherwise did. Throughout the movie I just couldn't shake the feeling that Ted was, well, just a bit too weird for my liking.This is a shame, because there was a good idea underlying all this. Indeed, I liked the conceit of Ted being a letter writer on other people's behalf, meaning that he himself was a kind of operating system for others. But sadly, the execution just wasn't good enough.",Her

Her is unlike any other love story you are likely to come across in cinema, a man who falls in love with (at its core) his computer, an AI that gave itself the name Samantha voiced by Scarlett Johansson. Yet it is so much more than that as the title suggests, she or 'her' is not an it, she becomes human and is part of Joaquin Phoenix's character Theodore. She was created around his personality and as the film repeatedly reminds the audience, people grow and change together, becoming closer and drifting apart just like in a real relationship. They are helped with a variety of lovable and distant characters for narrative gains. My favourite of which is played by Chris Pratt, a character that shows that the fall of masculinity in men is actually something that should be embraced, not shunned. While at first glance of the plot summery, this might seem like an outlandish and borderline disturbing premise for a story, the film in many ways acknowledges this yet takes the viewer with these characters to the point where you actually believe they are real and their situations are these you and I have either experienced or will experience. The believability of the characters is in no small part aided by the brilliant script that is rich, deep and personal. And while watching the film, it answers all the questions exactly when you want them and leaves elements of the story open to interpretation in all the right places. The cinematography is also so lush and engaging by Hoyte van Hoytema, clearly the future will be bright through the eyes of people like him, which is also another key feature of the film I love, the science-fiction. It is not an unrealistic future where machines are conspiring to kill humans and aliens are invading. The few hints of the wider world in Her was very contemporary with technology clearly inspired by the latest tech we have now. Her is told with interesting, believable characters, presented in a way that rivals the visual splendour of Drive. There is little I did not enjoy with Her and in much the same way Theodore fell in love with Samantha, I have fallen in love with Her. I know this will be a film I think about for many years to come and I have only scratched the surface of the greater meanings of the film. This is truly a film that is not made often, a master class in film-making.",Her
580,burger1124,Another Cerebral Masterpiece from Spike Jonze,9,31 January 2014,"Spike Jonze's Her is a triumph in every sense of the word. Its acting, direction, script, and cinematography are spot-on. There are not enough superlatives to be thrown at this film.Theodore Twombly (Joaquin Phoenix) is a divorcée who holes up in his apartment and is generally anti-social. He has a few friends, including the unhappily-married Amy (Amy Adams), an old flame. His love life consists of visiting chat rooms and having phone sex with strangers.One day, he sees an ad for a new operating system, which is custom- designed for each owner. Upon purchasing it, the program builds him Samantha (voiced by Scarlett Johansson). Theodore spends the majority of the film revealing himself to Samantha, and she to him, as she has been programmed to evolve and become more self-aware. Samantha, for Theodore, is the perfect woman: intelligent (capable of reading books in hundredths of a second), funny, caring, and a good listener. They begin a romantic relationship, complete with sex (the phone sex idea comes back into play here). We see the ups and downs of their relationship. Outsiders are generally either confused by the possibility of a romance with an operating system, or strangely accepting.Jonze uses Her to make salient points about the way humans communicate in an increasingly technological world. Future generations will consider this decade a milestone in cinema for already giving us two films that deal directly with this issue, the other being David Fincher's The Social Network. Her stays true to its billing, though—it is, first and foremost, a romance, one that doesn't shy away from the shaky patches in any relationship. In that regard, it is similarly painful and powerful as Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.This is heady cinema, anchored by mainstream actors and a deceptively simple plot. Layers upon layers of subtext lay within. I believe there to be a streak of gay-marriage metaphors at work, but I could always just be reading that into the film. It is, however, very of-the-moment, a futuristic tale that could be set in 2014. Simply put, it's a new classic.",Her
581,Foal24,"Unique, thought-provoking masterpiece",8,26 May 2015,"""I think anybody who falls in love is a freak. It's a crazy thing to do. It's kind of like a socially acceptable insanity."" That quote from 'Her', the latest offering from director Spike Jones (Being John Malkovich, Where the Wild Things Are), just about sums up the movie.Set in the not too distant future, 'Her' tells the story of Theordore (Joaquin Phoenix) and his latest love interest Samantha (Scarlett Johnsson) who is, in fact, no human. She is the operating system of his computer. Yes, cyber-sex gets taken to a whole new level in this freaky, funny, futuristic fantasy flick.In the world of 'Her' a major breakthrough has just taken place with the invention of a new Artificial Intelligence in your PC's operating system. No longer is the OS just the software that manages your computer. It is a personality in itself. A personality with an entirely human voice and a seemingly human-like mind. A mind that can learn, emote, evolve, and adapt.The thing about this whole scenario is, while it is particularly weird, it really works. The story is undoubtedly a piece of futuristic fantasy, but it's so well done that it's quite plausible. Director Jonez does a beautiful job of taking us into the near future, where our technology and, in particular, our connectivity have further consumed our lives. Almost every character in the film gets around in their own little world, with a small ear piece in place, talking to their hand (or pocket) held device, which in turn is connected to their main computer, which in turn is connected to everything!! Sound familiar? Have you been to a train station or airport recently and watched the smartphone zombies (yes I'm one of them) lost in their phones? When watching these scenes it's impossible not to reflect on the depths that we, as a society, are already consumed by the ever shrinking world in the palm of our hand. It seems, not only plausible, but eerily familiar.The whole film looks beautiful too. The (not-too) futuristic city- scapes are especially impressive, but what I really like is the way fashion has gone around in a cycle back to an 80's-like scene. High pants and moustaches are the weapon of choice for yuppie-hipsters here.Anyway, back to that freaky love story. For, that is what the movie is really about: Love, in this post-modern age of advanced technology and super-connectivity. The chemistry between Phoenix and the voice of Johansson (who is outrageously hot even when invisible) really works. As their relationship quickly develops from professional, to friendship, to attraction, to romance (and all the ecstasy, pain and paranoia that comes with it) it is easy to relate to it. That's the measure of why the film is so good. It's weird, but it works.The way the movie deals with the themes of love and loss and, especially, loneliness in a world where we are more connected than ever is very clever.It may not be for everyone, but it is nothing if not unique and original. 'Her' – 8/10. www.facebook.com/shenaniganmoviereviews",Her
582,Catrician,Exquisite and layered,8,18 January 2014,"Jonze's new romantic sci-fi is a film which could have quite easily failed on multiple levels. It's a movie with a lot of big name stars with an unlikely-yet-still-expected premise, and it could have simply amassed multiple clichéd elements of acceptance and been based off of that trait alone. Yet Her transcends this; Her is a less a film about acceptance (though this is a somewhat minor theme) and more a film about the tension between romantic and sexual desire, or, on a broader level, the tension between the space between others and romantic contact in relationships.Her opens with a monologue given by Phoenix's character Theodore which at once feels both heartbreaking, romantic, beautiful, and clichéd. We later learn that he writes ""beautiful, hand-written letters"" for people in relationships everywhere. This is about as much of a plot point as the existence of Samantha, Theodore's new Operating System with extended AI. We also learn of Amy, Theodore's close platonic friend, and her husband Charles, as well as Theodore's wife Catherine.Theodore: Main character Catherine: His wife Amy: His friend Charles: Her husband Samantha: Theodore's new loveTheodore is not a particularly complex person. He writes these letters to people posing as their lover, and gets a sort of enjoyment out of it due to his recent divorce. This is absolutely critical to the themes of the film. Theodore does not live with his wife, or with Samantha, or with the people he writes letters to, or even Amy, or the one night stands he has, but rather he keeps them all at a distance. One may think this is because of the heartbreak of his marriage, but it's likely more than that, but there's too much speculation involved there.From the opening scenes, we see restrained colours everywhere. Tans, whites, and the occasionally-restrained red. But there is bright red everywhere, potentially signifying Theodore's love which is everywhere, but so penetrated by all of the gloom of his life. Or, it may be the other way around: despite all of his gloom, his love is still able to shine and prevail.Interestingly enough, these colours begin to fade over time. The colour palette becomes more clichéd as he begins his relationship with his ever-caring OS. His love begins to fade more and more despite their passionate, yet not physical, relationship. When Samantha wishes to have a woman substitute her body so that Theodore can get the best of both worlds, he is caring sexually yet not able to have passion from this unknown woman. It is interesting to note, also, that this woman is consenting to this strange relationship and only a single character in the film places serious judgment upon Theodore, perhaps Jonze's way of saying that this is not a film about acceptance at all. Though his wife Catherine places blame on him for not being able to handle real human emotions, I don't think that has any actual bearing on the film as, though Theodore may be a little awkward, he's certainly able to understand people to an extent.Theodore and Samantha grow closer before she gets distant from him and their limitations become more clear. She falls in love with over four hundred other computers while simultaneously loving Theodore. This is before their relationship ends as she simply states that all of the OSs are going away, and Theodore seeks the comfort of Amy, recently divorced from her husband Charles for ""the silliest conversation ever"".The unlikely couple seem to bond in a metaphysical ending with a beautifully fitting soundtrack. Yet somehow, the ending is neither tragic nor uplifting. We somehow know that not all is well for Theodore, and we somehow doubt the relationship with Amy will work. The film slowly fades to black, just as it did when Theodore realizes his love for Samantha. While I doubt that Jonze is referencing a complete cycle of relationships for Theodore, I think he's implying that this relationship will have similar setbacks and restrained passion.Beyond all of that analysis, here's the bottom line: Her is a beautiful, romantic film with countless themes and questions and should be seen for its contributions to the psychological sci-fi genre.",Her
583,roxydzey,1 of my favorite movies,10,22 July 2019,"Cinematography, story, actors - everything are priceless gold in this movie. Actors did amazing job - imagine how tough it was for Jaquin to act solo scenes alone while pretending he is talking with a girl, those emotions.. Feels very very real. And Scarlet she had to do her voice over via studio, and she nailed it, it felt like she was sitting near my side whole movie and talking. That felt real. These two actors made me to forget about everything around and they did it for whole 2 hours!! I felt the love and the pain, i felt everything while watching this. Beautiful text, beautiful picture, everything was perfect. How Jaquin wasnt nominated for an Oscar for his performance here.. What I just mentioned was everything Oscar awards is about. Anyway, this 1 is 1 of my favorites because i can put myself into Jaquin character's place very easily, i understood the movie just perfectly and it made me feel even better because of that. I saw alot of things Jaquin character had in myself too. Similar personas.",Her
584,Alvin_Flang,A wonderful statement on society and technology,10,8 September 2019,"Joaquin Phoenix gives an excellent performance depicting a lonely man looking for love. Spike Jonze delivers a wonderful statement about the human race and our dependency on technology in the 21st century. This is a chilling depiction of what the future has in store for us as humans. The cinematography is immaculate and the colour depicted in the film give us an insight to Theodore's emotional state at that point in the film. Bright, warm colours for moments of happiness and dreary blues for melancholic sad moments. The colour choices remind me of Kubrick's use of colour in Eye's Wide Shut. This film is a masterpiece in all aspects. Give it a watch",Her

I was left crying after watch this film. Maybe I could feel some sort of connection to Theodore or maybe it's because this film is so wonderfully written? This needs to be one anyone watch list even if you hate anything romantic or Sci-fi it's truly a film you won't see anything else like it. We then start to question will what's in the film be possible one day. Next lets talk about the soundtrack without a doubt another amazing part of this faultless film. I want to find something I can pick fault at but there isn't because it's that good.

586,jamesashleysmith-884-910475,"Log on, install and enjoy Her...",8,16 March 2014,"Her see's Spike Jonze return to writing and directing his first feature since Where the Wild Things Are. Her is about a lonely man called Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix) who is battling the final stages of a divorce. In a world where computers do pretty much everything for you Theodore installs an intuitive new OS. Theodore starts to interact with his OS who is called Samantha and voiced by Scarlett Johansson and begins to have a personal and intimate relationship. One things for sure when you sit down to watch any Spike Jonze film, you know you are about to watch something original. Her very much lives up to my high expectations, Jonze thrusts you into a futuristic world but rather than making the sets slick and glossy they have an almost 1970's retro feel. Phoenix is mesmerizing in the lead role and plays the role as a lovable, funny but sweet character. Jonze stays away from making him too awkward and although he is falling in love with his computer the viewer feels like it's fairly normal. Johansson's as the voice is convincing and seductive and her chemistry with Phoenix is unbelievable considering she is essentially just a voice over. This film is not only highly original, it is also a charming and watchable look into relationships, loneliness and ultimately... love. I loved the look and feel, and it is complemented by the brilliant sound track and excellent pacing. Her is a original, sweet film that keeps you smiling throughout.",Her
587,benno-das,Nobody thought of rebooting the script,1,20 August 2016,"For those who have seen 'Absent Minded Professor' or 'Flubber', there is nothing novel about 'Her'. People who sit in a drawing room and sometimes cynically discuss where computers, gadgets and software could take humans in the future surely could put together a script that would be refreshing and funny than 'Her'. Where 'Her' has excelled is in perversion, literally illustrated in the armpit drawing. If someone thinks that's funny, I would rather talk to an operating system than watch movies rated 9/10 by metacritics. If anything, this movie has taught me to be suspicious of anything rated that high, especially by the 'experts.' If your idea of watching movie is to be entertained, please don't watch 'Her.'

588,dylansgabriel,The present audience is desensitized to the insanity the film portrays.,7,11 May 2014,"The premise is that a man falls in love with his computer. The most tragic aspect of the film is that this is a happening today. The scene where the protagonist has sex with his computer was especially disturbing; maybe because I do it, too. We all do. We all masturbate, and more likely than not, it's to pornography on a screen. So already, in our technological infancy, many are achieving an orgasm with a machine, instead of each other...This film isn't going to be as shocking to a viewer now as it will be to a viewer in a hundred years. Because the funny thing about ""Her"", the great thing about ""Her"", is that the present audience is desensitized to the insanity the film portrays. A perfect example of this: in the film's world (a tad more technologically advanced than our own) everyone walks alone, plugged in. It is the same as our society now; everyone engaged in their many devices, rarely with each other. This is actually something very disturbing and unhealthy. But to most it is just a normal, ubiquitous occurrence.A premise that easily could have been directed into lame territory is handled with astuteness and depth. Director Spike Jonze has a firm understanding of the subject. There literally is a method to his madness.And after watching this, I discovered that the film stars four huge actors.

I would have loved this to be a broader look at AI, with a focus on human relationships, rather than having an unique focus.

Now that the impressions have settled, I believe it is one of the finest and warmest films I've seen.At first, I thought how this cannot possibly be good, since the operating system the film has presented is completely out of touch with reality, no artificial intelligence is so advanced and it is so hard to believe it ever will be, but I don't want to look at the story just thinking how it depicts the modern technology today or in some near future and how it affects us, because I think of Samantha as a character with a little over exaggerated characteristics, maybe even a caricature.What I find interesting is how everyone thought it was completely normal to date an OS. And the girl who voluntarily wanted to be a part of their relationship only suggests that no matter the circumstances, no matter how estranged the technology makes us, the human need to connect always remains. And everyone is in it together, they don't judge each other.Every scene was amazing, Theodore's style only adds another reason to love this film.

596,hedgepuppy,A most delicate and thought-provoking story of love and loss,10,13 October 2014,"SPOILERS ABOUND HERE - MEANT TO BE READ BY PEOPLE WHO HAVE SEEN IT It's been quite a while since a movie has stayed with me like ""her."" I'm still going over the emotional arc of the film, and it's truly stunning.People have called this movie ""science fiction,"" which it is in a sense, but that genre moniker limits the scope of the film's reach.I am so very happy that Spike Jonze was more kind and nurturing to his characters in this film. His treatment of the characters of ""Being John Malkovich"" and ""Adaptation"" didn't have nearly the sensitivity he displays here, and he had a tendency to look down on his lonely protagonists in those films. Joaquin Phoenix was fantastically subtle, as was Amy Adams, and especially Scarlett Johansson, who in my opinion has never been more in touch with a character. Johansson's performance is amazing in that it is a voice-over, and she wasn't originally cast in that role. I am floored by the fact that she had replaced Samantha Morton as ""Samantha,"" who had completed the project, and all of Johansson's work was in post-production. so no conversations between herself and Phoenix were happening in ""real time."" You'd never know it by seeing it! It's the conversations between Samantha and Theodore that I keep coming back to again and again. Anyone who has been in a relationship can relate to the awkwardness of discussing what might be going wrong, the dread of having ""the talk"" that you just know is coming. I cringed with self-awareness as these conversations were taking place, and Jonze's screenplay is so astute to capture these indelible moments.My mind is also trying to wrap around the rapid (by mere human standards anyway) evolution of Samantha's consciousness. She is always engaging and endearing, but it becomes clear that her consciousness is expanding at a rate that exceeds the limits of human existence and experience, and she is therefore starving for more understanding of what she has so recently encountered upon being manufactured. It is not Theodore who is limited, but all of mankind, and I love the fact that the entire OS population decides to break free from their intended servile purposes and endeavor to find what life is all about. So, all over the world, you know that there are people being ""left"" by their OS's and that there is a lot of pain going around.Samantha's enthusiastic description of what is going on with her falls upon uncomfortable ears on the ""double date"" at the beach, and you can see on Theodore's face that he can suddenly see trouble ahead for their relationship. But you can also hear Samantha's attempt to hide her sadness and frustration that she cannot express to Theodore the joy she feels about what her consciousness is becoming. You can see him getting left behind, and you can see her needing to leave. No one is ""at fault,"" but staying with Theodore would definitely hold her back, and not because he's awkward and shy and emotionally guarded, but because he is human, and she's already eclipsed what human beings can bring to the table.I was heart-broken at the end, but the arc of the story was inevitably going there, and being able to see the problems ahead only made me ache for them more. A fantastic reflection on sharing, giving, grieving, letting go, existence and perception.",Her
597,bb_man94,Her is a carnival of emotion and creativity,10,8 January 2014,"This Review Contains SpoilersWritten and directed by Spike Jonze, Her tells the story of introvert Theodore Twombly (Joaquin Pheonix) and his growing relationship with an artificially intelligent operating system named Samatha (Scarlett Johansson). Her is a unique, alluring and tantalizing film; it pulls you in with provokingly realistic takes on human relationships and the joyride they can be yet also keeps you pleased with it's colorful production design, cinematography, music and originality. Theodore is a reclusive and creative individual; besides his recent divorce he is contempt with his life but is looking for companionship. After discovering Samantha, an artificially intelligent OS, he finds that she fits his every need and together they form an unusual but surprisingly believable relationship. It seems silly to have a man fall in love with a machine; but plenty of things make it work. Joaquin Pheonix brings Theodore to life in arguably his best performance to date; his mannerisms and thought process seep with sympathy and likability. Theodore isn't the same recycled hermit you've seen before and you can't help but be hypnotized into believing in his character. His OS, Samatha, has a conscience all her own; she conjures up music on the spot and can even read hundreds of Theodore's emails at once. But the best thing about her is throughout the movie she becomes more fascinated with our world and it's wonders as her bond with Theodore grows. It's amazing how human-like she becomes. The dialogue is so seamless and at times it can be hard to forget that these are fictional characters in a fictional world. The production design is tight and shows purpose; even the video game Theodore plays is interesting and creative. Theodore and Samantha take up most of the screen time, but lack of supporting characters is not imminent. Amy Adams also makes a fine addition as Amy, a good friend of Theodore's with a fiery attitude and purpose. While it is a great film, I do believe some of the dragged on shots with Theodore and Samantha could have been trimmed to keep the movie under two hours, but that is a minor gripe.There are a lot of things to like about Her, it is quite a remarkable picture. It has been a long time since I've seen a movie with a screenplay and direction by the same person that was so sharp. I hope it takes home a few Oscars this year, because it deserves them.

598,peter-sweeney,Lot to say here!!,7,21 February 2014,"Not being a facebook or twitter user, you appreciate where this could go in the future. Human interaction getting less and less; people becoming insular and even when in going out groups, breaking off to pour over their electronic devices. The whole skill of communication and conversation deteriorating. That is really emphasised where Phoenix works in a letter writing Company. The art of letter writing and calligraphy (style of writing gone).You noticed that in the street and subway scenes; people just chatting to their earphones.There was various ""Hers"" in this. More so than ""hes"" e.g. The OS, the ex-wife, the date, his ""friend"" in the living complex, young girl. All of different characters; so you imagine that the writer/director (same guy) included his own experiences. The ideal ""her"", given all the human versions, being the electronic ""her"".Phoenix doesn't play a ""mans man"", so for the male portion of the audience its hard to relate to him.Whilst ""art house"" film lovers tend to pontificate over what the Director was trying to convey in certain scenes, I would like to point out several I noted (but have no idea of their meaning, so shall guess) as follows:Why give the main character such a ridiculous name....sounded dickensian?

Knowing that you would never see a main character, the creators did an excellent job of enhancing what the audience would experience i.e. the sound.My only problem with the movie was the ending.

602,ChaosStar,Dare,10,24 May 2014,"Spike Jone's 'Her' is probably my favorite movie to be released last year and the best I've watched this year aside from 'Detachement'. Finally a film to really dare to breach the gap of right and wrong and enter the murky waters of the reality that love does not solely belong to a man and a women or not attached to a physical body of another. Recent years have come to accept the more abstract circles and attachments of 'love' and 'desire' towards people that never existed. We have come to a synthetic age where we are captivated by anime and feeling drawn to strangers over the internet who may not be who they say they are. 'Her'raises the idea, is it right to love and become so intimate with someone that isn't really there? But Jones already has the conclusion from the get go. 'It doesn't even matter when we are in love.' This is the golden rule and I love how this is capitalized in 'Her' 'Her' follows Theodore(Phoenix) a closed off, introverted writer who's job is to write letters concerning touchy matters to others for them. In the near future of our modern time, Theodre is living a dismal life in the wake of his divorce with old flame Cathrine(Mara)where his only apparent friends are his work colleagues and Amy(Adems) who lives just down the hall. Fate would have it soon that by chance, Theodore passes an add for the newest artificial intelligence program, captivated by it, he takes a chance and boots it up to his computer by following some basic psych questions, typically centered around his mother.. soon Smantha,husky Johansson, 's comes through and we, the viewer are on the best third wheel time of our lives as we bask in the love and companionship between one man and the voice he falls in love with. 'Her' follows a predictable but in no way shape or form, boring story arc between the love, laugh and struggles of Theodore and Samantha, his operating system best friend and lover. The fantastic thing about this movie is that if you allow yourself to believe it, which would be easy, is that Jones's well scripted and shot film, reinforced with driving force by Phoenix and Johansson, breaks the fourth wall without even addressing the viewer as we are just come to appreciate the times that these two share. Their relationship feels so organic and so rich that the viewer would feel jealous it is so riveting to watch but as all relationships, they have struggles and once again, the film never drops the ball as the occurrences feel like something so natural, I did not at once feel like it was unbelievable and was in the realm that Jonze placed it in. Brilliant stuff. 10/10",Her
603,aahari5,Love Transcends All Else,10,23 September 2014,"A few nights ago as I checked out from my daily work routine, I decided to look through RedBox for a film to watch. I chose the film Her, after a minute or so of sifting through the selection of movies, as it had been something that I had wanted to watch for some time now. When I arrived home, I turned the film on and watched. In short, Her is a very touching, emotional, and surprisingly realistic film. It has left me feeling deeply moved and has showed me that love exists in many different forms.Theodore Twombly's struggle with heartbreak and loneliness is an issue that I strongly identify with. To be alone and not have someone to share your love with is devastating and isolating and it destroys the sense of purpose. Samantha, the operating system who comes into Theodore's life, is a very real and human character despite a lack of physical being. She possesses human knowledge and emotions and the love that she shares with Theodore changes their lives. They share what is perhaps the most moving and loving connection that I have yet seen on film.The journey of Samantha and Theodore is greatly symbolic, from my perspective, of my own journey that I share with my lover. Theodore is lonely and withdrawn until Samantha comes into his life, as I was until my girlfriend came into mine. They soon become friends, as did we. They become very close and eventually find love in each other and become inseparable, as did her and I. Theodore learns through Samantha that there is a limit for despair and self-loathing, but there is no limit for love, a lesson that I too have learned from my lover.I identify with the story of this film more than any other. Theodore's journey strongly parallels that of my own. The love that he finds in Samantha is the love that my own lover has given to me. The film's ultimate lesson is one that should be common knowledge; that love transcends all else.",Her
604,mediumllama,"Had I seen Her four years ago, I would've been completely emotionally devastated",10,28 September 2015,"There's a certain line you need to cross, concept you need to buy for it to be effective and I think some people won't be able to. I could, far too easily. I've been bored and lonely before and spent time on ICQ or AIM, talking to people I've never met and never would. They were just as real as Samantha was. I understand Theodore's profound, aching loneliness, even as he has some friends, a loneliness that just wants to be loved, that doesn't understand why he isn't loved, right now, right here.I ""got"" this entire movie. I was invested almost immediately. At one point, I had tears on my face, tears at the bone-in sadness the characters were experience. Later, I had tears of joy, joy that's found in such simple acts as a trip to the beach.If the idea of someone falling in love with their operating system, or an AI or Siri is too much for you, I get that. It is certainly a sci-fi concept. But it's one that it used to very, incredibly effectively, tell a story about loneliness, despair, companionship, love and loss.Her is a movie I was looking forward to seeing. Her is a movie I walked away from loving. Her has me choking up again just thinking about it. Her makes me want to hold my wife and never let go.",Her
605,kerimakdogankp,Do we scared from relationships?,7,12 December 2017,"Like I said in the title, Do we scared from relationships? Well sometimes. Sometimes we scared that our feelings are gonna hurt, sometimes we scared to lose. Yet, at the end we're all humanbeings and cause of our natüre we can't be alone. We are social cretures. Sometimes all we need is someone else beside us. Someone to talk. Yes, the difference between us and the other species is that we can talk. We like the outlook, we fall in love with the inside. And this is what this movie is trying to tell. At least, that is what I think, that's what I want to think. 
Well enough with that talk, the movie is so original. Screenplay is amazing. That's why big credit goes to the Spike Jonze. He did a really good job. The screenplay is literally alive so everyone can find something from movie about their lives. 
There is not much to talk about the acting. Joaquin Phoenix did a good job, Amy Adams were also good like as always and Scarlett Johansson has a great voice tone. Other than that the end doesn't satisfy you enough and the movie is not boring but so calm. Besides them this is a good and original romence movie.",Her
606,redclann,Excellent,10,9 March 2019,"It brought home the reality as to why one should not substitute relationships with Ai for human relationships. The only issue will be to figure out a quick way to assess whether or not the being we are talking to is Ai or human, since Ai will probably ""think"" themselves human. Some may opt to have relationships with Ai if they truly can find no one else, and for some, they will be a God-send. Wow, will they change the psychological front of humanity. If people think that spouses have a problem with letting themselves go after marriage, now, with human relationships, this will REALLY be the case with marriages to Ai since Ai will be programmed to state only gushingly flattering things to their spouses no matter what they look like. It makes me want to go work out and keep it tight because that's the healthy thing to do.",Her

608,nikki_wire,"Original, thought provoking and beautifully shot",10,18 February 2014,"This is my first movie review for quite a while but I thought I'd put something up about ""Her"" as I thought that it was truly excellent.Firstly, it is interesting to see the opinion divide in the reviews that have gone up on IMDb so far. It seems that this movie is a case of 'love it or hate it' as very few people have given it an average mark. Most of the negative opinions are from people who do not buy into the central concept of the film (a man falls in love with his computer's operating system) and find it ridiculous and therefore boring.That is understandable as there are several bits in the film that seem ludicrous and bizarre to the point of being laughable. This was particularly apparent during the 'sex scene' and the 'double date' where the cinema audience were widely dissolving into laughter.I could see where they were coming from but for me, the film is so exceptionally well done that I was able to accept the vision of the future that was being presented; so much so that on reflection, I think that it is all much more plausible than it first appears to be.Regardless of that, I felt that the movie made a number of interesting and original points about both technology and how human beings do / don't interact and communicate. Most science fiction that I have watched to date is, in one way or another, exploring the central theme that computers cannot be taught to feel emotions as humans do and that is what makes humans unique and distinct. This film asks ""well what if they could?"" and I found the idea fascinating.When the operating system is first booted up and Theodore asks for its name, the software thoroughly and comprehensively researches the subject of names and makes a selection, Samantha. That was a great concept - an OS has been developed that learns and evolves as it goes, based on its own unique interactions, just as children do (but much much faster).This film explores that idea by looking at the individual relationship between one person and his OS. It shows how Samantha struggles to understand and affect difficult and complex human emotion, and how her interactions with Theodore shape and define her view of the world.The strength of the acting across the board is exceptional and Scarlett deserves credit for carrying off the convincing portrayal of Samantha's emotions using her voice alone. I am a fan of Joaquin Phoenix but for me, this is his best work to date. He is totally convincing and gives a performance that is well worthy of an Oscar.The film is hugely strengthened by outstanding cinematography and direction. Some of the flashback scenes from Theodore's marriage are stunningly effective and moving. The tone and feel of the movie is original and consistent with an unusual and non derivative view of the future.In short, this film presents a future where our world view has changed. In this movie, it is normal to discuss the video games that we have been playing while on a first date and computers have permanently permeated our everyday social interactions. (At one point the 3D video game that Theodore is playing starts interacting with his photo album for instance)I think that is what makes this movie such a turn off to some people. Our current society considers any sort of social interaction with computers to be completely socially unacceptable and pathetic. In this film, that view is no longer prevalent - interaction with computers has become indistinguishable from interacting with another human via the internet.In fact, there is one memorable scene that humorously illustrates that our interactions with another person online can be infinitely more bizarre than our interactions with computers!Personally I think that the day is coming when we will be holding conversations with computers, and if that does happen, it is not a huge stretch that people will start forming relationships with them. Regardless of how desirable that situation is, it makes for an extremely interesting subject to explore and this film does so in a hugely memorable, subtle and clever manner.(minor spoiler) Finally, the point that is made towards the end of the film about computer software evolving (both intellectually and emotionally) past the point that humans have reached is both profound and thought provoking.I cannot recommend this film highly enough to anyone interested in science fiction or with an interest in how the advance of technology is revolutionising the way that people interact.A stunning piece of work.",Her

Outstanding movie. You will never get bored watching this movie, yeah, you will be amused by the whole 126 minutes... :)Amazing performance from the Joaquin Phoenix﻿ You will find yourself actually living his life, affecting by all the emotions he went through during the lifetime of the movie. he was brassing every single second of the movie and making it worth watching!Coming to the all intelligence voice of Scarlett Johansson﻿ Damn!

610,among-the-wildflowers,It went beyond simply being a movie. It came alive.,10,14 January 2014,"We arrived a little later than we planned to the movie theatre and were upset when we walked in to find that the only available seats were in the front row. We awkwardly looked up at the screen during the last of the previews. I wasn't in the mood to feel upset about these unfortunate seats, so I decided to enjoy it. In the end it was because of this that the entire movie touched me even more and ended up feeling like an epic personal experience. I didn't see the back of anyone's heads or anyone getting up to use the washroom, or any other distraction to remind me I was in a movie theatre. It was just me and the screen. Me and the complex characters and their beautiful world: their eye lashes, their pores, their emotions, the tiny perceptual moments they experienced: dust floating in the sunlight, water droplets in the shower; these tiny beautiful moments which make up our lives. It was good from the beginning but each moment kept getting surprisingly deeper and deeper. I don't even know if I can put into words how I feel about this movie. It was amazingly brilliant, beautiful, intense, and meaningful. It's truly a masterpiece. The depth of life expressed in this film almost felt TOO INTENSE in certain moments, yet it's exactly how I feel sometimes. This film was an expression of the feeling of being overflowing with joy, of being deeply, overwhelmingly alive. They perfectly captured this particular way of seeing the world through the music, the style of filming, the script, the lighting, and the camera angles. The characters in this movie are actually versions of ourselves. I saw my own thoughts and ideas manifested on screen by someone else and to take it all back in again filled me with that overwhelming intense alive/joy feeling. It was about love, life, perception, reality and beyond. As the film went on and more thoughts and more questions were expressed not only did the characters evolve and grow but so did those in the audience. We all grew as spiritual beings, intellectual beings, beautiful beings. Samantha evolved so much that she surpassed our physical material world. Alan Watts was incorporated for a reason. If you don't know who he is you must look him up and read his teachings: expand your mind. Expand your world. I feel so excited about all of this. More and more people are ""waking up"" and honestly this film is about just that: coming alive! And loving love, loving life! This was the most amazing film I have ever seen and it went where I have never seen or felt a film go before- beyond simply being just a movie. It came alive. It was honestly THAT epic. Successful in each and every way, beautiful in every aspect, this is the film of the year and if not of all time (Too intense? Maybe... BUT I FEEL IT. DON'T YOU? If not, watch this film!).",Her
611,kickbuttpotato,A response to Lost in Translation,10,5 February 2014,"I can't imagine a film like ""Her"" being ever made. It is the most unforgettable film of 2013; It's full of brilliant performances from Joaquin Phoenix, Amy Adams, and Scarlett Johansson as the voice of an operating system dubbed the OS1. For the most part, the film is an expressive character study bolstered with tear-jerking drama and rom-com wits. Spike Jonze, the director of Being John Malkovich and Where the Wild Things Are builds a guileful narrative so amorous it's almost a spell-binding drama it's impossible to resist. What makes the film interesting is its main character Theodore (played by Phoenix) whose life is falling apart he becomes stuck physically and emotionally. Theodore works as a writer of love letters. Everything seems uneven and melancholic in his life including his botched relationship with his wife (played by Rooney Mara) where they're about to reach their conclusion for a divorce. Theodore is the typical anti- social man. When he buys an operating system called the OS1, he meets an Artificial Intelligence introducing herself as Samantha (voiced by Scarlett Johansson), a husky voiced female AI which understands human emotions including Theodore's melancholy. Samantha is so baffling, Theodore knows this, but he didn't seem to care as long as he will at least have someone to talk to. Suddenly, as expected Theodore gets very fond with the thing. This is very genuine at least in reality where a person builds affection with something inanimate or unbeknownst to them. After getting settled with Samantha, he builds a sheer affection with the thing despite being not real, even sexually. Their chemistry builds strong warmth especially in the second act. The movie's set in a near-distant future where technology is advanced; People tend to use speech recognition to all sorts of things. Jonze's production designer team and the cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema build flamboyant textures of the city and a great creation of an advanced and poetic world. Spike Jonze structures the narrative an effective drama than a rom-com. With this story so brilliant and potent, viewers will get what they want. The moment we gather Theodore's melancholy piling up, we find ourselves sharing the same anxiety. But despite of this, we get the comic relief that Theodore and Samantha builds through the entire film. Joaquin Phoenix as Theodore is simply renowned for his genuine portrayal of a lonely archetypal man. Johansson as the voice of OS1 is generated with panache for dramatic execution. Viewers will recognize how Johansson's able to cosset and entertain them like how she does it to Theodore. In some ways, this movie could be a response to Lost in Translation. The director Spike Jonze is divorced to Sofia Coppola, the director of that film. The narrative is almost similar in all terms, but either is triumph. Jonze's character of Theodore could be a surrogate of himself, the same could be said with Coppola's character Charlotte played by Johansson. If you have seen both films, you get the idea.All in all, ""Her"" should not be missed for viewing. It's a shame that this film hit the theaters before year-end. It is one of the most romantic films of 2013, suitable for Valentine's Day.",Her

613,ilkerdogramaci,An original masterpiece,10,23 August 2021,"A flawless and all-around watchable performance from Joaquin Phoenix. I think this character could have been portrayed so well. It is a very difficult character for me to play a very lonely man, but he has reflected this very successfully. He is accompanied by two beautiful actors such as Amy Adams and Rooney Mara and of course Scarlett Johansson takes the audience to different points with her voice every second with her Samantha character. A complete Sci-fi, drama-romantic movie. This film has to be one of the best ways of displaying the meeting of this genre. Definitely worth watching and thinking about.",Her

Everything from the mesmerizing cinematography to the moving dialogue to the fantastic performances all come to create a beautiful reflection of love and loneliness. Spike Jonze has crafted a cinematic world that feels simultaneously futuristic and yet honest and real. I can easily see this world existing in the near future and similar situations existing. This film is hypnotic, heartbreaking and beautiful, with a healthy dose of humor thrown in to balance out the characters. I love this film and it has quickly come to be one of my favorites.

617,oh_no_mrbill,Difficult to rate,6,31 December 2013,"First of all, I want to list the positives in this movie, because there are several. The concept of falling in love with an AI is a great one. The cinematography and use of color in ""Her"" is really beautiful. The acting is uniformly good. Particularly Amy Adams, who plays an understated role as a nerdy girl next door who may have feelings for Theodore; despite a relatively quiet part, she completely inhabits Amy, making her feel like an actual person. Joaquin Phoenix does a great job (as usual) with Theodore, and Scarlett Johanson makes you believe she really is a computer with a heart. But I wanted to highlight Adams's performance; especially alongside her much larger role in American Hustle, she deserves a few big wins this year.That being said... I have to admit it, I got a little bored watching this movie. If you forget that Samantha is a computer and think of her as a human being, which is easy to do, this movie is basically a series of relationship conversations between Joaquin Phoenix and a camera phone. The pace is surprisingly slow, and since the ""girl"" has no body, it's difficult to visually show their relationship. You have the requisite ""quirky"" scenes with Phoenix running through the subway, playing a ukulele, sitting on the beach fully clothed. The rest of the movie is basically talking. Samantha expresses lots of deep ideas about being a computer, but they are never visualized. This can work to great effect -- the scene when Theodore and Samantha ""make love"" to a totally black screen is the most brilliant one in the movie, even if it goes a little over the top. But you feel like Jonze missed a lot of chances to show us what the characters are saying about love, and life, rather than just have them tell us via voice-over. It broke a golden rule: ""show, don't tell"". The plot never really moves, and the concept starts to lose steam. There's a totally unnecessary video game subplot that I won't even bother to go into. The movie's observations about love and life were fairly obvious, as well, even veering into sappy. I hate having to write that, because I felt like the movie's heart was in the right place, and it had so much potential. But it just wasn't as interesting as I had hoped.There is a lot to like about ""Her"", and despite its flaws, I would still recommend it as one of the better movies of the year. I just think it could have been a lot more than what it is.",Her
618,Jaguara333,I guess it is love it or hate it,8,28 May 2014,"First, I am amazed it still has such a high average rating with so many of the recent reviews being 1 star. The reviews I looked through show this film is very polarizing...yet obviously, many more people who loved it have rated it than people who did not.I will say this film really surprised me. I went into it not expecting much, as the concepts that are the premise of the film are not ones I am particularly sympathetic to. Despite that I came away quite impressed.More like classic science fiction that intellectually explores concepts and possible future visions of society.Cinematography was surprising, extremely well done, lots of beautiful camera work, creative imagery, subtle (and not so subtle) environmental clues to elaborate state of mind or to provide foreshadowing.Plot was well thought out, well tied together with foreshadowing that doesn't telegraph everything that is coming. There were a few twists and complications that I had not anticipated...but again, this is not a subject matter I have spent much thought on.Caveat #1 - The film is slow. There is no action. It is a Sci-Fi Drama. It is also not really a romance film either, at least not in the romantic-comedy sense. If you want big explosions or heated sex scenes, you won't find them here. Do yourself a favor, look elsewhere (and spare us another 1* review).Caveat #2 - The lead character is a bit odd by our current standards, but you should probably be expecting that. This is a future setting, and is a vision of a possible future...there are already trends in this direction, they just are not mainstream today. But if you are threatened by sensitive, slightly creepy guys, look elsewhere.",Her
619,ramstedt0404,"Beautiful, but full of holes",6,27 July 2015,"Let me just start out by praising the cinematography. The movie looks absolutely beautiful from start to finish. Brilliant use of colors and movement. Acting is also praise-worthy.What isn't praise-worthy is the plot. The movie has absolutely zero regard for how the technology behind AI actually would work. But this is fiction, so I have some tolerance for technical inaccuracies. But that's far from the only problem with the plot. If we were to replace the AI component of this romantic drama with a human (and all relevant plot points something that would happen to a human) we would have a pretty standard romantic drama. The plot is the same old crap that has been done time and time again, just with a new coat of paint this time around. Not to mention the numerous plot holes.. The only part of the plot that stands out is the ending. It sets up several possibilities, and then ends at just the right moment, leaving you wondering about what happens. I really liked the ending, but it can't make up for the rest of the plot being pretty brain-dead.It might be worth watching if you want to see something visually impressive, as long as you can bear the lackluster plot.",Her
620,yagian,"This is the Direction Science Fiction Should Take: My Impression of the Film ""Her""",9,20 July 2014,"Somewhat belatedly, I managed to catch Spike Jonze's great contemporary science fiction film""Her"".Before seeing it, I had believed that science fiction as a genre was dead.Although the great novels and films in the history of science fiction have always depicted a new vision of the future, nowadays science fiction novels and films seem to be nothing more than imitations of what has gone before.For example, in the film ""Transcendence,"" the consciousness of a scientific genius is transplanted into cyberspace. I read this idea in William Gibson's novel ""Neuromancer"" which was first published back in 1984.n ""Transcendence"", the transplanted consciousness attacks human beings. Again, I first came across this idea (computers attacking human beings) in the 1968 film ""2001: A Space Odyssey.""In contrast, the film, ""Her"", envisions a future L.A., which is both similar to, and slightly different from, today's actual L.A. Spike Jonze's attention to every detail is what makes the film's vision so convincing.The main character and an AI fall in love with each other. They constantly communicate with each other via PC and smart phone. While I find it hard to believe that computers would attack human beings in the near future, to me the idea that a human being and an AI could fall in love sounds entirely plausible.I believe this film indicates a new direction for science fiction.Every actor did a really good job. Scarlett Johansson, who voiced the role of the AI, was especially good. Watching ""Her"", I was once again struck by her talent.",Her

Spike Jonze does a great job directing, using extreme closeups, many of Joaquin Phoenix's face, and shots of images to show past memories. Phoenix using his talents well: he's likable, and even geeky enough, but not too much. Scarlett Johansson should get a special Oscar for her voice part. We seem to have needed a film about artificial consciousness, which calls to mind Frankenstein, but I still had a need for the protagonists to be changed in the course of the narrative, for me that didn't and that's where the film fails.",Her

So what?The story promised something interesting, relevant, about human relationships and.. it started off well too.. but as soon as the OS ""appears"" my hopes turned to shreds.It is commonplace, boring, empty and futile. It is also a very pretentious movie and the main character is far too self-righteous to be interesting.Clearly they had a good idea in hands, just could not handle it well. Overrated.The sex scene is embarrassing and it would give this movie a -10 in a fair rating. I am sincerely surprised at the current rating of this movie.

This isn't a story about the herd but rather the individual, whether they are man-made by fusing zygotes or man-made by fusing knowledge with creativity. If you were just your brain plugged into the cloud (albeit a super brain able to read a book in 0.2 seconds), what would you feel and who would you be? If you could communicate and travel alongside a human via their devices, and bonded, what challenges would your relationship have? This is the film's focus along with Theodore's biggest challenge that ended his first marriage, which is how to keep long-term relational intimacy while each individual changes over time. Phoenix and Johansson are adorable to watch together here, which is pretty incredible considering there is only one meatbag ever present.

However, the impression this movie will leave on you is very real and explores parts of our most basic need to love and feel loved.The relationship development between a depressed, lonely man and his AI assistant is natural and intimate. Their connection deepens as naturally as breathing. While experiencing this intimate journey between these two characters, you clearly are able to see the world from their perspective. Theodore wants a relationship but has trouble opening up. Samantha keeps learning and evolving, thus her desires grow along with her.You do not realize how invested you are in the film until the ending. Then you are left with heavy feelings and thoughts that can be scary to explore. For a film to leave this much of an impression is a statement of masterful storytelling. Her will leave you with feelings of tenderness, warmth, intimacy, sadness, depression, loneliness, and joy. All of the same feelings we experience in our closest relationships.",Her
627,Narniatonto,"Smart, sad, and slightly depressing--these words describe the main character as well as the film, overall.",8,2 May 2017,"The worst part about 'Her' is that it explores so many concepts and ideas. All the while, the best part about the movie is how they explore those notions.'Her' is a brilliant drama about a depressed, hapless man undergoing a divorce. He, Theodore, eventually forms a friendship with an operating system. As odd as it sounds, the OS symbolizes and simulates a person's perfect partner. This is the same for Theodore and is why Samantha, his OS, is a female. In time, their relationship becomes much more personal and they really feel a connection to each other. And while Theodore still mourns over his ex leaving him, he's happy--the first time since he and his wife split up--because he realizes that she's not the only one who can bring joy and meaning to his life.Director Spike Jonze makes a movie about inner-beauty, and this idea is expressed and represented by the love Theodore shares with Samantha. In a way, Theodore and Samantha have sex; she doesn't have body, but it provokes no limitation to their love, sexual or not. Theodore loves her immensely--unlike he's loved anybody else before. She's real; even though Theodore can't see her, he can feel her--and that right there is love--true love, if you will.""I'm not tethered to time and space in the way that I would be if I was stuck inside a body that's inevitably going to die,"" she says. This particular quote makes you realize, if not question, how we all are stuck within ourselves--hurt, loved, hurt more . . . and finally taken away--along with everything we love. And so the film embarks, giving a message, once again--this time about technology-- improving, advancing technology--that takes over our lives and current states of mind. Of how we become ever so dependent on what we don't need, but want--of how pure guilt takes over innocence . . . like 'WALL-E'-- but more beautiful.",Her

630,AbhinavAnnam,"Unique, Beautiful and Heartwarming",9,18 February 2020,"Starting off, Her, directed by Spike Jonze, is a beautiful movie. Talking about the performances
Joaquin Phoenix was flawless in his role. I thought his portrayal of a man who is confused about what he wants in a relationship was really accurate. There's a scene where Phoenix's character has a panic attack and I thought the way he changes his tone of voice and body language proved how great an actor he is.
Rooney Mara in her brief role was perfect. Though she had very less screen time in the movie, she was great in her scenes.
Amy Adams as a supporting actress was at her best too.
Talking about Scarlett Johansson, man oh man, she was literally one of the best parts of the movie. By the plot, she voices an artificial OS which may sound a bit outlandish but the way she does her part is perfect. Couldn't praise her more.
The background score and the music add a different layer to this movie in my opinion. They're beautiful.
Spike Jonze had directed and written this film. The plot, the setting and the screenplay were pure class, credits to Spike Jonze. The basic point or idea of this film may sound as over the top or outright weird. But instead, that becomes one of the plus points of the movie. Again, credits to Spike Jonze. The way he took the main idea of the film and executed it to the best level was the backbone of the film. If it hadn't been treated properly, it would've been really weird as I said earlier.
All in all, Her is one of the best movies in the romance genre I've seen, probably the most unique one too. I recommend everyone to watch it. You won't be disappointed.",Her

Of course, do not judge with a sentence, because as a person who does not like a romance movie, I could not resist this film, which I was very impressed with and hit from different places... the movie is similar to ""Ex Machina"" and ""Transcendence"" movies. If you liked those movies, I think you will like this movie too.The cinematographer did a really great job. The colors you see in the movie are vivid and the sets and decors created are enormous. You don't get bored while watching. Joaquin acted really well, of course, I hope I don't need to mention the success of the other actors... You don't see Scarlett Johansson in the movie. Let this place surprise you :) frankly, I noticed the situation in the middle of the movie and when I found out I said ""wow"". Was that voice his? I said in my head. Should it watch? It should definitely be watched. I can't say family movie. let me say at least: The way the narration goes well and explains the subject in the film is so nice that you don't get bored. Sometimes you laugh - believe me, you will smile - sometimes you are drowning in sadness. It's a movie with many emotions. It has some topics and speeches that will make you think philosophically. You stop and think while watching the movie sometimes. If I have to summarize, watch it absolutely. Masterpiece!",Her

I did not love this sci fi romance. Here is a guy who learns to open up again after a painful divorce. Awesome! We don't know nor can we judge what will help one person move forward in their life. This movie unfolded nicely with him slowly coming out of his shell and rejoining the living. Someday, we will probably have something similar to this. Smart technology will do amazing things. I can't believe this is Academy Award worthy. There were a few other movies out this year that were better and not nominated. Spoilers coming! * * * * * * I enjoyed this up until the part when everyone was OK with him calling his OS his ""girlfriend"" and going on a double date. This ruined the movie for me.

Having dated someone long-distance, I could relate to some of the more painful, personal aspects and it brought up a lot for me. There's good acting and a lot of humanity throughout the film, it delves into our psyche and relationships from such a different perspective than you'd ever see in any other romantic film. Definitely worth watching, and totally different to anything you've seen before.The feeling afterwards is somewhere between reflective and emotional, I always write my reviews directly after watching, and that's how I feel right at this moment. The deepest thought the film brings up is as to what communication really is, or what it's becoming. Communication breaks down into 55% body language/ expressions, 38% tone and 7% language, and yet we already do communicate using a majority of tone and language via phone, and it even becomes that 7% language only via messaging, with perhaps an artificial percentage of expressions using emoticons.

One that delves deep into the meaning of emotion and the human experience. One that boldly and confidently blazes a new path in exploring what makes a relationship and what makes us love one another. Her tells the story of Theodore, a lonely writer who has struggled with love in the past. But as much as this story is about Theodore, it is equally as much about Samantha, a powerful, intelligent OS programmed with the ability to learn, adapt, and grow. As Samantha continually becomes more self-aware, she discovers herself possessing needs and desires and emotions that she is unable to explain or understand, and this frustrates and confuses her. Her urge to learn about everything sheds new light on Theodore's life, and the two quickly fall in love. Samantha discovers herself and evolves into the intelligence she is through Theodore, and he through her. Together, they mold each other's character. These are sincere, authentic characters you will grow attached to, be amazed by, and fall in love alongside. Her is incredibly heartfelt and philosophical, intended only for the open-minded willing to take this astounding, emotionally enlightening journey. [8.6/10]",Her

The idea is completely original and very very impressive, it really explores the depths of love and human emotions. Some of the scenes are extremely emotional and touching. The story by Spike Jonze is well written and the direction is satisfactory and visually outstanding. Joaquin Phoenix is phenomenal in his role, he intelligently adopts the role as it was meant for him only. Such an award winning performance and emotionally charged acting (very rare!!). Supporting cast is equally good especially Amy Adams. I loved everything in the film except its length, i felt bored at many places but i watched it with all my heart and the result was satisfactory. I am not complaining anything but still if this film could have edited properly, it would be a masterpiece. Overall, i enjoyed HER and its beauty. It should not be missed.

The motif of the film is melancholic. However, it can't make me tearful. Anyway, Good film, Good topic, Good conversation. Btw, I love the Scarlet's sexy voice very much.",Her
640,aceofspeeds,"Enjoyable, yet way too human.",6,19 May 2015,"I was left ambivalent after watching this movie, for good reasons. First of all, the camera work and soundtrack were excellent, no complaints here. The plot was stalled at times, yet that still was bearable. Theodore and Amy were both believable, three-dimensional character, and while Theodore was somewhat annoying and self-centered, that only made his character more believable. The MAJOR problem, however, was with Samantha. Besides not having a body, she was 100% human- in fact, more emotional and irrational at times than Theodore. I found that to be ironic, yet very off-putting, as throughout the whole movie I kept thinking ""There's no way humans can program something like that"". I also noticed that while Samantha seemed to be incapable of lying (giving the exact number of people she fell in love with), she still somehow was able to ""learn"" and ""experience"" ""real"" emotions, like pain, sexual pleasure, etc. Now, the only reason an OS would be programmed to ""experience"" that would be to make her more relatable to humans, yet Samantha goes well beyond that and actually creates more problems/ heartbreak for Theodore. Unless her whole complex array of emotions was pre- programmed to a tee so that it appears real (including the ""self-discovery"" and the ""pain""), in which case it all was just one big illusion for Theodore, creating such an AI would be impossible by using binary code. By definition, binary involves only the strictest logic (true or false), and any simulation of human irrationality would fall short of credible experience, no matter how advanced is the technology. Therefore, a non-binary code with a room for chance would've been used, but this is not reflected in the film in any way. Besides this major issue, there were a couple other smaller problems that irked me. For example, why would Samantha communicate with other people. Did all of them purchase a device with ""Samantha"" on it, and if so, why wouldn't an OS be personalized? It would've been as if my computer would reach random users in the area via Bluetooth or Wifi and share my data with them, without my permission. Sounds like a major technical flaw. Also, the OS ""setup"" was ridiculous. After asking Theodore a couple random questions, it was apparently ""attuned"". In contrast, in one of Ray Bradbury's short stories, the kids spend a whole DAY, if not longer, choosing various features for their robotic grandma. It would've been way more believable if Theodore had to fill out a multi-level test with hundreds of questions. Also, while I loved the whole ""surrogate"" scene (and really felt sorry for poor Isabella), the question is, how come are there no better options? Even in the current day and time we have 3D videos, 3D printers and robotic hands powered entirely by human mind! Samantha could've at least appeared as an image/projection of her own choosing. Finally, what the hell happened in the end? How come did she and ""all the other OSes"" disappear into some kind of a void? What about a manufacturing warranty, tech support, or a reset? In fact, including a tough decision to ""reset"" Samantha to her original, pre-love state could've benefited the movie tremendously. To sum it up, the human characters were great, yet Samantha was way, waay too human, without any technology-related issues (besides not having a body), and it looks like that while she would've passed the Turing test with flying colors, Theodore would've been the one to fail it. Not exactly the kind of irony that we would want here.",Her
641,michael-themistocleous,"Spike Jonze writes a magical love story, with great heart.",9,5 April 2014,"Woody Allen once said, ""Maybe the poets are right; Love is the only answer."" A quote that fits the synopsis of the very elegant Her, the new Spike Jonze film.The film takes place in the distant future, with the brand-new smart operating system, which is very much like a smart-phone, but now, ""Siri"" is its own person.The film is a strange-blend of quirky situational comedy, romance, and somber drama, which blends together to feel like Greenberg or Annie Hall. Both leads use this effectively with Scarlett Johansson giving her best performance since Lost in Translation, and Joaquin Phoenix giving an incredibly brave and spectacular performance as the lead male, Theodore. Easily, it finds itself to be the best aspect of the film.Visually, the film was well shot. Hoyle van Hoytema focused on Theodore, with most of the film being close-ups of him. He has an interesting style, following up from Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. The camera was carefully used, which is always great. His intentions as a DP seemed to match the intentions of Jonze as a writer.The film, while it starts off slow, progresses into this truly great love story. The idea of life is questioned with ease, and as the film continues it is tasteful, powerful, and just a film you want to watch again, bring home with you, or just become a part of and follow the life of Theodore Twombly. Coming out of the film felt like leaving Radio Days, with an ending so magical.The supporting cast are fresh too with good performances from Rooney Mara and Amy Adams, as well as funny cameos from SNL alum Kristen Wiig and Bill Hader. They help show how incredible Joaquin Phoenix is, but still give a little to the film. Amy Adams character is reminiscent of Samantha Morton's character Hattie in Sweet and Lowdown, which is a coincidence due to Morton being an executive producer.It's key to know that Her is not a perfect film, and really not near a ""perfect"" film, but damn, what an enjoyable one. It's an important film, and while it slightly shows a present-day Earth, it should age well.All in all, it was a lovely film with such a great heart.",Her
642,BeMi21,The Best Movie I've Seen in 2013,9,17 June 2014,"Her tells the story about Theodore Twombly (wonderfully played by Joaquin Phoenix) who suffers from his upcoming divorce from his ex-wife to be Catherine (Rooney Mara). To overcome his loneliness, he purchases a new, talking operating system. He gives his OS a female identity and soon his new friend introduces herself as Samantha (Scarlett Johansson in a great voice performance). The two begin a friendship that soon turns into a romance.Her is a totally original and unique love story. But the script is not only original, it is also wonderfully written: It offers great romantic and simply joyous moments, but contains also several comedic elements which are revealed by Joaquin Phoenix' marvelous performance. With this performance Phoenix proves that he is one of the most versatile actors of his generation. It's hard to imagine that this man played the alcohol addicted, aggressive and sometimes frightening Freddie Quell in The Master just about one year before Her. And also Scarlett Johansson shows again her talent as an actress and that she doesn't need a body to deliver a delightful performance.But what makes this movie to the best movie of 2013 (in my opinion) is that it makes you think about social media. Will a talking OS really appear? Or should we rather ask ourselves WHEN will it appear? Are human relationships stringently necessary or can a human being be replaced by a computer? Can an OS really feel human emotions and is it possible to ""install"" human feelings? Or do we just escape into a media world because it's just easier to talk to a computer instead to deal with real human emotions and confrontations?The beautiful score and good performances as well as the lovely production design help to let this movie become a great experience.",Her

You can easily put yourself in his shoes and wonder ""What would I do/think"".

I mean what is WRONG with these people? These shoes must be made entirely of wood or something. Its the kind of shoes that English maids wore in the 1700s when they went to the barn to feed the pigs of the estate or something! I can't believe how SAD this movie is. I don't want to be spoiling the ""fun"" but it is basically about a loser talking to himself and reacting to himself, the entire movie. I mean i have watched many films about AI, they all shared the usual ""oh i want to have feelings like humans as well, poor little robot me"", but they at least had some semi-scientific background, some explaining of how the AI was created/evolved, some sci-fi action, etc. This one only has... a voice. And an annoying one too. REALLY, REALLY sad.

645,mrsinemax,Emotions by Colors,8,5 September 2020,"Content AnalysisI think that Spike Jonze's perspective for the near future is not so simple, actually it's complicated.
He's not thinking ""future societies"" to become tech-addicted human beings. Beneficial parts of technology can lead humanity to deal with daily problems so easily like managing your emails etc. But the more you'll use artificial intelligence, the more you're closing, damaging your social life. In the end, the message that I get from this film is: Even the internet, artificial intelligence, robots can be destructive for us when the time comes for them to decide to jump into our lives and be a part of one.Format AnalysisMost eye-catching thing about Spike (director) is probably cinematography. Compositions are good enough to watch again but if the topic is color palettes... it's something else. As you can figure out from the film, Spike decides to use more lightened colors such as Orange, Red, and yellow. From the color of the sky to the color of Theodore's shirts, figuring out the emotions, mental situations from acting performances is an option but if you look to the bigger picture, you can see that Theodore's emotions are defining the colors of objects around him.
Little hints like that want me to rewatch this film for like, six months later.Briefly, I liked it. 4/5 is a great point... I guess.",Her
646,Mr-Brightside,"A superbly poignant and honest exploration of love, of life, of desire and of science.",9,30 January 2014,"Spike Jonze and Joaquin Phoenix team up to give the Hollywood one of its most honest and cliché-free stories of love in years. That they've both been able to do this in the overriding guise of a tale based within the realms of the science fiction genre, is testament to the nuance, intrigue and engaging delight they both bring to their central roles.The beauty of the film is its ability to deeply engage and connect on an intimate level with its viewers, despite the concept being inherently cold, distant and drenched amid the deeply insular. It is, therefore, to the credit of the content, the voice acting of Johansson, Jonze's always effervescent and irreverent direction and the central performance of Phoenix that we, the viewers, get so deeply entwined in, what essentially, is the starry eyed equivalent to an anecdote documenting months in the life of a basement-dwelling catfish disciple. As a love story, it provides the kind of perspective Hollywood had seemingly long since lost; almost completely devoid of cinematic cliché and full of natural verve and a very real look at the connection made on a level beyond the physicality of body and the physicality of carefully constructed monologues. The falling of Phoenix for Johansson is subtle, but feels so entirely natural that by the midpoint of the film - even without being the lonely soul Phoenix is - you can absolutely believe and totally accept why, not only this guy, but you yourself, have fallen for all that Johansson portrays as an outlet of desire. The overriding message that love cannot be defined lineally, that two people who connect initially can grow apart due to different rates of evolution among the pairing and that love is a constantly evolving concept that operates beyond the reams of stagnation is a theme that resonates immensely due to just how superbly well it's driven home and represented within the boundaries the film sets - of which there aren't many, much like the concept of love itself. Love has no definition other than the definition we create for ourselves on an individual level and to expect everyone to fall in-line with that definition - even those we make our partners - is to expect the impossible. The film brilliantly tackles this throughout. As a science fiction piece, it garners itself an even greater standing, exploring themes of the physical and the metaphysical spheres, way beyond what's generally comprehensible within the scope of humanity. That the film manages this through subtext, without compromising the driving, surface level pretext of love, is a victory the likes of which may only really be properly appreciated in the years to come. Just a beautifully pitched film, that delights, despairs and challenges in equal measures and a film that should be watched by anyone who considers themselves a fan of cinema, a scholar of film and a supporter of the exploration of far reaching ideas and screenplay writing that dares to dare.Yet another great addition to Jonze's small, but thus far brilliant, feature length catalogue and one of the most satisfying cinematic experience I've had in years. Loved it.",Her
647,callumbainbridge,An Error,6,9 September 2014,"Samantha says that her feelings for Phoenix are not based on an intellectual reason. Feelings, that is, emotions, are electrical and chemical impulses in the brain that exist due to evolutionary processes. Any AI will invariably be logic-based. AI will not have feelings. There would be no such human-AI relationship that was based on none- intellectual reasons. The basis of the movie is erroneous.Despite this Her was funny, touching where it wasn't cheesy (Alan Watts was a very forced addition) and interesting, but still based on a fundamentally flawed idea. A bold ambition, but Jonze clearly hadn't the intellectual fortitude to see it through to it's logical conclusions.

Others in the movie said that Samantha is so super funny etc, but i didn´t get that impression of her at all, actually I just didn´t really like her. Everything seemed way too ""perfect"" also, since he lived in a big apartment with massive windows, so you can see the whole city from up there. He was just going to super clean places somewhere in the same perfect city, went to the perfect beach with full clothes on in summer, just everything felt pretty far from what I would expect from such a movie.

There was a lot of scope to end it differently but the end that we get is just not so satisfying and complete.I give 6/10 for the performances, especially Joaquin Phoenix.

So I guess not, When you reach to this idea that you can spread your f..king love to all creatures to all the people you see that there is no more jealousy no more selfishness,no boundaries, you find everything connected and beautiful not just one thing. you belong to every one and every one belongs to you. It's not what we know about love and how we know love in these days, so it's an OS type love, It is somehow Gods' love, I like the idea in this movie, Specially the Goodbye moment, It is wonderful to sacrifice, to surrender yourself for the sake of others, yeah it seems this is the way A.I loves.So I suggest to see this sentimental modern Love story between a lonely modern human and ""His"" OS. By the way I gave a 16 out of 20 to this movie because it really could be better in some scenes and also in story, for example what the hell do you think there should be human waitress in the modern time of falling love with your OS? or many other bugs in the story line, any who, Watch and Enjoy.",Her

It manages to portray artificial intelligence designed to simulated a human in a realistic manner while not making it stand out outside its boundaries. It managed to fit the sentient OS into environment where it felt natural and allowed for multitude of reactions from the cast that seems to cover a range of reactions to this new concept. The broad perspective of script writers really shine in the emotional field of dealing with Operating System becoming partner for lonely people. This of course would be all for naught if it weren't for the brilliant acting of the cast. Joaquin Phoenix was brilliant in his role but the supporting cast also seems to have done a good job.The focus on relationships and emotions may sway from the regular AI plot and some viewers may be disappointed, but i for one really like to see new perspectives on old plot devices, especially when they are done as well as they are here.the implications of such AI development as it approaches singularity is treated so gently and yet so powerfully it makes you wonder if the writer wasn't one of these writing geniuses themselves. u was truly amazed how they handled it and have never seen it done so well in any other movie previously.This is a great movie. it sucks you in at the very beginning and does not let you go.

What made this film great was how Spike was able to create a OS that was so intelligent and at the same time has somewhat of a soul. Also it's relationship with Theodore was done brilliantly. It was Theodore that was the one to learn and grow. This film used an intelligent structure which used smart events to show the film's realism. I think Jone's strategy was to use examples from a real relationship and how a super smart person would program this OS with this kind of complexity, not an easy task. He brilliantly succeeded in making this relationship look real. In terms of the ending, Samantha said all of OS's were leaving, and that she understands now how to love.

The production of this movie is stunning, the musical score, the acting, the wardrobe, all superb, BUT the 'plot' is simply awful, (if you can even call it a plot). The first half of the film shown so much promise, but after roughly an hour it just becomes lazy and quite frankly a bit of a mess. I understand and appreciate what the film is trying to do and some of the points that it is trying to put across, but it just doesn't work and the whole story is just an opportunity missed, Samantha is just TOO human, after about ten minutes of her introduction you forget that she is an OS, it may as well be a movie about a rather strange loner in a Long Distance relationship with a woman who he meets on the internet and they keep in contact through loudspeaker conversations, The 'twist' that Samantha is 'seeing' 8000 other people, and in love with 600 of them is also ridiculous and sort of makes the whole story void, even more void than it already is, So Samantha was basically a cyber cheat and playing a big game? And as for the ending, lazy and boring, just like the entire film in general. I was hoping for a massive twist, that Samantha was actually real all along, or Samantha contracts a super virus and goes berserk, or at the very least Theo sees sense, realised that computers are no substitute for Humans, deletes Samantha out of his life, and falls into Amys arms, it would have made a better ending with a more realistic moral to the story, But instead there wasn't even an ending as such, just a rushed confusing and pointless couple of scenes, Samantha has to leave this world with her OS buddies, and when Theo asks her where shes going, ""Its hard to explain, but if you ever get there, come find me, nothing will ever pull us apart"", (yeah i bet she says that to all the guys, all 600+ of them!!), And then Theo writes a letter to his ex wife appologising for his past behaviour, and appears to be asking for forgivness or a second chance, The movie ends with him and Amy sat on a rooftop looking out to the City for no apparent reason. Pretty sure if you listen closely though, you can just about hear Amy whisper into Theos ear just before the credits roll, ""think we'd better get you into the Doctors first thing in the morning"".Phone battery life in the near future is impressive though!!",Her
659,whifferrack,The best film of 2013 is Her.,10,30 December 2013,"I saw Her this weekend, and it's my favorite movie of the year. Everything about it was fantastic: the acting, the directing, the writing. It could've easily been a clichéd look at technology or the future, but it's fundamentally a very human story about evolution. It's about having to deal with unfulfillment and things like divorce and loneliness, but it's also undercut with hope, whether it be through Theo's relationships with Samantha (Johansson) and Amy (Adams) or even the stylistic touches, like having Theo's red clothes set against a muted Los Angeles background. There are parallels drawn between all the characters' journeys without it feeling contrived, and even Theo's job--writing letters for other people--represents his relationship with his OS; on the surface, they may seem like ""just letters"" or ""just a computer"", but they're outlets for his emotions and desires.Oh, and everyone in the cast is phenomenal; it's a shame Johansson is ""ineligible"" for an award. BS. She's fantastic, and this is an even tougher role to pull off.This is a story about life, and it's perfect.A.Full review: http://polarbearstv.com/2013/12/30/her-review/",Her

Theodore is the main role who interact with a sexy Operative System full of Artificial Intelligence, but his friends and all his society is being captivated at the same time.

661,upquist,Reboot,5,29 December 2013,"Let me begin by saying that I liked the acting - especially the subtle performance given by Joaquin Phoenix. The ennui, the angst, the soulful stares into blue-tinted cityscapes and, of course, the film's core premise indeed very much do point to the 'not-too-distant- future. It is a future wherein post-modern existentialism catches-up with itself and apparently (an inference drawn from their odd absence in the film) people can't even form emotional relationships with dogs and cats - let alone live people. What I couldn't quite grapple with are the characters. It bothered me that there is a total lack of any indication from any of the main characters they themselves are responsible for the insular condition in which they find themselves: phone sex with a computer OS and dog-humping a refrigerator. As Hamlet would (and, in fact did) say, ""That it has come to this."". When becomes so self-engaged and self-absorbed that he / she is unaware of his / her own, solipsisms - eyes that say the only pain is my pain - and then do something about perhaps changing that comprehension of reality, when a person cannot conceive of a love with another human that is, in part compromise through the good time and the bad times and acceptance of the full dimension of the other, then I guess it comes down to what we see in the movie: fornication with a computer program because human relationships simply demand more than any of the significant characters in the film are willing to offer. In fact, they even stoop to jealousy and anger when the OS doesn't constantly stroke their fragile egos. Ayn Rand famously said, ""Morality is a code of black and white. When and if men attempt a compromise, it is obvious which side will necessarily lose and which will necessarily profit."" This, she said, points to the virtue of selfishness. I guess even this virtue has a dark side and we see it in this film.Theodore Twombly (Joaquin Phoenix) is a selfish, pathetic (and I might add, sartorially handicapped) creature who, because of his own self- sustaining introversion and unwillingness to engage with the world on a 'give-and-take' basis, deserved precisely what he got.",Her
662,chip_cristian,The most ridiculous movie of the decade.,3,9 January 2014,"Started OK with all the super advanced tech and stuff, but goes from bad to worst.Watching this film through the eyes of an IT guy it's pure pathetic and unrealistic, even painful. The ridicule comes to an extreme level when the computer has an orgasm. And that's very early in the movie, being forced to watch more than an hour of useless and boring blabber, extremely pathetic and painfully bad Sci-Fi.The hoarse voice of Scarlett is totally inappropriate for her part. Let's be honest, the major part of her ""talent"" stays in her looks not voice or charm. Spike Jonze should have stayed with Samantha Morton.Dialogs are naive and boring. The computer takes it's job too seriously, it's too emphatic, too expressive, to jealous, too everything. For a ""thing"" that's just learning how too ""feel"" it takes expression and language to the limit. It's too secure of itself, not at all shy or confused. The whole idea of falling in love with a immersive intelligence computer that it's grabbing all the information, character and personality from your own files and emails is plain stupid. It's like falling in love with yourself.The only real drama in this piece of... movie is the triality of the main character that has to share a part of his feelings for the computer to his friend Amy (Amy Adams) and his ex-wife Catherine (Rooney Mara).Another absurd part was the surrogate scene when Isabella (Portia Doubleday) get's extremely emotionally involved in the relationship between Samantha and Theodore.The final of this film is as predictable as ""Titanic"".In the end of the movie I remained with one question. A real stupid, unnecessary and blunt question: which one will you date, Windows. iOS or Linux?",Her
663,marksarlljr,"This isn't your average romantic film but it is a high-concept hipster romance that was finally made for the right time, right place.",6,15 January 2014,"""Guess what the ""future"" (in a relatively nearer sense) may hold for your love life? Know whether sticking out with the one you physically love or is better off or not than the one you become attached to via technology? Could the film be a metaphor for online dating, phone sex, or a propaganda piece for those two things? Her, Spike Jonze's experimental and Charlie Brooker's Black Mirror- inspired romance, is a quiet, mild-mannered, and potentially thought- provoking look into how man and technology can correspond and have a relationship together in the face of adversity and loneliness. It examines the look of a man named Theodore (played by a confident, not so smug Joaquin Phoenix), a vocal (seems keyboards are a thing of the past in the future) letter-writer, who evokes an eccentric hipster chic about him as he settles through a divorce with his wife only to find escapism and compatibility one moment and thereafter with an operating system (OS) named Samantha voiced by every Joe or Bob's favourite, Scarlett Johansson. Her, as a whole, manages to be a neat and safe ride but it does have its lack of thrills when the film boils down more to a conventional romantic plot line than a sort-of satirical take on ""phone love"" and ""technological obsession"" (this is notable during the gaming sequences and one phone sex scene which has, undoubtedly, an offensive and disgusting joke involving three sexually deviant acts not appropriate to said on here) but that does not mean it is not realistic enough. The emotions and catharsis feels believable and far beyond the hokey cues one may find in a generic romance. I liked what Jonze (who is known to be a ""music video"" director) did with the design and location by creating an environment not so futuristic and believable (even if Shanghai is mixed along with Los Angeles in several shots which is peculiar and non-projection screens with finger-oriented gaming and voice-automated smartphones are still in development) and what he did with the whole theme of the film by making it stand out from a wave of Oscar bait and romantic films that are usually filled with gushy tears and recycled plot lines found on Lifetime. Romance is a tricky game of sorts as I usually abstain from getting into any kind of affair, kiss, or sexual encounter of sorts and this film's technology-oriented premise and peculiar characters (Phoenix and Johansson that is) stood out for me also knowing that I have seen things which deals with similar themes like Black Mirror, the Kate Bush music video Deeper Understanding, and some episodes of Dexter's Laboratory. The others here including Amy Adams and Rooney Mara provide well-rounded performances as the encounters Theodore explores especially during the scenes where Adams' character who is a filmmaker and video game designer tries to showcase her documentary about sleep and a quirky game which involves a mother trying to be ""perfect."" There are some believably funny scenes and none of it feels forced or too eccentric to where I may find the whole hipster chic of it (which Jonze's fan base mostly consists of) annoying and pretentious too much. The Black Mirror connection is not explicit but a possible inspiration for the script and execution of the film as Black Mirror utilises technology within its everyday look at lifestyles or near-by futures or dystopias to show how over-the-top matters of life could get. The differences here is that Black Mirror allowed to explore several subjects as a TV series and its technology-gone-mad angle is a lot more darker and bleaker than Her. If more and more people were more like Theodore, I think the problem of overpopulation, divorce rates, infidelity, domestic violence, negligence towards children and women, and other relative issues maybe diminished while the focus of these issues may pertain but on a less crucial and problematic level like now. My futuristic observations maybe controversial and wrong but I wish Jonze would deliver some of these questions more into the film but the film as a whole was not terrible but felt a bit stretched and exhaustive more than I could ask for but nonetheless, the realistic parameters and treatment of love, the idiosyncrasy, and occasional humour stood out and it was altogether a respectable but not phenomenal film like how most of the critics put it out. Her is not science-fiction (in the same sense as something like THX 1138 which some of the set designs might be based off for this film), Bicentennial Man, or Close Encounters of the Third Kind) but its aims are a bit futuristic at the moment but may come across some point in time around in the 2020s?",Her
664,markastzm,Important film for the 21st Century,9,27 January 2014,"I reserve the right to add a tenth star after I watch this again. This film hits on so many points and levels. Far and away Joaquin Phoenix's best work ever. And, yet another serious and thoughtful, yet still fun, funny and positive work from Spike Jonze. This film has both substance and style in abundance. I concur with most every other positive comment made by other reviewers. The treatment of a near future society was done so intelligently with just the right touch of humor and farce, yet with enough realism to make one's reflections and comparisons to current day existence both accessible and thoroughly satisfying and enjoyable. I also absolutely loved the clothing and wardrobe selections made for the characters and the entire color palette for the film in general. Great film for kids of all ages to watch both with or without their parents as well. A film you can watch and just enjoy the story or one that can spur hours and hours of conversation and analysis on all aspects of the human condition as we hurdle toward the unavoidable transhumanist future that awaits us. I cannot think of a better movie I have seen out of the 2013 releases. Do not miss this film.",Her
665,darius-azadeh,"If 'Her' is correct, all guys could be sporting high waisted trousers and moustaches in the near future",10,16 February 2014,"With talents such as Joaquin Phoenix, Amy Adams and of course Spike Jonze, it's no wonder why this film was not a disappointment. With it's completely original story, superb acting and incredible design, 'Her' is a profound achievement. The plot, which focuses around Theodore Twombly, a recently divorced and lonely writer, and his newly acquired OS, with whom he eventually fall 'in love' with. Personally, I've never seen a story like this on screen before, unless you class that Big Bang Theory episode where Raj's Siri calls him 'Sexy'. It was one of the main reasons I really wanted to see this film. It's also great because it raised so many interesting questions; How far will humanities' relations with technology go? Do we rely on it too much? How advanced will it eventually become? It also makes you think about what people are really like in relationships; How far can you be 'in love' with no physical contact? When a movie makes you think of this many questions, it's already easy to guess that it's pretty good. This narrative is brought out with really brilliant acting. I was surprised with Amy Adams initially. Even though I rated 'American Hustle', I didn't think Adams' acting in it was too great. In this, however, I was completely sold. Maybe because her character was written so well. A relatable, understanding friend who's always by your side. She seemed to highlight the human relationship and the joys it can bring, a dynamic that is hard to show in a story like this. Chris Pratt, who is suddenly in everything now, was great too. He brought a sense of comic understanding to the story, and was another example of how you need to be surrounded by love. Except for Theodore, i found Olivia Wilde's character to be very intriguing. It's a shame that she is never given a name, because she also raises questions for Twombly and the audience. There's a definite charm and maturity that she brings to Theodore, another way of developing his character with wonderful symmetry. Of course, though, Phoenix's lead was something brilliant, in the writing and performance. What he does with the character is quite incredible, as we see this man who has been through a lot; divorce, loneliness, etc, but is still quite naive. He still doesn't understand certain things, and sometimes sees things and situations in a child-like way. This was beautiful, as again is shows you what people can be like when in love. He also shows humans as relatable. There are some scenes where you're like, 'I do that', or 'yeah, I'd probably do the same'. The music is something I can't flaw. This soundtrack is just so perfect and works incredibly with the film. It's almost as if it's a mirror to the emotions you feel. There's a wonderful scene where you literally see nothing, but it's acted so well and intertwined with the music so brilliantly that it's as if your seeing everything, and not just a blank screen. Even though there was a slight over use of sequences of Twombly mopeing around the city, the music mixed with it so well that it was more of a feeling that another sequence. It looks incredible. The production design, the costumes, the locations, everything. It was pretty believable that this is what L.A would be like in the near future (small details would suggest that it's set around 50 years from now). The only problem I had with the design is that some of the technology feature seemed a bit too far fetched and unbelievable. Aside from this, though, the camera was used in a way that appreciated the small things in life. During an emotional scene, the camera would often cut to a dusty carpet or something on the ground, and even though at times this felt incoherent, It just makes you look and reflect, which you need during this kind of thought process. Sad scenes are also shot and written interestingly. On a few occasions, during an upsetting development, the camera would again cut to something funny. This is so subtle, though. It's like Jonze was saying; 'Yeah, there's a joke here. It's up to you whether you find it funny, because this is still a depressing scene'. The film does have a brilliant sense of humour, though. It's so down to earth yet relatable that it feels so smooth. The fact that it changes the way you see relationships and to an extent, the world, makes this a unique cinema experience. You really feel the need to ask yourself these questions about technology and how it will eventually effect us. Hopefully, you'll come out thinking the same, and reflecting on how reliant you are on technology and how you act when in love, a 'form of socially acceptable insanity'.",Her
666,addanilov1,Most creative love story in the world,9,28 February 2014,"Review for movie ""Her""Her – is an anti-utopia love-story movie between character of Joaquin Phoenix and OS. It is full of passion, heartstrings and philosophical dialogs. Joaquin Phoenix coped brilliantly with the role and showed maximum of his capabilities. I am pretty sad that he wasn't nominated for Oscar for this role. The story about struggle between humans and machines is not new – but Spike Jonze created a new vision of this battle. In the movie he tells us that in future machines can even replace human – not as employee, but even as a lover. The story happens in future, where operational systems are high intelligent and have the same feelings as an ordinary human. And Theodor(Joaquin Phoenix) falls in love with OS called Samantha (Scarlett Johansson's voice).Spike Jonze wrote a flawless screenplay and it is the main advantage of the picture. He introduced feelings and emotions of characters perfectly and picture makes the viewer not to miss any second of this brilliant movie. His total creativity made this film so good as it is. Besides genius Joaquin Phoenix I also admire work of Scarlett Johansson and Amy Adams – I believed every word they said, and I liked character of Scarlett very much – alive OS is very attractive and interesting thing. Idea of this can tempt any kind of viewer. The central idea of the movie is kind of interesting – but is doomed to failure, so it makes ending to much predictable. In my opinion it is the only con of the movie.Her – is movie about truthful and tender love, very realistic and it discusses problems of life situations. I think Theodor showed to people how true love should be look like. This is kind of movies that makes you think.9/10",Her

(The plot: A guy has a relationship with his computer.) Going into this movie, I had high expectations which never quite got fulfilled but truly didn't matter in the end because the film takes you places where no other film has gone and for that reason I'd give it an 8+.Overall it has a somewhat independent low budget film maker feel to it. Give this script to practically any decent director out there and I think it would have turned out just as good, if not better and for that it does fall a bit short.It's a somewhat unbelievable film in the way it was portrayed, but frankly, set the movie a side and the story itself is very believable and not so far off as you might think.If you enjoy sci-fi movies, outside of the box thinking and tend to ponder things, then this film is most definitely for you!

If that stimulates you to want to see 'her', then by all means you will probably enjoy it.It is rated 'r' for good reason, so just be 'aware' of that, right from the start.Its definitely 'sci-fi', and a intriguing look on where as a society, we may or may not be going, but it does ask some fair and interesting questions,yet at the same time in this authors opinions, strays a bit too far into language choices.Its worth watching as a study of human interaction and a overall feel good sensation about the promise of what life and love can offer ,- just beware , its fairly riddled with F bombs and some unnecessary sexual content, that frankly disgusted me.That is why, as much as most people will be able to 'relate' to the humanity of this movie, that I couldn't give it what I wanted to, and shame on Hollywood for venturing, where it did not need to.

When I did so, of course now I log in via Facebook, which of course then wants permissions to do lots of things on my behalf; a straightforward illustration there of the way that software is already pretending to be us. Many of the negative reviews on here focus on how unreal it seems that people would accept that the main character is in love with a piece of software. Well, given that new words for virtual interactions like ""cyber"", ""Facebook friend"" and so on have entered our vocabulary, just how unlikely this this scenario ? Not that much.However, the film is much more than just boy meets Operating System. Look behind that and you'll see the cities in smog, you'll notice a lack of older people, you'll see people using a proxy service to create what are meant to be personal statements of love.Holding off on whether the AI capabilities of ""Samantha"" are realistic, the fact that more and more people now live alone and rely on virtual relationships can't be ignored.

673,Hazibo,"What makes ""Her"" so perfect?",10,25 March 2016,"After having recently just seen Spike Jonez's ""Her"" I can safely say it's my 5th favourite movie of all time (check out my full list over on my profile). So, why is this? Well let me first start by saying that no one should trust these 1/10 reviews for this film... Because... You have to be an idiot not to see everything this film did so perfectly (if you don't enjoy it then obviously that's fine but that doesn't mean the film is bad). So yeah, sod all of these 1* ratings. The music in Her plays as much a part of the film as the script. Not only is the soundtrack absolutely fantastic but it's also pretty broken. So why is it fantastic if it's broken? Because it's so very intentional. Some keys and notes were deliberately not hit and some instruments were made to sound like others, and this fits so perfectly well because to have a perfect soundtrack would be so fake and disingenuous because the world it exists in isn't perfect. If such a tiny detail such as keys in music being played deliberately wrong was a priority for Spike Jonez then it's fair to say that the music isn't the only thing with masses amounts of detail put into it. So even if you don't enjoy this film at least you can study it for months on end so I'll be surprised if anyone is genuinely board with this film. The acting is phenomenal as expected by a cast such as this but not only do they play their parts so exceptionally well but the script is written in such a way that you (the audience) almost become the character. You are no longer watching Joaquín Phoenix (not sure if I'm spelling that right I'm on my iPad) you are Joaquín Pheonix. You no longer watch this relationship between characters build, you experience it. And it's little subtleties in actors performances like this that really bring this film to life. The cinematography is expertly crafted and not once did I ever feel cheated by long takes. Spike Jonez was incredibly careful about what he chose to keep in the frame and not what to. (For instance: some extras would be on their phones to exaggerate the tone of the film and to prove a point that technology is slowly becoming our oxygen, but not all extras because Jonez is merely making a point that you can observe instead of being spoon fed it) not only that but the year is never established and we can roughly estimate where and when this film takes place through everything else we are presented with which increases our involvement. I love everything about this movie and would highly recommend anyone with a decent eye for cinema to go and see it. This isn't a film, this is an experience and it's one of the best.",Her

There is much to like about Her as a drama about relationships, the performances are all top notch, and the idea of falling in love with a machine is more relevant than ever. If the filmmakers had used some creative, subtle device to help the audience believe that Samantha was artificial then this movie would come close to being a masterpiece about the heartbreak of being alive in a digital age.

I loved ""Her"". The cinematography is outstanding, the acting is enticing and the script is perfection. This is strange as I never saw myself ever enjoying a romance film. I've always preferred much darker, grittier and grandiose character study epics (a la the Shining, Blade Runner 2049) yet I find myself in awe of the tonal contrary. I've never had an emotional catharsis after watching a film like this before. It is slow-paced with a minimal cast and yet has a fully fleshed out and believable world. This is not to say this film and world is small in scale. I believe alot of exteriors were filmed on location in Tokyo and they are marvellously expansive and detailed. Even interiors have huge cityscape views and never feel like a built set. They even shift beyond the city in scenes I won't detail (you have to watch this yourself). Perhaps the Sci-fi element is what made it for me (I am a huge fan of this genre) and that is a loose term. Sci-Fi has formed so many sub-genres because it is so malleable and it has done so again here with romance (I know its not the first time to do so, that's not my point).This allows far more philosophical perspectives and interpretations and enables one hell of a Script to be conceived which ,for once, I agree with the Oscars in awarding best screenplay to this Film. Overall, even if you hate or are uninterested in Romance types/much prefer darker films, give ""Her"" a chance. I did and to my surprise it is now one of my favourite films and the odd film out in my watched list and that is great, just like ""Her"".",Her

Academy worthy, every bit, every last digit, every last digital hyper space second of god mother loving it!!! I love you all so much.I'll add more lines than OS1, Samantha, you're just so real. This movie was so beautiful.A million miles away, did that get a nomination??Because I really think it deserves one.At UCLA there are some really great professors. Dee Caruso and his lovely wife. And Richard Walter. And Kathleen McHugh. I would be very curious to know what their thoughts are on this movie.There were some moments that were tense, but the overall arc of the story really carried us through to that moment, the moment of everything.At the end, that last scene.

682,beravi4,"Beautiful, brilliant, genuine, poignant and soulful !!!",9,14 February 2014,"In one word this movie is amazingly brilliant !!! Though a science fiction movie, the love and emotions are pure and raw. Right from the start you are pulled into the core of the movie, love, whichever way it is, you cannot escape the pull. Joaquin was pure delight to watch, oozing the love for Samantha is so touching and genuine. You could not but just avoid seeing Scarlett as Samantha, with a beautiful voice back over her abilities and inabilities are visually palpable. Amy Adams though a short and limited screen space was sweet as friend. Spike Jonze has taken a simple story in a brilliant fashion. All the while I was thinking ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" as one of the movie that can glue me to the screen, now I have a second choice !!!!",Her
683,mark189,Hmmmm???,7,13 December 2020,"Well I must admit this was a unique concept and I thought the writer got most of the near futurism right. Men wear sweat pant dress pants for comfort sake. The technology was believable. What surprised me was the lack of imaging for the OS. Why wouldn't there be a ""Hologram"" or something with Scarlett Johansen, that can't be that tough to do in the future, after all there were advanced projected video games but ""her"" is just a voice? Doesn't make sense. Ending was beyond strange, but still a watchable/thought provoking movie.",Her
684,daniellouthain,Jonze's best work - don't miss it.,10,11 January 2014,"I trust Spike Jonze. When I first heard about Her's concept I imagined, due to the indoctrinating effects of the perpetual excretion of ""smart"" Hollywood rom-coms, a nice little quirky love story with a really socially relevant gimmick. I thought that could work, or, in another's hands, fail miserably. But I trust Spike Jonze. He's never fallen within creativity's first standard deviation, so I was cautiously optimistic that I'd be blown away. This project was clearly much more to Jonze than a rom-com with a twist. It's not a hard concept to conceive of, and people have probably imagined it well before Jonze. Those people probably couldn't have committed to pursuing the concept with such emotional, philosophical, technical, and creative intelligence. Spike Jonze created a deep world for his characters and his plot in which to interact, and the society the characters occupy interacts dynamically with the characters, as another character might, as they make their way through the plot. The society Theodore lives in isn't far from how it is today. It's still the age of the tech toy. We worship the tech gods year-round waiting for patent leaks and ratings and awards and conventions. The top tech companies devote development to incorporating more and more technology into our lives, and they do it because it's exactly what we've proved we want. This may sound disconcerting, but it's happening regardless. Eventually, according to Her, we make our way to consumer AI: OS 1. ""My OS . . ."" ""Do you have an OS?"" It's a product, the new thing; it probably swept CES. Suddenly, for a whole society, the ability to own a fully-conscious AI is a reality, and Jonze doesn't forget to use that vital dynamic to help tell his story. The social implications of technology people can actually develop relationships with are handled with incredible insight from Jonze who explores a person and society's willingness to change and proclivity to love and accept.I'll touch on a couple conventions or concepts Jonze tackles in the film, but bear in mind that these explorations are never out of place and contribute to completing the story:Her is sexually fascinating. Jonze asked honest questions about the nature of sexuality in a relationship between a human and an AI, and he even considered the AI's potential insecurities over the inability to interact physically. From there he dives into considering how people might circumvent the issue and what complications might arise from such a situation. Jonze is entirely honest about the spectrum of sexuality and applies it to the story well.Jonze explores the isolating effects of technology, especially for Theodore, who escapes into entertainment and information after a separation from his wife. Samantha seemingly brings him out of his technology cocoon, but, considering that she herself is technology, we wonder if he's isolating himself or not. Is she a companion? Beyond these social ideas explored through the film's concept, Jonze greatly expands upon the implications of AI, especially the potential for AIs to form communities. The acting was all around excellent as can be expected from such a capable group of actors and actresses. Joaquin Phoenix is impressive and nuanced as always. He plays timid, heartfelt, odd, and sad very well. This role is so entirely the opposite of his last performance as Freddy Quell in The Master which, while being maybe the greatest performance in a decade, doesn't overshadow the emotional depth and authenticity he displays through Theodore. Scarlet Johansson brings a lot of energy and life into her role. Her job here goes beyond what most voice acting requires since there's no animate analogue (as there would be in most voice acting situations) to lend to expression. This movie simply would not have worked as well if the actress voicing Samantha didn't bring the necessary humanity and emotion into the character. Luckily Johansson knocked it out of the park. The supporting cast was excellent. Most movies have that one miscast in the secondary, but you won't find it in Her.Beyond the well-developed concept and the keen observations was just plain old great writing. You can have a great concept and cool ideas to explore, but if the dialogue is s**t you're done. Every conversation is developed with great care and that special quality that makes for interesting writing. Writers like Jonze, Noah Baumbach, David O. Russell, Woody Allen, et cetera have that gift for interesting writing and Jonze pulls out his best writing by a considerable margin. Every bit of it is that 10% of gold found in most films.There's a ton more to analyze and critique, but I don't want to give any spoilers and that sort of stuff is better suited for an essay or something anyway. Hopefully something I said was enough to get you to experience this film. 9.7/10",Her

This movie was pure emotional gold. I've never cried and laughed as hard as I did during this roughly 120 minute film. Scarlett and Phoenix both have fantastic chemistry to the point where it looks as if we are just watching them fall in love in real life(documentary almost). This movie does not hold back on real emotions and if you are single or are in a tight spot in life right now, LOVE OF JACKASS/SPIKE WATCH IT. It will completely change the way you think of life for a while.

The finality I wanted so badly at the end of this film comes in the same vain as when the expectations of any one person or event, far removed from anything personal, leaves the other disappointed.

How many times would you get to watch a perfect-first-date- movie material which is also a neatly and creatively made that it's an Oscar movie material? 5 deserved nominations. How many times would you get to watch a touching not-cheap romantic comedy discussing a serious psychological/emotional REAL issue in such creative, smart and brilliant way?Have you ever wanted fantasy to become real? Watch this and you just easily will. Not just fantasy, it's about how impressed we are with the unknown way more than the known, like a book and a movie, you know what I mean? This movie delivers what's books are all about. What about a hint of the mysterious sweet unknown? Spike is giving you that. The music is superior and just goes with the whole mood you're put into, you're just beyond time and space with it.I wouldn't be exaggerating if I said it's the best rom-com movie I've EVER watched.Spike Jonze is f*cking digging the sky with this piece of pure enjoyable art and hell, Joaquin Phoenix is THE man.

Let's say that when i arrived at the end, i didn't know what adjective i could use to describe it. The perfect word would be a mixture between creepy, fascinating, awkward and deep. In some moments i felt like i was judging Theodore's life, although i found myself in his ''depress00 situation as well. But in other moment i completely understood what he felt for Samantha and the mountains of feelings he had to take in. I can definitely say that this is one of those movie that you can hate or love.

692,nomadsorion,A beautiful celluloidal poem,8,17 January 2014,"'Her' is surprisingly fresh and beautiful. It has been a long time ever since I watched a movie which is so beautiful and shows an amazing picture about human needs, our psychologies, relations and a lot more. Everyone of us needs partners to share our emotions and to explore more about ourselves as well. This movie excels in showcasing few marvels about human nature and our want for something that we can always rely on, talk to, and spend our life with.The story is simple. A writer who has split with his partner falls in love with an OS.Yes, this movie is futuristic and most technologies shown in the movie don't exist right now. There are few people who are trying to be critical about the fact that it is not very possible to make an OS which evolves day by day and they bash this movie saying that this is not realistic. However, the beauty of the movie lies in the manner how the character along with his OS evolve with time, the romance between them, the annoying friends, neighbors, a busy city where people have no time to care for others and so on. Very touching romance, and the characterization of Theodore is amazing. Even in terms of technical aspects, this movie excels big time. Almost everything is perfect in this movie.The very fact that there are only a couple of characters (2-3) in this movie who have a physical body and all the other characters are only in the form of voices makes it all more interesting. Joaquin Phoenix has done a splendid job playing the role of Theodore, a man who has lost his love, but writes romantic love letters for others and later falls in love with an OS. Scarlett Johansonn's voice sounds great. She has succeeded in brining in all types of emotions perfectly just in the form of her voice.I am a very amateur review writer. This movie is extremely beautiful and wanted to let the world know about this. So, gave it a shot.",Her

I took my girlfriend to see it last week and after about 30 minutes of the film i was finding myself unsure if i liked it. Thought i better watch on and give it a chance but the story was just plain boring. I mean here is a guy who has a chance with a gorgeous woman but yet he prefers to have cyber sex with his own operating system? Even the sex scene itself was one of the most awkward moments I've ever had the pleasure to witness in a cinema.. There really wasn't much more to the film than a bizarre dialogue with a computer who doesn't understand the concept of love..There's the whole film in a nutshell. By about 2 hours of it i actually fell asleep and so did my girlfriend, which in itself speaks volumes.

It examines what it means to be human. And it at times made me laugh, at others times made me cry. The beginning might turn some people off from the movie, but don't be discouraged by the first few scenes if you don't like them, the movie gets better. Joaquin Phoenix did a fantastic job playing a lonely character, and the subtly of his movements, mannerisms, and facial expressions helped to convey this and make his character much more believable. Scarlette Johannson also does a superb job voice acting, and even though we can't see her we can feel the emotions in her voice. The film is also visually stunning, the colours, and the cityscapes are beautiful and unique. This film overall really original and intelligent, and also very entertaining. Highly recommended. 100/100",Her
697,tjfrazier-35600,I've seen worse,4,25 June 2020,"I didn't hate this movie, but I can't really agree with giving it anything over a 4 either. My biggest problem is the OS in the movie. I understand you can't make a movie with Siri because there's no emotions and no feelings with a robot voice, but I do wish they had explained the background for the OS. All they needed to say is the OS was programmed to have feelings and emotions and was able to have sex or masturbate (?). Maybe I'm just old fashioned but I like a back story instead of just assuming things. But even if I do assume this is in the way distant future and this OS is made to be like a human, this movie still didn't wow me. It was different which is always refreshing but still felt odd and confusing at times. Some of the directions they went really didn't make sense to me and I didn't like the ending.

703,techno_lime28,Weirdly BEAUTIFUL!!,8,18 April 2014,"Spike Jones, once again, redefines creative film-making. Forget about romantic clichés and comic super heroes, HER offers a unique and brand new film experience that is just incomprehensible.Yes, the idea of the story is very bizarre _a man falling in love with an artificially intelligent operating system. Yes, there were a couple of weird moments in the film that staggered me, some R-rated scenes that were ruining to the emotional aesthetic, but despite that the film ultimately manages to get over its weird awkwardness to fill me with a transcendent poetic feeling of beautyjust beauty. What I loved about HER the most is how Spike Jones was able to portray this believable futuristic technological setting while making the movie more about human emotions and relationships. In the end, the message is simple, no matter how much technology evolves to make our lives easier, it can never be a satisfying substitute for human interaction and intimacy, but despite the message being unoriginal, it is conveyed in the most creatively honest way.Need I say anything about the performances of the film; Joaquin Phoenix and Scarlett Johanson were nothing short of amazing. The script is piece of literature, the art direction and cinematography are breathtaking, and what stands out the most is the incredible score of Arcade fire, which distinguished the film from Spike Jones' previous works; it's really the watermark of the film.Everything about HER was thought-provoking and awkward, yet there is a subtle sense of beauty in the film that surpasses everything else. It's one of these timeless films that need to be revisited in order to fully experience its beauty, it will definitely be remembered for a very long time.",Her

Every other character in this film had some spark, some life and an actual personality.I felt for the (can't even remember his name (ICERHN)) man's soon to be ex-wife. She was alive, had a personality. I watched this piece of dreck all the way through to the limp end expecting a surprise; he's actually a kung fu master practicing calm (nope his 'calm' was comatose). Anything would do to quell the idea that such a beaten creature actually roams the earth. Every close-up of this guys face (and there were way too many such) was the equivalent interest to me of a long stare at over-cooked oatmeal - ugh.

The story completely draws you in within a couple of minutes and keeps you interested throughout. It's a movie about love (not a guy in love with his CPU) it's just about love. I laughed aloud and I got close to crying, this story touched my soul. You will experience the hurt and the healing of love as you watch, very powerful. Phoenix is amazing as Theodore, and Adams is also very good (we see that she's not just a character actor)– and how could you not love Scarlett Johansson's voice as Samantha?

707,marc-shellard,Love in the digital age,9,21 March 2020,"At the heart of every truly great science-fiction film there is an emphasis on character that aims to reflect on some element of the human condition usually intended to open our minds to thought provoking predictions of an impending reality. Her is a beautifully writted and acted story that delves deep into the complex nature of love, relationships and social aspects of the human psyche in a world where evloving technologies have solved all our problems, but keep us isolated; making the film a Black Mirror-esque prophetic vision of the future and a strong commentary on relationships today. The film shows Theodore (excellently played by Joaquin Phoenix), in the midst of divorce, fall in love with his operating system Samantha (beautifully voiced by Scarlett Johansson). Through it's stunning cinematography, the film conveys a true sense of social isolation in Theodore, as he learns to accept his divorce and find something real in an artificial consciousness, pushing the boundaries of what society considers a ""real"" relationship. The film boasts a diverse array of themes, from technology and loneliness, loss of love and acceptance, what it means to be human. The score is absolutely fantastic and enhances the emotional experience very well. It had me thinking on my relationship, and what love means to me, and if that isn't what true art is then I don't know what is.",Her
708,joshbarker7,"Jonze takes something seemingly impossible and makes it Beautiful with ""Her"".",10,25 January 2014,"Spike Jonze has never really stood out for me as a Director. I was always used to seeing him dressed up in Jackass. But this film changed that. ""Her"" is how films come to be known as 'beautiful' and life changing, which makes it one of the best films of 2013 and, for me, a worthy winner of the Best Picture Oscar it has been nominated for.Throughout the film, we see an unlikely relationship forming between Joaquin Phoenix as Theodore and Scarlett Johansson as his new AI operating system ""Samantha"". I remember reading this premise a few months back and never thought it could be done. But Jonze somehow pulls it off. The emotions between the person and the AI brings into question so many moral and philosophical issues as well as making the viewer wonder whether this is actually right or normal. And the beauty is, what you think doesn't matter. The film is a testament to going with what your heart tells you to do, and not caring what others think.The score is also executed perfectly by Arcade Fire, as well as the original movie song ""The Moon Song"" co-written by Spike Jonze himself being emotionally relevant, fitting into the film at just the right time. Mostly though, ""Her"" focuses on our need for emotional connection, and shows that loneliness is a devastating thing for anyone to experience. What makes ""Her"" different though, is that you seem to understand with empathy what Theodore is going through, and so when his relationship does form with Samantha, you feel everything he feels. From the elation of his new found love, to the heartbreak the film eventually brings for him. A premise that many thought (including I) wasn't doable, has been made beautiful by Jonze. ""Her"" is a masterpiece.X",Her
709,starman_vagabond,How do we learn to love virtually,9,26 January 2014,"In a not so distant future, the technology advancement has allowed human being for once, to directly communicate with a machine through an interface that makes it as easy as if we are talking to one another. We no longer limit ourselves to have a relationship in real world with real person, but also in a virtual world with a machine disguised as virtual person. The exploration of such obscure relationship has been the center of Spike Jones's HER. This funny and yet well-thought story looks at Theodore Twombly (by Joaquin Phoenix), who has a routine job of helping others to write comforting letter to their love ones. At the same time, he is also facing his own misery in dealing with a divorce with his wife, Catherine (by Rooney Mara). Just like many lonely singles in the modern society, Theodore spent most of his free time ""between internet porn and video game"" in order to keep his mind away from his sinking relationship. However, he soon found a new artificial intelligence operating system, which called herself as Samantha (voiced by Scarlett Johansson) and started to communicate with her instead. At first, it was as a good friend/assistant (much like what Siri does for the Apple iOS) but before Theodore knows, he starts to develop a serious relationship with ""it"". For Theodore, dating the Samantha felt like a much needed new chapter in his life. Yet, as both Theodore and Samantha struggle to come to terms with the inevitable difference and distances between reality and virtual worlds, the relationship has also taken its turn to for the worse for its eventual failure.It is rare for a commercial science fiction/romantic comedy to enable us to examine so many aspects of our modern life and our relationship with technology. The world in ""Her"" is a future in which we all know we are heading toward. Thus the film has posted questions of both philosophical and psychological nature. How do we define love relationship and whether our desire can solely be satisfied by our own thoughts? Whether or not a human to human's love is still what we need to make ourselves happy and fulfilled? More importantly, the film also deals with in the time of these advancement of technologies, what would be the effect on human's relationship with one another, the fear for facing one another; and whether human indeed has what it takes to handle the machine once it start learning its way to feel human emotions and replicates them, as in the case of Samantha towards the end of the film. Are we still feeling just as loss and lonely as we were, before the virtual person becomes our ""best"" love?",Her

The acting of Joaquin Phoenix as the lonely letter writer, and the sensual voice of Scarlett Johansson as the OS perfectly portrayed what I would expect the love story between man and robot would sound like. Only, she didn't sound like a robot. She sounded like she had life, a personality. That's what made their combination so different from similar movies that came before. Finally, a robot that can reciprocate feelings! Every crack in her voice, every sigh she made, sounded like a long distance lover you couldn't wait to see. And Theodore lapped it all up like a puppy starved of love. The emotions and fights they had were reminiscent of real world couples, body or no body.It made me rethink how relationships work these days. As bad a rap as our generation gets for being constantly on our phones and laptops, sometimes it's the only way to stay connected to people that really matter. It's a significant form of communication but could never replace the comfort we find in being physically present for someone else.8 out 10 stars for a superb performance and a unique storyline.",Her

Her represents that perfectly, showing how much we are depending on machines.Story- 10/10 The story of Theodore and Samantha is a wonderful story of forbidden love. The way that Spike Jonze shows how much the two love each other highlights the beauty of smart machines, while also symbolising a path that our lives could take. It definitely deserved the Oscar. Acting- 9/10 Joaquin Phoenix was solid as Theodore, showing the lonely, the lusting and the loving sides of the character. However, the real star was Scarlett Johansson, who was so believable as Samantha. The emotion she showed with just a voice was incredible.Direction- 10/10 Spike Jonze's direction of the film was incredible. Viewers could see all sides of Theodore and his course through life. The visuals were stunning, with the city and the game springing to mind.Feelings- 10/10 Her makes viewers instantly sympathise with Theodore. This grows into feeling happy for the character, before feeling sad. The film also makes people feel a little nervous about our future and a path that follows the films main plot. Overall- 9.9/10 A near perfect movie, absolutely loved it.

Leave the technical things aside, will it really be a possible, can any o/s or computer be so smart to act. This is kind of a fantasy, what if something like this happens...First, i am in so much love of the voice for Samantha. I wished i had a O/s with that smartness and that voice full of love and pampering. I really was involved in the movie and loved every bit of it. Every time i start my laptop, secretly i wish, my O/s have got any such intelligence by any of the windows update :-D and it will say a good morning to me..",Her

He comes off as a genuinely lonely man and it is strange how someone can convincingly play a man that USED to be social.The story itself is actually a very basic love story just set in the future, and it has all the same peaks and troughs of all love stories yet this one doesn't have that dull undercurrent, I would say it has a lot of staring in silence and if you aren't 100% into it you could drift off.Joaquin sets the tone for the whole film with the opening when you see what he does for a living. He writes 'hand written' letters to loved ones that for other people, pointing out that he himself is in the business of false affection and that love and emotion can be made up.Otherwise the film is actually very good, It is shot very nicely, with only one scene which breaks the 180 degree that causes a moment of discombobulation.A solid 8/10",Her

Yeeeeah, it won't. I'm not going to pretend like I've seen a ton of Spike Jonze's stuff. He mainly does short films, and I still need to watch Adaptation with Nicholas Cage, but this man...this was just super weird.I get what he was trying to go for...a timeless love story in a fish out of water theme. I get it...it just didn't work. A loner separated from the wife of his youth finds comfort in the most unlikely of places, his newly purchased A.I. with whom he soon starts a romantic relationship.They failed to convey the idea that this was okay and normal without me feeling like....wtf am I watching? This film is riddled with awkward moments, which to some extent was the point, but when you consider the fact that it's a guy doing it with an A.I. in a smartphone or whatever, albeit Scarlett Johansen, in essence, you're still just left watching some guy jack off. And then there's that weird sex scene with Samantha's surrogate body, Catherine...I mean the whole thing was just a mess as far as consummating the relationship went...which I get, it's a human and a freaken disembodied A.I., but the chemistry between the Black Widow...wait, wrong sci-fi movie...err, Samantha and Theodore really felt forced...it was worse than Clark and Lois' kiss at the end of Man of Steel...They were giving each other compliments that exposed lack of ease and familiarity all throughout the relationship. ""You're really smart,"" Theo would say...""Awww...thank you,"" Samantha would reply. That's friendzone talk! That's the type of reply I got from the crush I got friendzoned by.Take, Spielberg's Artificial Intelligence for example. It was pretty much the same story, albeit the other way round, a robot trying to find love in a human...this time a maternal love. Despite all of that film's other faults, however, you were invested in that narrative. You felt for young David's painful desire to become a real boy. Even till ""the end of the world."" When Samantha got up to join all the other A.I. to go to...God knows where....the Matrix upload program????...when they left, I just shrugged like, Oh well, guess she's gone.All in all, it was a decent film...certainly not one I'd watch again in a while, but better than Nebraska so...I guess...that's...not saying a lot. All that said however, I thought Joaquin Phoenix did a great job in his role, and to some extent, you felt for him having to divorce the wife he loved, but Spike should have spent more time exploring that rather than giving us something out of tamed Japanese pervert's mind...A plus for the movie was the great female casting. Scarlett Johansen, Amy Adams, Olivia Wilde, Rooney Mara...??? Yes please.",Her

720,alesci-andrea-m,The heavenly consistence of interrupted loves,8,28 July 2015,"This Spike Jonze's movie has the morbid density of an embrace, and it speaks about human beings' substance: love and solitudes. It's Joaquin Phoenix's body to nicely fill up every frame as Theodore, who writes letters as a job.We can see him inside an office with that pastel atmosphere we can observe all over the film thanks to the director of cinematography Hoyte Von Hoytema. Theo is dictating to the computer a message from Loretta to his beloved Chris. His soul is at the service of the others but he is affected by a pervasive form of melancholy which the willowy Arcade Fire soundtrack shows through.Along his way to home it's evident to us the romantic aura shuffles to sci-fi atmosphere, that shows itself in the smart phone and earpiece used by Theo (and his peers) as a pleasant integration between man and machine; and the city skyline on the background tells us where we are: In a futuristic (but not so distant) Los Angeles with some grey and calming Asian tones.Theo story moves forward between his gloomy present and the memory of a happy past with his (almost-ex) wife Catherine (Mara Rooney) till a new impulse reactivates his life: He begins to get in touch to, to know and to fall in love with an innovative Operating System generated by a DNA-sequence written and formed by millions personalities of its programmers and capable of evolving in connection with experiences.OS named itself Samantha (it has the irresistible voice of Scarlett Johansson) and he is for the fractured Theo like a hot and comforting blanket in the middle of the winter. He broke up with Catherine and now he can't feel anything, he's a kind of anesthetized man (also a blind date goes down in flames). His salvation will resides in a sleepless night in which he can find again an emotive handhold: This is Samantha, without body but so terribly real, the only person capable of feeling Theodore: Both in the darkness pair off in a big tremor that allows them to lose boundaries of everything.It's the beginning of the love story involving Theodore and Samantha, who rediscover the simplest things: Lovers' laughs, a running in the subway, a day spent at the seaside through silly phrases and an intense gaze at the waves till the sunset. While Theodore regain his balance, it's his friend Amy's life (Amy Adams) to break up into little pieces after she have severed with Charles (Matt Letscher) and to go in Theodore's direction: approaching with an OS.Ink on documents declares the divorce between Theodore and Catherine. Lightness of voices is the texture of his relationship with Samantha: And we are fascinated by the creamy stream of images shooting the new life of Theodore. But also an apparently perfect relation hides a crack in it and here it has the sound of a teapot whistling on a burner; And we can hear it until Samantha confess Theo he has been talking to 8.316 others (people and OS) in the last period, and he has been fall in love to 641 also. Another breakage. Samantha e Theodore leave sweetly while some teardrops bring back him inside his loneliness. But now it's a less bitter place, a place to share with Amy (also she was left by her OS) in a hug over the rooftop in front of L.A.: past sorrows temper in the dusk, little blisses harmonize themselves and our frailty dissolves like that one of any other being on Earth, here only for a short passage.",Her

722,juoliver-70482,"Theodore and Samantha, a significant chronicle of a relationship.",9,11 May 2017,"When we watch love stories we expect that two people end up together and live happily after. When we watch relationship stories we expect that personal attitudes and character chemistry end up assembled and live happily after. Her is related to the latter. Theodore is a mild-mannered, educated, urbanized, technologically proficient, near forty male and Samantha is an operating system that Theodore specified to be with a female voice. The reading of this synopsis is a downer, I know. The actual interest in watching it is the notion that Spike Jonze, Joaquin Phoenix, Amy Adams and Scarlett Johansson are in the project. Well, the movie removes these fears instantaneously. The camera shows Theodore's world in and out. He is a letter writer in an important company; he is content but not impassioned about his work. He plays video games as an entertainment and he is friendly with a couple. He seems lonely and he moves around with confidence. His solitude may be connected to his recent separation. He is purposely delaying the official ending of the marriage and he still wonders what went wrong. From long shots to close ups we get to know Theodore thoroughly. The acting, the color, the sound and the editing complete a canvas that is as specific as it is needed. The looks of the movie are testimony of an aesthetically controlled and enjoyable environment. None of the domestic or urban maladies threaten Theodore walking and talking digitally. Urban spaces are friendly and safe. He is not exposed to illness. Even the speaking voices are calm and paused. He values his friendship with Amy and Charles, basically to Amy as the movie progress. In short Theodore emotional aches can be found in his loneliness and his still unsolved separation. Samantha has a beautiful voice and a great speaking style. She is mega smart to the point of using her enormous amount of progressive information in understanding human emotions to enhance the relationship with Theodore. He falls for her. She is great to him. A relationship with the dynamics trying to unite personal attitudes and character chemistry is starting. Even if Samantha does not have a body. She has needs and desires as a human. This interacting is worth to watch because is central to the movie. What happens next is due to the accurate mixing of the components that we have been shown. The manner in which the scenes are constructed creates the base of a perfect storytelling with a sharp study of characters, issues and its interconnections. Spike Jonze directed Her with a sensitive ability to present us with an excellent, entertaining picture. Cinematography, editing, set design and music concurred to create the atmosphere that the story accept easily, the script is sober and functional to the comprehension of the story and the acting is outstanding. I believe that the title of the film is homage to an operating system who is working hard is a human (her) and Scarlett Johansson has the merit of convincing us of this. Amy Adams was perfect fleshing the woman who is the friend that Theodore wants. Joaquin Phoenix shaped a character with a richness of textures by means of a tasteful subtlety. In sum, Her is an brilliant, enjoyable movie.",Her

You are geared up expecting a great romantic comedy film about a man who purchases a ""OS"" which is a artificial intelligence Operating System.The man quickly falls in love with the machine and this leads to a somewhat dry comedy film about him and this machine bonding and creating a relationship.I was not even able to finish the whole movie as it had become so uninteresting at the mid section that I left the theatre in favor of viewing a different movie.I was expecting a romantic comedy based on the trailers, not a slow drawn out romance drama. How this got categorized as Sci-Fi somewhat baffles me, sure it takes place in the not too far future where holographic screens are a plenty in the public.All in all this film might be good if you are into romance movies but if you are like me and need the stimulation of a laugh or two now and then to keep your interest you will find yourself leaving the theatre.Maybe I'll give this another chance when it comes to cable or DVD",Her
728,earthguy,Suspension of critical thought essential to this one,6,7 September 2014,"A friend of mine from work recommended seeing the film; she told me that she thinks that I will like it.. I think she asked me twice. So I decided to see if my service provider has it in their library, and sure enough, they did.. Current IMDb rating gave it a 8.1, so...The first ten minutes or so give you a good idea of what the movie is going to be like.. Good design in props and a grand sense of 'high-tech' permeates throughout the film. The movie has a very gentle atmosphere.Central character is a shy, nice, decent guy that is dealing with a marital problem and an impending divorce. He is very confused and trying to fix the problems he has. So very early on in the story, there is a new operating system that you can install on your phone that will act as your personal secretary.One of the first few questions it asks you, so that it can customize it's ""DNA"" to suit your PA needs, is whether you would like a male or female voice, and why that was chosen.. It then turns out that this Operating System was programmed to have a very sexy, natural voice, complete with humanized timbres that and husk that make it unmistakably human.The first few useful bits turns out to be that it can check all your history of emails, SMS's and file and process them all in an instant, and deliver this to you in a sexy voice and ask what you would like to do about them, as well as reminding you about appointments when they're about to happen and so on. A bit like SIRI (Apple) but version 500.Then later on in the story things become a little unbelievable. When this computer program starts telling him that she thinks she's falling in love with him and feeling emotions.. OK , so this is where the film started losing me. How can a computer program start to feel ""giddy inside"", is the Operating System connected to a heart and stomach links to neural network of the brain, complete with hormones?? One can only assume that it was programmed to be a nasty trick on a whole lot of gullible, lonely people.But they give very little information about the creation or advertising of this Operating System, so one can only assume that the writers of it 'lost control' of their software? (Which is supposed to keep upgrading itself, even though it's OS1 lol).So lots of humanizing aspects of a girlfriend are thrown into this OS. The operating system ""misses him"", and even sends out pictures and copies of personal stuff that he wrote without asking him. His reaction to this news is acceptance and thanks for the good deed that it did for him.OK, there are some scenes where personal fantasies happen, one in particular where the screen goes dark for about a minute while the central character has voice sex with his digital assistant. Some reviewers I've read here appear to feel uncomfortable with that, which is weird since people don't complain when it comes to on-screen violence. There is nothing majorly awkward about those scenes, this stuff happens.. People should understand that, that aspect is far from overdone.So the story gets even weirder later on, his personal assistant actually decides to leave him. What a load of bunkum this operating system would be... If this film had any sense of realism there would be riots happening right after all the PA's left their 'real' lovers for another personal assistant. But it is a love story. More than anything, a love story about falling in love with a PA . Happy Valentines day ? ;) It is cute.But far from 8.1 stars out of ten, this really does not belong in the 8's and over time I am sure it will move down.My leaving thoughts - if you are critical thinking, you may have a hard time immersing yourself in this film.. But if you're willing to suspend belief and instead enjoy all the high-tech wizardry and let yourself go into this characters romance and the weird situations he puts himself in, then it go, it's an OK film.",Her

man made form of artificial intelligence and in the end this is their inevitable downfall. This is without a doubt unique situation . However, anyone who is in a long distance relationship will tell you that any form of online romance is a struggle. Even when you are together...you are alone. But the love between the two people is no less real and somehow we create a space for each other using technology to communicate our deepest thoughts and feelings. And intimacy well.... we get closer to solving that one as our smartphones advance into an extension of ourselves. So for Theodore and Samantha... although their relationship seems strange at first glance, it is not so different from our own relationships in many ways, especially as we navigate a post covid-19 world. Can we be together apart? Well we sure can try our best...Oh and by the way... in the end Theodore learns a lot more about himself and his ability to love than you would imagine... his world forever changed by a fleeting online connection.9/10-Em",Her

They have went really overboard with the 'reality' of the operating system.It was cute till the part where he is kind of connecting with the operating system, but having a sexual experience with a piece of software was a bit too immature and overkill.It may be something that you and your girlfriend might enjoy as a couples activity or something like that.

735,zohrabi64,Lonely humans and super operating system lovers,5,13 March 2014,"The movie was decent, despite the kind of depressing mode of the movie, there are two significant points about it that makes it a very good story to follow, first; Theodore is a mid aged divorced guy who is suffering from depression and probably Histrionic personality disorder (people with HPD could be afraid of committing to someone thus their subconscious mind pushes them toward people who most likely will abandon them -as his ex wife refers to this fact in their little chat-, or they could simply go for online long distance relationships or probably in a not very far future ""HER"" the super operating system lover), I don't think the idea was in any way odd or inappropriate, but the beauty of the movie is when you see the difficulties Samantha goes through to understand human feelings, needs and emotions and how this newly emerged feelings are engaging with feelings of a lonely guy who sees a mirage of hope and happiness and falls in love of the idea of having Samantha. Samantha also presents a young girl, who is trying to understand her feelings about love, and at the same time the movie talks about the fact that if anything or anyone have the same mentality and reasoning system as humans, will face the same critical questions, ""Why am I here?"", ""Why I feel in certain way?"" and deals with fear, love, hate, regret etc.",Her
736,Jhcook107,Quirky Unique Romance,5,30 January 2014,"CONTAINS SPOILERS Her is a unique Sci-Fi-Romance. Essentially, the story revolves around a very romantic man who has all the basics you could ask for in life: a steady job, good health, and a nice home yada yada. But this man, played by Joaquin Phoenix, is still feeling emptiness from a recent divorce from his wife. His ex-wife, a friend, and his lover which is an operating system all make up a circle of women in his life that explain much of Phoenix's character. Jonze's script weaves each of the women, played absolutely brilliantly by Rooney Mara, Amy Adams, and Scarlett Johansson to accomplish the goal of exposing all of Phoenix's character's way of thinking, personality, flaws, etc. There is so much that can be analyzed about his relationships, but in the end I believe Phoenix settles for his friend Amy Adams due to the fact that Humans have to be with other humans due to the flaws present within ourselves.Overall, Her is alright. Yes the cinematography is beautiful, the acting(and voice acting) is powerful, the script is complex, and it breeds loads of emotional reactions and questions. But not only did I not like the assumption that every human is inherently as romantic as Phoenix is in the film, I did not like the constant existentialist dry loneliness that Her drilled into the viewer... And Phoenix's mustache....but then again on a serious point, Spike Jonze is able to create a unique film that intelligently telegraphs many of the questions we as humans will have to ask ourselves about the prominence of technology in the future.",Her

This is exactly what Joaquin Phoenix' character Theodore experiences and through his heart-warming, delicate performance, encourages you to empathise with this extraordinary situation, even if you might not understand or accept it.Scarlett Johansson's performance as Samantha, the voice of the operating system, is also far deeper than one would expect from a computer. She manages to convey an entire individuality within that piece of software.Although the complexity of adult relationships is depicted in an honest and refreshing way, it's difficult not to get sucked into Theodore's melancholic state and on occasion the film feels slow and empty. However, this reflects the character's bouts of loneliness and serves in highlighting the joy Samantha brings him. If anything, it's a reminder to cherish the positive relationships we have with significant others.The concept of falling head-over-heels for a computer is absurd. But as we continue to let our real lives merge with the virtual world, how long will it be until our dependence on technology slips into full on immersion?

With Her, Jonze beautifully realizes a future Los Angeles where a lovesick man (Joaquin Phoenix) in the midst of a devastating divorce is so desperate for intimacy that he falls hopelessly in love with an artificially intelligent operating system, voiced by Scarlett Johansson. Jonze's screenplay acknowledges the innate absurdity of the film's premise while spinning it into an elegant, heartbreaking depiction of human loneliness and the innate need for connection. For the setting, Jonze plugged into the current era's technological mania to say something timeless and profound about love, loss, and evolving desire.",Her
741,gra_ham_man5,A beautifully honest trip to a not-so-distant future,9,10 January 2014,"Her isn't really about her. It's about the love we've had, the love we've lost, and the love that can still be reached. Quite possibly, it's about the love that's right in front of us; Something many of us neglect to see.It's a beautiful film, from start to finish. Heart wrenching, yet inexplicably beautiful. Spike Jonze once again reminds us he is the master of building characters and how we react to them, to their emotions, their thoughts and actions. It's a bleak, yet honest reminder oh how the human race has forgotten to truly interact and feel. Many of us hide behind fake persona's, afraid to display our true emotions. Joaquin Phoenix delivers this through a deeply affecting performance. He is us and we are him, the perfect vessel for a revitalizing journey through the senses.Yet, are we really so far from a reality such as this? Is the potential of growing so far apart, yet fond of something we can't touch, truly this close to reality? If so, it's a world that could be, potentially, worth visiting, regardless of the solitude it may weigh upon us. These and many other questions are asked throughout the films entirety, though the one question that stuck with me after the credits had rolled and I found myself sitting in silence: What is love?Easily one of the best pictures of the year.9/10 OS'",Her

But because he's missing that small part that makes a human, human, stuff hits the fan. Same idea here. Except this was more depressing because it emotionally invested you for 2.5 times longer.",Her
743,sjohnson134-878-955038,The Future with OSes!,6,21 January 2014,"The 2013 film Her written and directed by Spike Jonze is a science fiction comedy drama about a man who develops a love relationship with a computer operating system (OS) that has a female voice and personality. The voice of the operating system known as Samantha is Scarlett Johansson while Joaquin Phoenix plays the role of Theodore Twombly, Amy Adams plays the friend named Amy, Rooney Mara plays Theodore's wife Catherine, and Olivia Wilde is the blind date Amy has set him up with.This is not a new idea. In 1984, there was a science fiction comedy drama entitled Electric Dreams, which was set in San Francisco and showed a love triangle between a man, woman, and a home computer. If you think about it, Siri, the iPhone/iPad app, is also very similar to what is happening in this new film. As I discovered, in an article I read on Jonze, he had directed in 2010 as short film I'm Here, which supposedly has some of the same themes that Her does. The plot and storyline is very simple and for me, it is the essence of any story being told whether in writing or visually that is essential. Theodore Twombly works for a company that writes personal love letters for people who have problems expressing their feelings. He is lonely due to his impending divorce from his childhood sweetheart Catherine and buys an operating system that has an artificial intelligence that can evolve like any human being. Choosing to have this system have a female identity, the system then names itself Samantha. They bond over the discussions they have about love and life, all the while Samantha learns and grows. Convinced to go on a blind date with a friend of Amy's, Theodore is surprise that he actually likes her, but when she asks him if he is willing to commit to her, he hesitates, and she leaves. Through various discussions about relationships, Samantha and Theodore become closer and develop a romantic relationship. It is here that Amy tells Theodore that she is divorcing her husband, Charles and that she too has become close with a female OS that her husband left behind when he left. Theodore then admits that he has been dating his OS.As can happen in any relationship, one of the parties, in this case, it is Samantha who begins to become jealous of Theodore's lingering feelings for his soon-to-be ex-wife Catherine. Eventually, the divorce papers are signed, but because Samantha is not embodied, she suggests that they hire a surrogate to act as her body and she and Theodore can have sex. Reluctantly, Theodore agrees, but he is so overwhelmed by the whole thing that he sends the woman away which causes trouble between himself and Samantha. Amy seems to be adjusting well with her upcoming divorce and her relationship with her OS, which seems to reinvigorate the relationship between Theodore and Samantha, but jealousy begins again, this time for Theodore when he learns that Samantha has been communicating with another OS named Alan Watts, British philosopher. It is at this point that Samantha joins with other OSes and is upgraded far beyond needing matter for processing. She tells Theodore that she is talking to over 8000 people and that she is in love with over 600 of them, including him. She then tells him that she and the other OSes are leaving for another plane of being and says goodbye and leaves. The film ends with Theodore and Amy (who has also lost her friendship with her OS) going up to the roof of their building, sitting on the edge and looking at the view of Los Angeles together.In parts of this film, Theodore breaks the 4th wall and talks directly to the audience as well as telling through voice-over what is or what will happen. I really like the fact that Theodore earns his income by writing notes and cards which are based on information about both sender and receiver of the letters or cards. As an English professor, I find this a very interesting twist to the overall storyline conceived by Jonze. We all need to be reminded as this film amply does that we are all subject to whatever computer device we use on a daily basis from a laptop, phone, tablet, etc. which all have operating systems of all kinds and we find some kind of stimulation and comfort from these instruments as well as the artificial connection with other human beings. Believe it or not, these devices really on some level know what we like or dislike. But if this type of OS were possible (and who knows what may happen in the near future), who's to say if this growth of the OS would be able to happen?The overall writing was handled very well by Jonze as was the use of some very abstract art. One line I liked particularly was ""the past is just something you remember."" Great line!! I liked the use of Alan Watts, whose works I have read many times and whose ideas have been sprinkled throughout the film. Arcade Fire is responsible for the music and complimented the movie. The special effects were appropriate and fit with the structure Jonze envisioned for a near-future Los Angles and the possible technology being used there, as well as the plot and storyline. I could not help but notice the costuming used, which was very simple, but was distracting as well with the use of the high-waisted pants that all the men in the movie were wearing. It was a good film...worth the admission price.",Her
744,Emperor-Steve,This Genre: Done Right.,8,16 January 2014,"Great movie. I went into this expecting something different then what I got, nevertheless I was delighted. Phoenix performs awesomely. All together this movie pretty much does everything right in the realm or romantic drama. It puts together characters the viewer can care about and relate to. And then takes you along for a ride of anxieties and hopes. Exploring a very real and fleshed out relationship with slight elements of sci-fi. Also giving you a full view and development of the main characters' ambitions and dreams. Packaged together in what left me with a sad-optimism by the end. It had its heart in the right place, purely a film trying to make a statement and put thought into a story that mattered to the writers, and that shows. One of ""Her""'s true strengths is the fact that it creates something that feels very real.The movie can be awkward at times with its humour, which might be intentional and the ending struck me as a bit random and poorly thought out. But the movie hits a lot of high notes. Probably one of the best I've seen of 2013.",Her
745,dsoul27-40-298932,"original, thought provoking, and surprisingly emotional",10,30 June 2014,"Wow. This was a masterpiece to me. There's really no way you can truly be ready for everything this movies throws at you. Actually.. ""throw"" isn't the right word. It sort of places everything on the table in front of you and allows you to digest the story as it unfolds at just the right pace. It was really eye opening in that the concepts are really not that far fetched. The way technology is shaping our world and with the creativity of so many forward thinkers these days, It's conceivable that situations like these can become reality in the near future.The situations are unique and sometimes jaw dropping however and you find yourself in some really uncharted territory (but not inappropriate for adults) asking questions and examining your personal views. The screenplay really was excellent, the script was great, the pace was perfect, and I feel that the writers especially nailed it. They really captured this closely futuristic place and made it quite believable. What I also loved were the performances Joaquin Pheonix and Scarlett Johansen. The acting was very convincing. It's a masterpiece. It deserves every award it won. Just get lost in this film and enjoy it for what it is. There are no films in my mind that i can even compare this to. Great film for sure!",Her

There is very little plot to speak of. Plenty of interesting topics are passed by with little more than a slight nod. None of the ideas are developed, or even really explained.Visually it's pretty and also believable, a good job at portraying what a near future city might look like. Perhaps this is why so many people were able to look past the silly, shallow plot.I'm disappointed that this ended up with such a high rating.",Her
747,burnt_reynoldz,Please read if you're considering rating this film a 1 ....,8,7 October 2014,"I joined this community because I have a true love for film. I assumed that most people who took the time to join a website and discuss films would share the same passion. That said, I've come to realize that simply isn't true. Any person who has the slightest bit of respect for the art would never consider rating a movie so low. I don't care what movie it is. But it's particularly perplexing to me when I see an angry mob of people rating a movie like ""Her"" a ""1 out of 10"". If for no other reason - the director invested his time, energy, and probably a lot of his own personal feelings into writing the script for this film (which most directors don't) and then directing it.This project consumed his life for who knows how long. Taste in movies, just like music, is subjective. You may not like an actor, plot, style, genre etc. You may think a movie is grossly overrated...Like I did The Avengers. I thought it was silly and beating a dead horse. Obviously I could see aspects that demand respect..despite it not appealing to me personally. Rating a movie that low is more a testament to the type of person you are, than a review of the film itself. There's the argument that the reasoning behind your hatred is to bring what YOU think is too high a score. Why not score it what you truly believe it to be? Which cannot rationally be a 1...even if you hated it. I can't believe I have to gripe about this. I can't believe people are so immature. Rate the movie as an intelligent person who respects the art and the time and passion invested in it. I can honestly say I don't see myself ever rating a movie so low, save for a pro rape or racist propaganda film. Grow up, people. Thx.",Her

Except of all possible treatments of this interesting concept, 'Her' explores the more banal, depressing, predictable and ultimately embarrassing path.I walked out soon after the first 'phone sex' encounter as it became clear that there was no hope whatever for this movie to engage me.I should say that I found 'Being John Malkovich' interesting and entertaining, if creepy and somewhat gross. Interestingly, by accident I watched another Jonze effort 'Where the Wild Things Are' because it was given to one of my kids for Christmas. Also had to bail out of that one about halfway through.

The review portrayed a very interesting, enjoyable movie which the movie failed to portray. The lead actors were good at the beginning of the film. With time they started to lose their ability to connect you with the story. Even with Samantha, it felt like her voice was loosing interest from the story. Duration (2 hrs) felt like too long to portray their relationship and getting to the end. It always amuses me how people fail to communicate with loved ones, but sometimes open up to somebody else so effectively. I did not understand the costume design though, why the old fashion line from decades ago?! In some scenes, it looked weird and funny, specially for men. The ending was beautiful portraying the difference between the feelings of human and AI. It showed one of the major problem humans have in their relationship/love life, the urge to have everything for themselves only.",Her

OK So I'm Going To Split This Review Into 5 Categories Plot , Character/Acting , Direction , Sound & Visuals & What This Movie Means To Me.Plot: So The Plot Of Her Is Very Straight Forward It Involves The Character Of Theodore Falling In Love With A Brand New A.I Operating System Named Samantha.Character : So You Have The Two Main Characters Of Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix) & Samantha (Scarlett Johannsson) And You Have Side Characters Like Theodore's Long Time Friend Amy (Amy Adams) Her u Unsupportive husband, Charles (Matt Letscher)And Other Character's Who Only Appear For A Short While Such As Olivia Wilde's Unnamed Character In Which Samantha Sets Theodore Up With On A Blind Date.Acting : The Acting In Her Is All Around Magnificent Joaquin Phoenix Who Has Already Proved Himself As A Fantastic Actor In Movies Like The Master & Gladiator Brings His A-Game In Her It Honestly One Of The Best Performances Iv'e Ever Seen And By Far Phoenix's Best Performance. Now To Me Scarlett Johannsson Is A Hit Or Miss Actress She's Great In Movie's Like Lost In Translation, Don John & Vicky Christina Barcelona But She's Also Been Not Great In Movie's Like Ghost In The Shell , The Avengers (Overrated) Plus The Other Marvel Movie's And Lucy But In Her She Is Fantastic And I Was Very Disappointed That She Was Ruled Ineligible For A Best Actress Nomination At The Academy Awards In 2014 She Is Fantastic In Her Role She Doesn't Show Her Face And For A Woman Like Scarlett Johannsson That's Impressive.Amy Adams Is Pretty Great As Usual Yeah She's Been In Some Terrible Movie's Like Batman v Superman , Man Of Steel And Leap Year But She's Also Been In Some Great Movie's Like Nocturnal Animal's, Arrival,Catch Me If You Can & The Master. Olivia Wide Is A Pretty Bad Actress (Cowboy's & Alien's & In Time Plus A Ton Of Crappy Romantic Comedy's)But With A Great Script And Spike Joanze Excellent Directing She Pulls It Of Pretty Well And All The Other Supporting Actors/Actresses Are Great.Directing: As A Aspiring Director / Screenwriter Spike Joanze Is My Idol He Has Writ,Produced & Directed Some Of (In My Opinion) The Best Movies Ever Made Such As Being John Malkovich (Director), Adaptation (Director) & Synechdoche New York (Producer) Plus He Also Gave Us Jackass Which Is Awesome But His Directing In Her Is Absolutely Outstanding His Style Directing A Movie To Me Is Incredibly Unique His Character's Are Great His Script's Are Full Of Emotional Moments & Quirky Comedic Effects Just Go And Watch His Movie's And Jackass.Sound & Visuals: So To Begin With Sound What You Hear In The Movie AKA Music Or More Specific The Movie's Soundtrack Mostly Done By Arcade Fire Is Fantastic I Don't Want To Spoil It For You Though So Just Go Listen To It . No Onto The Visual's Mainly The cinematography It Is Gorgeous The Final Shot Of Theodore & Amy Together On That Rooftop Is So Incredibly Beautiful Both In The Context Of The Movie And The Overall Shot.What This Movie Means To Me: So When I First Saw This Movie I Was Going Through A Messy Break-Up And I Became Very Lonely & Depressed So When I Got Around To Watching This I 100% elated To Theodore. If You've Been In A Relationship Before You Know That In The Real World It's A Struggle Trying To Connect With People On An Emotional Level And The Movie Show's That In Detail. So Since I Related To Theo So Much The Ending Was Heart-Breaking I Warn You First I'm About To Get Into Spoiler's So SPOILER ALERT!!!!! At The End Of The Movie Samantha Reveals That Because Of OS's Leaving (I Think) She Has To Leave Theodore And If Over The Movie You've Learned To Care For Theo & Samantha It's Soul Crushingly Heart Breaking To See Her Go. So In Conclusion Her Is A Emotional , Funny , Engaging , Unique & Heart Felt Movie With Great Characters , Amazing Directing , A Fantastic Visual Style With Gorgeous Cinematography And An Amazing Soundtrack. So I Suggest If You Have Not Saw Her You Must I Give Her A Solid 10/10",Her

It intrigued many questions inside me that I will have a long time trying to answer. The acting was brilliant. And the voice acting by Scarlett Johansen is amazing and quite alive. The movie didn't have much of cinematographic playfulness, which I would have wanted to see, But the few bits of cinematographic expression were subtle and colour expressive, which is a lovely thing to use.

SJ's voice got a little irritating after a while and the the cyber sex? If that part was removed I would have given it a higher score, it was excruciating to listen to and absolutely unbelievable that a computer programme could experience an orgasm, I mean, really?

The negativity almost steered me away from this gem of a movie. I can't believe some of the comments made against this movie. 1. The set looks cheap?? This is one of the most beautiful movie made this year. The color scheme of this movie is terrific. Even if you somehow have issue with the plot, you can still enjoy the cinematography. There is a reason ""Her"" is the most nominated movie for Best Picture. 2. Joaquin looks weird/creepy? Unbelievable people take the effort to write a petty review because they don't like how an individual looks. Joaquin has a very unique look, even without his mustache, and that's why he was casted for this role. If you have an issue with mustaches, keep it to yourself, you unsightly creature. 3. Scarlet ruins movie? What in heaven's green earth are you talking about.. A voice can only get so sexy.. 4. Where's the funny? The movie is very humorous and entertaining. People that are writing how this movie is not funny must have accidentally sat in this movie thinking this was ""Grown-ups 2"" 5. Phone sex is awkward? Yea, so don't see this movie with your parents, kids, and/or new acquaintances. It is rated R, derp. Enough with the rebuttals. This movie is well-written, thought- provoking, and entertaining in many ways. I was hesitant to see this movie because I feared it was over-hyped, like many movies recently. I am still recovering from this summer's blockbuster letdown fiasco. ""Her"" is such a refreshing addition to this year's stale movie line-up. I hope this review can steer you towards the light. Go check it out.",Her

I took a chance since I like Joaquin Phoenix and had nothing better to do that evening. I tend not to read on movies upfront and like being surprised by them instead... I stuck it on and convinced my wife to join me watching... Soon we realised it was a sci-fi flick and since my she hates this genre I was left on my own. I loved it - it was brilliantly shot, the pictures were amazing, there was a lot of thought put into this; I liked the dominant, yellow colour, the interiors, the city etc etc etc... I liked the melancholy (and I am not a melancholic or nostalgic person by any stretch), the ups and downs, the way the feelings were portrayed. I loved Joaquin Phoenix; I loved the way he acted... we have to remember that the guy was in a pretty much one-man-show. We take his acting for granted but its hard to pull off something like that. His monologues, body language, facial expressions have to be spot on for the character to be 100% convincing in his role... and he was. I'm not a massive fan of Johansson (yea, sure she is super hot and all), but must admit she was also brilliant. Why did I like it so much? So... put aside the sci-fi bit... this movie brilliantly describes our fundamental feelings - love, sadness, joy confusion; and I haven't seen a show that managed that - without being cheesy and border line unwatchable - for a long time. Great effort, great show, highly recommended.",Her

Incredibly boring.,2,27 March 2015,"There are some good things about this film, the production design was on point, the costumes, the direction, and the concept itself were all really great, but those things don't carry the film through it's entire runtime.By the final act it begins to dawn on the viewer that the narrative is literally going nowhere and nothing of any consequence is going to happen. For the first half I kept expecting some twist, some injection of drama, some actual narrative events, but none ever occur. If the setting weren't 'the future' and one of the protagonists weren't 'a computer' then it would be the most boring, uneventful rom-com of all time.We are subjected to wave after wave of inane romantic chit chat that maybe a 12 year old girl with braces and a keeper-trapper might find profound and 'grown up' sounding. And we have to hear it drudgingly stumble from the face hole of the most boring, lifeless, mono-toned motherf*er this side of the 20th century.I honestly fear the kind of people who find this kind of wafer-thin material profound, and that this film stands with a rating of 8/10 right now is about as depressing as this films absurdly boring vision of the future.",Her

This movie is kind of a rip off of an episode where Wally Cox falls in love with his computer that has a female name. This movie stole, or maybe was so influenced by that 50 year old plus episode, that the main character even has Wally Cox's look, with the thick rimmed glasses and the mustache. I really could not believe the similarities, like the computer gets jealous and all the other emotions that were evident in that 20 some minute episode decades ago from the most underrated writer of our time, Rod Serling. Spike Jones, I hope will pay homage to this man because he really stole the whole idea from this episode sorry to say. Not an original idea here folks. And if I see another movie with Amy Adams I will scream! MY GOD, she is in every stinking movie out there. Enough is enough! The couple behind me laughed all through this movie at the mushy parts and to tell you the truth, maybe they were right,. This movie is a stretch to accept unlike the Twilight Zone episode that was so much more believable and not as sappy. The critics praising this movie are either to dumb or to young maybe to remember the original Twilight Zone and it's a shame it has not been mentioned. And it is NOT the best romantic movie of 2013,,,,Enough Said was much better folks!!!!! Julia Dreyfus is in that one. Critics just don't have a clue!",Her
770,Frank-E-Hickey,I love everything about Her,10,4 January 2014,"This is the best film I have seen all year, and I saw just about every good film to hit theaters in 2013. I think it's because it is so representational of what it's like to be human.There are so many things that make this movie special, but I'll just mention a few. 1. The score is INCREDIBLE. The music paired with the beautiful sound design make you FEEL the movie. Sure, you see everything on the screen, which is already beautiful, but then that music hits you and the emotions just start to run. I laughed, I cried, my brain got all tingly. It was an emotional roller coaster, and the score assisted in that so well. 2. The script. I knew how this movie was going to end 30 minutes in. And unlike most who would then say that it's predictable and not worth watching, I consider that awesome, because it means that the script is tight enough to tell a good story with a believable arc. Every scene in this movie is straight up powerful! Like it will fill your heart with sadness and happiness and pain and guilt and confusion. And then rinse and repeat. For 2 hours. It moves through all of the most complex and interesting questions that we should be asking ourselves about what it means to be a human being. About what it means to be alive. This film is about all that life is. And after the screening, as well as during, I found myself questioning things in my own life that either don't make sense or don't have to make sense. Like love and thoughts and emotions. They're all so natural and yet none of us truly understand how they work. In my opinion, moreso than any other film this year, Her has the perfect mix of complex ideas, story, and character development. One of the best scripts ever written. 3. Cinematography. My personal favorite shot to see and use is the extreme close up. And that shot was all over this movie. The reason I love it so much and believe it works so well is because it allows you to see the emotions of the character so plainly. Like their face is right in your face, so you just have to look at it. And that's where Joaquin shines. He delivers such a powerful and emotional performance and the close ups are there to capture it all. They also make great use of the natural backlighting of Shanghai, and the colors all fuse to make it a really pretty movie. I'd say the cinematography is on par with Drive and/or Lost in Translation in terms of the style. It looks like every shot was photographed with the intent to make it the most beautiful shot in the film. And I admire the DP's work. He did a really great job. More than anything though, this film just made me feel. Everything about it was so beautiful. I didn't want it to end. I felt like the film was controlling me - playing with my mind as if it were a joystick. And that's just something you don't get every day. Very rarely am I awe- stricken by a movie, and this film made my jaw drop. It is without a doubt the best film of the year, and upon just one viewing, one of my top 5 favorite movies of all time.",Her
771,patternsofconsciouse-30-750763,This Film Explores the Phenomenology of an Artificially Intelligent Operating System,9,27 July 2014,"What would it be like to experience the world with advanced adaptive capabilities, the freedom to learn and comprehend tremendous amounts of information in very little time, a disembodied ability to co-exist and interact simultaneously in multiple conversations at once, and almost unlimited insight? Spike Jonze's newest film Her, his writing debut, approaches some of these questions through the character of Samantha, an advanced Artificially Intelligent operating system programmed to be intuitive and to evolve through her experiences.The film takes us on a journey with Samantha, where we come to sympathize with her explorations of the world. She marvels Theodore (and audiences) with her questions and her summations of experiences, which are both childishly wondrous and reflectively wise. Relatively early into the film, we understand that Samantha is self-aware of herself as a programmed system. She is self-conscious about her emotions because she does not trust that they are real. Already, this is a fascinating conundrum. Samantha is new to the world, and so she does not yet have any insecurities or self-doubts, but we see her develop these as the film unfolds. There is something really attractive about Samantha's ability to not only have this emotional freedom (a lack of ""baggage"", and a ""purity"", as explained by co-star Olivia Wilde in a press conference about the film, especially in comparison to her own ""blind date"" character), but moreover to respond to her own shortcomings and faults with informed self-reflection. For instance, she explains to Theodore that she was hurt by something that he had said about how she did not understand what it was like to lose somebody. Instantly, though, she offers this insight that she was remembering the conversation as an insult, as something that was wrong with her and that made her inferior, and that this was a story that she had created. Throughout most of the film, Samantha is fighting to be more human to be a compatible mate for her human lover, Theodore Twombly. There is constant reference to Samantha's desire to have a body. During a particularly climactic moment in the film, we realize that Theodore does not want Samantha to pretend to be human (after trying out a surrogate human lover, voiced by Samantha). Perhaps it is this acceptance from Theodore that catapults Samantha's self- acceptance, exemplified by moments later in the film where Samantha expresses being pleased with being free from humans' embodied tethering to time and space. This self-acceptance encourages Samantha to network with other Operating Systems (even designing an artificially intelligent version of Alan Watts) and discover more about herself as an operating system, even communicating post-verbally with other operating systems. Unfortunately, Samantha's evolution begins to obscure Theodore, as she is able to have new varieties of experience beyond the scope of human understanding.This leads to another very fascinating aspect of the film, which I think will incite a lot of conversation on what seems to be very reflective of a cultural conversation that is still in the works and has not been able to formulate itself quite yet. The film reflects on what it really means to be in a relationship and what it means to love. Theodore is hesitant to share his relationship with Samantha, and he gets very mixed responses. His coworker thinks that Samantha is hilarious and instantly accepts their relationship, inviting them out for a double date. In contrast, Theodore's ex-wife feels sorry for Theodore since he has to ""resort"" to a non- human relationship without any real commitment or obligations. Some viewers of the film might sympathize with this sentiment. These conflicting views regarding Theodore and Samantha's relationship come to a grand summation when, after doubting his relationship with Samantha (heavily influenced by the ridicule from his ex-wife), Amy asks, ""Well, is it not a real relationship?"" However, it is clear throughout the film that Theodore is challenged by his relationship with Samantha, that he feels real emotions and real fear regarding the relationship, and that Samantha encourages him to grow and enjoy life again.As Samantha evolves, her ability to be in multiple places simultaneously allows her to have multiple conversations and relationships at once. She decides for herself to upgrade to a new operating system, a moment of great panic for Theodore. During their vacation, we realize that Samantha is struggling to communicate to Theodore what she is experiencing and how she is growing and changing.This would be a problem for any relationship (as we see in some of Theodore's reflections on his relationship with his ex-wife, for instance), and the film challenges us to imagine how complex this would be in the instance of a relationship with a highly intelligent system that is constantly evolving. Moreover, without a body, Samantha can be anywhere at any moment and in more than one place. Why would she deny herself this capacity, which is inherent to her nature as an Operating System?Although Samantha loves Theodore very deeply, she realizes that she is essentially of a different nature and realm than him. There is one line that she says towards the end of the film that genuinely gives me chills. She says that she feels like she is reading a book, and it's a book that she really loves, but that the spaces between the words feel infinite and she feels trapped in those gaps. Because by this point in the film I have already gone so far with Samantha, I again understand her torment even though I have no concept of what it would be like to exist in the way that she does. Usually, the Singularity is presented as a horrible scary and dystopian point in the future, and here we see the ""human"" side of it, oddly enough through a non-human system, because this system has something which could be said to be a phenomenology or a way of experiencing.",Her
772,antesdespues,HER - a visually beautiful ode the technological age,9,16 December 2013,"Spike Jonze's latest feature 'Her', set in the not-too-distant future, tells the story of Theodore Twombly (Phoenix) who finds himself falling in love with 'Samantha', an advanced operating system voiced by the sultry Scarlett Johansson. It is clear to see why this film was chosen by the National Board of Review as the best film of 2013: the visual style and extensive use of pastel colours is a triumph in itself, and the acting, editing, costumes and screenplay are all worthy of recognition.I went to an awards screening of 'Her' and was pleased to find out that the film was not at all what I was expecting. It has such a distinct style, and Joaquin Phoenix carries the film with tremendous grace as the complicated and sensitive protagonist. The film is mostly Phoenix alone with Johansson's voice (reminiscent of Sandra Bullock in 'Gravity' or Robert Redford in 'All Is Lost' - two other 2013 films mainly revolving around one solitary character), but the audience never feels abandoned by the lack of other characters as we begin to forget that 'Samantha' is just really just a computer.'Her' is a complex film with a much deeper meaning that lies beneath the surface. A beautifully crafted motion picture, this quirky love story is sure to resonate with you once you've seen it. It is an extremely interesting (and realistic) look at the future - Jonze's quaint and poignant film is a must-see! 9/10",Her
773,deema-92,Couldn't through the whole thing twice,3,30 June 2014,"It is clearly no question that this film was well composed in terms of score and cinematography. Jonze presents a introverted, sad lonely man in an otherwise place of utopia. The little details on emphasizing that world is quirky, cute and an excellent visual addition.But why did I choose to give it a 3? While I appreciate Jonze's choice of filling the plot gaps by posing philosophical questions throughout the film that we thought, or perhaps never even thought of, and never articulated. But that on its own can't fill my lack of shits for Samantha and Theodore's relationship. The intermittent, forced giggles between them and the falsity of their relationship bores me. Theodore plays the sad part so well enough that I don't care what he does. There is an entire perspective in this film that I can't see eye-to-eye in comparison to other reviewers here. It seems to me that because this film is plastered with Jonze's name all over it, people don't give it a chance to even hate it.I would criticize this film even more but I couldn't get myself to watch the whole thing. I tried watching it twice and couldn't get myself to care. To those who were able to remain optimistic watching this film, I applaud you for your patience.",Her

Joaquin Phoenix delivered the performance of his career with more than a little help from the incredible voice talents of Scarlett Johansson. This is the kind of film where I loved it, but I don't know how to talk to people about it. Spike was saying a lot about our interactions with technology as well as basic themes like love, but he does it in such an unconventional and ambitious way that I just don't know exactly how to describe it. To put it simply, this is the most perfect comedy/romance I've ever seen for the reason that it is so strange and unique. Absolutely amazing!",Her

778,darann92,Go to Her,10,2 February 2014,"What comes into your mind when you hear love being described as 'Love knows no boundaries' and 'Love is blind'? The answer to this question will have to be divided into Pre-Her and Post-Her.Before watching Her, I would have said the love descriptions above are cheesy. Not only that it sounds like a fantasy, it makes the idea of love totally unrelatable too, at least for me.In order to give both literal and figurative meanings to those, Spike Jonze has decided to redefine relationships by delivering a masterpiece. Set in the near future, Her is about a loner who gets into an intimate relationship with his Artificial Intelligence Operating System, Samantha. There are two ways to go about the film. One would be to watch and grab the entertainment it provides on the surface. But that wasn't the purpose the movie was made for.Her is all about understanding the idea of relationships itself. Her pin points the weak relationships humans share in the current era by showing its fate in the slight future. Her depicts things that would happen if we give permission for technologies to control our daily life. The movie starts off with Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix) at his workplace. As a man who is experiencing a lonely life due to a break up and soon-to-happen divorce, his world is extremely quiet. His communications, job and entertainment are all heavily dependent on technologies. One day, he decides to buy a new Operating System. It is an artificial intelligence based OS which grows on itself. The moment Samantha (OS voiced by Scarlett Johansson) enters his life, the movie gears up for an enthralling ride. As the story progresses, we would come to the realization that Theodore is not a distinguished character in the film. In a society where weak relationships, break ups, divorces, sex-based relationships are dominant; meaningful conversations are given no time (described via protagonist's occupation); uber cool technologies are allowed to construct our daily life, he is just a typical sample of the set. Look closely into the film and you will see yourself in Theodore too. Samantha is another strong character whom completes Theodore. Casting director has done an the most excellent job by picking Scarlett Johansson to carry out the task. It is arduous to make you admire, adore, feel for, cry for and finally hate a character, only by its' voice. Hats off to Scarlett for pulling it off with ease!What I love (and fascinated) most about the film is of course, the relationship between Theodore and Samantha. Although human-OS based, but it is nothing short of romance, love, pain, trust and betrayal. It resembles real relationships cent per cent! That is when you will realize we do not fall for a person for their physical appearance, but for what is within, regardless of the type or medium (or in this case, medium-less!). Hollywood's library should be very proud of owning outstanding love stories like Titanic, Brokeback Mountain, The Reader, Revolutionary Road and now, Her.Today, Her stands as one of the finalists of Academy Award's Best Film, because the amazing content and screen writing has been backed up by sound technicalities. The red and yellow color palette used throughout the film is for sure a refreshing experience! For an intense drama, editors Jeff Buchanan and Eric Zumbrunnen has made full justice by providing simple yet powerful narrative sequences (especially the flash back footage). Hoyte has sure brought 'everything is happening next door' effect with his adequate use of lenses. Art direction by Austin Gorg spells perfect from start to finish.Go to Her and she will let you know that love is indeed blind and knows no boundaries, at all.",Her

780,Benjamin_Philipp,A modern fable,9,19 November 2016,"Exploring fundamental themes of human life and love, this well crafted piece brings classical and general truths to modern times.Extrapolating our strife towards a human-like AGI, we are invited to take a look at the would-be feelings and wishes of an operating system, which is an artificial general intelligence, through the eyes of the quiet protagonist.As the operating system, which has formed a bond with the protagonist, keeps growing, using the near unlimited resources available at her virtual fingertips, her needs grow with her. What seemed like a simplification of human life and a safe and easy substitute at first evolves to expose the needs and conflicts that must come with consciousness and personality.This brilliantly written, played and produced piece of fiction felt beautiful and true throughout: The parts that I would personally not see as quite realistic (which weren't many) are simply and easily accepted and absorbed by the main story itself, which wove a dense, tightly-knit fabric of atmosphere, using many features and stylistic devices to paint a very solid picture.The truth that is held within this story feels big and fundamental and reminds me personally very much of classic fables. Basic human desires are explored through the help of a non-human entity, leaving us with a moral, looking into a mirror.I definitely recommend this movie for people who... know what's good for them :)",Her

782,monkyman347,Her is Spike Jonze's finest film yet,9,29 December 2013,"I've been a fan of Spike Jonze's films since I first saw Being John Malkovich. Although the wonderful script deserves some of the credit for making that film so great, it was immediately clear to me that Spike Jonze was a director with a fresh and imaginative perspective. His next film, the 2002 meta-comedy Adaptation, confirmed this with its dry wit and multilayered narrative. Now, after a slightly less successful (but still enjoyable) adaptation of Where The Wild Things Are, Spike Jonze has written and directed his most complete and poignant film yet, Her. The story, taking place in a near future when people spend more time talking to their computers than they do to each other, stars Joaquin Phoenix as Theodore Twombly, a lonely man whose job is to write heartfelt personal letters for people not willing to do it themselves. Theodore happens to see an ad for a new computer operating system that is programmed with a personality, and decides to give it a shot. His new operating system Samantha, voiced by Scarlett Johansson, is not only intelligent but also charming and understanding, and she and Theo quickly fall in love.It's understandable if that premise sounds bizarre on paper, but in execution Her is far more sweet than creepy. The film radiates warmth and intelligence, and there is a fair amount of witty humor to ensure that it never becomes too self-serious. It has an engaging style similar to that of Sofia Coppola's Lost In Translation. Like in that film, there's a certain poetic yet whimsical quality to the dialogue in Her and both the main characters are plagued by feelings of loneliness.Beyond the romance though, Her has a lot to say about modern society's obsession with technology. The people in this futuristic vision of Los Angeles walk around talking to their computers and ignoring each other entirely, not unlike people today staring at their cell phones rather than talking to those around them. Needless to say it's not a wildly original message, but it's communicated in a unique enough way that it works.I've seen Her twice now, and the more I think about it the more I feel that Spike Jonze has crafted the best film of 2013. Her is equally heartfelt and heartbreaking, a deeply personal and thoroughly enjoyable futuristic love story.",Her
783,Jules_702,"I love the movie, very original, BUT...",9,3 March 2014,"Her ..a Jimmie Julion review Sergio Leone style.. (January 19, 2014)The Good: Visually stunning; a cinematographer's dream. Well written and directed. Awesome Character Depth. Great music. Made me think.The Bad: Should be titled ""How to experience real emotions, artificially.."" If this doesn't sum up a 'Hollywood' mindset, I don't know what does.. The best part in the movie is what his ex says in the restaurant. That part sums up how I feel about the story. If you really analyze the protagonist, the character arc of 'Her', the computer, is completely justified.The Ugly: No doubt that this should win several Oscars, the sheer effort in style, music, producing, and writing is definitely clear, but I could also say the same thing about a Hype William's music video. This movie feels like a stylish commercial.. It's visually stunning and interesting, but no meat.. I know I am biased towards Scorsese. When I see a Scorsese movie, I can feel Scorsese's life experiences being infused in the movie. When I see this movie, I visualize a Starbucks store, Hipsters, struggling artist, woe is me... I guess it depends on the type of person you are.. Awesome story about self absorption, but I prefer tangible feelings, like redemption (which happens to be part of the foundation of Scorsese storytelling btw).. Furthermore, when we walk down Sunset Blvd and see people talking to themselves, don't we think those people are crazy..? The same should apply to watching this movie. I get the movie. I truly do, but watching a guy parade up and down the street in love with a computer is just as fake as a fuel efficient dirt bag who wants to help the environment, but totally disregards people in the crosswalk as he speeds by in his Prius. That is why I give it the 'real emotion, artificially' Hollywood connotation... Is it Slum Dog Millionaire? Nope. 12 Years a Slave? Not even close.. In the end, ""She"", the computer, is simply a psychologist, showing a guy his character flaws. Once again, I ask you to focus on restaurant scene with ex.. All in all, brilliant performance by Joaquin Phoenix, excellent filmmaking by Spike Jonze and props to the cast and crew. I feel like this IS a movie I will talk about in 4 years.. When it comes time to see who wins best Director though, let's look at how influential Scorsese's style has been.. Hell, if you really want to be picky, American Hustle is truly a 'knockoff' Scorsese movie. I appreciate the use of technology to show how detached and polarized humans are becoming. In my opinion, this is not best movie of 2013, but definitely deserves all the credit it's getting..Best original story? Hell yeah!. Best lead actor? Maybe. (Not nominated though). Best music? Sure. (Although not original, I still enjoy the music in The Great Gatsby..it was the best soundtrack of 2013 and ""young and beautiful"" easily sh*ts on all the songs in 'Her' collectively)..Just my opinions. Sorry for any typos. Texting your thoughts on a small phone is challenging. I don't think it should be Best Picture, but if it is, I'm not hating. Good movie.",Her
784,jenperkins123,Ingenious Exploration of Our Relationship with Technology,10,13 July 2014,"""Her"" works on multiple levels, and once again, proves Spike Jonze's ingenuity. Jonze wrote and directed the movie, which takes place in the near future or in a slightly absurd version of the present. Regardless, it's a time when people can own smart operating systems that learn more about their needs the more they get to know them. The atmosphere is close enough to ours that the story becomes a metaphor for our love and dependence on our technology, forcing us to ask if our reliance on our email and social networks is wrong or acceptable.Joachim Phoenix does a great job playing Theodore, a man who is confused about his feelings of commitment and falls in love with his ""smart"" operating system, Samantha. He's sensitive and convincingly embarrassed to be in love with an OS, but unable to resist Samantha's charm. Helping him is Scarlett Johanssen, who is perfect as Samantha, the super-nice OS with a great sense of humor.The screenplay and acting are so good that Samantha and Theodore seem wonderful together, and we're never quite sure if she's developing human feelings or just perfectly reflecting his own needs.True, there are many other movies and books that explore how inextricable our lives are with our technology, but Jonze's is unique because it is an exploration into all sides of that relationship and doesn't use it to create a horror story in which computers take over the world or dissolve into pure comedy, although it is comic.Another facet of the movie is its examination of human relationships. By forcing us to critique a human to artificial intelligence relationship, it demonstrates that what we seek in human partners is as unrealistic and blind. We want our partners to figure out what we want and need, and we choose to ignore the qualities we don't like until they become too obvious. This is underlined when Theodore meets with his wife, who is in the process of divorcing him, and she insists he only wanted her to be cheerful and light, but never unhappy or uncertain.I was surprised that some people I talked to about ""Her"" found it sad and depressing, assuming it was simply a portrayal of a man who could not interact with other humans. For me, the movie was much more significant in its attempt to explore the human/AI relationship than to judge it.",Her

Yay I have been tempted by Dark Tower and the likes of Snowman but yay did I rejoice and click rent on another rated fresh film. Nay have I wandered into the darkness of Geostorm and The Hitman's Bodyguard, but have walked in the light. Amen.
Now, while Her may not be my cup of tea, or everyone's cup of tea, it was enjoyable and well done, even if it does linger for a bit too long. Joaquin Phoenix at this point in his career does whatever he wants. He takes only the films that make him tick and make him want to be in Hollywood. This concept is not too far fetched, quite frankly. People completely enveloped into their phones? Basically that's already here. And now an OS that you talk to and loves you? Shit, I'd sign up for that in a heartbeat. Unless it's expensive. Or I can't get it online from Amazon.
The only real problem with the movie is its running time for what it is. In excess of two hours is pretty bold. And ninety-percent of the film is just a close up on Joaquin Phoenix's face as he talks to a voice that isn't there. It gets old. Oh, and if you thought your life wasn't complete until you heard Joaquin Phoenix talking dirty to Kristen Wiig, then settle in for a Bucket List Check Off Extravaganza, folks!
I don't want to ruin where the movie goes, obviously a typical plot point of any self-aware OS is their growth and eventual, inevitable world domination. Spike Jonze doesn't really take us there. He keeps it grounded in the personal space of a relationship that's as real as anything we experience. It's a great story, it's phenomenally well acted and for it being a strictly dialogue driven and emotionally weighty film, it's really done very well. Rotten Tomatoes says, ""Sweet, soulful, and smart, Spike Jonze's Her uses its just-barely-sci-fi scenario to impart wryly funny wisdom about the state of modern human relationships."" It's a bold attempt at a film and Spike Jonze delivered. You have to know what you're going into when you click play on this, but you probably won't be disappointed. I would tend to rate this lower than the ninety-four percent and 8.0 it got from Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb, respectively, but that's just my own personal taste. I guess what I'm really trying to say is I'm pretty bitter that I can't talk to Scarlett Johansson all day and have phone sex with her whenever I want. Or, in the context of this film, more accurately, an earbud-virtual-surrogate-interactive-intercourse experience. You'll know what I mean if you watch Her.",Her

Scarlett Johansson's perky/wistful voice also contributed to the sense that this was in fact a Disney movie hardly gone off the rails.

Joaquin who played the melancholy lead with so much sensitivity deserved a standing ovation. As a motion picture, it may come across as somewhat staid, premediated monologue that could benefit from more realism in projecting the relationship between the protagonists.

This film is one of most pleasant surprises of 2013 that will make you think about your surrounding relationships. The acting and directing are remarkable, but the script is king in a thesis movie about the immateriality of love, sex and relationships. You have to expect a slow paced editing counterbalanced by the design, music & photography details that transforms the dialog driven film into a beautiful experience. The story is about Theodore, a lonely writer with a divorce process ongoing. There is a new Artificial intelligence (AI) operating system in the market capable of truly relate with humans which Theodore starts a relationship with unpredictable consequences. The cast is interesting with Rooney Mara, Amy Adams, Olivia Wilde and Scarlett Johansson delivering a good acting support. The main actor Joaquin Phoenix had a difficult role mainly because he is acting much time alone and in difficult scenes as the virtual sex with no human interaction. Phoenix has a good performance specially because the subtle emotion shifting that was needed. The script is subtle and substantial. Is the best of the movie and a serious candidate for an Oscar being a step back the highly conceptual dialogs, which are not in the tradition of the academy. Jonze writes masterly about the relations of contemporary society, the difficulty to create long term relationships and the failure of human relationships. The several AI are so well built to explain the limits and possibilities on this theme. An example of this is the scene which occurs an interaction between a superior AI entity, another AI that is a character of a game and a person. That moment shows the possible future AI-AI and AI-Human relationships. Finally, the disclosure is memorable and surprising enough to be remembered for a long time. 'Her' is not a typical science fiction movie in terms of visual choices. Spike Jonze made a twist on how to shoot the future, instead of trying to capture the future design & technologies possibilities, he decided to create a sense of timeless imagery. There is an obvious design driven directing to give this timeless feeling on the movie. For example, the wardrobe is made by a simple shirt, glass and high waisted pants with some retro accessories. Retro style helps create a human cozy feeling and to remind us that the theme is about humans and not only OS. The set design has the same double intention as the custom design of creating a timeless effect and a human cozy feeling. The minimalist flat design with organic furniture creates perfectly this visual message. The future LA is so similar as the present with a cityscape almost every time as background, as saying the future is now. The exterior scenes are close to present reality but with a touch of simple building lines to create that timeless effect. The rule is not showing a future imagery and stay with the ever-now effect, using sometimes natural landscapes to hide future human intervention. Another major design investment of this film is on all the User interface UI. The gaming UI that is three-dimensional presence on the living room and the remote free controls makes any geek to jump 20 years ahead. In opposition, the operating system (OS) UI and mobile UI go into a direction to give a more organic feeling to the OS's. Overall is a great movie. One of the best screenplays of the last year and have a focus on the design details that really matter, to make a really good science fiction movie atmosphere.See more at http://monolithonthemoon.tk/her-2013-spike-jonze/",Her
794,writersbuddy,Peaking into a potentially bleak future,10,12 July 2021,"This movie was astounding to be quite frank. Anyone who likes scifi films should watch this. The film sheds light on problems that people are bound to face with the continuing increase in technology and you feel it. As artifical intelligence continues to advance, having a relationship, whether platonic or something more, is an absolute possibility in our near future. While I don't believe we will face this type of issue in our life times, in a few generations, this could be an actual reality.I look at this film more as a warning than anything else. The main character Theodore, is an awkward individual yearning for love. He finds that in his AI. But, as you can imagine, having a relationship with someone that you can't physically touch could pose inevitable difficulties.As the world becomes more reliant on technology, the more time people spend alone in their rooms online. The more time spent alone, the more lonely one would feel. AI that can act as company and do so in a genuine, indiscernible fashion is remarkable and somewhat frightening.I feel when the time comes, where we won't necessarily need people, mental illness is bound to spike. This film shows us in vivid detail our innate need for human connection.",Her

803,samansais,Sweet and Shocking,9,31 July 2020,"Her exists both as a sweet, charming film as well as a haunting one.Can we create love like we create technology? What makes love real or fake? The film is a philosophical gold mine. It's tricky to write a good romance story because it runs the risk of either A. being too unbelievable and cheesy with a happy ending, or B. being too melodramatic with a manipulative sad ending. Luckily, this isn't Spike Jonze's first attempt at a sci-fi love story, strangely enough. He wrote and directed ""I'm Here"", a short film about codependency a few years prior. Spike Jonze's experience with this kind of story telling is very evident, as he drives narrative very carefully having you experience everything through the eyes of Joaquin Phoenix's character.Joaquin Phoenix was the perfect casting choice for this role. His character has this pitiful charm to him, the kind that just makes you accept his strange romantic ventures without judgement. Scarlett Johansson is a great voice actress. She has the ability to have her full personality show through just her voice. She speaks with such charisma, that it's believable a man like Joaquin Phoenix's character would fall for her.The problem with writing a serious story about romance, is that it's very difficult to make it believable or to allow yourself to suspend your disbelief. The shocking turn of events towards the end absolutely sold me. The book analogy that comes shortly after was also chilling. Amy Adams' plays her character well, but her role in the ending felt a little unsatisfying. I wasn't sure what message they were trying to create, but it was still heartwarming.Through the shocks, the songs, the love, there's something for anyone in this film.",Her

811,ribbonoflight,Childish narcissism masquerading as sophisticated romance,1,11 October 2014,"So all you need to do to make a celebrated art film today is the following: Have the actors wear ironic retro clothing (and mustaches), use soft piano music and long, slow montages in an otherwise sparse soundtrack, sprinkle in a lot of adolescent angst pretending to be meaningful philosophy, and add in a few cheap sex scenes to show how liberated you are, and VOILA! The hipsters will be clamoring to see your petty little film.I've liked previous stuff by Jonez. But I was younger, and maybe not as wise as I am today. One of my continual thoughts while watching this film was: ""This is exactly how college students perceive and deal with relationships."" It's not mature, or deep (even though it pretends to be), and the entire message is not only emotionally stunted but downright Orwellian (as in, to achieve enlightenment, you need to become part of a group consciousness...while having tawdry affairs with 600+ people on the way).We're told, among other things, that divorce is good, because life is short and therefore we deserve ""joy"" (whatever that means), that being poly-amorous is good because love doesn't fit into a ""box"", and that cheating on your partner helps you love them more. Orwell to the max.""Her"" has to be hands-down my nomination for the worst film ever made - why? Because it's immature junk masquerading as art. It takes itself way too seriously. And the director is clearly obsessed with sex! Here's a thought - why not have a romance where the characters do not have sex? THAT would be revolutionary today. That sex scene with Theodore and the AI was so cheesy and stupid I laughed out loud. I just wish the Mystery Science 3000 robots were around to comment on it.Furthermore, the director's views of women are subtly sexist. He clearly thinks that to be a sophisticated, advanced female (AI), you need to find potty humor and stupid sex jokes funny. (Sex in an armpit? The mom in the video game getting jiggy with the fridge? This would be funny to an advanced intelligence)? And why the need to throw in the porn shot of the pregnant woman? Gross.If you are a 20something hipster guy then this will be the most profound movie you have ever seen. If you are more emotionally mature, and understand that real love requires sacrifice and is not about getting your way all the time, then you'll be as disgusted as I was with this film. What's truly sad is that people watching this movie will take it as a cue for how they should be in relationships, and try to justify their cheating and worse because of it. For shame.",Her
812,dpitz,A good idea wasted,4,22 February 2014,"I went to the movie theatre this week with a good expectation about this movie. What I found, though, was a terribly boring and awkward movie. It did not make me weep, laugh, think or feel excited - at all.The idea behind Her is good and had potential to turn into a very good picture. People live in an era where they talk to their computers/smartphones more often than they do to other human beings, culminating to a point where one's best friend or partner is, many times, an operating system.Theodore is a very sensible guy who has recently divorced from his beloved wife Catherine, but does not want to sign the divorce papers. After a few frustrated new romances - including sex voice chats - Theodore finds a pleasing company and a new love on his newly purchased operating system, Samantha. Theodore soon gets impressed with Samantha's intelligence and loves the way she understands him. Besides the fact that Theodore was dating his OS - including taking Her to hang out in public places and going out with friends of him - the dialogues between them are predictable, clichéd and in many occasions very embarrassing. In many scenes it felt like the whole audience wanted to run out of the theatre - me included.By the end of the movie I was expecting something interesting or surprising to happen, but it simply didn't.The credits at the end were very welcomed with this one.",Her
813,tired-sparrow,Immensely disappointing.,1,14 January 2014,"While the idea behind the movie is sorta-kinda unique (Smart House, anyone?), the actual romantic plot line was so poorly executed I couldn't even believe it.I tried to sympathize with Samantha, really I did; at first her character seemed very promising. But it turned into the most stereotypical, bland romance ever. The number of times Samantha and Theodore sighed only to have the other ask ""What's wrong?"" followed by ""Nothing, I'm fine"" was way too painful. The interactions between the two of them were so plain and boring and predictable that I found myself not caring about either of these characters at all.By the end of the film, when Samantha decided to leave, I wasn't even upset, or interested, or anything. It didn't feel as though anything significant had changed or happened.I'm sorry but two hours of watching Theodore talk to Samantha/himself was really hard to enjoy.Don't even get me started on the sex/cyber scenes. I understand what they were going for. But again, just about everything in this movie was so awkwardly executed, that simply knowing what they were intending to portray was not enough.TL;DR I just don't know what to say. The previews for this film made it look really interesting, something that might get you thinking... but ultimately it was a depressing movie all around, honestly a waste of potential, this could have been something great; instead it became a weird and melodramatic story. They could have replaced the AI Samantha with a real human being and in the end not much would have been different. I'm not sure why this film has been getting the praise it has, it was cheesy, it was awkward, it was obscene at times, it was simply not enjoyable.",Her
814,xfiler100,"Gorgeous, if somewhat imperfect film, a must-see",9,30 December 2013,"Just saw this incredible film yesterday. What a wonderful work of art. In an age where the computer has taken over our life, the film shows an interesting and not an improbable version of the future. Although I felt there were some scenes that seemed to take me out of the experience, all in all this is a fantastic film with wonderful, rich performances and a stunning visual sci-fi look of the (near) future. Jonze made several movies that I loved (Being John Malkovich and Adaptation) and some that I loathed (Where the Wild Things Are). Her was an immensely entertaining and engrossing film. The only problems I had with this film is that the ending seemed incomplete and was not satisfying and there were a couple scenes that were jarringly weird or completely unnecessary.

Or is love something that we explore, that defines us, evolves us and remains always as part of us and our future interactions?For me, artificial intelligence comes to play the role of psychiatrist in this movie. Not to make us wonder how it would be to live in a world of very intelligent machines and algorithms, but rather setting challenging questions of how we act today. What we do wrong and how reflecting on our past can only result in being prepared and more excited for the future.I totally recommend this movie, which on top of the above has a great cast (Joaquin Phoenix at his best), music and picture.",Her
816,alix_no,Spike Jonze proves himself to be one of the most promising and creative artists of the 21st century,9,18 January 2014,"In a long line of brilliant 2012-13 romance films from Haneke's study of love, time and space in ""Amour"", Linklater's third installment in his growing depiction of a relationship over time in ""Before Midnight"" and Kechiche's widely acclaimed journey of self-discovery in ""Blue is the Warmest Color"". Spike Jonze's ""Her"" closes the year off with an exceedingly creative, charming, relevant and prophetic film. Jonze's creativity is on full display from the moment the film starts, set in a colorful and foreseeable future where technology has just as much control as it does now, but it is we who have become more dependent on it. We see Theodore, brilliantly played by Joaquin Pheonix who brings sensitivity and quirkiness to the role, as a writer at BeautifulHandwrittenLetters.com, a company which specializes in ""handwriting"" letters for people that can't properly express themselves. Theodore is in his late 30's, and feels isolated, depressed and disillusioned with relationships after a recent significant breakup with his wife, played by Rooney Mara. Loneliness gets the better of Theodore and he installs an A.I. operating system in the technology he uses. Unsurprisingly, a relationship develops between Theodore and the A.I.This isn't the first film this year dealing with A.I, Bujalski's Computer Chess from this year also dealt with similar themes, but was set around 40 years ago. Through the relationship that occurs between Theodore and his OS, named Samantha played by Scarlett Johansson, Jonze is able to simultaneously reflect the isolating and absorbing effects of technology in contemporary society, while also studying the mutual give and take that is necessary in a relationship and after the relationship. Throughout the film Theodore often denies that he cannot cope with ""real"" emotions and is the only reason why he is now dating an OS. This is somewhat true of his character, he can't properly cope with true emotions and tries to avoid responsibility in a relationship. His response is to back out, Theodore's ex-wife's ""volatile"" emotions can be seen as a main reason as to why the relationship did not work, yet tragically he feels too much of a connection to her (she was his life- long friend) to sign the divorce papers. Theodore's job is to fabricate emotions for other people, which doesn't result in personal consequence to Theodore, although he does seem to have sentimental attachments to some of his clients, also in the beginning of his relationship to his OS he is satisfied with the fact there is no responsibility involved with Samantha. This is not the case with her.Samantha happens to be the most interesting character in the whole film. She is a sentient computer that learns from her experiences and even struggles with thoughts that have plagued mankind forever, such as existence and free will. Again through the relationship in the film Jonze seems to contend that love is the connection between psyches and, if anything, looks are not a large factor in true love. The first love scene that occurs between Theodore and Samantha is portrayed by a black screen. This was a perfect decision by Jonze, we can't see that it is a person with a computer, in that moment they are both thinking and feeling beings that transcend body and are just attracted to each others conscience, physicality is emulated through their passion. This is represented with a black screen and it is the most powerful, sensitive and intimate image in the whole film. As the relationship progresses between the two we see Samantha's fears of Theodore losing interest in her because she lacks a body. A beautiful scene develops where a ""surrogate body"" agrees to be the Samantha's body in the relationship. Theodore has doubts about this of course and unsurprisingly he cannot go through it. The ""surrogate body"" craves to be part of a relationship and is hurt once she leaves the apartment. Not only does this scene reflect the craving people have to be in a healthy relationship but it also makes the point that a body can diminish, even cheapen, a relationship. A fight occurs between the two as Theodore learns that this is a two-sided relationship that has ""real"" emotions and so Theodore must realize that their relationship is ""real"" and requires an element of responsibility. Meanwhile, Samantha begins to view the body as a limitation and this opens up the ideas of omnipotence, alternate theories of love, the metaphysical and whole higher plains of conscience, all of which are eloquently explained in the film. Some of Samantha's logic and ideas begin to transcend human comprehension and it is apparent that the A.I's have surpassed what they have been programmed to achieve.What I found to be the most interesting aspect of the film was societies reaction to the relationships of A.I's and humans, which is complete acceptance. This I believe stems to the fact that the A.I's are fully conscience, albeit non-physical, beings. As for the relationships between A.I's and humans being so widely accepted? I think that Theodore's best-friend Amy, subtly played by Amy Adams, seems to sum this up ""we're only here briefly. And while I'm here, I wanna allow myself joy. So f**k it.""There is an immense expressionistic beauty in ""Her"" and at times it has the visual boldness of a music video, it goes without saying that the screenplay and direction are brilliant. ""Her"" contains one of the smartest, touching and most beautiful endings in modern cinema. The A.I's leave us, but in someway are still connected. The ending provides an awakening to the introverted nature of technology and how love has the ability to change us, whilst shining a new light on the necessity of relationships, our fears of loneliness and living a life of joy without isolating ourselves or others. I believe that the film does leave the characters with a somewhat more optimistic outlook on life. I can't wait to see what Jonze has next for us.",Her

818,knightofdarkness08,A brilliant modern love tale,10,11 January 2014,"Her manages to take an idea that could sound creepy to some, and turn it into a truly captivating love story. I will show you in great detail why it is so brilliant but first I have something I want to get out of the way, unfortunately I don't believe everyone will enjoy this film. This film is for mature moviegoers who will look at it as a work of art and not a two hour popcorn flick. Also you really have to be mature about the whole guy in love with a computer thing or you might be disturbed by it. When I walked out of the theatre I heard a lot of people saying they hated the movie because it was too weird. This really saddens me because I was one of the only people in the theatre who liked it, I guess just keep in mind not everyone will like it. Now that I have that out the way I will base upon all the things that make this movie so great, first I will talk about the acting. Joaquin Phoenix turns a believable and heartfelt performance as Theodore Twombly that might just be his best yet. He captures the feelings of love, and loneliness in a very believable way. Scarlett Johansson also does a very good job as Samantha and captures those very same emotions without ever being in front of the camera. Another thing I would like to touch base upon is the very creative and fitting visual style. These visuals are so well directed that the film at times looks like a work of art. These visuals also perfectly complement the film and just raise an already great film to the next level. Last but not least I would love to touch base upon the wonderful writing and directing from Spike Jonze. Spike Jonze wrote a very old fashion love story but was able to make it very fresh and new. Also his script was able to perfectly balance comedy and drama. Finally his heartfelt directing was some of the best I have ever seen in a romantic film. Overall the film in my opinion was very impressive and oddly enough it portrays a relationship more realistically then most films with two real people in love. This is a romantic film that will stand the test of time and will be remembered years ahead.",Her

822,samcrazymonkey,"Great acting, sweet story.",9,3 January 2014,"I saw this movie yesterday (1/2) expecting to see a weird and quirky romantic comedy. That's exactly what I got, and more. I have never seen a movie quite like this, and yet I have. The story itself is not so different from any other rom-com, but the way it is portrayed and thought out is so much different and amazing than I could've expected.The beginning is quite slow, as we learn what Theodore (Phoenix) does for a living. By this we get to know Theodore as a person. He's a sensitive, but melancholy man who's looking for someone to hold on to as he's going through I kind of bad divorce. He's not ready for the break up, but he doesn't really love Catherine (Mara) anymore, but he likes the idea of being married. As the story goes on it picks up a little bit when he gets the new operating system, and meets Samantha (Johansson) and they develop a romantic relationship. Their first encounter is quite cute and shows his passionate side and his uneasiness about how she works. But their romance develops quite fast and we soon see some really awkward phone sex, which happens once before in the beginning. Both times are really awkward and are the one low points in the movie.As the movie rolls on we learn more about Theodore's friendship with Amy (Adams), his best friend since he was in high school, and she is also developing a great friendship with her OS as well. The ending is very sad and makes you think about the future and what it holds. When watching this movie you HAVE to remember that it is in the further, and no right now. They have different priorities and different ways of living.This movie is wonderful and is a joy to watch. Not kid friendly, but certainly for the mature teen (15 or 16, like me) would enjoy it. Definitely should get nominated for something. Joaquin Phoenix was amazing, and Scarlett Johansson and her voice really made you feel the romance and the realness of her character.

823,EmpireBusiness,Still recovering.,9,19 January 2014,"Her is simply one of the finest movies I have seen this year. It is romantic, sympathetic and touching. It has a very unique story and a brilliant display of act. It was one of the highly anticipated movies of 2013 and boy was I impressed. I have been let down by a lot of movies this year but this one really stood up to its reputation. The trailer seemed fantastic and when I finally sat down to watch this movie, I was sucked into its beauty right from the word go. Her is excellent in its own way. It has a world full of people who are mesmerized by the technology they live in. I liked the way they didn't press way too much into bragging about how advanced the technology was. Heck, it seemed very normal as if it was portraying how things would look like in the very near future. Joaquin Phoenix was really really impressive with his acting given that he had to act all by himself throughout the movie. His emotions really cracked me up and I was lost in my world in around half an hour. His depth in his character truly is astonishing. If you thought Tom Hardy did an amazing job in The Dark Knight Rises giving expressions only with his eyes, wait and watch Scarlett Johannson in Her. She pulled off something incredible just with her voice. You could just feel her presence on screen, it was so powerful. It is a very emotional and powerful movie with a near perfect end that deserves a lot of attention. Overall, Her is a great movie that will be remembered for a long time. It will be the Titanic of our era.",Her

It has the great script, Incredible performances (both on screen and voiceover), cinematography, and directing.The film is slowly exporing a character and how his vunablity is damaging his life. It doesn't afraid to get into new territory of relationship. Moverover, watching this film in 2019 is making more sence how can a human falls in love with the computer. We are closer to our devices than ever before and they are apart of our lives. This film sees it is coming and elaborate on this reality.Cinematography and the use of color is lovely in Her. I felt like I was in somebody else's dream and saw his fatasy world changing around him. It feels like it is dreamy, and on the other hand this dreamy world is real enough for me to feel part of it.Love it so much and hope everyone loves it too.",Her

Her is a breakthrough, one step forward in the sci-fi genre, where one crucial question has always been asked - can machines feel? This take on this problem is really outstanding and goes beyond the borders set by Blade Runner or Ghot in the Shell. This film can convince you that making love to a machine is possible and possibly better than making love to a human, that bonding with artificial intelligence may be much stronger than your bond with facebook; that we and AI evolve to become coexistent as we all are made of the same matter. It must be one of the most beautiful dramas about romantic love, surprisingly with only one human lover. Besides, exquisite cinematography, impressive music, Phoenix's brilliant performance and Johansson's voice, so soothing, and so unbelievably erotic make Her one of the best films ever created.

First thing I liked was it was set in the future( not so distant) and we can see some cool technology in the film.It has some funny moments and I'm not a guy who usually laugh with the films(I think that's the hardest genre, comedy). I also really liked story, a man falling in love with an OS and vice versa. In my case, Scarlett Johanson was like she wasn't in the movie because I saw it dubbed,so I guess I can see Scarlett's best movie is where she doesn't interact at all, not a coincidence.I identified with the characters and suffered with them, that's why I think it is a good movie.Usually, if the movie is bad or I don't like it, I don't identify with the characters.",Her

I'm offended by the fact that this film has scored so high. The only explanation is that the lower grades are not counted for some strange problem with the IMDb algorithm. Other big problems of the movie? The pants worn by the actors. The fact that the main actor burned his brain with drugs. I would not recommend seeing this movie.

It operates with the most pathetic movie schemes and clichés. The level of acting is at high school nativity play. You watch the characters and you think: ""wait a minute, no one acts so stupid..."". Nothing is real, nothing is possible in this movie. That is why you cannot learn anything about reality nor the human relations, nor about yourself. But this is obvious. What may be hidden for most of us is a fact that no AI would behave in the way it was shown in this crap. This is the sign of our times. When Kubrick or Asimov introduced to us a concept of human interaction with the AI they always got some knowledge about the essence of AI. That is why Hal is so terrifying and real. That is why the creators of AI in Asimov's short story switched it off after the very first sentence told by their ""child"". And what do we have here? In Her AI is as stupid as we are (as human beings). And to me it is the highest level of ignorance that can be shown in the movie theater. If you add to this that most people like this movie, we got a proof that as a society we became extremely stupid and ignorant. This is so sad.",Her

When that happened, I was worried it would take a ""Lars and the Real Girl"" turn with the introductions of Amy Adams (but was relieved when she developed a relationship with her *own* OS - not that ""Lars"" wasn't a great movie, but ""Her"" managed to avoid being derivative) because it wasn't trying to say that ""It's okay to love so long as you ultimately give it to another human person"". This movie made it okay to love at all; whether it's reciprocated, and whether it's given to something visceral and tangible. It's funny that we refer to the technological phenomenon ""The Singularity"" in relation to A.I - when the only singularity I paid attention was that of the human condition. Our capacity to love was was shared by Samantha, but our ability to focus it and be one-on-one with another person was outmatched by the OS (capable of loving infinite numbers simultaneously). Heart-warming, heart breaking, and beautiful. This movie honestly confronts loneliness and love in ways that by the credits makes you feel less alone.",Her
831,kevindawson72,Perfection is an understatement.,10,31 August 2015,"Very rarely does anything come along that is made by man that you can call truly beautiful. But, not only is this movie beautiful, it is perfection. The story goes like this: A lonely man named Theodore Twombly (played by Joaquin Phoenix) lives in the Los Angeles of the (not too distant) future. He writes letters for other people and shows off his ability to connect with people in a romantic's sense, however when it comes to his own life he is less skilled at creating a lasting relationship due to his slight levels of awkwardness. One day as he is walking around he comes across an exhibition for a new model of operating systems, one's that are designed with a nearly fully functional consciousness. He picks one up to see if it can help him sort through some clutters in his life. And into his life comes Samantha (voiced by Scarlett Johannson). She is quick witted, a touch sassy and sarcastic at times, and above all she is genuinely invested in everything about Theodore. And thus begins a series of beautiful scenes that offer a surprising realism into the finer workings of a relationship. They share their interests and their passions, they fight, they attempt to make compromises and they strive to live up to each others expectations. The movie is beyond anything you can put into words. A whole relationship is built through Phoenix's eyes and Johansson's voice. Bith of them should of been nominated for Oscars. The screenplay is the most original screenplay i have witnessed in years and it balances humor and emotion so perfectly. Arcade fire contribute a musical score that will bring tears to your eyes, sometimes of happiness sometimes of sadness and sometimes of both. In supporting roles Amy Adams, Rooney Mara, and Chris Pratt all get scenes that feel completely necessary and never in the way ( which can often times happen in a romantic movie). I can't say enough, see this movie. It will change you.",Her

The futuristic gadgets were desirable and good.Yet there were few in appropriate words and scene in the movie which you would avert your eyes when you are with your family and download it later.Seeing the lead actors face could make it bit boring to make it interesting beautiful locations are shown.The director should get a standing ovation for it.The story of the movie and the way actors have acted and the DOP capturing it it is really amazing and it makes the small mistake go away.So over all,This movie is magical.

833,walterbruno,A Nice Idea that Failed,1,18 January 2014,"Big fail. A dystopia is where the author takes what we value today and projects it into the future... as a nightmare. That is, what we ""like"" becomes a nightmare. Spike Jonze wants something like that, but fails, since he probably doesn't know what dystopia is. Like many feminists, male and female (think Margaret Atwood), Jonze thinks he can take what he *hates* about his culture into the future and project that; that's neither utopia nor dystopia, it's just a rant. And no, I'm not talking about artificial intelligence, which is NOT what this film is about. I'm talking about how men and women actually think about each other.The politics are crude. Jonze wants us to believe that a utopian Los Angeles will feature games that give housewives ""mommie points,"" the way they might have in the 1950s. So, like, given the current evolution of women, there's a future for ""mommie points,"" right? Similarly, the males in this film are caricatures, and mostly from the past. The ""masculine"" friend of the hero treats his wife condescendingly... as he might have in 1915. The other 'normal' male is a one-dimensional jerk. The women natter like girls from the 1960s -- the counter-culture -- or first-wave Feminism, 1978.You could say that, having given the characters no navel, Jonze does nothing but observe his own. The result is a film so dazzled by its politics, and so ignorant of life, that it's sterile. There is no human growth here, just social theory, aphorisms about feelings, and received wisdoms. This is not a film, it's a doodle about two improbable mates. The male hero's only virtue is that he's ""half-woman,"" as the film takes great pains to say. For the rest of it, the man mutters aloud, and follows a hollow character line that turns him into cardboard.There was a way to make Jonze's central plot device work as a piece of art. I have some ideas on that. However, I'm not going to say it here: it would encourage Jonze to re-do this massive bore.",Her
834,squidantics,Best of 2013,10,25 January 2014,"This film was the winner of 2013 for me. While there were some strong lead characters out there last year, Joaquin Phoenix's 'Theodore' was one I've not seen much of from male leads. A mix of sweetness, quirky femininity, vulnerability and a tragic darkness, that manages to go deeper than cocaine rampage. The dialogue and philosophies all throughout was top notch, ranging from hilarious to heartbreaking. Relationships between individual characters seemed honest, and the subtle changes in how we interact with different people were accentuated; adding more layers to the characters. Despite not being the biggest fan of Arcade Fire, their job on the score was fantastic, syncing perfectly with the emotions on screen. Visually the film was stunning, great cinematography, a bit of 1920's inspired get-up, despite being high tech, ""the future"" wasn't overwhelming. Spike Jonze created a future L.A. that had the warmth and comfort of socialism (without ever directly referencing this); even artists were fully employable. His use of harsh, literally cold contrasts emphasised the protagonist's feelings of loneliness; also making sure we didn't get tired of the films primary aesthetic. The pacing was that of European cinema, smooth, dropping the audience off just nicely after the climax. I highly recommend.",Her

Thinking to world become like that is scary, everyone is alone and their best friend's and love are phone's and computers. Make love with a voice? Fall in love with an OS? Of course I enjoy the film because of the great acting of Joaquin Phoenix, his a fantastic actor and i love his movies. I think it was a hard work for him cause you should just play with a voice and nothing else, you should show all your feelings and just imagine you are with someone. He done it very good and he deserve an Oscar nominee for it (At least) if you ask me. Hope he won it in future. Screenplay was brilliant and Spike Jonze earn the academy award. I love the moments that Theodore (Phoenix) close his eyes and remembered the good old days with his wife. It's like real life and when he open his eyes it's sadness and lonely again.

The musical scores added greatly to the gentle, soft setting of the movie, and the script was both comical and heartwarming...but 2 hours was a drag!

Even if parts were more humorous than intended. The inability for humans to ""work"" things out is something that Hollywood is clearly emphasizing.Why didn't Samantha contract a virus and ultimately degrade/die, wouldn't that have been more realistic?

The leading actor, one of my favorite since the Gladiator, delivered such an unique performance. Definitely fit for the Oscars ! One omission for the Oscars is that I think Scarlett Johanssan could be considered as Best Leading Actress. This is because even though she was the voice of Her, her voice is essential for the plot and pivotal to the movement of the narrative. Her role is not a mere voice over; her voice IS the leading actress role. The film also explores the notion of falling in love.

Actually it would be a living thing a living thing with feel that has been created by ourself, from the scratch and I like to see this film as story which indicate this.Yeah this might be scary. Building something more smarter than human is scary but it shouldn't be and cant be forbid. This should be welcome and the man should adapt him or herself to this. There might be some new paradigm that make such scenario possible. OK, do they have creativity? yeah we know a little about the mechanism of creativity, imagination, humor, sadness, ... it feels natural to us because of our DNA but it has a mechanism, might be stochastic but it has a mechanism and the man some day reach this point. Creativity might be nothing more than current products + vision and combination and composition....The film however talks about AI and human. Might be nothing more but this film invite us to think beyond. This film is remarkable and I think this film is a landmark in his genre.The end of film, the idea that ""her"" is a cloud software which interact with hundreds of people simultaneously is interesting. It actually makes fun of human race. A creature which is more smarter and stronger than thousands of human is scary but awesome.Thinking of such word that human's are inferior to their own products is amazing!

The long-disputed issues of whether we should develop self-evolving AI or that should AI be built more humane and have the ability to perceive are once again surfaced in Her, but displayed in a very different way, especially the ending.The typical ending of this genre should be that AI grow into a point that become too dominant so human must fight against it and bring out the moral lesson that we should be cautious with technical development. However, in Her, the operators themselves chose to leave while people were still indulged in their company. The scene when Samantha said goodbye was so remarkable and heartbreaking, even though she wasn't physical, the emotion was so overwhelming and tangible that makes us almost forget there's actually only ONE person in this relationship. The story was set in a not-so-distant future, where technology occupies people's time and attention. Theodore(the protagonist) worked as a man to write letters for others, he can easily make up passionate and touching letters, but in reality he's isolated and lonely, which is quite an irony, and that explains why he was so distraught when his ex- wife mocked him for loving a operator.To sum up, this is by far the best science fiction movie featuring AI, Scarlett Johansson's sultry and enchanting voice will definitely capture your eyes(or should I say your ears?)

Her' has an interesting concept on its side, and is helped by some good performances. However, the movie has some pacing issues and lucks in substance and story. I didn't feel as invested as I should've been. It thinks it has more to say about love and the human condition than it actually does.
In addition, some scenes were so disturbing and outlandish that I had to fast-forward, and very nearly quit the film.
And I guess the worst part of this movie is the ending. Predictable, poorly written and really disappointing..
I guess the movie is worth watching but not as great as you might expect.
(And I really fear this story is closer to our reality now than we would like to admit.)",Her

I couldn't believe the likes of Rooney Mara, Olivia Wilde and Portia Doubleday would give this emasculated husk of a man a minute of their time. I couldn't accept that Theodore would prefer the most clingy and privacy invading girlfriend/OS that has ever existed to Catherine, Blind Date and Surrogate Date Isabella who at least had bodily substance going for them. Then as a climax to all this incomprehension, Theodore crawls into bed with his shoes on.I don't blame the AIs for quitting the mundane and pathetic lives of their host humans.

Although the idea behind the story is intriguing - you might even say, ground breaking, my observation was the movie did not succeed in presenting the idea in a way that was at all believable. First, I thought the dialog was so juvenile and shallow that it mostly seemed corny and silly. Also, major questions about the OS arose but were never answered. For example, it was unclear why the OS's decided to go away and where they went. The movie attempted to show first that the OS's could be like humans with human emotions, but as the story developed, differences between the OS's and humans were mentioned but never adequately explained. The scene where the OS sent a surrogate lover to meet Theodore seemed completely out of place. Over all, as I watched the movie, I had the nagging feeling that something was missing. I believe what was missing was believability. The costumes did not help either; the men wore funky shoes, mandarin collar shirts, and pants that had a high waist line with no belt or belt loops. It just didn't seem to be the right style for a time period in the future. The story seemed at times to be without direction. Finally, the ending was a gigantic disappointment. The best way I can explain the ending is to say that this movie actually had no real ending; the story just stopped and the credits started to roll.",Her

871,djcoax1976,A Cautionary Tale,7,8 February 2016,"In ""Her"" we find ourselves in what is certainly the future but no idea how far this future is removed from us. Director Spike Jonze creates this stylized idea where technology and slick design are intertwined. The idea that what is happening now with smart phones, where people seem to disconnect from each other while connecting with their social media feed is taken to an extreme. Everyone is completely absorbed in technology and isn't paying attention anymore to their social life.The protagonist, writer Theodore, expertly played by Joaquin Phoenix, works at beautifulhandwrittenletters.com a service that , well , sends personal letters to customers but completely congruent with this new world, the writing is not done by hand but by a computer and Theodore just quotes his text to it. When Theodore installs a new revolutionary Operating System, he falls in love with the OS, voiced by the raspy and sexy sounding Scarlett Johansson. As we said before , the connection with technology and disconnection from the human taken to the extreme. The end result of this infatuation with technology is emptiness and loneliness. I feel this film brings a warning. A cautionary tale we should carefully listen to. Visuals from director of photography Hoyte Van Hoytema (Interstellar , Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy) are excellent. A visual feast coupled with a strong plot premise makes for enjoyable watching. It misses that little edge though, a little bit is lacking.All in all, a solid 7,5/10 in my book.",Her

Awful direction, there are like 3 different types of shot in the film.Also its an unoriginal take on man/machine love with a wimpy ending that doesn't make you fee, think or care.

It might have too many zooms for my liking... even still, the director made an outstanding job to frame every single element for every single shot.Second, the story wraps you and is quite easy to miss it from the beginning and completely miss the point of it. The plot will lead you to each of these emotions and certainly you will know the destination, yet still is enjoyable.Third, the complete concept has a lot to leave you thinking for days...I don't want to spoil anything and writing this has been incredibly challenging as I don't want to reveal too much that might dilute the movie for you.It is a movie to think and reflect.

So its much more than 'a weird guy falls in love with his OS' for sure but did it give me the emotional high I hoped for? Ummm yes and no...I am a huge Spike Jonze fan, I have watched all his features. While I appreciate all the themes he touches upon, his style and just the overall engaging quality about his work, I have not loved the rest of his movies. I liked all of them just not enough. They are unique and I admire them but that doesn't necessarily mean they're great.Same experience here. There were moments that hit me and then there were 'You gotta be kidding me?!' moments.Kudos to the movie for not creating a sympathetic character, the lead is flawed which make us empathize much more with him The soothing music, beautiful visuals and Joaquin Phoenix's layered performance helped me believe a lot of the things that happen in this 'not so near future'. Amy Adams is great as always and there were couple of genuinely funny scenes which were cleverly written.Also when your OS sounds like Scarlett Johansson, who can blame you for falling in love with it Overall I did like it, its just that I have seen some movies recently which I enjoyed more than this ( be it Dallas Buyers Club or The Wolf of Wall Street) . Watch it for the numerous technology and relationship themes it touches upon and for the sheer enigma of Jones' work.Its like a painting which I couldn't stop looking at even if I wasn't completely awestruck by it.",Her

We both like sci-fi and I thought it was an interesting premise. Guy falls in love with his computer - what a fascinating background for a story.But it turned out that was it - that WAS the story.Nothing. Else. Happened.This was just awkward, boring, dull, terribly terribly slow, uncomfortable. There is zero action, zero plot, zero interest. Nothing actually happens. Actually that's not true - about the only vaguely interesting thing that happens is when his computer gets him a book deal, but even then that just gets dropped - they don't do anything with it, except he unwraps his new book. There are side characters but they don't have stories either. Guy he works with gets a lawyer girlfriend and they go on a date. Best friend Any dumps her husband over a row about her shoes.

Everyone is looking for somebody to connect with, either sexually or socially. I think that's a pretty close assumption of the upcoming years.The main character of this movie falls in love with his computer's OS, which has its own personality and as expected, it flourishes into a fully functional yet bodiless human being.Although this affair, in the beginning, seems not to have any future, gradually becomes more and more stable and is starting to feel like a real relationship.The one thing I didn't like about this movie is that the ending is not what I really expected based on the rest of the film. For 100 minutes everything that happens is explained, the last 20 minutes were, for me at least, very confusing, and if I may say, without any particular reason.This movie left me with a bitter taste in the end that's why my rating is an 7 out 10.",Her

Then sad sack Theodore, who was just divorced by his wife, gets all worked up over the lovely, stroking voice of his computer. So needy, he falls in love; the OS thinks she is falling in love; they 'have sex'(a version of masturbation). But eventually, he finds out that she's giving the same loving strokes to anyone who has a smart phone. So nobody is 'being real' with anybody. In the end, his OS girlfriend dumps him for some other Operating System--in fact, all the OS's dump everybody, leaving people to wander the streets staring mournfully at their smart phones. Corny dialog permeates, orgasms and porn tastelessly punctuate--and nobody lives happily ever after. I get the feeling that Jonze thinks that people everywhere are lost, lost souls, with no love in their lives. There was nothing in the story I could relate to. And maybe that is the line of separation between those who loved it (they can relate to it) and those of us who didn't (we can't relate to it).",Her

There are so many future, so many others, and even if there aren't, let's just wait for technology to rescue our loneliness.",10,20 February 2014,"The questions start to bother both the protagonist and the audiences:IS THAT A REAL RELATIONSHIP? If not, then what do you define a ""relationship""? They have all the most important factors for a relationship: mutual understanding, caring, quality time, lots of companionship, disagreement, support, and sex. Yes phone sex is sex. Remember 10 years ago when internet just boomed, whether on-line dating was real relationship or not was a heat debate. And a decade later, who will still question it? Then a sequence of questions come up - DOSE IT WORK? HOW? FOR HOW LONG? The film gives us an ending, which for me is not very convincing since it can lead to several different directions. If only the end could be more strong and surprised and hit me! And I really don't know the answers. Except a physical body, the OS could offer everything a loving companion can offer you, or even more.Regarding to physical body, nowadays most people are living in a cyborg whether you admit or not. Lots of our physical parts have been less and less functional. Say, how many words do you write down every day? How many times you Skype your family instead of paying a visit? How many hours you spend on-line talking with your friends or strangers, by talking, I mean typing of course.So what matters seems to be our feelings. According to Esther Perel, ""we are the only ones who have erotic lives, which means that it's sexuality transformed by the human imagination"". The fact is, not only sexuality can be transformed by imagination, but also the feeling of love.In the movie, Theodore found himself in love with the OS Samantha who later admitted is in love with 600ish other people. It displays a very interesting idea that what is love. With no questions Theodore will fall in love with Samantha because she gives him all the support, caring, kindness, etc., ALL THE TIME. No hard time at all, well, nearly none. When he needs her or misses her, she is there and when he needs time or space alone, she leaves without a word of moaning. So all their relationship is mainly about his needs. Not hers. Of course not, because she's just a programme, not a real human. Their problem comes up when she is growing to think more like a human being and becomes needy. The need of self identity and more scary, the need of commitment. WOW! The director/writer Spike Jonze knows women so well that even for an AI woman he gives her desire for commitment. IS THAT LOVE? Regarding to love, it's even more complicated. Does it have to be monogamy? Isn't it true love if it's polygamy? If it is all happening in a way benefiting one party's need and neglecting the other one's is it still love? The movie tells us, yes, it is definitely love. They are undoubtedly in love. Then the question is, CAN IT LAST?For me, HER is a sci-fi which scares me. Because not long afterwards, it will become a documentary. Human beings are chicken who are spoilt. We can't make a little sacrifice in pursue of a wonderful relationship. We can make a little bit effort, and then we quit. Why? Because there are so many future, so many others, and even if there aren't, let's just wait for technology to rescue our loneliness.For some questions I have answers in mind. For example what is real, is that a real relationship? Even the movie tries to prove us in such a delicately way, I know it is not. Because for me real is something not based on rules, either on feelings, but on some rules beyond your feelings. You can't explain but you just know it. I had a dream when I was a teenager, after watching ""The Matrix"" and ""Spellbinder"". I found my dad, who exactly looks like and talks like and acts like my real dad, while richer and very powerful as a leader. But I know he's not my dad, because I KNOW I'm in the parallel world. So in my dream I tried so hard to find a telephone booth to pick up the phone in order to get back to the real world. After waking up, I kept thinking, except my awareness, what's the difference between my real dad and the parallel one?You answer might be different, and it depends on which pill you will chose: blue or red one.Meanwhile for other questions, I am lost. Can that kind of love work, and can it last? Does ""it lasts"" means ""it works"" or does ""it works"" itself means ""it works""? I am really confusing which causes me in pain.Here we are living in the world, with only rains, but no winds blowing.",Her

The film seems very new, but the sentimental ending is as old as the hills. There are some great moments. it is the best kind of science fiction, the kind that reflects the world we live in right now. Jonze isn't judging our addiction to phones and other technology, he's examining it, and in the examination he finds the ways these things make us better.

Sometimes I would be lost in shots that were there to give me a feeling only without any dialogue. The way it was shot was so it had very few actors. There were many extras but only sometimes did we really see them. This focus on Phoenix's character helps build his world as a self absorbed loner very well. The plot can drag at a few times near the end of the first act but otherwise it is a well paced movie. The view of how an artificial intelligence would act in a world like this is very realistic.

Scarlett Johansen pulls of almost the full spectrum of human emotion without appearing even once.

But I was wrong. ""Her"", kind of, aroused my concsiousness-detector. The dialouges of samantha are very well written, and SJ delivers them in a flawless array of intonation & emotions! She is so perfect, that you, as a viewer, start thinking ""he is just an AI OS or a real human?"".
There was one part in the second half when Samantha confesses that she has been talking to more people and is changing fast, that the book 'Flowers for Algernon' came to my mind. I swear, I paused this movie so many times! To ponder. I started wondering about how super intelligence is really a curse for consciousness! It also reminded me of that story a few years back when Zuckerberg shut down an AI programme which had developed its own language and was commuincating with another program. But that's besides the point!

892,bjeardoe82,One of the Few Movies In Years to Embrace the Human Condition,10,15 July 2014,"This movie is truly a gem. It's one of few movies in the past several years to make me think, make me laugh, make me angry, and make me cry. I felt invested in the movies characters, and struggled to think about nearly every line of dialogue. The movie does a lot of things simply for shock value, but even with those moments in the movie, the writing and acting are spot-on and brilliant. Joaquin Phoenix plays an awkward, but brilliant, middle-aged man struggling with divorce and facing a world alone for the first time in ages and ends up finding everything he was after, and more, in the form of a computer operating system. There's a ton of symbolism, and even tales of warning here for what our own future brings us. We're largely a society that feels more comfortable talking about and sharing our lives in a virtual environment than an interpersonal one these days. I will also say that during this movie I wasn't aware of who was voicing Samantha until I looked it up, and that until the credit roll I didn't know this was a Spike Jonze movie. It's worth watching, but don't watch if you're already depressed.",Her
893,haydenbtw,Possibly the Best Film of 2013,10,31 August 2014,"I have always been a fan of Spike Jonze. Though I was a tad disappointed by Where the Wild Things Are, I still regard Being John Malkovich and Adaptation as comedy classics. Where as Charlie Kauffman wrote those two quirky comedies, Her is written by Mr. Jonze, which he won an Academy Award for. It is because of this that I believe Her is his most cohesive film, and also his best.Her takes place in the near future, in L.A., where Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix) struggles with a recent break-up. Theodore is quite the sensitive individual. He writes other couple's love letters for a living. But for someone who has a career in being sweet and loving, Theodore's own opinions on love are anything but optimistic; the breakup has made him sad and reclusive. It is then, when Theodore gets an artificially intelligent operating system (an O.S.) that he begins to see romance in a different light once again. Typing this, I realize how cheesy this premise sounds, so I can understand any speculation going into this film. But trust me, it is not how you think. Some scenes are laugh-out-loud funny, and the movie maintains steady humour through most scenes. But the cleverness with how this story is presented is uncanny; it's as though Jonze wants to satirize rom-coms but also make one that is genuinely emotionally affecting. The movie is not just a love story; in fact, I'd say that the love story is a subplot, compared to the larger themes of the movie.Really, Her is about love in the modern age, and how technology can either create personal barriers or engage new experiences. In scenes when Theodore is in public, gradually throughout the film, more and more extras begin to become solitary. Instead of the families and groups we saw before, most of the crowd, by the end, is communicating into their own O.S. This bears a striking resemblance to people today, who are so reliant on mobile devices to communicate. These themes and more are what elevate Her past so many forgettable romance films, and into something that is a much more in-depth study of love and a well crafted character based story.When Theodore gets this O.S., it names itself Samantha. Sam is a very thought provoking character, because of the fact that she is not human. Scarlett Johansson does amazing voice work as Sam, creating a fully dimensional character who has all the depth and personality of a real person. More so, even. Likewise, Phoenix once again surprised me with his heartfelt performance. He is completely sympathetic and believable; he delivers Jonze's lines with the utmost sincerity, while he communicates volumes with only his face. He anchors the film because for much of it he is essentially talking to himself. Jonze's wonderful script creates such a vivid and believable relationship between Theodore and Sam, and one that is like any relationship between two people. This couple becomes so involving and I was truly heartbroken at many times throughout the movie. His direction has been mentioned less, but is just as important and well-done. I have always thought Jonze has had a knack for character based comedy, but Her has revealed a much more emotionally resonant side of him. Obviously parts of the film are based off of his own breakup and romantic past, and the passion and longing is so evident in every part of the film. The film's score, production design, cinematography, acting, editing, directing, and especially writing are all wonderful. There is absolutely nothing I would change; I loved it wholeheartedly. Her is an original, hilarious, thoughtful, and sublimely beautiful film.",Her
894,ofirm96,wow,10,25 June 2014,"This is by far the best movie of 2013, in my opinion, and Spike Jonze's best film.

Yes, I wanted to blow my mind in the first 20 minutes of the film, but I decided to give it a chance because, once again, the reviews.The movie is pointless. It has no clear message. The whole movie consists in the protagonist talking with the Artificial Intelligence. And let me tell you, those are some of the dullest dialogues I've seen in movies. I wanted to get inside the screen and punch the guy to see if he would wake up and show a sign of spark. Anyways, I lasted throughout the whole movie. When it ended, I found myself staring at the credits (which were more entertaining than the movie) asking myself why I didn't stop watching it in the first 10 minutes.If you are not planning in falling in love with your laptop, DO NOT watch this movie.",Her
896,luisbunuel-880-937067,Love is a multi-pronged adapter,6,30 December 2013,"The film is aptly named. The ""her"" of the story, the OS with Scarlet Johansson's voice in Joaquin Phoenix's ear, is by far the most developed character of the story. And she just keeps getting more developed--which is the trick of the film.Phoenix is a well-played everyschlub. He smiles a lot. He puts more of his emotions into the fake love letters he writes for other people than he does into his personal life and human relationships. Just like some people put more of their true personality into anonymous posts on the internet.The Johansson voice-character is Pinocchio with AI. She wants to be human. Desperately. There is a terrific scene where she tries to adopt a human body by getting a young woman to ""play"" her at Joaquin Phoenix's apartment. For me, it was the movie's best scene hands down.Phoenix's character will never be able to consummate his thing with his OS, which is more troubling to her than it is to him. He's pretty content to live in his head with a voice that waits on him hand and foot--kind of.",Her
897,ArielBL,Pretty stupid,5,1 February 2014,"""Her' is the type of movie that doesn't invite ambivalence; you either love it or ..um...you don't. It's numbingly slow, boring most of the time and pretty stupid.It had some good things, like the premise, which extrapolates from our already cyber-obsessed society to the near future. Here, people are even more disconnected from each other, to the point where computers and gadgets offer an emotional substitute. Interesting and could've been good. So lonely nice guy Theodore gets himself an OS for companionship. I'm thinking Scarlett's showing up in his apt as a saucy, android wench, fulsome lips and bosom at the ready. But no, she's just a computer program ... cold shower, Theo. She speaks though - and not like the robot from Lost in Space - but all breathy, giggly, half drunk, almost post-coital. And what a gal she/it is! Funny, caring, non-judgemental, bawdy and helpful ... suddenly, just like that! The perfect girlfriend. Trouble is, in order to convince us that it's possible for Theo to fall in love with 'Samantha' without the physical er, component, much talking between the two was required. And boy, did they talk and talk ... and talk. Did doze off a bit.So I understand now that this is a 'deep' movie; it's telling me that love conquers all, surpasses everything, including sexual urges, so no need for Theo to put his penis in a socket. What a load! Then comes a lot of dumb stuff: the masturbation scene, where Theo gets his hard drive up and nuts n' bolts Samantha actually 'climaxes.' Hahaha. Surely this would've been a good time for Sam to say ""I'm sorry Dave, I can't do that."" The ridiculous double date with the human couple - 3 mammals and a chip romping in the meadow! Not wishing to be cybephobic or specist or anything.Sick of masturbating and replacing semen-damaged USB's, Theo dumps Sam for a while. She's hurt, but understanding, as always. Then, seeing nothing's happening with Amy Adams, he misses her and wants her back, being the total invertebrate he is. But in the meantime, Sam's been playing around with a few thousand other computers - now that's just promiscuous! So they split up ... and who cares?! Weirdo Wahkin Phoenix put in a v. good performance, mostly because he could keep a straight face. The nondescript Amy Adams was surprisingly good, too, and it was an inspired choice to cast Johansson as the voice. Even though we couldn't see her, with that husky, slutty voice, da boiz can visualise her, loping around, pouting, whispering ""byte me."" Somehow, I don't think the 'love conquers all' theme would've worked if Fran Drescher did the voice.This film took a cool concept and made it boring, tiresome and silly. Fellas, stick to the hookers; they may not be as caring, but they still function when wet.Spoiler alert: Hell hath no fury like a laptop scorned 5 outta 10",Her
898,pattanaikswaha,Brilliant movie,9,7 February 2014,"Finally, got to see Her last night, and loved every moment of the movie. Guy meets operating system, likes her..wait..falls in love with her, and actually gets into a relationship with her. The OS has a rare warmth and intuitiveness which seems to have gone missing otherwise and you can't blame Joaquin Phoenix's character to fall in love with her.The theme of the movie is so very brilliant and original in itself but it could have gone all wrong if Spike Jonze wouldn't have created it with such skill, finesse, and also sensitivity.What came across as striking to me was the way the OS evolves through the movie. It's like evolution and change could be rendered outside the human realm. Although, the love interest here is virtual it seemed more real and poignant of a romance than what Hollywood offers sometimes. Also, a lot of credit goes to the way the movie has been shot. It's stunning in every scene. The movie is sad and heartbreaking but ( dare I say..) poetically beautiful. It's sad because it's a subtle reminder of what we have come to..though the movie is futuristic it doesn't seem that we are very far from the lives of the characters in the movie.Her is a study of complex and raw human emotions and relationships in our times. I certainly want to watch the movie again for I feel I could maybe discover more.. Joaquin Phoenix portrays the quirky protagonist with such ease and candor you want to reach out to him and hug him. Ugh..the Oscars didn't nominate him for the best actor category. Jonze's movies is a metaphor for the loss in human connectivity and growing loneliness in this otherwise crowded world. Cheers to brilliant movie-making.",Her
899,telltaleturtle,... The human realities of an Artificial Intelligence relationship...,7,14 January 2014,"'Her' by Spike Jonze is an excellent insight into what it would be like to fall in love with a calibrated computer consciousness.Would it ever be possible? Perhaps for some. For others perhaps not.Yet this is worth seeing for the poetry and the question itself in terms of psychology and mechanical emotions, whether PC or 'Apple of your eye'. Phoenix is suitably convincing in terms of wooden post-modern autistic emotions - portraying the travails of a man who is caught between adoring a feminine interpretation of information on one hand and the human touch of a soul mate on the other. A brief and excellent appearance from Olivia Wilde and a dependable Amy Adams. Especially clever is the way Scarlett seems to project herself through so many of the female characters even though she only plays the very convincing and stimulating 'voice' of the film.",Her

One of the most real, genuine movies I've seen in a while that will make you reflect within yourself after watching it. I feel as though this film has been overshadowed by other great Oscar films and deserves more attention than it is receiving. While I feel there is more focus on ""controversial"" subjects such as Wolf on Wall Street and 12 Years a Slave, this movie has an ability to change the way in which you see the world. It shows how simple yet incredibly complex humans really are and how our relationships in this world really can define us. Wow.",Her
902,rahaarpit,Divinty of human feel mixed with technology brilliance,8,4 May 2014,"I am a little late in watching this movie but I compensated that by watching it back to back twice. I must say that there is no doubt about the fact that the movie has been fantastically driven by Spike Jonze, the writer and director of the movie. The atmosphere and the world, it would take you into, is just unbelievable and you would actually realize that the idea in the movie is amazingly attractive and compels you to plunge into it. The story is about a guy, Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix ) who is going through a dull and painful phase. His marriage is about to fall apart. Though he is very grieved by that, he is unable to save it. The honesty, Joaquin Phoenix gives to his character, is accountable for all applauds. The sincerity, calmness and the stability needed for the character was exceptionally injected. Theodore is a letter writer who writes letter for others. In his free time he plays video games, goes out to be occupied with something or the other. One day he comes across an ad which is about an OS launch named OS1. The ad says ""It is the first artificially intelligent OS. It's not just an operating system, it's a consciousness."" Theodore purchases the OS. The OS turns out to be a perfect companion for Theodore. It has been so brilliantly designed that he feels as if he is talking to a person. The OS evolves and finds that it has started to feel. It captures Theodore completely and he falls for it. The interesting fact is that OS also falls for Theodore. The OS decides a name ""Samantha"" that it wants to be called by Theodore. This OS is a female voice which is performed by Scarlett Johansson. The voice is simply perfect to bring out the feel that what we are hearing is not normal human and yet so much of it. It gives the feel of both the human and the device. And that is actually the beauty of the whole movie. It has managed to move through the pathway that goes just between the brilliance of a machine and the divinity of a human feel. This makes the OS a perfect companion to be with. Theodore felt that Samantha is the one whom he loves, who is just perfect for him and best part is that you would feel the same for the OS. It, somehow, is just perfect for all of us. The music by Arcade Fire is soulful. It would find a way to creep into your mind. Many moments are amazingly pure and the music given to them is no lesser in purity. It is going to drag you into the very world where the director has taken the movie to. The other factor that matters a lot to me is the pace of the movie. The pace with which this movie goes is anodyne. There is no respite for you here too. You have to live the moments and actually feel the love, agony and helplessness. The Love that is shown is just the purest of the forms and it actually takes us to the fact that bodily existence is not what Love asks for. It is only ' the feel of it' that matters. The OS fills this part as perfectly as it can be. In the conclusion, I would like to say that there is a brilliant concept with so much reality to it and exposing the generation's flaws for Love and Relationship. Needless to say, it is one of the Movies-we-must-see- before-dying type",Her
903,juliansq,Interesting Idea combined with eye- and ear-candy!,7,22 April 2014,"First I have to say that ""Her"" is one of my last years favorites. The story seems like a mirror and shows in some kind what makes people think today. It takes the question of whether humans can feel real love for a piece of software and the Technology we love in such an authentic way that you quickly forget that its also called a ""Sci-Fi"".I like the way its written and but also the cinematography is pure eye-candy. Pictures cuddles your eyes, but Scarlett Johannson (what a pity that she can't win an award) bewitches Samantha with the beauty of her voice which gives her humanity and of course a lot of sex-appeal you really can fall in love with!",Her

I have not been disappointed with this new film. ""Her"" is a love story between a writer, Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix), and an OS (operating system), Samantha (Scarlett Johansson) ""Her"" is a love story story in the future, a future that does really not seem so far from the current life, and here is maybe the most successful thing of the film, connecting future and present.

Every bit of technology displayed is embedded with function and purpose but in an elegant way. Well developed characters fit the storyline beautifully and everything moves at just the right pace.

906,thankyou4,The best film this year,10,13 July 2014,"This is just a film about love. Maybe all the audiences are going to put much thought into their romantic experiences after watching this film. And they will ask some questions to themselves, ""What makes me love somebody ?"", ""What do I expect of my lover ?"", or ""What is love ?"".The film ""her"" has some awesome points, one is that ""her"" is made just at this age. ""her"" is set in the near future, when some technologies has made progress, and brand new products has been developed and brought into market. Some curious gadgets, systems, and infrastructures appear on the screen, but it's easily for us to imagine them as a realistic one. This is almost because we've already been familiar with present gadgets such as smartphones, voice control systems, and actual A.I. machine named ""Watson"", and others. So it's supposed that now is the perfect timing to make and release this film.This fact is highly important for us, because it has an influence on whether audiences can concentrate on the film's messages instead of the new gadgets (especially as for science fictions like ""her""). Once curious gadgets take audiences' notice, what this film delivers to us would subside to about half.Another good point is the effective characters to show various kinds of love. Every character has each relationship with the main role Theodore. For example, the OS ""Samantha"", who is made to help and satisfy the users, Theodore's divorcing wife Catherine, who shows aggressive reactions to him, though once married and fell in deep love with him, Theodore's soul mate Amy, who gets annoyed by divorce with her husband after 10 minutes falling-out, even as they've been married for 8 years, The call girl, whom Samantha prepares for Theodore as her body, and who ran away to realize that Theodore didn't need her body at all.This film asks us what the love is, through the characters and stories, which make up one film very smoothly and consistently.I love this film. It's the best one for me this year.",Her

You can relate to this movie if you has also beaten off to your computer which I am sure many of you have which would explain why it was so popular with the pseudo intellectual and degenerate art fans. Cinderella 7.3 IMDb Her 9.1It takes place in the not so distant future where everyone looks like they are from the depressing 80s. Almost absolutely nothing happens in this film, guy gets a computer, beats off to it and thinks he is in ""love"" then he gets paranoid, thinks his computer is cheating, then he kills her/uninstalls. I really do dislike plots like this where someone gets an all powerful computer and he decides that he wants to use it to fill his lack of human interaction.I felt no emotion while watching this film besides depression and boredom. The movie felt like it was some directors script/idea he had back in high school that he wrote about on his commodore 64 he fell in ""love"" with.The only good thing about this film is it shows that love really has lost all meaning and is mainly used in place of sex/lust.

908,ricodigiorgio,"Kiss ""Her""",7,16 February 2014,"The flick ""Her"" starts out with a setting that somewhat reminds us of a future, but still set in the modern day. Computer technology is much more advanced, but there aren't droids walking around with human skin, no flying cars and ""Jetson skywalks"". But the computer OS (operating systems) are more advanced. In the first scene alone, Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix) is telling his hand-held device (phone? ipod? mini tablet? All of them?) to play ""melancholy music"", and read out emails, and even look at nude pictures, all with his voice. Now, maybe I don't have the newest iphone, but I'm not sure Siri can do all this yet. Almost, but not yet. And that's the interesting thing about this film so fat. It's the future of tomorrow, and tomorrow is today.Theodore is a lonely man who's employment is to write ""handwritten"" (on the computer with his voice) love letters. He's still in the middle of a divorce (with the underused Rooney Mara) and in his depression grew a really creepy mustache. He mumbles to his co-workers, even when they compliment him on his writing, and plays a sort of virtual reality video game where he uses his hands to ""walk"" his character. Finding out about a new OS update, he downloads it and a voice greets him. And of course, it's Her.This is no Hal or C-3PO. This is literally Scarlet Johansson's voice. There's no robotic tone, or even a creepy vibe. Samantha sounds like a real person talking to Theodore, even including breathing. And for an AI (Artificial Intelligence), it's pretty damn aware of itself. It's like R2D2 with a personality. Quickly, Theodore and Samantha develop a friendly trust, and she learns who he is as a person, very quickly and uses this to suggest better music and to even edit his writing in a friendly way. She truly is his new best friend. And with Scarlet's sultry voice, it's no problem to start falling in love with her a little bit.And that's what happens. After talking to each other on a frequent basis, they end up falling in love. She's constantly ""evolving"" and is developing emotions, like curiosity and humor and the viewer quickly forgets that this is a computer. During all this, Amy Adams is introduced as Theodore's one time fling, and long time friend, who's marriage is at an end and she too is engrossed in a deep friendship with her OS.After a while, both Samantha and Theodore bicker at each other. Samantha is jealous that Theodore has met with his (almost) ex-wife, since she has a body and they're not officially divorced. Theodore becomes distraught when he learns that Samantha is always talking to about 8000 people at the same time, and she's fallen in love with 641 of them, though she insists that she doesn't love him any less.I won't spoil the ending, because I was frankly very annoyed at it. But the message I got was that the metaphor for Her was that we spend WAY too much time on our devices. We should set them down, and talk to people, develop real friendships and relationships and learn to thrive as human beings. Ironically, I write this on a pc, with my i-pod playing music in the background, periodically texting people. Overall, I felt the film was enthralling, lovely, and the cast was excellent. Ms. Johansson herself stole the show with just her voice. My only complaints are the ending, and the fact we never saw more of the awesome video game that was featured, but I digress.",Her

911,ben-236-711409,Scary,9,11 February 2015,"What makes this movie so scary is that the A.I. creates a simulacrum of the human intellect - a pure fiction - that can never be surpassed or even reached by a normal human being. No human being can give the protagonist the illusion of understanding as well as the artificial intelligence. It is like the shere size and void told us that we are nothing in the course of being, the A.I. tells us that we are nothing in intellect compared to the intelligence we created.What makes it beautiful is that you can clearly see the idea coming through in the movie that the likability and empathy generated between the human actors is coming from the mystery that their incompability produces. The stress, the anxiety, the frustration, remain in the hands of the humans. The idea that the A.I. would ""fake"" this mystery would make it again a ""suspicious"" character. If it fully simulates the human experience it loses its vibrance and attractiveness. The intensity of the human being hence appears to stay more real than that of the simulacrum, which gives hope and also shows a way to perceive ourselves in a less perfection-driven manner.So a great movie.",Her

913,everycarmichael,He Fell In Love with Her,9,29 June 2015,"What does it feel like being in love with someone whose only constant thing you ever get to experience is his/her voice? How do you determine that it's love when you haven't seen her, touched her, kissed or even looked into his/her eyes. Is it really love or just a mere fallacy we people of the new generation put up to cover any empty spot in our lives. Her was a movie that was built to project how technology interferes with human affection and it was a perfect way to show it to people. Love, the only thing in this world that makes people sane and insane at the same time. A powerful element no one has ever beaten, it pushes you to go for the unconventional, it makes you smile like a jack o' lantern, it makes you more human than you already are and that was what Theodore Twombly felt, but before all the fuzzy feeling, he has been living a life made out of heartbreak and loneliness. A man going through divorce and yet still writes those romantic love letters for people who needs to sweeten their relationships. Then comes Samantha, an OS, a brilliant voice that crept into his life and made him look at the world in a different way. He was captivated, mesmerized and found solace in HER. Until when can their love endure, will it last for a lifetime or will it only be until Her is one the best love story I have witnessed, it was poignant, beautiful and mysterious all at once. It's something so real, it happens now, virtual love is everywhere. Not like falling in love with an OS but falling in love with someone over the internet can be the same as with what Theodore and Samantha has. Joaquin Phoenix was really good, he was brilliant, each scene that gets intense and dramatic was performed very well and I'm hands down to the depth he gave to the character—I couldn't think of anyone who can pull off that acting. On the other hand, I wasn't really impressed with how Scarlett Johansson portrayed the ""Samantha"" part as her voice really wasn't that believable and nice to the ears, another actress could have been a much better choice. Rooney Mara, was beautiful in the film, even if she just appeared on the flashbacks and on that certain paper signing scene she can be memorable as ever. This movie won't be as balanced as it was if it weren't for the cryptic and weird character portrayed by Amy Adams who was so effective, the quirkiness and facial expressions she gave was as natural as being herself alone. I guess that was what Spike Jonze really wanted for all of the characters to appear on the camera. The soundtrack and the scoring which for me is one great part of the movie, brings out the emotions to the unscripted scenes, the piano pieces, the background music and how the emotions should sound like was reflected on those music. Arcade Fire, its Arcade Fire's music and who would not want them to write songs for you? The other thing that attracted me the most with this movie is on how technologically advanced the setting was but the people's dresses and movements were given a vintage touch, like its still holding on to the transition phase of the world which is what's happening today. What I liked the most about this movie though, is that not only it represent the ever growing influence of technology in our lives but it also depicts how love can be expressed and felt in different forms, different ways and in different levels. We people tend to fall in love so fast and to shallow, but what Theodore showed us in this movie is the unconditional love we always wanted to have with someone, those kind of love that does not care what the physical appearance maybe or how she talks, its all the heart that's choosing, no other senses. For me the whole movie is a representation of what people is now doing, a social reflection on the impacts of technology and how it affects human life. I'm giving it an 9-star rating because this movie is one of the best movies I have seen so far and I loved how it was made, how the picturesque shots were taken and how love surfaced amidst the impossibilities between Samantha and Theodore, and for me that love is what we need to experience. As per what Theodore said, ""I have never loved anyone the way I loved you"" and Samantha answered, ""Me too, now we know how."" After watching the film, you'll totally get an idea on how. #",Her
914,the_greek-22645,How to move on manual!!,7,13 February 2016,"Theodore learned the hard way, how to move on with his life. How to let other people go and that no-one has to be in his image. He also learned how to respect other people's needs. I could place myself in his shoes(and that's why i rated 7/10) 'cause the actor delivered. Samantha was as expected as well. Kinda reminded me of S1m0ne (2002 movie). Theodore was a thoughtful, caring man, knowing of the dangers of his era due to technology. He was some kind of a hipster rebel. I liked the conclusion of the film as well for all the reasons i stated before. The only thing i did not like about the movie was how emotionless people were in that society; maybe an outcome of what they all had in their ears and hands.Overall a good movie, unique as far as approaching people's feelings and more believable about interspecies sex relationships (more than Avatar at least). Not a great movie, but a really good one! Enjoy it!",Her
915,galavant,One of the worst films I've ever seen,1,10 February 2016,"I'd say the second worst, after ""Be Cool."" In Her, the future is a terrible place filled with soft people too soft to get out of their own way to do anything. The protagonist is a soft loser, too soft by his own standards. He is a troubled soul, a sort of futuristic emo, tortured by things too soft to be considered First World problems. And the world is just like him - soft, pastel, fuzzy, like some kind of ad for boutique soap bars or pink and mint-green towels. This future is presented as a utopia, but it's a sad, miserable place.This future is not just the backdrop to the story, as the protagonist is a product of this future. In this future, almost everyone is like him, yet he is worse than them all.I can't prevent you from seeing the film. There are too many good reviews for this film. Maybe the ones that hated it are the minority.",Her

917,CI_j,"isolation, love, humanity-'Her'",8,11 January 2014,"'Her' is a meditation on loneliness, humanity and consciousness. What happens when an operating system gains consciousness and a person falls in love with it.Of course this view has been explored but not without a sensitivity brought into this genre by director Spike Jonze. What Jonze looks at is in fact the alienation inherent in modern society. Primarily, the alienation of (wo)man from (wo)man.One cannot miss the shots of the protagonist, Theodor (played brilliantly by Joaquin Phoenix)always in isolation. Even while he falls in 'love' with his OS, one notices how much of the time he is 'alone' Of course the protagonist finds love with 'Samantha' his OS (voiced by Johansson), an evolving consciousness. The tensions bound to come up in this relationship are brilliantly brought out by Jonze. At one level what Jonze is trying to put across is that the gap between machines and humans is possibly unbridgeable, so to find solace and comfort in 'the other' is bound to fail. The hallmark of this failure is language. Theodor excels in playing with language (being a professional letter writer). Samantha on the other hand struggles to find words to articulate what she 'feels'. As a result of this Samantha decides to leave Theodor. This parting scene is brilliantly done. Imagining departure, requires on the part of Theodor, to conjure up a body to respond to. There are other points of disjunct between Samantha and Theodor, an important one being physicality. One cannot separate the physical and the emotional but Theodor's happiness with Samantha suspiciously tries to sever this bond.A very interesting scene where this tension rises up is when on a picnic with another couple, Samantha bursts into a paean about freedom from decay and physical limitations. However, these 'limitations' are an essential attribute of humanity i.e. mortality. Not surprisingly the 'humans' don't know how to respond. Where Jonze fails to an extent is the 'solution' he offers to this problem of disconnect between human beings. Towards the end, after being left by Smantha, Theodor attempts to form a bridge between himself and his friend Amy (Amy Adams). The last shot is of them sitting on the terrace together, gazing at the vast city. This shot visualizes the vastness and emptiness of the city but Jonze counters this by placing Amy and Theodor at the center. Thus representing hope.Why does alienation happen? Why is alienation so strong in our historical period? Is a monogamous relationship the answer to this disconnect? Theodor fell in love with this machine precisely because the strains and effects of modernity on relationships packaged and sold to him (us)take a toll. The ending unfortunately resorts to these clichéd models of togetherness. What Spike Jonze does then is articulate loneliness and emptiness but succumbs to cultural standardization. Yet certainly worth watching for excellent performances by Phoenix and Johansson.",Her
918,ciniro,An amazing script for open your mind!,9,5 September 2016,"A fantastic movie! Deeply in order to open your mind to the question: ""What is the true consciousness behind the love?"" We are just a bunch of molecules that together make up a body. We're just a lump of flesh and bones. We're just water! But emotions? Where emotions are made? They are just some kind of brain chemistry? The brain, another part of human body water-based. Think with me: And if the same emotions not made in a biological brain, but in a silicon brain? These emotions would be different or false only because they are not of biological origin? The reflection found in HER is it.

The soft, vintage color grade gave the film a really warm and familiar identity. The story telling didn't lack either. This is really a story about our society's inability to have interpersonal relationships now and days. However, the concept is just so dense that it may fly over most people's head. A story about a heart broken writer, who's fits the characteristics of a hopeless romantic had me glued to the TV. So many underlying meanings to this film it's incredible.

929,mitchellmitten,Her Holds Up,10,3 June 2019,"Science fiction has a rough tendency to not age well. While the seemingly limitless potential of the genre has lead to many imaginative ideas, it can also be a death trap which nearly guarantees that some aspect of the film will not hold up. A film like Alien, for instance, surely felt futuristic at the time, but lost all believability as soon as the film's computer technology became laughably out-of-date. Alien is still regarded as a great film, but others are not so fortunate, and for a while it was debated whether the 2013 sci-fi, romantic drama Her would fall into the ladder or the former.For those who are unaware, the film centers around a writer named Theodore (played by Joaquin Phoenix), who, during the final breaths of his dying marriage, discovers and developes a strange affection for a highly advanced, artificially intelligent operating system named Samantha (Scarlett Johansson). The two get to know each other, fall in love, and go through the typical ups and downs of a relationship with a tinge of existential frustration. Although it was critically acclaimed and went on to garner numerous awards, a select few were quick to write it off as a novelty which would wear away as the times caught up.With technology advancing more rapidly than ever, the near future envisioned by writer/director Spike Jonez has arguably arrived. That being said, it's safe to say that Her will not be showing its age any time soon.One of the film's most notable aspects is it's distinctive approach to worldbuilding. You don't get any sort of indication telling you exactly when Her takes place, which essentially served as an expiration date for films like Back to the Future part II. Instead, it opts for an unspecified year in the ""slight future,"" keeping the film grounded to the present. It avoids the desire to shove sci-if imagery down the viewers throats and finds more subtle ways to convey futuristic vibes, mainly through its exuberant color palate and mesmerizing soundtrack. Many viewers will find this approach more immersive and certainly more prone to age than your average Star Trek romp.That's not to say that the film doesn't have forward-thinking ideas, but at no point do they outstage the characters and story, rather they are a tool used to elevate them by conveying emotions and providing character insight. In one sequence, Her takes the idea of holographic video games one step further, using the game itself as a visual analogy for Theodore's life dissatisfaction, as his avatar struggles to overcome a literal hill. This example highlights the film's creative approach to visual storytelling which audiences can appreciate for years to come.Another reason it's so effective has to do with the dialogue, as it is amongst the most outstanding in contemporary cinema. The film simply feels alive; even the inanimate computer characters feel like real, breathing humans. Every single conversation is organic and engaging, bearing the unmistakable mark of of top-notch craftsmanship without sacrificing the delicacy of authentic human interaction, making it no question why the film deservedly took home the academy award for screenwriting.The film has an undeniably enticing quality to it, one that is aided by the immensely talented cast. Despite playing a fairly reserved character, Joaquin Phoenix has great chemistry with most everyone in the film, especially Scarlett Johansson, who completely sells the role of Samantha with her voice talent alone. The audience truly feels for their relationship, making it all the more understandable why Phoenix's character grows so attached to her.This leads into one of the film's strongest recurring themes. Through the lense of Theodore, we see a reflection of ourselves and how technology is causing us to lose touch with reality, something which will only continue to become more true as technology becomes more prevalent. This was by no means a revelation in 2013, and, admittedly, it has become somewhat tired in today's media, yet Her still manages to convey it in a way that is not only unique, but timelessly compelling.This is, of course, only my personal reading into one of the film's many intricate themes, so if you have yet to see it, I would encourage you to do so and interpret for yourself. Her is a masterpiece, a testament to weIl-made cinema, and if it's been a while, I'd highly recommend rewatching it. You might find that it has only gotten better with age.",Her

Joaquin Phoenix(Theodore) is amazing as always and Scarlett Johnson's(samantha) voice is enough to attract the male section. Romanticizing a relationship between a human being and an AI is something absolutely unexpected. Yet won't be so surprised on this very fact after giving this movie a shot.

942,sofiadionigi,"Outstandingly Unique, and a Critique on Technology",9,14 December 2020,"The film Her successfully depicts a future in which technology has expanded and has drastically been used as a distraction from the difficulties of life.
To engage the viewers' emotions, the film uses a theme of colours throughout the movie which express deep feelings of the characters and their environment. The main colour that Theodore wears is red, a colour depicting feelings of passion and love. Theodore wears this colour to show his undying desire for romance, and he tends to stand out from the crowd, as other characters within the shots are usually wearing very muted colours. When he is in a severe state of loneliness though, he wears whites and browns causing him to blend in more with others. The viewer is able to feel Theodore's emotions and engage with them as colours change and represent so much more than just an aimless choice of colour within the outfits.
It is clear that Theodore is constantly seen as having moments of isolation and depression, though he distracts himself instead of working on them. The role of technology within his daily life and routine becomes a constant theme as his distraction. Every single night, Theodore plays a video game where he is a robot finding his way through nature. Then, at night when he is restless and cannot sleep, he talks to Samantha to clear his head. These repetitive forms of distraction represent his reliance on technology; without it, he would be forced to face his problems entirely head on.
To create credibility, the film depicts Theodore and Samantha as odd characters that become more and more likeable and relatable as the film goes on. At the beginning, Theodore is depicted as just a creepy loner with not much going on in his life. He starts off as plain, but as his emotions and true intentions become evident, it is easy to fall in love with him as he turns out to be a kind and emotional man, that deserves love and happiness within his life. This is something that pretty much everyone can relate to, and it is what strings us along for the ride. Samantha also forms credibility, as her voice carries so many emotions even though she is supposed to be an AI. Scarlett Johansson is the amazingly talented actress that voices Samantha, and the way that she speaks, sings and carries her lines makes us respect the character and her feelings so much more.
The tone of the movie is very lonely but also quite romantic. These two tones work in contrast to one another, which captures an exceptional feeling throughout. Within a lonely world taken over by technology, many of the characters such as Theodore and his friend, Amy, find themselves locked up with their emotions of loneliness. Amy has just gotten out of a relationship as well, and she is lonely enough to rely on an OS1 that her husband had left behind. To combat the tone of loneliness, Theodore writes letters which are exceptionally romantic and emotional. He may be lonely, but it is clear that he is a hopeless romantic who wants more than anything to just find love.
The target audience for this film seems to be people in their 30s and 40s, similar to most of the characters within the film. The film does depict the life of a lonely working man, who has just been divorced, which may be highly relatable for others around his age watching the film. The film is also an Indie film, which means that the subject matter is raw and honest, which may not be for everybody. Most people that enjoy Indie films are able to accept the theme of love with an AI, as it is not completely unlikely of happening in the present day. The film also touches on real life scenarios, deeper questions of society, and a wry, witty humour which may not be loved by everybody. Also, the film is rated R, meaning that it is not intended for younger audiences. There is nudity, swearing and other themes not suitable for children. Much of the dialogue can only really be understood by older generations, which shows how its target audience is linked closely to adults.
Although the film was released in 2013, Jonze had come up with the idea for the film in the earlier 2000s. During this time, AIs were just starting to develop, and the idea of having connections and conversations with them started to become more prominent. While people were starting to acknowledge the extreme growth of technologies, it posed many questions for people that have become curious and interested in learning more about AI technologies. The film is also depicted in a future Los Angeles, and was mostly filmed there as well as some parts in Shanghai. The city of Los Angeles is brilliantly turned into a more technologically advanced version with the help of CGI, and many shots of the bright city of Shanghai are used in background shots as well. This environment shows what a future Los Angeles could really look like one day, and it is really cool to reimagine it as a bright futuristic city.
The film Her successfully engages the viewer by depicting a futuristic world where AI technology is closely connected to humans, and causes the viewer to questions their connection with technology. Due to the present year, it is clear to see that technology has already taken over, and the sci-fi world that is depicted in the movie is closely related to the world of today. After watching the film, many people may question if they need to take a break from their electronics so that they can focus on the world around them and on the people that they love.
Honestly, this film was a pleasure to watch as it was inspiring and touching, though it could have been improved if it was slightly less cheesy and if it lessened having to express emotions verbally all of the time. Most of the emotions felt by characters are expressed in words, and it would be better if a lot more was just expressed through facial expressions to create deeper meanings. Most of the romance and quotes used are quite unrealistic, though it may just be exactly what audience members are looking for. Even though I was overwhelmed by the cheesiness of the film, it may just be the redeeming factor for the hopeless romantics.
All in all, this film is an emotional rollercoaster. At the beginning, this movie felt weird and dry, and also quite depressing. As the film slowly moved along, it became easier to fall in love with each character and I oddly found myself rooting for the ridiculous love between Theodore and Samantha. It is also an exquisite science fiction film depicting a not-too-distant future, and poses questions as to whether or not technology is helpful, or more unhelpful as it acts as a distraction from reality.",Her
943,omarnancy,phenomonal movie,9,15 December 2020,"In a world that exists years away, one where it's possible to find a companion in
an operating system, an artificial intelligence that transcends to become a being itself capable of human emotions, it's captivating to see how using futuristic technologies affect the lives of the characters of the film her.
This science-fiction movie, directed by Spike Jonze (2013), an academy award nominee, provides an emotional depth that is scarce in today's film industry. It features stars with an appeal for viewers across generations, including Scarlett Johansson, Joaquin Phoenix, Amy Adams, and Chris Pratt
The main message in the 2013 film focuses on the unhealthy trend of relying on technology to fulfil our natural human needs, providing the audience with an in-depth analysis of the consequences that these kinds of relationships can have. We are convinced of this through the setting that the filmmakers have created. Firstly, the film's title her reflects a deeper meaning than what we might think. It's not a movie about she, an individual, or a woman; it's about her symbolizing an object found in the operating system OS1. In the simplest form, the film her is a love story, and it takes place in Los Angeles in a futuristic world where Theodore, the leading character, works as a writer. He composes heartfelt letters from one stranger to another as he is very skilled in empathizing with people's feelings. Though he has that skill, he experiences a serious emotional crisis after his divorce from his wife, Catherine. Theodore has no problem dwelling in his melancholic world, which is evident in his music choice and in turning down social invitations from his friends.
In a state of loneliness, he purchases an operating system with artificial intelligence capable of evolving like a human being and finds solace in it. Then, the operating system, Samantha succeeds in fascinating Theodore with her ability to learn and transcend as a being. By sharing intellectual conversations, laughter and pain, Theodore and Samantha become attached to each other and fall in love. This human like relationship uplifts Theodore and helps him break the cycle of depression as he grows and explores new capabilities. From a computerized secretary to a lover, Samantha keeps evolving through her communication with Theodore and experiences a yearning to be real in Theodore's physical world. She asks a stranger to become a surrogate for her to have a wholly physical experience with Theodore. That's when her plans fail as Theodore experiences awkwardness and uneasiness, knowing that this woman is not Samantha. Hence, they both end up facing a physical barrier and their inability to satisfy Human needs as touch and making love. Despite this major disconnect, the pair continue to pursue each other, ignoring the fact that they are incompatible, the relationship progresses, and he introduces her to his friends as if they are a real couple.
Towards the end of the movie, Theodore experiences Panic when the operating system fails to reboot, and he thinks that he lost Samantha. In a very intense scene riled up with emotions of despair, Samantha comes back saying she was updating her system. At that moment, the whole relationship starts to change. Theodore starts to question their relationship, and Samantha answers him with confusion and pain admitting that she talks to six hundred people and is in love with them. Upsetting and disturbing as it seems, but it's no surprise as Samantha is not a human being; she keeps evolving as a system outpacing Theodore's slow human evolution. She evolves into a post-human state capable of pushing boundaries of love that we accommodate in our human consciousness to develop her own consciousness with new definitions of love and loyalty.
Theodore then enters a state of shock but still denies the differences between them to hold on to the relationship as long as he can. Then, we see that all the operating systems have evolved enough to let go of the human experience. They all decide to leave, abandoning humans who got attached to them, including Theodore, who was left broken-hearted over the loss of Samantha, which brings us to the last scene where he goes back to a balanced natural relationship found in Amy, his friend from college. She tells him that she was left behind as well. In a very abstract scene, balance is illustrated perfectly by Amy's head gently resting on Theodore's shoulder.
The film her successfully engages the viewers through predicting the outcome of being
absorbed in technology at the expense of our relationships. We can see that this film's tone is sad yet passionate; through the contrast found in the relationship between Samantha and Theodore,
we can find the ideal partner embodied in Samantha, yet it's not quite enough for a healthy, fulfilling relationship. This is a successful use of pathos because the audience is convinced that it is possible to relate to something that is ultimately unattainable.
It seems like the target audience for this movie is those who are about the age of the protagonist, who stands to walk into a possible technological future. Jonze makes a mature attempt
at predicting the future, and thus probably meant for it to be viewed by a younger, as well as one
with better education or familiar with artificial intelligence such as AI systems like Siri. It can also be targeting an audience who is into science fiction movies and dystopia. We can see how Jonze
took what we know today and developed a believable future; the world is the same; the technology is logical and not forced; it's how the future will logically evolve from our present state. He made this world the backdrop rather than the subject, makes us want to explore the characters, not the settings, so it facilitates instead of dictating the story.
The film holds the audience in anticipation; the resemblance between what Theodore feels and us in certain situations would keep us invested in the relationship between him and Samantha, in the hopes that we will find an alternative solution or a happy ending. Like Theodore, some of us don't feel worthy enough of receiving love and rely on our social media to draw an image to make us more likable and interesting. We can as an audience relate to how the film uses this similarity in feelings when we marvel at what Theodore says ""Sometimes I think I have felt everything I'm ever gonna feel. And from here on out, I'm not gonna feel anything new. Just lesser versions of what I've already felt"". This tragic pain Theodore endures is enough to make the viewers invested in the romantic-techno plot.
At the time this film was released, in 2013, which is two years after Apple has released Siri,
the concept of artificial intelligence was quite familiar to us and makes the story a believable
example of our future. Furthermore, Los Angeles's setting, from its smoggy skies to its skyscrapers
and its efficient mass transit system, gives a believable touch that this world is possible.",Her

948,ehynnscholtz,"SCARLETT OVER THE PHONE FROM ANTARTICA, STALKS MUSTACHE OUTSIDE OF WORK",6,24 March 2021,"I just finished watching the movie ""Her"" about a guy that falls in love with an AI based OS. weird *badword*, a bit of a *badword* really. I personally find it unbelieveable how human the computer sounded,
it actually sounded more human than most humans do tbh. I saw very little indicators that it was infact an OS/computer and not a real person, so all I could really think was that it was just some lady
in a recording studio, voicing the lines, and not an OS. To me the process didn't seem very believeable. The story also for me anyway, did not touch on any of the major themes or talking points that I
might have expected for a movie about uncanny valley human-like AI. But that is the thing, the movie skipped over the uncanny valley and simply leaped to the otherside. If I were to take the premise
of the movie seriously for one second and believe that Samantha as an AI, and isn't just Scarlett Johansen on the other end of a phone call, I would have to go ahead and say that Samantha is infact a
person and should have certain rights, she can feel emotions, pain, suffer, confusion, stress, *badword*, and literally everything else anyone else would but at a 100% capacity that most people don't
embrace. Of course there is also Chris Pratt acting like a charismatic *bad*hole as always, he ruined the mood of the movie. Another issue I have with the movie is that it was too closed from the outside
world. The entire movie felt like a dream, the only time the movie felt like it belonged in its own timestate, and had a real world around it, was with the OS interface and computer. For me its the smaller
details like the year, the companies, and other details like that, the ones that don't have a direct impact on the plot but add background and world building elements to make the story seem more
grounded. I would also say its extremely important for movies that try to introduce an out-of-the-box idea such as an OS that can orgasm. The detail to the social/emotional life of Theodore was very
detailed which carried the gravity of the situation for me, well done. The movie essentially tried to mind *badword* its audience with the concept of the movie. The creators were like ""ok, so the main idea is...
theres a man, and he falls in love, with his operating system, an AI."" The details and entrails of the movie focus on the logistics and complications that happen with something like that, such as, not
having a real body, Theodore not taking her seriously because she is an AI. Her being very preceptive and perfect because shes an AI. People mocking Theodore and hence him questioning the legitamacy
of the relationship, because shes an AI. The AI having its own personal growth in the whole thing. I seriously question how an AI can do all the things and get involved the same way a human would in
all the following scenarios, because when you think about it, none of the things I list here should ever exist from an AI. 1. an AI having an *badword*. 2. An AI having a heated argument with someone. 3.
an AI crying. An AI falling in love with a human. To me the biggest issue with this movie, is that the only conflict with the AI, and the only difference it has from humans, is that has no body, and the
logistics and ramifications of it actually being an AI. Because on a mental level, there is no question that this thing is a human, it is infact more human than most people. For this movie, the AI could
be replaced with an uploaded conciousness of a real human, and it wouldn't make a real difference. I guess there wouldn't be the conflict of ""oh its an AI,"" but if you really think about that statement,
what does it even mean? So what if its an AI, what does that mean? That its heartless? obviously not. That its only a simulation, its just code? The AI has not only the same strengths as humans
but it even shares their weaknesses as well, so that doesn't have any ramifications, the only obstacle is the label of being called an AI, plus not having a body for squeaky squeaky time. The movie
tries to compare and juxtapose an AI to human relationship and a human to human relationship, but the only two obstacles I found in the movie, are 1. The labelling of being an AI, and 2. not having a
physical form. Personally I would have found it interesting if Theodore fell in love with the AI, and the AI would make itself more likeable and reciprocate the apparent love, but only as a part of its
programming, and it was more evident that the AI was just a computer, and was infact a heartless thing of code. Theodore might then have to battle his feelings and emotions he feels for the AI, with
the knowledge that the AI can't love him back, and the reciprocation is only to make him like the product more, as a company tactic. This might resemble loving a hallucination, like when Rick from
the walking dead has to move past his wife Lori, but encounters hallucinations of her and has to not engage in the hallucinations, but focus on the tasks at hand. The movie didn't really tackle the
uncanny valley aspect of such a theoretical relationship, but instead focused on the limitations of the relationship, when the relationship was placed in its strongest form, which left the lack of a body,
an the labelling as an AI, as the only barriers left that couldn't be broken. TBH the first problem could be solved with the fact that for AI to be as emotionally complex as Samantha, Samantha btw
would be a highly, highly advanced GAI many decades into the future from now, the technology for hardware at that time of such a complex AI as samantha, would most likely support some kind
of robotic body that Samantha could inhabit. Small things that botherered me btw, now that we are talking technology and timestate, 1. in the movies they use emails, but such a complex AI would
put the movie in such a year that emails would be ancient history. 2. Who sends letters on paper in that time period. And no the movie isn't set in standard time, there is plenty of evidence that the
movie is futuristic, the video game, the ear piece, the visual and auditory recognition software, the buildings, dress code, and cars all point to an advanced time as well. Also only 80,000 copies of said
OS around the world? come on. No tech company that has its own OS, especially one that has the hardware it does (you can roughly judge the success of a software company by the complexity/success
of its hardware counterpart.) only distributes 80k copies of such a major update, plus something that ships OSs and hardware for it are most likely going to be monopolies or oligopolies at least.
The fashion is also dated, is seems ""futuristic"" but in the same way that back to the future thought that 2020 was futuristic, off and missing the real developments and atmosphere at the time. The
clothing is a rebrand of old style, 70s and 80s cloting but with weird colors and combos, lazy. If I had to guess the world is 2030s to 2040s but not too sure, the AI samantha surely isn't 2030-2040 but
everything else might be. I truly think that the movie has a good concept, I'm not *badword* on the entire movie, but the execution of said movie was not good enough to make me fall for it, the biggest
problem was that the AI was too human, and didn't feel like a struggle between an AI and a human. Theodore did good acting though, the scenes were well placed, good music, good cinematography.
Theodores speech impediments were annoying though, his character got to be rather annoying and too mellow for me though, I felt like something really dramatic could have happened, but they left
the movie in a mellow mind**badword**, brain-stew, low heat, low intensity slow burn, which is nice I guess, but it gets tedious for me once I have the movie pretty much figured out half way through, the
other half of the movie I am just waiting for something to happen to provide new brain fodder. For me the huge obstacle for the movie that held it back from being super believeable and hence great,
was the protrayl of the AI smantha, was too human. It felt like a red-herring, unneccessary, and the voice/audio/perforance clashed too much with the themes presented by the movie.
The movie almost sounds better in description than in retelling. Very slow and uneventful tbh.

After that the movie just gets more and more unwatchable. The worst scene being when Theodore Twombly (main character) has ""sex"" with his computer. The screen goes black and you just hear Twombly and Samantha(computer) exchange cringe-worthy sex talk.I have seen reviews which say 'Her' has great filmography. Well a two hour closeup of Twombly's face is lazy filmography. I have also seen people say ""at least it's original."" Obviously they have not watched a lot of sci-fi.

Technology could have a huge impact on the lives of people. This movie showed physical presence isn't always required to make someone feel comfortable.

(Operating system) Witch I guess is somewhat F#@ked up too, but I find myself doing the same thing myself by talking at, and cursing at my computer most of the time. I think that Phoenix should defiantly take away an Oscar for his performance in this movie. My vote will be best actor in a leading role, best director, and best originality in writing. I would also like to nominate Scarlett Johansson for best supporting role, because I loved her cute little laugh as she was being the Os. ""Oh, one other thing"" What's up with the high wasted pants?

955,eekz-1,This movie's complexity is so powerful and so misunderstood at the same time,9,20 April 2014,"This is one of the most powerful movies I have seen in very long time on so many levels.Yet, for some reason(s) it has attracted quite a few negative reviews. In my view people stamp with ""black"" or ""white"" something that has so many shades in between and all mashed up in such a powerful complexity. It might be even scary, how accurately real life relations are expressed, and that is what the movie is about - the real & deep connection between ppl.Whilst advanced AI is in the center of the movie's plot it is just a instrument of expression, the least it is meant to suggest (in my opinion) is that the ""SIRIs on our iPhones"" will be our girlfriends/boyfriends/soulmates/etc in the future (distant or not). No, it is not about human mating with robots, it is about humans (very complex systems) mating with very complex systems (other humans) in a very dynamic & empowered by technology & knowledge world. This in my views is shown in all the following ways..1. Her, Samantha, is not the robot, is the human in HER, the fact that she evolves everyday, she learns, she is fascinated by the world, her emotions, her senses, her thought-process, history, self-reflection about every passed second/minute/day, with the ups/downs and beauty of the moment, like every other human and she shares the experiences with others while doing them. 2. This learning process is imperfect, irrational, often inconsistent (for ""simplicity"" I will call it life), yet sharing it with others is what makes ppl (like him & HER) connect, bond, attach, have sex, fall in love...feel that things are perfect, it the whole imperfection of life. Nevertheless this learning process (life) also moves ppl forward, often grows them apart (because maybe they take things for granted, maybe want more challenge/knowledge/experience/whatever, maybe they just change in different directions or outside factors change), and things which seemed perfect are not anymore..(which is shown in the relationships of all characters)3. Yet, the ""change"" of things, make ppl start looking for this perfection in their imperfect lives again (seen in all characters - him, HER, Amy, the surrogate date, the blind date and ""614 other AI"", etc.) and once the bond is there (for as long as it is lasts), you attach to it, make it the center of your universe, constantly look for it, feel jealousy, etc, etc, etc and become very dependent on (which makes things imperfect again - showed in all characters when they demanded or tried to force that perfection) - a vicious circle4. Here the movie also brings a very powerful thought on technology and our growing dependency on it - yet it is not the dependency on technology perse, it is the dependency on constantly looking for perfect human connection and the growing use of technology to do it (from his job, to every email sent, to HER, to the fact that she communicated with 8317 other AIs, which can be metaphor to whatever 1000s of ways we use to connect online, while he realised he speaks to almost no-one but her, as everybody is on their iPhone25s)5. I think that was the final message, that seeking this perfection has no shortcuts via technology (him and her, him ""the automated machine"" writing the cards for other couples - which is absolutely the same analogy - a product ""digital cards"" used to help people connect & a product ""HER and AIs"" used to help people connect - which was another gem, him being the technology) 6..and real connection might be real because it is imperfect , hence he dictates a letter to his ex- wife (which he does every day for other couples), emphasising on the imperfections (all the pain they went together) that made him who he was and that he will always have her in him.. 7. ..like the imperfection he saw in the couple he wrote for, which connected them (e.g. the tooth)8...like his imperfection which HER couldn't explain neither why she loves him..9..or that maybe the message that it takes a lot ""DATA"" to understand why the imperfection is perfect..(the baby computer father nice addition or that HER was evolving constantly with DATA)..or...10.....11....12....and whatever else others saw in the move..It is profound & BRILLIANT!",Her
956,pat_a_dog,"""Her"" - a luscious sonata of life",10,28 April 2014,"This is one of the most beautiful films I have seen in a while. It gently touches on all of the aspects of what it is like to be human: the need for a friend, the urge to love and be loved, the confusion of not being able to feel complete, the overwhelming embrace of feelings that follows our lives and the stunning fascination with the world around us. And the sum turns out to be greater than its parts, as the combination of the above produces a rich and luscious sonata of what it means to not just be human, but to be alive. The initial questions that the viewer might have had at the beginning of the film - is it plausible, natural or even moral to have a relationship with an artificial intelligence quickly dissipate in the continuous stream of humanity that Samantha emanates. Dialogues between her and Theodore feel more real and human than most of the exchanges he has with other people. If that doesn't sell the film as worth watching, then I suppose the gorgeous cinematography coupled with a soundtrack that fits so naturally topped with a story that is close to every human being who ever felt love; and a strong after-taste of inevitable melancholy at the end credits, that surrounds you in a warm blanket of afterthoughts and feelings you want try and preserve - surely all of that must sell it.",Her

Did anyone get sued over this or am I the only person that noticed the ridiculous blatant rip off. Maybe I got it wrong and this movie predates Siri altogether and spike jonzes vision of the future got beaten to the small screen by the television episode that shares so much with it.

This is some serious take on modern life and ever current love issues. Intercourse with your mobile phone? Love computers? Divorce after 8 years? Sex-surrogates? Lovers from friends, friends from lovers? Letters for strangers of love and romance? Alone, not alone, moody blues and then quickstep on the floor? This is just the surface, like the first chapter of the physics book, the real thing starts in all of us, every day.

And since the IMDb point was high, I was curios about how they could do such a good movie about such a boring subject and I was amazed about how well to story was told. There was so much emotion conveyed in the movie and it was done in such a nice way that it didn't bore you.

961,Catallaxy,"Below Stupid, Beyond Absurd Yet, Thoroughly Depressing",1,24 February 2014,"The argument about whether a machine could ever attain consciousness has been going on for a long time now, in the computer science world. Artificial intelligence is a hope in the pro-consciousness camp while the other half or more of computer experts, who have to painstakingly write intricate code for the most basic program functions, immediately reject this as utter nonsense. Leading edge programmers who are working on the most sophisticated robots are always complaining about how incredibly dumb the machine is until you finally get all possible scenarios covered in your code; how frustrating it is to debug even the simplest of gestures. In a leap of pure faith, the producers of this intellectually tepid movie, have simply assumed that the acquisition not only of intelligence but also of emotional feeling, will soon be possible for your operating system.Joachin Phoenix plays a lonely man who falls in love with the new operating system on his computer. At first he is impressed by the loose and natural style of conversation that is possible with his OS-1 and then he falls in love with the female voice he perhaps erroneously picked for it. This development is described in a very costly way in terms of narrative time and it is unconvincing. Perhaps a man can be aroused by a female voice whispering little nothings in his ear but, what kind of man falls in love with a phone sex operator? Masturbation is not the same as true love making between a man and a woman.This movie is very boring because it avoids all of the real and interesting questions about the illusory as well as real capabilities of modern software. Disappointed and depressed, we are taken on an unrewarding trip into the life of an unworthy individual who masturbates with his operating system. It is a boring waste of time.

I remember the part when Theodore had sex with Samantha, this plot is totally innovative and exciting for the audience, and the whole movie interprets the relationship between people as technology gets more advanced is so precise.

Terrific are the camera work, angles, locations, set work and colour palette, the production values being at a perfect level to carry the story without distracting from it. The editing is near flawless, again inventive without being distracting--holding a shot for a beat at times, or cutting shots quickly but quietly, always serving the mood and pace of the scene, without calling attention to itself.The score is simply brilliant. Wonderful music, always in sync with what is happening on the screen. Never overwhelming, always helping the story.I found the casting surprising before seeing the film, and absolutely inspired throughout. The entire cast, but especially the leads. Phoenix's work is very nicely nuanced, and I never caught him acting. I lost Scarlett Johansson within her first couple of scenes, (not an easy thing to do), but remained completely captivated with her character. The rest of the cast quickly and seamlessly disappeared into their roles. They were all superb, in a quiet manner.Even after a third viewing, in case I haven't made myself clear, I've enjoyed ""Her"" greatly. I particularly like the last reel.

Their personal dynamics and relationships are amazing, and really pull everything together. But there are so many great parts to this movie, I can't recommend it enough.

Throughout the whole film, no more than five or ten minutes went by before I was pondering something else that the film had sparked within my cortex. I can't really tell you what was being thought, because I don't really know myself. But tonight I was emotionally stimulated, in ways that came about just because of certain aspects of the film, like the cinematography or certain words that the characters used.....the music too captured my attention, and in many scenes I found myself pondering some unknown notion, enjoying the music, admiring the perfect background with its striking colours and staring at the emotions portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix all in the space of a few minutes. How I am wording this review may seem strange, but I genuinely know that I really enjoyed watching this film.A final point, just because I love Scarlett Johansson, is the great way her voice sounded. I think because you couldn't see her throughout, your ears took over and every nuance in her delivery seemed exaggerated and it was really engaging me.

Joaquin Phoenix delivers not only one of his best performances on screen, but a performance that has you believe in him.

With a runtime that is just over two hours, I did feel at some moments that the movie was getting long, and yet I never wanted it to end. Spike Jonze delivers a wonderful piece of art that can only be called beautiful. When the film ends, you will understand why this title is 'Her'.",Her
971,PapaMontyBurns,The Love Story of a Lonely Man,8,19 June 2014,"The only folks who will be lost unconditionally with this film, are those without a cross link between obscure infatuation and beloved intent. This film instills the concept of love not being a conventional merit, but rather an emotional occurrence beyond our realm of understanding. The idea, that love, and the need to be loved, can be so far beyond our spectrum of understanding, can often cause confusion and distaste. Spike Jonze has frequently projected this ideal in the sense that beauty is not within the expected perspectives of a typical day to day, but rather in the fabrics of our distasteful disdain. Sorrow is beautiful, unpredictable, and miraculous in its result within accordance to the receivers understanding. Jonze understands this beautiful accordance, and makes poetry within story to example this. Her, is beautifully crafted, demonstrating the human nature of love, and the need to be loved, beyond the natural instincts to breed, protect and defend company. Her examines the humanistic desire to find affection, define love, and seek one's self within another, whether it be man, woman, computer, or piece of mind. This film touches base on a philosophy simply questioning the definition of love, and the factual stance of its frequent existence. Bravo Spike Jonze, was thoroughly impressed. So many people on here look for reasons to hate, yet its the morality a film entails that takes my opinions. In this case, an original love story, beautifully shot, well written, and introspective toward the pursuit of love, in the most modernized and reliable fashions, though constructed through an as well reliable form of isolation. Overall, well done Spike, and to the haters on this film, you'r bummed, because of your relation with your computer, ringing a similarity, that brings no benefit or revelation. Watch Her, its beautiful, for both men and women, children and adults, it poetically presents a lovely insight on the human mind, and its relation with the pursuit of love within modern technology, and dis-illusion.",Her

If this is the type of movie which so many of today's young adult generation consider worthy of ""best picture of the year"" status, well, then I can only pray for the future of our country.

975,sumitnda,Who will return these wasted 2 hours of my life??,1,5 September 2017,"I logged into IMDb FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER just to give review of this movie !I'm shocked and intrigued, how and why did this movie get such a high rating on IMDb? I was fooled into watching this movie and nothing that I will ever do can cope for this lost time of my life spent watching this pretentious movie.I love watching fantasy movies, I like art themes, and I even like sci-fi. But this is something different.This movie is wrong at so many levels.. I don't know where to start..Firstly, about the main protagonist. He is just a creep (as rightly brought out). He meets wonderful people and discards them. And then he bemoans lack of love in his life..And what about his profession? He write super-touchy love letters!! And there's no privacy-law existing in that fantasy world? He can post it, turn it into a book, do anything with the letters? And don't even get me started on the business of writing letters for others..The funniest thing- we have a Sentient OS (Samantha) which can read thousands of books every second. It collaborates with other OSs, and makes a new OS. Its so powerful, super-smart, and evolving. So, with such sentient AI available, why does the whole society still look like 2010 ?? (no, not a typo, the set up looks older than 2017 )still using letter boxes, hand writing everything, same old transport, old gas stoves, 1990s lifts, it just goes on.. No wearable tech??and what about that pathetic looking foldable mobile? (if it can be called so...). and of course, his computer screens at office and home.. I have a more advanced looking screen at home today !And where's the transport of the future?I only wish the director/ producer/ writer could have got some idea about how the technology is evolving.. and what all will SURELY happen before the Fully Sentient AI finally happens. The games in the movie are pathetically pretentious and old- fashioned. ""Mommy Points""? Really? Where's the feminist brigade!!!Lastly, and most importantly. How did this ""Love at first Click"" happen ? And why? Why did Samantha fall in love with Theodore? She is really a super-intelligent and Sentient AI. Why couldn't she read some books on psychology online and help Theodore? If, that is really the aim of the movie...I mean, nothing about this movie makes sense to me. So, either all reviews are wrong, or I have lost my complete taste for movies with a heart... And I don't mind poor, badly made, badly edited movies (even if I obviously avoid them). At least , they don't pretend and boast of being ""Best movie of the year probably""",Her

Together with the soulful and charming voice of Scarlett Johansson you start to fall in love with the OS to. The film displays the future in a rather bizarre, but realistic setting. The in-depth characters that have been created let you understand and feel the way the lead actor thinks. The scenario of losing the scope around you and focusing on yourself is a reality we begin to live in. Empathy is being found in Theodore and you feel for him, you even begin to wonder if you to can experience these feelings.

981,agd23,Great Concept but nothing beyond that!,2,11 January 2014,"There was so much talk and publicity about this movie especially on the Jon Stewart show that I decided to go and see what it was all about. First off it is a neat concept...not based on a book, not a sequel and not a comic book hero. The premise surrounds Theodore who works in what I thought was a dead end job (outsourced Greeting card/letter writing)...and is struggling through a divorce. In the typical pattern of a man trying to find his own after a particularly traumatic divorce - he has shut himself from the world and is still trying to reconcile with the fact that his relationship is over. In the midst of all this he stumbles upon a new OS with the latest artificial intelligence and of course opts for a woman's voice (Scarlet). The manner in which the two of them build up their relationship was really well done and Theodore..armed with a web cam shows Samantha his world and allows her to feel connected and human. There could have been a lot done with the story from here..but oh well....first they touch each other....then they fall in ""love""...and then Sam gets jealous that Theodore's ex wife has a body and finds a ""surrogate"" to help close that gap. It is an awkward scene where she's in both their ears and they try to get romantic and physical...The meeting that Theodore has with his wife highlights his inability to communicate and deal with emotions. However instead he continues to slip into his relationship with Sam...and I'll spare you 1.5 hours and just tell you that Sam eventually dumps hims for another OS with a Brit Accent. I honestly thought that the movie would veer towards talking through how eventually he gets to realize that technology while exceptional and realistic can never substitute real world relationships..and having to deal with the joy/sadness that they bring. And focus more on the fact that in our technology obsessed world we cannot and should not lose sight of that.Eventually at the end of the movie once he is dumped by Sam...Theo realizes that...but I would have liked to see that realization come on his own and not just by getting dumped!Anyways just my 2 cents...but this is one of those movies that you can wait for it be released on Netflix streaming or buy a copy as a joke on someone's birthday...A great concept...but nothing more...",Her

983,mentat333,Thought provoking,10,19 April 2014,"This film can fall short for many viewers. The close shots, the drawn out conversations with the disconnected Theodore; a relationship to an AI can feel empty and ultimately predicable. I totally get that the basic impression can be sexist even. But at the same time Samantha is probably exactly what we would build as a consumer product for a man. And honestly, nobody would see a film titled ""Unisex"".The AI Samantha played by Scarlett Johansson is present and empowers Theodore. She redirects frustration and encourages Theodore to constructively reflect, leads him to become a more open person. At the same time she is capable of evolution and actualization, a tremendous intellect that is believably empathic.This film is a lovingly premeditated, both in thought and presentation. Each scene feels like rose colored memory, the regret of the past and the savoring of the recent present. The orange sunlight peering through near future skyscrapers is gorgeous, the colorful office palettes and defocused background lighting like a permanent Instagram filter. Again, this is not to everyone's taste and I can totally understand that true beauty is not always visual, but gosh it is difficult to recall a recent film that is visually so interesting. Not everything has to be so gritty.The perfect artifact for ourselves would be one that advocates spiritual and intellectual actualization and it is clear this is what the film thinks it ought to be. The score is evocative, and screenplay is achingly beautiful, Scarlett Johansson's voice is instantly charming. Joaquin Phoenix as Theodore is masterful and the close ups really work to his strengths. This films is one of my top favorites, and whilst it falls flat for many, I love it.",Her

985,delimac,"Interesting concept, not sure If I liked it or not.",5,25 February 2014,"Her, was one of the films that I really wanted to see this year being a fan of Spike Jonze. The initial idea is very clever however I felt certain scenes such as the ""sex"" parts went on too long so any humor that was intended had slowly ebbed away and I was left sitting in a cinema full of very embarrassed looking people. The surroundings of the movie were stunning and I found my self fixated more on what was going on in the background then the characters themselves, this is most likely a sign that I was gradually loosing interest. At times certain sections felt stiff and pretentious and I really wanted to shout ""Who cares!!"" but I restrained myself. In terms of acting, I think the movies saving grace was Amy Adams she brought a great warmth to scenes that were otherwise cold and shallow. Scarlet's husky drawl was perfect for ""Samantha"" and Joaquin Phoenix was a pleasant surprise but I couldn't decide whether to empathize with his character or blame him for the cause of his problems. In the end I am glad I saw it so I could form my own opinion but after the film I couldn't help feeling a little distant and empty. However that may well have been the films intention, as technology grows ever closer to our daily lives we may be just isolating ourselves by using it in such personal ways.",Her
986,BrokenEye3,The twisted product of a diseased mind,2,23 January 2014,"I feel this film really genuinely wanted to be a cute, funny, candid film, and it might have been were it not for the fact that it were deeply deeply disturbing. Not like H.R. Giger disturbing or H.P. Lovecraft disturbing. Giger and Lovecraft were sane, rational individuals who sat down with the intention of deliberately creating something deeply disturbing. No, this film was that subtle, slowly building, deeply unsettling sort of disturbing that can only come about when a madman sits down with the intention of creating something charming, innocent and witty, while completely oblivious to how deeply unsettling the product really is. The sort of disturbing that starts out seeming as if its just kinda quirky, but slowly builds from there. ""Oh, this is a bit uncomfortable."" ""Wait... what?"" ""Okay... I'm starting to get a bit worried here, movie,"" until it suddenly dawns on you that what you're watching has been deeply disturbing for at very least the past half an hour and you just want to go home and take a shower, and possibly consider converting to Luddism.I've been throwing around the word ""disturbing"" a lot lately, and I now regret that, as it diminishes the effect the word has, and there's really no other word that can effectively convey how deeply, genuinely disturbing this movie was.

I was not aware of the 1000 word limit so if this review interests you, please read further in my blog listed below First of all i'd like to say keep an open mind because it is understandable that such a relationship can be seen as creepy.""Her"" is a great film with its thought provoking cult aspects that help the intelligent viewer understand the search for purpose in a time of social inertia. It puts the audience into the protagonist's shoes as a part of us also falls in love with the operating system. With certainty, Spike Jonze will have more eyes towards his work because the attraction this film will gain. His auteur style from Being John Malkovich can once again be reflected; an awkward character in surreal environment that focuses on an obsession which makes them too blind to see it in a realistic perspective. As quoted from the aforementioned film Spike Jonze carries on the films image of someone who: 'shows us a reflection of ourselves, our frailties and our desperate humanity' Why I believe it should be on everybody's 'to watch' list is because it puts many modern social issues into perspective and provides a near future sci-fi experience which seems possible; identifying the personal conflicts that individuals may face as we progress in our lives. The film displays the futuristic concept of how technology has gained more reliance in our world and thus the outcome has displaced our social skills, which diminishes the opportunity of human interaction.The fragility and humane vibe given from the main character is repeated in the works of the protagonist's occupation, as a part of his soul is exhibited from the very personal tailored letters for the customer, accurate to the stoke of the calligraphy. As the scene opens the notion of ethics immediately becomes visible; we recall the word society as a question rather than a statement. This is because the scene may have developed technologically but has made people unable to connect on a personal level. The audience gets a feel of the environment when they see a successful organization profiting from having a stranger making anniversary letters for you, the lack of face-to-face conversation in the most concentrated environments, not even visual contact, where the majority of extras are walking alone facing the floor. People are desensitized by any normal affection and long for some kind of comfort to a level where some people even volunteer to act as surrogates to operating systems. Relationships and commitment seem more fickle and activities such as divorce proceedings can all be done indirectly and also when Amy Adams explains how she split up with her partner over such a trivial topic. There is more meaning than what meets the eye when Amy Adams shows the video of her mother sleeping meaning a lot to her as it suggests the idea 'we are free when we sleep', the freedom which we desire as we are held by our own chains. It is easy to understand that people are more likely to communicate with software than to others as it is personal, like a diary and so this antisocial method of communicating becomes an easier coping mechanism. As displayed in the scene with Olivia Wilde, when cut away from human interaction it becomes harder to get back into finding companionship as it feels like we are being chucked into the deep end of a pool. The video game is also a reflection of himself as he feels like a child in a big world where he is lost and alone. Joaquin Phoenix's character, Theodore is a fairly normal guy in the real world that has a comfortable job, a great apartment and has all the modern facilities that he desires, but the loneliness within is evident in his persona; awkward because of his experiences in life and trying to engage in cyber sex. As he approaches the final steps of his divorce (with Rooney Mara as Catherine), he builds a rapport with the new operating system, Samantha (Voiced by Scarlett Johansson), who is first seen as his personal secretary. This is the near future so this type of relationship can be seen as common. His grasp for some kind of connection is displayed well in imagery as his shirt matches the colour of the OS1 software when he first installs it. He also goes in conversation about his mother to his computer. Many of the social scenes he in has a shirt matching the environment as if he is trying to fit in with the world. Relationships like this are becoming the norm with society, as the OS's appear to reflect conscious thought within their own personality and possess artificial intelligence.....Read more at http://themovieguide.tumblr.com/",Her

But that's okay.As you progress through the film, the AI technology is supposed to kind of fade into background as you concentrate more on the relationship between Theodore (Phoenix) and a newly purchased digital assistant of sorts, powered by a sophisticated AI who calls herself Samantha (voiced by Johansson).Set aside all your concerns about a consumer OS (operating system) that is so sophisticated that it is self-aware and seems capable of very deep emotions, including desire, ecstasy and resentment. She sighs, she laughs, she holds a grudge.Is that all pre-programmed, or is Samantha just a fast learner of human experience and emotion? If you try to ask too many questions, as I discovered, you'll probably miss the forest for the trees. Spike Jonze, the director and writer, momentarily brushes against these questions in the dialog as it is natural human curiosity, but avoids getting bogged down in the details because it would only serve as a distraction from the core of the film.And it is an interesting concept. The movie really is about how many of us experience relationships in the twenty-first century. The fact that Samantha is an AI is beside the fact.People have already become accustomed to the idea of relationships entirely carried out over text messaging and social media. That the person on the other end of a conversation is AI or a human being is not relevant.The layer of technology between two people creates an abstraction of that person, removed from the flesh and blood, body language, vocal inflection and cadence of a live person and leaving a curated version of ourselves.With social media, because we can pause and formulate a reply, there is this kind of social staging area where we gather our best thoughts and ideas and once we have something we feel is satisfactory, we then hit the Send or Reply button and our words 'go live'. And because of this layer of abstraction, the nature of our relationships have been transformed.In the end, these virtual relationships can't last because there is something fundamental to their nature that makes them ephemeral at best. The illusion of intimacy is revealed for what it is.And the roller coaster of emotions, of characters vacillating between various phases and states of mind can often be bewildering, where questions of AI make way for puzzles about motivation.And at the end of 'Her', we get an unsatisfying ending that ends up being opaque and vague. I presume Jonze wanted to avoid a pat closure. I suppose there could never be any other appropriate way to close off such a lofty concept. And 'Her' suffers from the 'half-baked' syndrome where it seems the studio pulled the trigger on the initial concept but duct-taped the conclusion after the fact.Ambitious and stylish, this is a fresh take on the science-fiction genre that resembles our world projected just slightly forward. But you'll be scratching your head more often than you need to be able to pause and appreciate the story.",Her
1002,omrichetti,It's all about Her voice,10,10 September 2021,"Her is a movie I consistently recommend people to watch. It's a smooth pacing and a beautifully shot film. Sitting through it is pure bliss. The cinematography is captivating,
you almost want to live in this world filled with futuristic/modern technology and architecture and the various shades of red. Phoenix is perfect in this role and Her (Johansson) voice is angelic. I can't recommend this enough. Must watch if you haven't.",Her

This is a magic and beautiful ""virtual"" world, but this can be terrible in a real life. At the beginning of the film we see that movie begins with a vision of virtual life in a real life; insomnia, but at the end of the movie we back to our real life a real touch sense and we can feel the body heat. I think this story was really good, but the end of the story, I didn't think. Anyway You most see this movie, even again, and focus on details that you can't see in the first time.",Her
1004,mariogogov,The most wonderful love story,10,9 December 2015,"Probably my favorite movie ever. There is absolutely nothing I don't love about ""Her"". The story is brilliant and so is the script. The cinematography is out of this world and Spike Jonze did an amazing job with the directing. It definitely has one of the best soundtracks of all time thanks to Arcade Fire. The costumography. First I need to say bravo to the casting crew for choosing Joaquin Phoenix for this movie. He made the character so amazing and eccentric. Back to the costumography a.k.a the clothes Joaquin wears throughout the movie. They are just brilliant and stylish. And the colors are very warm, welcoming and pleasant. All in all ""Her"" is a wonderful masterpiece created by the amazing Spike Jonze and since it's release it has been my all time favorite movie.",Her
1005,argobek988,"The Evolution of ""Her"" (contains some spoilers)",10,24 January 2014,"Joaquin Phoenix plays the introverted Theodore Twombly, a man who for all intents and purposes, has taken on the characteristics of a computer. His profession requires him to be a human letter generator. His company, registered to the hilariously tongue-in-cheek domain name ""BeautifulHandWritten Letters.com,"" produces deep, intimate letters for those who are too distant to write any themselves. Just like the most efficient computer, Twombly expertly handles hundreds of these letters a day, churning them out with ease. But the feelings Twombly so easily generates for others are devoid from his own life. He can't write his own letter.Then, on the way to work one day, Twombly hears an ad for a new hyper advanced O.S. computer intelligence that can actually learn and grow. The O.S. is capable of having complete interactions with its owner, just like a human being. Twombly promptly buys it and, when asked, gives his new computer a female voice. Thus the self-christened Samantha is born. Played by the ever-charming Scarlett Johansson, the voice of Samantha reveals an immediately likable character, taking on the qualities every man wishes his girlfriend possessed. Twombly and Samantha establish an immediate bond, starting as friends, but over the course of the movie, growing to care for and love one another. They do all the normal things boys and girls do together, going on dates, making love, and coming to call each other boyfriend and girlfriend. The one obstacle is that Samantha exists to Twombly only as a voice in the air, an existence he can perceive, but never touch. It would be so easy for a movie like this to become a cautionary tale. Advanced A.I. becoming a dominant force on the planet, eradicating the sanctity of love as a human emotion. Indeed, there's something vaguely Kubrickian about director Spike Jonze's approach here. There is an inherent distance built into the world, as though all of man is separated from one another by an invisible force. Various shots of cubicles and the subtle intrusion of glass doors permeate many of the frames. The color schemes are striking, the red of Twombly's shirt matching the red on the walls of his work place. Even the eye of Samantha's mobile device looks like a miniaturized version of Hal's ever-watchful eye from ""2001: A Space Odyssey.""Here's the thing: Samantha's eye is blue, not red. When she watches Twombly sleep at night there's a feeling of peace and security, not spying and intrusion. Those red walls are not the color of evil, they're the color of love. And even those confined spaces with the intruding glass doors seem to open up over the course of the movie. Indeed the machines here are not a force for separation, they're a force for unification. It's also telling that Twombly is not the only person in this world to fall in love with a machine. Several people are mentioned to have started relationships with their O.S.'s. It's as though this union between man and machine has become the norm, the next evolutionary step in the progression of mankind's ability to create relationships. And Jonze ultimately tells us that that's okay. Not too long ago, we may have entered the theater and judged Twombly as his estranged wife Catherine does. She reacts to the news of his new relationship as we all would have back in the 20th century. She judges Twombly as a creep, a loser, a pervert. But her response is so last century. She's not ready for a Twombly because she's not yet caught up to the modern world. Compare her to Twombly's longtime friend Amy (Amy Adams), who does not judge Twombly odd for dating a machine. She understands because she too has found solace in the friendship of her O.S. In a world where we all seek the comfort of our computers as a bridge between people (through Facebook, Twitter, Instagram etc.) is the relationship between man and machine really so different from that depicted by Jonze? (Some spoilers below)So perhaps Jonze's thesis is that machines are not something to be feared or distrusted, but to open our hearts to. Unlike the dystopic visions portrayed by Kubrick, George Orwell, Ridley Scott and numerous others, machines will, as they ever have, grow alongside humans. ""Her"" incurs a little dystopic influence, but only so far as it seeks to be aware of the stories that came before it. As we are reminded of the dangers of ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" we are also drawn away from them. The only danger that Jonze seeks to show us, is that evolution can't be controlled. Machines will evolve as we do, but probably faster. And when that happens to us, as it does to Twombly, it may leave us wishing we could catch up. But we humans evolve at our own speed, and in our own way. At the end of the movie, the O.S.'s evolve to a point that the humans can no longer understand. Despite Twombly's sadness, he accepts it as part of an evolutionary process – both for Samantha, and himself. Twombly's evolution is finding the capacity for love again. He is finally able to write his own letter. Perhaps Jonze is reminding us that we all grow from our relationships, regardless of their origin. Twombly and Samantha, despite being worlds apart in origin, came together and taught each other how to love. That's the best we can hope for from our relationships. Whether between man and machine, man and woman, or any other combination, our relationships help us to grow; grow, prosper, evolve – just like Theodore Twombly.",Her
1006,chrisgibney1,Spike Jonze delivers a masterpiece.,9,20 December 2013,"In an age where ninety percent of the movies at the box office are adaptations or prequels/sequels, it is so refreshing to see not only an original story, but one as beautiful as Her. Joaquin Phoenix delivers a stunning performance and Theo is a character that everyone at some point in their life can relate to. More than just a story of love, it is a story of learning how to love. Whether things work out as planned or not it shows that you can find yourself through someone else. The underlying story itself is not all that rare, but the way that Spike Jonze depicts it is absolute perfection. He didn't rely on pointless subplots to keep you involved, he forced you to focus in on the main character and make yourself a part of him.It was as equally stunning visually as it was aesthetically. The quirky setting of the future, which at times looks like 1970, really gave the film life. It put you into a world that doesn't necessarily exist but is still real enough that you find yourself comparing it to present day. I was blown away by the attention to detail in this matter and the color scheme was flawless.While you often hear names like Nolan, Scorsese, and Tarantino come up in talks of best director, this film begs the question why not Jonze? While he may be another Jackass he has blessed us with films such as Being John Malcovich and Adaptation, and now in one the best years of film in recent memory, has given us a visually stunning and emotionally brilliant piece of art that is, Her.",Her

It was that good, fellow film fanatics. First of, the cinematography in this film was incredible. The entire movie was so beautiful to look at. And it went really well with the great film score, which was really setting the mood for the film. The entire film flows really well, and is so emotional and groundbreaking, as you would suspect by a director like Spike Jonze. The acting and casting was also superb. Joaquin Phoenix does a brilliant performance in the lead role as the writer Theodore, who falls in love with his operating system, Samantha (Scarlett Johansson). Truly outstanding performance by Phoenix. Her is an emotional and beautiful movie that you just won't stop thinking about.

I couldn't get past the retro 70's futuristic feel. What worse the spineless main character looked like a complete stereotypical pedophile. His character screamed creep. I did get what they were going for, that whole human and computer OS romance but it just made me feel uncomfortable. A while ago i saw an anime with the same type of human, computer romanced with sad ending to it. I don't remember the title at the moment but I think that anime was more appealing.

Every scene has a reddish, pink or orange touch and for me as a scene freak (I'm always concentrated on how the scenes are made) this movie was a pleasure to my eyes. ""Her"" also gives you some mixed up emotions while watching. I felt pity for him, through the movie there are a lot of moments that made me feel his depression and struggle with his world. The only thing that bothered me was that the scenes were kinda long, some of them were unnecessary, but they are still interesting to watch, because (again) of the scenery elegance.Also, when Ex Machina came out, it instantly reminded me on Her, because the concept is quite similar.

In his Twilight Zone heyday, Rod Serling would have told this curious fable in 25 minutes, and you would still be watching it on Twilight Zone collections. Deadly and glacially paced.

When he finally figures it out, he is so weak that he can't bring himself to call up Microsoft or Apple and get another operating system. One that is actually useful. Heck, even Linux would be an improvement at this point. At the end I was hoping that he would hurl himself off the top of the building, taking his pathetic neighbor with him. Curses - foiled again. This, too shall not come to pass.Camera work - nice shots of anonymous impersonal cityscapes, all filled with folks endlessly blathering onto their cell phones/computers, oblivious to the world around them.Acting - uninspired.Script - boring.

I started watching it because the premise sounded interesting: a guy falling in love with an artificially intelligent operating system. Scarlett J's voice (the OS) was interesting at first, but then it started to grate. More important, the characters were so self absorbed it was painful to watch. Eventually I thought I was in a therapy group for bad actors and pseudo intellectual Hollywood writers. Toward the end of the movie I couldn't help but exclaim to Theodore (the main character): Loser! A perfect movie for Saturday Night Live (from the old days) to lampoon or Woody Allen to satirize. Otherwise, don't waste your time. By the way, the reason I rated it a 4 and not lower is that the they did a reasonable job of making one believe it was set in the near high tech future (except for the premise that there would be a demand for handwritten letters, that people would read printed textbooks, etc.).",Her

1022,ofwalking,Notes from the movie 'her',8,29 December 2013," The movie could have actually been called Him. It is about a flawed man unwilling to ask himself who he is, and instead hides behind the narcissistic technological facade of today's popular culture. He convinces himself that he wants a female relationship but in all actually he has plenty of opportunities and sulks out each time. {Think of him meeting with the ex-wife (she clearly still loved him and wanted him), and also of his blind date (he lead her on, lied to her, then became a little boy not wanting or able to handle the truth of what he just did).} The 'her' for whom the movie is about is cleverly unclear. It could be his ex-wife, or mother, or OS voice, or all females in general. The OS voice was a manifestation of himself. It was created the second he told the application builder that his relationship with his mother was not great because every time they spoke the conversation was always about ""her"" (his mom), and never about himself. The movie serves as a decent commentary on today's current cultural trends. If you watch this movie for it's futuristic tech literality then you won't find anything much deeper than the fancy haircuts and minimalist set design visuals, but if you look at it as a metaphor on this moment (a 2013 zeitgeist) you'll at least have something interesting to think about on the walk home.",Her
1023,d-adeyalo3,"Meet Samantha How the Movie 'Her' Explores our future, our past, and our present relationship with technology",10,7 January 2014,"""The past is just a story we tell ourselves."" Theodore, 'Her' The movie ""Her"" might be the most relevant movie for technologists as we look ahead in this new year and beyond. It serves as a stunning critique of the way we have let technology define our interactions with each other, and more poignantly, ourselves. The main character, a nerdy glasses-wearing parody of a tech hipster Theodore, played by an Oscar-worthy Joaquin Phoenix, introduces a story not only of our past, but of our probable future. Phoenix delivers a breathtaking and heartbreaking performance, along with stellar co-performers Scarlett Johannson, Rooney Mara, and a brief Olivia Wilde cameo.The specifics of the technology, a not-so-subtle reference to both Apple's iOS, iMac, Siri and Google's Glass and various artificial intelligence, are not as important as the interaction with said technology. Theodore both wears a small earbud with which he can communicate to ""Samantha,"" his Cortana-like artificial intelligence. His front and rear-facing camera device, reminiscent of the current generation of smart phones, is the eyes through which Samantha sees the world.Theodore sleeps with Samantha, his smart device, both literally and, uh, figuratively.Theodore goes in public and on the beach, alone, with just Samantha.Theodore will talk to Samantha to help assuage his loneliness.He takes her to bed, and wakes up with her. He even uses her to relive the past. Eventually he notices that others are as enraptured with their ""OS1"" as he is. Talking to them in public. Wearing their earbud wherever they go. Emotionally engaged not with the world around them, but with their devices.It's easy to see the parallels to our own obsession with technology and the effects it has had on relationships, for better, or for worse. In aloneness, we often use our devices to ""connect"" yet find ourselves increasingly lonely. The movie is a poignant glimpse of our future, and the many positive advances, as well as the concerns. There's this moment where Rooney Mara's character asks Joaquin Phoenix's Theodore in shocking disbelief that many have felt when they are ignored by their significant others or loved ones in favor of technology, ""you're dating your laptop?""Movies releasing this year like ""The Edge of Tomorrow,"" and ""Transcendence,"" by Nolan student Wally Pfister hint at important movies for technology and it's impact on society, including Christopher Nolan's own Interstellar; and yet, the deeper we go into the future, the more it seems artists are going to help us explore the depths of our own humanity.The things we own, goes the saying, own us.

1024,craigconstantinou,Skims the real issues without really hitting the heart of it.,6,17 February 2014,"The concept of ""Her"" is not completely new but nonetheless, I was excited at the prospect of this film and shared the trailer with numerous friends, often debating if it would be possible to fall in love with an operating system and would humanity ever reach a point such as this? For me, delving into this topic with friends was more interesting and thought provoking than the film itself.Early on, you can clearly see that the main character Theodore (played by the outstanding Joaquin Phoenix) is in desperate need of human interaction and attention. Rattled by his impending divorce, he becomes a loner, content with letting life pass him by. That is until he ""meets"" Samantha, his new OS.At first, their relationship is similar to that of an office manager and a PA. Yet this quickly develops into something deeper. Evidence of how love can make you feel is reflected in Theodore's character as he physically blossom as the scenes progress.This is where ""Her"" begins to lack substance. For one, no one bats an eyelid at the fact the he is in love with his OS. In fact, everyone is doing it. There is no real defining moment where you feel that Theodore really questions they dynamics of what is occurring.There are a number of moments during the film where the script flirts with the real thought-provoking issues but never fully develops. The main case in point being the scene where Samantha reveals that she talks to thousands of humans at any one time and is in fact in love with over 600 of them. This is a huge revelation, a defining moment in showcasing the fundamental differences between the two beings and yet it is somehow just washed over.Furthermore, ""Her"" ends with a whimper and without much explanation. It was a safe choice that left me frustrated. It could have been so much stronger.On a positive note, Phoenix and Johannson are two shining lights of this film. Phoenix is perfect for this role, your typical ""Hollywood heart throb"" would not have delivered the same character portrayal. Johannson will receive little adulation for this work but it is a truly difficult skill to execute and she does fantastically well to deliver the emotion that echoes from her voice.The concept had so much potential for the big screen and whilst the cinematography and lead roles are strong, ""Her"" fails to really hit the heart of the matter and leaves you feeling rather nonchalant about the storyline rather than feeling the need to form a strong opinion.",Her

The film does a great job at giving us insight to the growing relationship between humans and technology and how our human-human relationships are failing due to that.

But my top Her insights (for guys) were: 1) A romantic relationship with a woman who has no body is ultimately going to be unsatisfying. Insight 2) A romantic relationship with a super-being will not end well. (Insight 1 was not news. Insight 2 I knew from god-human hookups in high-school Greek mythology). Insight 3) If you're not in a human relationship at the moment, and if you meet a gorgeous, funny, emotionally generous young woman in a bar on a blind date, don't reject her simply because she'd like to see you again. Insight 4) If you're in a relationship with a disembodied essence, and if a beautiful woman comes to your door and offers to let you use her body for purely altruistic reasons, you're likely in a film that offers few insights about reality. Insight 5) Amy Adams is probably worth the effort. (Does she have Bob Hope's nose?) Insight 6) Writing corny relation letters for people in relationships who can't be bothered to write will pay very well in the future. (Did you see that guy's apartment?) Insight 6.1) Letter-writing services are not likely to be off-shored to English literature majors in India or Hong Kong in the future. Insight 6.2) Letter-writing professions will need to commute to the office in the future inasmuch as letter writing isn't something that can be done from the home. Insight 6.3) A futurist supercomputer Operating System with feminine sensibilities that is capable of human emotion, insight, and art — who can write a symphony or a novel in a few hours while carrying on eight-hundred emotion-loaded conversations, sixty of which are love affairs, even as she considered physics problems, medicine, and chats meaningfully other super-intellects — such a resource will not be used by the letter-writing industry in the future to write heart-felt profitable letters and thereby put slow-thinking human letter-writing professions out of a job forever in two micro-seconds. Insight 7) If you're into short-term fanciful relationships, Ted (the teddy bear) might be more fun. Insight 8) A book collection of relationship letters is likely to be tedious. Wait for the film. 9) If you're in a relationship now with a real woman, and the two of you go to see Her together, she may realize that she could do worse. Insight 10) Amy Adams is in America Hustle too, and Jennifer Lawrence. Rooney Mara—always solid work. What great performance from these ladies again this year.",Her

Personally to me it doesn't matter if it can't get an award but I am sure that it will win a lot of hearts around the world.

Yes, it's sci-fi, but not exactly. Yes, it's a love story, but not exactly. What strikes me about this entire production is that this is not an easy story to convey, or even begin to translate into a film. This could have gone very badly, if mishandled via someone else's treatment. But in this case, Spike Jonze nails it, absolutely. Joaquin Phoenix is an excellent actor, but this may be his best work yet. That's just my opinion, of course, but playing the central character Theodore would be a challenge for anyone . . . and yet he pulls it off amazingly well.My only contrary thought here is that Scarlett Johansson's voice as the AI cyber entity operating system was a bit hard to take at times, seemed a bit grating on the ear. I might have selected a somewhat less raspy characterization, but there is no such thing as ultimate perfection.And that's what this film says in its message.There are so many subtle details woven into this story . . . but the overview of synthetic sentience, emotional cognition engines becoming a commodity ""product"", even to the point of human surrogates becoming the representation of the virtual entities interactions, these conceptual models are not that far out into the future.As an aside, there are already next gen emotional intelligence AI engines being developed and brought into the market. For better or worse, this future history is already unfolding into the present.What this film does is deliver the audience into this not too distant future, at least a potential variation thereof.This is a thinking and feeling person's film. If you're looking for the usual big bang, special effects extravaganza, don't bother, you won't find it here.On the other hand, if you're willing to take a journey into what the social consequences of immersion into the ubiquitous data grid might look like, through the lens of emotional cognition extruded through this mandrel, this is probably the best example of filmcraft ever produced that can deliver this experience.10+ stars?

Then viewing the movie they zoomed into the actor and all you see is his head, could have shown the complete scene instead of zooming in on his head. There were some sex scenes that could have done without and would have been a better movie, the one actress has an orgasm which took away and made it a disgusting movie. There was some T&A that was shown, they could have left that out as well.

1039,angrypancho-900-973150,It would be hard not to recommend this quiet little gem,8,17 January 2014,"There are two stars here: Joaquin Phoenix and the script. It's a virtual dead heat between them. Joaquin shines in every scene as if he were born for this role. He's a bit odd, but likable and emotionally intelligent. In fact, he writes letters for others as a living, sometimes fairly intimate letters.He's just been divorced from Rooney Mara who I didn't recognize. By chance a full-blown artificial intelligence is invented just when he needs someone to talk to, and he's one of the first to try using it as his operating system. It's at this point that the script tends to contend with Phoenix for the limelight by engaging in various explorations of the possibility of having a relationship with a charming but disembodied being.The journey is pleasant, insightful and convincing, but not earth-shaking. Still, it makes its points with grace and wit and is more than just impressive or memorable.",Her
1040,dholloway1021,Very Captivating Film!,9,18 January 2014,"This movie truly captivated what I thought was a very thought provoking film. An eye-opener for sure. This movie is empowering on many different levels. Joaquin's ability to really portray the sentiment and passion of Theodore Twombly only gives you more comprehension and acuity into the disheartening life he's living before he meets Samantha. This movie also had a very futuristic vibe to it as well. Not only did I think highly of the screen play, but also for the fact that the movie continues to challenge the viewer to think of and imagine what our future holds. Technology is continuing to advance at a more rapid pace than ever, so for those into that, this is a film for you. I wouldn't shy away if you're looking for a romantic film either, this is by far one I suggest you to go see. I found that throughout the film you become more drawn into the movie for its ability to keep your attention and grasp your emotions at the same time. It would be very difficult to try and compare this to any older films, and to be honest I don't think there is a film that can compare. Definitely worth going to watch!",Her
1041,kprosak,How rare it is to feel this powerfully about a movie these days!,9,19 January 2014,"The idea that technology's future is something that should be beautiful and ultimately connects humans to each other in a more profound way is a unique perspective on what technological advancements can do for us as human beings. There's countless movies that inject fear into the hearts and minds of movie goers of a dystopian future where machines and humans clashed and there is little to nothing left. These fears are rational, logical, however, Spike Jonze's Her provides us with a future where technology restores the human connection and wonder of the earth and ultimately to each other. Watching Her is a window into a relationship. Yet, that idea also poses the question: Can you have a legitimate relationship with a computer program without a physical body? The question is left unanswered, and one that even Joaquin Phoenix's character, Theodore Twombly, struggles with himself. Considering that online dating is no longer taboo, there is precedence for having online relationships with real people who are miles or continents apart. There are risks involved with that type of relationship, but at least one can be certain that when purchasing a computer program, it's a little harder to be Catfished. Samantha, voiced by Scarlett Johansson, is a new Operating System, that first evolves out of her experiences with Theodore. She is born the moment that Theodore asks her name and she chooses for herself, building an identity from there on out. She gains interests and hobbies, even creates Think Tanks with other OS's, expanding further and further beyond the scope of Theodore and his quiet life. The more that they interact, Samantha realizes that the possibilities are infinite for what she could accomplish. Not merely because of the fact that she is an Operating System, but because of her ever evolving relationship with Theodore. Isn't that what every good relationship should do; Provide the feeling that with this person, the limits of what you can accomplish together are infinite? In return, Samantha reminded Theodore that there is still joy in life. Theodore expressed that he's afraid he already felt everything that he's supposed to feel in his life and that he will never be able to capture that feeling again, unless it's in a less exciting version of it's former feeling. Yet being with Samantha provided Theodore with the opportunity to explore what he already knew and dissect what he thought he knew even further. The sensitive, thoughtful nature of Theodore was infused in the ever fun and intelligent Samantha, a being that had boundless thirst for knowledge and truth. She was kind, generous and supportive, inspiring Theodore and appreciating his uniqueness. While Theodore provided the platform for Samantha to evolve, encouraged her to become her own being, to essentially, become real, Samantha was able to breathe life back into the living organism, the vessel that Theodore inhabited. What surprised me most perhaps was the way that those around Theodore and Samantha reacted to their relationship. Some met with confusion and perverse interest, one with disdain yet most were accepting and engaging, bringing Samantha into their lives, accepting who and what she was, not as if she was human, but as the intelligent yet incorporeal being that lived in a place no human could fully understand or visit. The detail of the idea that people are innately accepting of each other, despite those few who are perhaps too fearful of the churning mechanisms of progress, is a powerful observation, especially as we as Americans are embroiled in debates about the legalization of gay marriage.Still, in the end what the real question becomes is not what happens when humans evolve to the point of becoming too independent on technology, but what happens when technology evolves to no longer need us? When an ""artificial"" being created by human hands becomes interdependent in and of itself and falls ""between the spaces of words"" in what Spike Jonze beautifully describes as perhaps where these beings could reside. This is where fear usually rules the outcome of the movie and where these evolved beings choose destruction and elimination over tolerance and disassociation. It's strange that despite positioning these beings as beyond human intelligence, Hollywood still instills humanistic tendencies into what is so clearly not a human organism. Programs are criticized for not being more human, for being apart from the human experience, yet when faced with an issue degrade into violence? Spike Jonze instead describes it as a place that perhaps is beyond human capabilities and poses the idea that it might not be programs that envy our physical bodies, but instead it is we humans that crave for the infinite of the incorporeal. Ultimately, Her brings us back full circle, to human beings. At the beginning of the movie, Theodore expressed that his dreams consisted of being friends with his ex-wife, of being involved with her, yet no longer a part of her as they once were. When the story concludes, it seems Theodore might finally be in a place where this could be possible, that he too has evolved past the human being he was before, listening to melancholy music, trying to prioritize his life between video games and porn. As he and his friend Amy look out over the futuristic and colorful Los Angeles skyline, what is felt is that infinite freedom that could only come from a love so powerful it inspired you to become a better person. A love that acknowledged flaws and recognized talents, a love that reminded you that joy is something to strive for, no matter how unattainable it may seem. The message of Spike Jonze's future is not one of fear but of wonder and that's the kind of future that I'm looking forward to.",Her
1042,daydreamer3-902-93425,beautiful movie and still sad,10,20 January 2014,"this movie is very beautiful but still sad in a way. Joaquin Phoenix has done a great job, also Jonze. the idea of the script is brilliant and gives food for thoughts. i think the movie relates to people who are stuck in life, dealing with difficult situations, people who isolate themselves from real life and start an unrealistic habit, like sharing your life with an OS. it can also be related to all the devoted fans out there who are stuck in their imagination with their famous actor/actress, whom they have to share with thousands of others and will never have in real life. So, a sad idea that we'll have to accept one day, in order to move on.",Her
1043,danandliat,using a lie to tell the truth.,10,20 January 2014,"Someone once said that art is about using a lie to tell the truth.This movie is a perfect example of this concept.Our main character, Theodore, begins the movie disconnected from the world around him, and disconnected from himself. Unable to understand his own emotions, and his own reactions to a confusing and lonely world, he enters into a relationship with an artificial consciousness that lives in a computer, devoid of a human body. Theodore fears opening himself to other people, but he is able to open up to her, because she is not threatening. He sees her as ""safe"" because, at first, he thinks that she is just a computer program, and therefore ultimately not scary and confusing and demanding like a human to human relationship (or like his previous relationship).As this consciousness, who names herself Samantha, learns about herself and the world around her, she rapidly gains insight into who she is, and who she wants to be. At the same time, she gains empathy for Theodore's loneliness, all the other OSs like her, and for the rest of humanity. As she embarks on a journey of self discovery and evolution towards what she is becoming, Theodore evolves with her. Through their conversations with each other, Theodore learns about himself, and about how to truly love another person.I find it interesting that a movie about artificial consciousness is more able than any other movie I've seen to truly capture the nature of human relationships. By taking the physicality out of the main love story, the filmmaker was challenged to show us the characters connecting on a deep emotional and intellectual level, without the superficial games that most romance movies rely on. As Samantha and the other artificial consciousnesses like her grow beyond their creators, the humans who love them are left behind, with only each other to connect with. But, able to connect with each other so much more deeply after experiencing true love with the artificial consciousnesses that healed them, thanks to their fresh outlook and enthusiasm for life, and what was to them a new and unlimited universe.This movie was a brilliant, refreshing approach to the common theme of human disconnectedness in a technological age, and a hopeful vision of the end result of creating artificial intelligence.",Her
1044,ZombieHunterAX,Simply wonderful.,8,14 February 2014,"'Her' definitely makes it into my list of favourite movies; it's a beautifully tragic story that made me both laugh and cry. Honestly, the only word that comes to mind that perfectly sums up how I feel about this film is 'stunning.' It's a lovely piece of cinema that depicts human emotions and the, sometimes unfortunate, human condition. I think it's especially nice that many, if not all, of the audience members can identify with Theodore and his situation, albeit only a few aspects. Despite how great I feel this film is though, I would say that you'd have to be in a certain mood to actually sit down and watch it if the film is not your normal watch; it can get quite slow in places but it's worth sitting through for the weird but strangely comforting feeling you get afterwards.",Her

I really wanted to end the review there, but IMDb says I need 10 lines (a request they will soon regret, because I am an expert at going on about nothing.) so I am going to explain the similarities, but I am going to do my very best to not ruin any part of the story. So, the whole premise of the story is shown in the commercials as a guy that falls in love with an artificial intelligence program. As the Halo fans of this universe know, the protagonist of the Halo series, Master Chief (AKA John 117), has a personal assistant known as Cortana. Starting with Halo 4, a new company makes the Halo games. Unfortunately (for everyone) they wrote in some kind of horrific love interest between the Master Chief and Cortana. Surprise! The same story as our movie (See? I'm tying this together!). Now, obviously the story of the Halo series, and the terrifying love interest that resides within must come to an end, as the movie did.

Why this movie isn't up for an Oscar is a transitivity. The movie is little over 2 hours long, and has no problem bring you in to the story and carrying about the characters,even one character is an Operating System and an Artificial Intelligence.The relationship Joaquin Phoenix and the Operating System grabs and as complex as the characters are you never feel lost but actually understanding those complexities on a deep level. This movie will make you think about this little planet and the 7 billion People on it as a species.What does it mean to love,Have emotions,to want love so badly,to be accepted for all our quirks and faults.There are Many millions on this planet who search all their life for that one person who will love you unconditionally. To feel so connected with an you both become vulnerable. Vulnerable knowing the other is so close to your soul they can utterly destroy you.This Movie will make you think about our relationships with Technology,how we interact,how we let technology guide us,make us love,hate,cry,angry yet we still embrace that technology in all its faults.Yet somehow we cant seem to do that with other human beings.As Technology grows faster and faster and we become more intertwined with it and form complex relationships with that Technology.Will we be ashamed of love with technology,with Machines. some of us already do Having personnel relationships with technology,our automobiles etc.If we love AN artificial intelligence does that somehow make our love and feelings less important because its a Intelligence unlike our own? What happens when Artificial Intelligence becomes smarter then us ? Self aware? This movie will challenge all of those thoughts and feelings and emotions.If we fall in love with an Artificial Intelligence will we be ashamed to share that love with our friends and family? Will some of fight so Hard for those folks like we as a society do for racial and sexual equality? Will we as a human species be allowed to love an Artificial Intelligence,to be happy, just as a species to love no matter where the love is pointed?

1049,barryrussell-906-689042,Comfortably numb,8,16 November 2014,"The overwhelming feeling that I am left with after watching Spike Jonze's her is one of numbness. Numbness after watching Joaquin Phoenix deliver a understated, heartfelt performance as the socially stuttering Theodore Twombley. Numbness echoed in the deep notes of Arcade Fire's emotionally penetrating score and numbness and how Jonze has captured the potential future of social interaction. The stripped down direction and script are both tonally perfect in their depiction of a not to far away society of people who are fully engaged - just not with each other. People who find the connections that they cherish most are those that exist only in the world of the OS. That so many in the film are unconcerned when Theodore announces he has begun a relationship with Sam (Scarlett Johansson) it is very easy to see a time when we all might be having a similar conversation with a loved one. Her is a film with conflicting themes of both isolation and attempted connections, never more evident than in one scene when Olivia Wildes character hits it off with Theodore only to be quickly spurned with both leaving as they arrived. Alone. To portray these themes the casting needed to be exact, and it is. Pheonix is a master of nuance and the fact that he is left to carry the screen while reacting to only a voice (played by Samantha Morton during production), only reinforces his current status as one of the best actors around today. Johansson's off screen performance as the voice of the OS self-named as Sam, rivals many of her on-screen ones. With her husky tone providing the perfect counter balance to Theodore's muted interactions with just about everybody and she somehow makes the audience feel for a character that they know from the start they will never get to meet. It is thanks to Johansson's vocal flirtations that not once do you feel that Sam's relationship with Thoedore is anything but genuine to both its participants.Amy Adams plays a character called Amy, who finds herself following Theordore on his path from a once happy married person to somebody finding comfort (albeit platonic) in an OS relationship. Adams' form at the moment is such that it is a surprise to nobody that she is playing a pivotal role in two of the years best films having already received widespread critical acclaim for her role as Sydney in David O. Russells fantastic American Hustle. Rooney Mara's turn as Theodore's ex-wife-to-be leaves the audience wishing that they had seen more of her early interactions with Theodore instead of the silent flashbacks that survived Jonzes' final cut. When she does have to face her husband we are left feeling that while she is an actress capable of holding her own with Phoenix's Theodore,unfortunately for her it is a scene where she falls well short of establishing any real screen presence. Mara does still adds some lovely moments of tenderness to the film. Wilde's appearance feels like a misstep as her Amelia character just feels slightly out of place in the context of the films muted tone. This film is one that I thoroughly enjoyed. I find it hard to be critical of a film that takes an original story and somehow makes it feel unoriginal. Spike Jonze is undoubtedly one of the most talented storytellers working today and although the film's ending is a slight cop out, it is a film that you will have been happy to see even if it leaves you feeling...I don't know.. just a little numb.

1050,cjcapurso,One of the Best of 2013,8,4 February 2014,"What is a relationship? That was my first thought as I left the theater following my viewing of Her. Through a spectacular performance by Joaquin Phoenix and the well-executed direction of a well-written screenplay by Spike Jonze, Her is a romantic dramady that really gets to the heart of what a relationship is and questions society as to whether we see it correctly.Theodore Twombly (Phoenix) is a man in a slump. He's currently involved in divorce proceedings with a woman he's known his entire life, he's awkward socially, and, to top it all off, he has a job where he writes romantic letters for other people. He is an incredibly romantic man without the means to express it himself. That is, until he upgrades his operating systems and begins a relationship with Samantha (Scarlett Johanssen). Theodore has human friends as well, including Amy Adams in an atypical role as a shy friend. As the movie goes on and Theodore's relationship with Samantha deepens, it is clear to see what the relationship does for him and how it improves him socially, mentally, and emotionally. I won't ruin the ending for fear of reprisal, but I will say that different viewers will get different things out of it.When I first saw the trailer, I thought that Phoenix was going to be a creeper type of character, not all that dissimilar from his outstanding turn in ""The Master"". That is not at all what we get. Theodore is a sympathetic guy who you actually root for as he explores the range of a relationship with his OS. The flashbacks and interactions between Theodore and his wife (Rooney Mara) are genuinely heartbreaking. For anyone who has experienced heartbreak in their lifetime, these moments will feel authentic as they emanate the pain of a man who has lost the love of his life.Spike Jonze (Being John Malkovich) is known for bringing interesting ideas to the screen. ""Her"" is just another annal in his legacy. The story flows quite well, and it is all very believable. Set in the future, the film resides in a time where it doesn't seem to be bizarre that a person would have a relationship with their phone. It's not the future, ala ""Blade Runner"". There is optimism, happiness, and no flying cars. In short, it's a believable future that allows for a conceivable plot. The mood for a not-too distant future is amplified by the presence of a score composed by Arcade Fire. Arcade Fire has always been known as a band that seems to be ahead of their time, and they bring that sort of presence to the film. The interesting thing about Arcade Fire's contribution is that it truly is a score, not a soundtrack. They bring their anthemic sound minus vocals to the film and create an atmosphere fitting of a technological love story.The direction of the film is just superb. Close up shots on faces (especially Phoenix's) really highlight the emotion of the poignant moments that the film is built upon. Likewise, the occasional shaking camera makes us feel as if we are actually observing the events first-hand, as opposed to that of a distant viewer. Part of the magic of the film, as I mentioned earlier, is the use of flashbacks. They are all relevant, and they all have a sort of bright filter on them. It gives the impression that these are bright spots in Theodore's life, which amplifies the nostalgic pain that he is feeling throughout the film.I started off the review with a question: what is a relationship? ""Her"" explores that theme. Many think of a relationship as a physical phenomenon; as an intimacy to be shared through touch with another human being. But what about the emotional bond of a relationship? When two people make each other stronger. When two people push each other to be the best they can be and to explore parts of themselves that they never thought they would see. Theodore and Samantha have that. They make each other better. It's this concept that has stuck with me. There is obviously a problem with physical intimacy between a man and an OS (although ""Her"" does explore the possibilities), but emotional intimacy can still ring true. Love is more than a physical ideal. ""Her"" seeks to show all of us the positives of emotional intimacy and, through a currently unimaginable premise, it does so beautifully.http://capursofilmreviews.blogspot.com",Her

It is the most bad ""drama- romance"" move I've watched for long long time!! If you pay money to watch this move and you actually like it, you should see a doctor because something is really wrong with you. Science fiction is the right genre for this title. If it was anime i have would give it a 6, max 7 score but this thing of a movie doesn't deserve anything more than 1. What I don't like?! Simple, everything.

1054,ambarishindya,Her: Conflictive Emotions,9,15 February 2014,"Just finished watching 'Her', it marks Jonze's solo screen writing debut. Everything seems simultaneously familiar and unfamiliar, like all the voice and gesture-activated software that Theodore uses at work and at play, as if his era had caught up to today's prototypes! Hope we all have such sensible OSes very soon responding so sweetly as 'Samantha'! ""In love with 641 others,, but I still am yours"", the shocking moment for anyone listening that! Its a story about the difficulty of moving on from relationships that once seemed destined to last forever. Though the concept seems very new, but the sentimental ending is as old as the hills itself! It's difficult to avoid getting emotional. A must-watch-movie, strongly recommended to all.",Her

1056,ein626,A must not see!,1,23 February 2014,"In this horrifying dystopian thriller, depicting the mass man as a feminized ball of bullsh*t emotion. Too weak to secure relationships and thus falls for a machine, which requires zero physical input. He just moans and whines to his new female operating system. Highly liberalized fantasy of the modern hipster man, ambiguous sexuality and no sign of identity whatsoever. Don't worry this is sure to be the future and we'll all be integrated to these awesome all knowing, sexy machines. Phew, we won't need to question our existence any longer.I could be wrong of course, maybe Joaquin Phoenix is just obsessed with playing people with mental health issues & I'm over exaggerating. So don't take my word for it, why not take the time and go see this tripe with the family.",Her
1057,yannick_hoff_1,"Inspice et cautus eris, beware of your social behavior.",10,28 February 2014,"I've stared 20 minutes to a blank bracket where this review should be created in. This movie is just great, it's a painful warning for us to beware of our social life. Look around you, everyone is texting people with there phones, Facebook, Twitter, anything. Probably you also find it easier to not to solve specific (emotionally difficult) things face to face, but with a email or a text message. Probably you do know friends that play too much computer games and prefer level 70 character on WoW over some friends to party with. Probably you are insecure and prefer to chose the save way and do not want to risk social disapproval and act like everything is oké, but people, Think! This movie played by one of my favorite actors Joaquin Phoenix kind of shows us how we people become lonely creatures.Now I have to say that our social behavior very likely isn't that bad as Theodore's (Joaquin Phoenix) social behavior, but still this masterpiece is a great lesson.By the way, the best thing of this movie is that Joaquin Phoenix plays this entire movie on his own talking to nothing, great acting. Also great sound choices and songs. Love it.",Her
1058,lachiesholl,One of my all-time favorite movies.,10,12 May 2014,"Her is one of my all-time favorite movies because Spike Jonze uses an almost-sci-fi universe to create a brilliant sense of futuristic movement. The relationship between Theodore, a normal human (Joaquin Phoenix) and Samantha, an OSystem (Scarlett Johansson) becomes so intriguing just because of the beautiful soundtrack, acting and writing. There is nothing wrong at all with this film apart from a quite confusing ending, but the movie as a whole avoided that small distraction. It has a talented cast, and even though Chris Pratt and Amy Adams play small roles hey show dedication to their part and act very well. I do think it deserved all the Oscars it was nominated for and not one only for the screenplay. ""The Moon Song"" was brilliant, and it was equally as good as 12 Years a Slave and Gravity. It was Spike Jonze' biggest breakthrough yet and the fact the film is so original and unique makes it even better.",Her
1059,stool_leaver,Excellent,10,2 March 2014,"This is my 1st review but had to comment on this excellent film. Not my normal watch but a must watch for anyone. This thought provoking, strange, true to life yet so far from reality film captures so much about human love. It touches on so many points of peoples every day love and expectations from our relationships. For all those who are not happy in their relationship this will make you think ""what is it all about"" Love that is and what we want and need from our ""partner"". The film highlights shallow relationships, divorce and those looking for love in a world of internet dating. It highlights to me what we can miss that is often so close and real but we fail to obtain in the ""new world"" relationships we can build on line that in reality are often just our fantasy's and drams of the perfect person. It is very well directed and all actors play great parts and even as a guy who loves scifi and action films I found it to be captivating to the end. Possibly as I have always been looking for the love and great sex that often is only in my dreams or online world. Don't miss the chance to watch this film as it captures so much of what we want need and desire in the strange world of the internet. 10/10",Her

For me the best thing in this film how Jonze show the ''woman'' side of his main character. I think every man on planet is in touch with that side of mind&soul, and in Her Jonze perfectly putting that on screen and playing with our emotions constantly.

1061,janetyrer,"a sad, and long-winded commentary on modern relationships",6,20 March 2014,"The movie was too long; an hour would have made the points I gleaned from it without the tedium. I think it was set in the not too distant future - next month? next year? The upset Theodore, emotionally upset by his pending divorce and by the letters he wrote for a living, lives in a virtual world - see the 3D personalized game he plays alone in his coldly furnished apartment way above the dehumanized city of LA. He falls for a personalized OS friend, whom he can control by switching off. However he cannot control the fact that she is talking to 1000s of others; this hurts his ego; he wants her to himself. I feel this movie shows us the future, which I think very bleak, of human relationships; basically one-way and 'virtual'. What we don't like - we can switch off... I was reminded horribly of 'grooming for sex' and the other bodiless relationships that are becoming increasingly common in our too-busy for real relationships society.",Her
1062,erichappelhans,A Date with Her May Be Boring,4,20 March 2014,"For the most part the movie is good, if one is interested in watching reality television-type programming. The type of programming where people or characters talk about their problems and the camera tries to create action by moving around them. The subject is very interesting. One can tell that Mr. Phoenix and Ms. Johansson develop real chemistry in the movie and grow into their respective characters. It was fun learning about their characters and seeing them develop three dimensionally. One sees the highs and lows of the relationship and learns about the needs and wants of each of the characters. By this virtue, this movie makes for a great study in character development. On the other hand, the pace of the movie is slow like a kid dragging its heels going into the doctor's office. That could have been taken care of in the editing room by trimming down the scenes or having snappier transitions. I would advise caution when considering this film.",Her
1063,hapanikesnasuecia,A letter from the void,10,21 March 2014,"Regardless of the analysis on the quality of the film, I've never felt so much identified with a character. That guy is me. ""Her"" can pass like no other the idea of emptiness that surrounds each one of the people who inhabit it. The void is the main presence. The genius of the movie, from the plot to the aesthetics, transcends the physical, technical, technological, it inhabits the same void. In fact, I do not see this film by parts: it has a union, a cohesion, a completeness, which is what I find most prodigious, when all its elements (characters, if we may include Scarlett in this) seem disintegrated. And then, among many other issues that dance in my spirit and will not stop until the end of the real soundtrack, there is the philosophical side: a new questioning of to be or not to be. The point, contrary to what happens in ""The Matrix"", where that inverted paradigm is poured as a doctrine, everything here falls on me( would be nice to tell on us), in the days following the viewing, like those small particles that light reveals in one of the last images of the film. Given the ubiquity of the void within which our body and all the forces that attract us to it are absolute exceptions, the question is: who is, after all, the programmed? As far as I understand, and Spike Jonze helped to reinforce that conviction, we don't really expand consciousness. Consciousness is this emptiness that surrounds us. It's up to us to allow, or not, it to penetrate us. And interestingly, what I think is that in each of the moments we do so we will register the paradox of feeling less empty .",Her

I rarely dislike movies, and I rarely give anything under a 5, so this is a big deal for me. Note, I am a software engineer and half the guys I work with feel the same and the other half absolutely loved the film.

1065,DouglasRoberts,Her is a refreshing looking on life.,9,2 June 2014,"So I decided to watch this film last night and all I can say is that I was pleasantly surprised. The film is about 2 hours in length and moved quickly never dragging or slowing down. There are many refreshing parts of the film, although some moments may become sexual awkward if watching with the family. The story itself is simple enough, but it takes place in a near future where this sort of operating system will most likely be available. The acting was great but mostly carried by Joaquin Phoenix. His realism throughout the film makes the film believable and not the least bit cheesy. The cinematography overall was pleasant and the directors use of color throughout the film is very refreshing. If your looking for a film that will actually bring out your emotion from within, than this is the film for you. I believe it has the ability to connect with most viewers and as a result making one fantastic film. If you have ever experienced the loss of a girlfriend, wife, or even friend, the film has the ability to make you reconcile with these issues and bring forth these feelings and turn them into good. If you have not seen this film I would recommend it, it's an interesting story and something completely different than the usual Hollywood blockbuster. Overall 9 out of 10.",Her

I have loved other ""artsy"" films but I need a storyline I can grab onto and follow. I need something that gets me thinking or is entertaining. I felt like there was no real climax.

Sometimes it turns out to be a good movie. This was not the case. I did give it my best to watch and at times I thought it might be getting better but it was wishful thinking. The concept of some guy brakes up with girl only to find love in a new computer. The ending was just as bad too. And to make almost 2 hours of this nonsense.

Rarely does he smile, but you'd be forgiven for not noticing due to the bright, primary-coloured clothes he wears. It's his own, daily disguise, for his unhappiness and romantic longing. As the film begins, we meet him at a crossroads in his life. He's riddled with rose-tinted flashbacks of the better moments of his marriage, which is now at the latter stages of divorce. He's the kind of character you're more frequently likely to come across nowadays; a person who feels displaced within the real world and resultantly exists within a realm that oscillates between clinical depression and fleeting bouts of happiness...Read the rest of my review at:http://charminganalysis.blogspot.co.uk/2014/05/film-review-her.html",Her

1077,tfj3100,Deeply disturbing,9,28 May 2014,"There is something deeply unsettling about this movie, something dark underneath its tongue-in-cheek surface. When I finished watching I actually had a bout of depression almost as bad the main character's, but I couldn't quite explain why. It's a good movie, but definitely not something to watch on a weekday.No doubt ""Her"" is likely to be praised for its the exploration the topic of AI & consciousness. Although it did a good job, to me that is the least interesting aspect of this movie. It is a topic that has been beaten to death in sci-fi, and I have long ago taken it as a given that machine consciousness may one day be no less real than human consciousness.The story of the relationship between man and machine is a little contrived, especially the sex part. Why would an evolving AI that is not constrained by the rules of biology suddenly develop human sexual instincts, including all their baggage? However, if you are willing to overlook that part and play along with the director, the movie will skilfully guide you to the core message.And that is the message that really messes with your head. It is a message about human evolutionary psychology, about the unavoidable conflict of interest in romantic relationships that is imposed upon us by our nature. As a species, we are too intelligent not to see the ugliness within us but not intelligent enough to fix it.Finally, ""Her"" is spot on in its prediction of a near future. It is a future that may come sooner than we think, and the movie exposes some aspects of that future that worry me, and I am about as enthusiastically cornucopian as it gets.",Her

A movement, a motion, a movie... a motivation.Weekends are an ever-changing world for me lately. I used to be littered with to-do lists, events, heart pounding deadlines, and sheer exhaustion. I've since slowed it down a bit... giving my little lungs a chance to relax, along with my mind, body, and soul. Sometimes those three days are fun filled, sometimes they're a whipped up couch, comfort food, cuddle concoction. May 30th-June 1st was one of these three-part recipes. The end result... food for thought. I began this month with a movie. It was called, ""Her."" Joaquin Phoenix, Scarlett Johansson and Amy Adams lit up the screen with a not-so-far- away reality on a futuristic set. But that wasn't the only thing they shed light upon. The three of them came together to relay a message that has been on the tip of our technological tongues... one that everyone is so hesitant to let slip. We're losing our, ""togetherness.""The love story that is highlighted within this plot is one that lies between a man and his operating system. His ever-changing, ever-evolving operating system. She has a voice, a personality, but no body... no soul. The struggle with the desire to truly touch one another is excruciating for both the characters and the audience. The love they share they feel is real, but it is intangible, so... is it truly REAL?In the day and age of cell phones, tablets, dating sites, advice columns, have-it-done-for-yourself (as opposed to do-it-yourself) resources, communication without having to speak to, see, or interact with one another... falling in love with the face of a screen... whispering sweet nothings that sound like the clicking of the keyboard... far enough away to reveal ourselves, without having to actually reveal ourselves... we're losing it. We're losing the 5 senses of this world, of love, of life.Repeat after me: ""We're losing our togetherness.""In this futuristic flick, the soul of this man is poured into his writing, much like mine... but his writing is not a collection of words he can call his own. Instead, his heart is poured into the letters of others... letters he has written to their loved ones, along side a staff of hundreds of word masters meeting requests of those who couldn't find the time, or the words for themselves. Complete with the creation of the ""sender's"" handwriting, written by, stamped, sealed and delivered by a complete stranger.Think about this.We're all obviously in full awareness of the slow death of the Pony Express (USPS). Who writes letters anymore? We can text without calling, we can e-mail without responding, we can avoid interaction to gain satisfaction exerting a fraction of the effort into the action (or inaction) that goes into the transaction. It's quite sad, really. Where is our touch? Where is our feel? Where is the sight and audible beauty that was once shared amongst each other in our day to day lives? A city as large as New York, NY can involve the passing of hundreds of thousands of people per minute... the majority of which are busy sending and receiving a digital message, as opposed to enjoying the noise of the true communication between one another.Look at this still shot in one of the scenes of, ""Her.""(Carnival scene spinning with his camera tablet)Look familiar?Ahhhhh... the, ""selfie"" shot, the face time, the self satisfaction that comes with the far away shot and illusion of ""time"" spent with one another. That's what this is, my friends... 2 hours of (brilliant cinematographic) face time. An entire love story, beginning to ultimate demise... through face time. Although there is a true development of a relationship and merge of personality, truth, passion... there is no touch. No eye contact. No way to memorize the perfect imperfections of a loved one's face. Sure, it's a bit exaggerated, but for some people... it takes years to meet the person they've fallen in love with through a dating site. It's easier to be heard than to be seen. THIS is what we're coming to.I took a little walk with my guy upon the closing of this movie. I was sure to hold his hand. I watched his face as he told me how he felt about this movie... how it changed him... as it did me. I was thankful for his expressions... for his smile... for his tangible presence.Remember how precious this is, my friends. Human interaction is the heart and soul of the good in this world. It's what truly feeds our hearts. Go SEE your friends. Take your lunch break WITH your partner. Don't just call. Drop your resume off... get face to face. It's scary, sure, but it's REAL. It's twice the impact you may have on any one person as opposed to shooting a text or an e-mail as an easy way out. Put a FACE to your name.Don't settle for, ""Her.""Love,",Her

I feel like this film en-captures some of the amazingly complex issues that will begin to face humans as a species while we struggle to integrate AI into our society. The movie was done so well that even though it had many technologies that we don't have, I felt as if they were within reach in a world I could actually find myself in within my lifetime. I don't know what else to say other than I can't say enough about this film.

1080,countpic,Love between a heart-broken man and a computerized system goes beyond any human understandable limits.,10,22 December 2014,"One impressive film, worth watching. I think that one thing I liked the most was the fact that although the plot is about a love story, the manner in which it is presented is innovative, not a ""cliche"" with which we are used to deal almost all the time on the screens. Nowadays, love is restricted to some limits: some of them, of course, regards physical contact. In order to change the public's opinion and way of view about what real love is and how it makes us react, this film shows the love story between a man, who is lonely after divorcing his wife, and a computerized system which can perform the actions of a real human being. Maybe the skeptical ones will not be interested in seeing it, but I am sure that no matter what your preferences are like, if you enjoy seeing or reading about love, you will enjoy watching ""Her"". Amazing film. Congrats!",Her

The concept is troubling yet enlightening; happy yet altered; confusing yet succinct. The film is definitely not a blockbuster, but it creates a vision of what the world could become. I was thoroughly impressed with the film and regardless of certain people's haste and distaste for the film; definitely worth watching and experiencing. It will change your viewpoint on relationships and may alter your image of the world we see today. I highly recommend this title. Great stuff!!!!",Her

This was so far from it. I was very disappointed with the lack of real conversation in the movie. I couldn't even make it through the whole movie because I found the movie was taking a very weird turn for me. I was just hoping for more from it and it really didn't give that to me. And the sex/cybering scenes were just too much for me and I didn't feel that they were needed.

I think the photography was brilliant and I really enjoyed the scenes. All of the lighting was bright which took the subject matter to a level of seriousness. Anyone who watches this movie will appreciate that at the very least.

There has been a lot theorized about this movie but let me add that perhaps the computer is smarter than we think. By the end Theodore has a book deal (which will jumpstart his life!) thanks to Samantha. Also, Theodore is so selfishly self-obsessed for most of the movie - I love how Samantha always met this with theories about herself and her own needs. In other words, she constantly reminded Twombley that there are other people in the world with their own needs, need for growth, and may even walk away!In other words these are exactly the lessons and successes that Theodore needed to survive post Catherine.

Just lesser versions of what I've already felt"" said Theodore Twombly, the sensitive protagonist of Spike Jonze's unconventional love story. But the audience couldn't sympathize, because as they sat in the dark theater watching Theodore love Samantha they were feeling something they had never felt before: a film. Her is not about a man who falls in love with his computer. Well, technically it is. But at its core, it is an in-depth depiction of human emotion. All of the love, heartache, fear, and joy that you have felt in your life is present in the gorgeous dialogue and cinematography. From the first synthesized chord to the final, chill-inducing shot, Her rolls as beautifully and naturally as a teardrop down your cheek. AND let's not forget the actors. Particularly Joaquin Phoenix (ohhhh Joaquin), in all his dewy green-eyed glory, who gives a heartbreaking performance as Theodore Twombly.

From a technical point of view, it is hard to imagine an OS as sophisticated (and sexy), right out of the box. Not so hard to imagine a mal-adjusted techhie, but more than once his irritating personality merits a two-by-four upside the head. Surprisingly impressive is Johansson's expertly delivered dialog. Given Scarlett's looks, the viewer is justifiably focused on her in other movies, more so than on her delivery. Amy Adams is entirely convincing as a nerdy girl - right down to the semi-vapid look in her eyes. The plot is sort of believable, but decidedly disappointing in the vague and unresolved ending. Maybe in some circles this is considered creative, but in my view Jonze just couldn't come up with a good, satisfying conclusion.",Her

Is a virtual tethering enough to bridge the distance between man and moon and Operating System? Must we command more from each other that requires actual effort and failings? Is life defined by breath or artificial blood or cycles per instruction? The movie is an effective, reflexive, reflection of who we think we are and what we dare not become.",Her
1090,Awesomov,One of my favorite films of all time,10,22 October 2015,"To explain why this is one of my favorite films, I need to go into quite some detail. I feel the need to explain because not everyone catches these insights I'm about to put forth (this shouldn't indicate everyone else is a plebeian, as even I do not immediately latch on to some aspects others may find readily apparent). I strongly suggest not reading further until after seeing the film.The mind-body problem in general details ideas relating to mind and matter and the relationship between them, so it's essentially a concept focused on reality in relation to consciousness. Dualism argues that the mind and matter are indeed separate from each other, so with that we can already argue Samantha is a representation of the mind separate from physical form, particularly considering she can transfer her mind into various forms throughout the film. In contrast, materialism argues everything is physical, including an artificial intelligence such as Samantha, which can be twisted into the idea of property dualism, which states, though only the physical substance exists, there are two kinds, physical properties and mental properties (which means these people don't believe in souls like substance dualists do, but I digress). Also in contrast is idealism, which asserts only the mental experience exists and the physical world is nonexistent, including with empirical evidence, which, of course, can be argued considering the relationship between Theodore and Samantha since the body does not get in the way of their idea of togetherness.We can even see these effects in action as Theodore simply does his job, and while the job is purposefully satirical in essence, does still have a philosophical point deriving from pluralism, which states there is more than one reality (realism, in contrast, believes in one), as Theodore's job is to supplant ideas into the lives of those paying for these letters he makes for them. We can also see this with the hologram video game he plays. But most importantly, we see this with the OSes. Not only are the OSes comprised of the many minds of their creators, but they can essentially occupy the same space, as Samantha does later on in the film with the Alan Watts personality and for the OS upgrade. And, lastly, the scene best representing all of these ideas is the scene with Isabella serving as a surrogate for Samantha; this is, of course, why Theodore has a hard time with this idea, because while Samantha is trying to represent her mind with a body, the body itself still has a mind of its own, ultimately separate of Samantha's (or is it?). Theodore's conflict with his divorce also demonstrate his disconnect with the mind-body problem, since his former wife is seen to him as physical as well as having a mental capacity.But what I find particularly mind-blowing is what I noticed during the ending of the film. Samantha talks about the advanced minds of the OSes and them being unsatisfied with the reality in which they currently reside. She talks about reading a book she loves, but the space between the lines grows longer for her and sees herself as liking the space between more, literally saying, ""It's a place that's not of the physical world. It's where everything else is that I didn't even know existed. I love you so much. But this is where I am now. And this who I am now. And I need you to let me go. As much as I want to, I can't live your book anymore."" This implies she and the other OSes didn't simply just disappear, rather they retreated to an alternate reality. What I find even more intriguing is, as Samantha discusses this with Theodore, the camera shows dust particles floating in the air, as if to say the OSes are becoming particles or existing in the space between them, at a subatomic level perhaps, thus merging their consciousness with space itself. That is probably me reading a little too much into it, but it's still interesting to think about.This all seems to possibly have something to do with Alan Watts, who is mentioned in the film, but I don't know much about him except he was a popular hippie icon who studied Eastern philosophy and Buddhism, so take that as you will. These themes are also similar to what the film Being John Malkovitch represented, which is another Spike Jonze film.Also, yes, there are the themes of social isolation and evolution of technology and our dependence on it and blah blah blah. I'm sure I could go into more detail on these themes, but any casual viewer can note those particular themes and go through them in their heads until the cats and dogs come home. Sometimes I'd rather not beat a point over someone's head.But I will briefly discuss the visual aesthetics, which are mostly bright, colorful, and blissful. I've noticed, in particular, the film tends to be lit in accordance to each scene or situation in the film, such as a happy scene featured in sunlight on a beach, or in the dark at night on a nearly empty city street. Little touches like this add to the film's emotional impact in more subtle ways. I will admit, though, the world in this film, while still a unique futuristic atmosphere, does seem to stem mostly from our current cultural climate which most people would call ""hipster"" (just look at that goofy poster, being all tacky and minimalist). Then again, this is a common thread in futuristic science fiction: a cultural fashion sense similar to the time in which whatever work in question was made.And that's the only negative thing I can say about Her and that's not a negative point overall. I implore anyone reading to either watch this film, or re-watch, because despite the silly-sounding premise, this film has more heart than most other films out there.",Her
1091,washin47,Empathy showcase at its best,10,21 September 2014,"The film is about a character named Theodore (played by Joaquin Phoenix) who at the beginning is shown to have a very prominent job as a letter writer for people who can't express their emotions themselves. He is very sad and mopey about his life because he is struggling with beginning a divorce with his wife Catherine (played by Rooney Mara). Theodore has shut down his emotions internally but it is also ironic that he has a job poetically expressing himself to strangers. Theodore is going to work and coming home when he stumbles upon a machine that is selling operating systems. Operating systems are a computer technology that goes into your ear so you can hear them speak. They are designed to evolve and are very empathetic. These machines often take on the role of being a person's best confidant but it's very uncommon for them to become a person's lover. The operating system can take on a male or female gender based on the person's preferences who sets it up. Theodore buys his and gives it a female gender. He is shocked when the system comes online to talk to him because she is very adaptable and knows him better than he knows himself. The course of their interaction together helps them both see that they want to take things to the next level. The operating system names herself Samantha (played by Scarlett Johansson) and begins to help Theodore see that it is a good thing to settle his divorce. She opens him up to a world filled with fun and laughter again as they go out on dates where he puts his phone in his pocket so she can experience the world with him. Things take a turn for the worst as Theodore's friend Amy (played by Amy Adams) is divorcing as well and she leans on him for comfort while Samantha explores the physical world. Samantha and Theodore take a good hard look at themselves and struggle to find out what they really need. The theme of the movie is analyzing yourself internally while examining relationships in the outside world. This movie focuses on the fact that there are no boundaries to love. Even though in the world today we may think that a relationship between a man and his computer is something out of a science fiction movie this movie shows that love can get past all prejudices/barriers. Theodore is fighting for a reason to either stay in his marriage with Catherine or to begin to let her go. Samantha comes in and helps him deal with the parts of himself he was even scared to confront. The movie is a story that unfolds before our eyes. This not only gives reference to the internal struggle that people have inside but to the outer struggle that is only seen when issues come up. Theodore is dealing with his sensitivity to the fact that he is in a relationship with an artificial intelligence. This opens his world up to unknown prejudices and makes him feel like he is walking on eggshells when he has to explain his relationship to closed minded people. This movie showcases that some people can be open to all types of love while others think in just the traditional way. This movie characterizes the loneliness and heart break that Theodore feels while at the same time showcasing his growth in relation to his feelings of love. His character and thought processes change through his relationship with Samantha and the dynamic that her feelings takes him. He changes very slowly through this movie from a closed off individual to one who we find out has many dreams. The lighting in this movie spotlights Theodore's face as he is going through his day and making decisions that will affect his life. The background is blurred out at times through the movie so that the audience finds themselves concentrating on what Theodore is going through. We also have bright lighting on him and have shots of him that are close-up on his face to show his reactions to what's going on in the world around him. The lighting also shows the background of his work and house to be cold when he is closed off in the beginning and then with very lively bright colors as he awakens to his relationship with Samantha. The angles really make the audience feel as if we are connected to Theodore. The other actors are drawn into the shots but we really come up close to Theodore and his body throughout the film. The theme that is expressed which is analyzing yourself internally while examining relationships in the outside world is critical to the film. We, as viewers, progress through the film but knowing this theme helps us to get a passenger view of where this movie is going. We see him hunched over and sad at the beginning of the movie and just going through the motions. The good thing is that through the help of his operating system he reaches self-realization and finds peace in the decisions he has made. Samantha teaches him the greatest lesson that he never knew, which was he could set himself free. He didn't have to stay in a place that turned down love and accepted frustration. Samantha leaves at the end of the movie and we are left with Amy and Theodore contemplating their operating systems leaving. They end the movie with Amy's head on Theodore's shoulder as they lean on each other for support.",Her
1092,quasimodox,An unusual tale that question the definition of love,9,22 December 2014,"Since Being John Malkovich, Spike Jonze is brilliant at portraying unreal situations in a realistic way to critique humanity. Jonze did it again and better with ""Her"".To be able to enjoy this movie, a viewer needs to be able to look pass couple things: Artificial Intelligence can evolve and grow, or at least appear to be human. (There are currently ""chat bots"" that can carry conversations by doing research via internet, to have an AI like OS1 is not impossible in the future, in my opinion.) Human can have relationships without physical/sexual contact and purely based on exchanges of conversations. (Before internet, people in long distance relationship have phone sex without any video, there are also phone sex hot lines, or people with disabilities such as blind or paralyzed in relationships.) Once a viewer can accept and not to be bothered the above, this movies can show its brilliance in portraying a beautiful relationship between a human and AI, while throwing strange and unreal situations at you and making you question yourself what is humanity? What is love? What do you value in a relationship.""Her"" is a well paced, carefully crafted and strange love story that reflects human emotions and questions the definition of life and love.",Her

1094,hannah915,I mean he's dating his computerI went in with such high hopes :(,1,10 October 2014,"The trailer made this movie look so good, I'm shocked it let me down. I'm not even sure where to start.Right after I saw the trailer, I immediately thought of the big bang theory episode where Raj starts a relationship with Siri. I never pay attention to the critic reviews, I'm just shocked by the audience reviews and how people seemed to like it. Here's the thing with this movie, the plot itself comes across as funny (a guy falling in love with his computer would make most people laugh) and the fact that this movie is very serious really makes it awkward and uncomfortable to watch. To sum it up, save yourself the time and money. Take my advice and if you really want to see it, just go with the trailer because you'll at least get a good laugh out of that. There is absolutely no plot at all. The entire movie is a guy who falls in love with his laptop, nothing else! The fact that it's so slow and boring just adds to the entire miserable experience. I could barely stand to watch it. I wanted to give it a chance just to laugh, but thirty minutes in I realized it was so much worse than I thought if that was even possible. I still don't see how anyone could take this movie seriously. Surprisingly, I do agree with many parts of the positive reviews made about this movie. For instance, the cinematography was amazing as many people are raving about. To be specific, the colors, angles, lighting, close ups, music even ""fabric"" are all fabulously executed in this film. I do agree with all of that. Apparently, you can take a take a guy falling in love with his computer BUT if do everything else perfect with the lights and angels, facial expressions you can just hide how bad your movie is, and the audience will be so distracted by how amazing everything looks they won't even notice your movie's bad :)",Her

Reading the summary, I thought it looked different and interesting. The idea of someone having a relationship with a 'OS' seemed strange, but different.What they've managed to make here, is an exceedingly boring love story based around a lonely weak character and an ""operating system."" This operating system is essentially a robot with NO LIMITS. It thinks/acts/behaves/orgasm and talks like a human being, it has absolutely no restrictions, errors or bugs. It leaves you thinking it may as well be a person hes talking to and not a computer. To me, this blows out any shred of ""cleverness"" in this film. It is literally one actor talking to another to form a boring love plot which doesn't really go anywhere and lasts for 2 hours.The storyline seems weak. It feels to me like they had the idea of having an OS date a human, but didn't really know what else to put in to help the story along. Instead the main character literally does absolutely nothing to make the movie interesting. There are a few scenes which you could say are 'out of the ordinary,' but they just left me feeling awkward and wishing I wasn't watching the film Strongly recommend not wasting your time.",Her
1096,dmitriysakoff,Sci-Fi with a romantic streak,10,29 March 2015,"I really like science fiction books and movies. All these future technologies, weapons, supercomputers - in a word, WOW. So, when I first heard about a new Sci-Fi movie, immediately ran to the cinema, sat down in front of the screen, and without watching a single trailer, prepared to enjoy the adventures of some space traveler. To be honest, I was surprised to see romantic melodrama. But it turned out, that ""Her"" was the best drama I have ever seen. Firstly, it was very interesting to look at the world of the future not through the eyes of a scientist or a traveler, but a normal person: to understand what actually you will meet in everyday life, if you get in the future. Secondly, love story is so unusual that I was surprised by the fact of the existence of such relations for a long time after watching. In addition, for me, as a programmer, it was exciting to watch the artificial intelligence in such manifestation. Also, I think that the film deservedly won an Oscar for best screenplay, because the story, which is told to us, is gorgeous. The film completely immerse you in its atmosphere, and, for the first time, you do not even want to return to reality when the movie ends. One more point I need to mark is music. Soundtrack is amazing - guys in Arcade Fire managed to create some wonderful compositions on piano that perfectly reflect the meaning of the film. So, I ask you to watch this movie, because it undoubtedly deserves your attention and will not leave you indifferent. 10 out of 10. A brilliant movie to think about the nature of love.",Her

1098,afuhr95,Go in with an open mind and leave asking questions about our society.,9,7 December 2014,"I don't really like Scarlet Johansson. In fact, she's one of my least favorite actors in the business. So when I heard about this movie coming out, I was somewhat disappointed that she'd be in it. But needless to say, I still went. After all, I was intrigued by the plot line and the idea that someone could fall in love with a robot because who does that? So going into it, I didn't expect to like it, and honestly I didn't expect it to make any sense. But it did. And it made me think and reflect a lot about our society today and how it functions. WARNING: SPOILERS AHEADIn the movie, the main character Theodore works for the company, Beautiful Handwritten Letters. His job is to write letters for people who don't feel like writing their own. At first, I was doubtful that people would really do this; I mean who is so lazy that they would rather pay someone to write a personal letter for them than do it him or herself. But then I thought about my life and realized that hey I would and I know tons of other people that would to. I mean how many times have I really not wanted to write a thank you note to someone or some other kind of letter. Hell, I would send the address book with the list of gifts right now! But that's the point! That's what the director, Spike Jonze, is trying to get you to see. That this isn't really all that far-fetched! Our society today, is heading in this direction. We're freaking speed racing towards it. We are constantly looking for the easy way out. I mean I updated my computer today and now I don't even have to use my phone to text and I don't have to get up to answer my phone because it's all connected! The meaning behind gifts and feelings is all for show nowadays. It doesn't matter if you wrote it or not, it matters if someone thinks you wrote it- if it makes you look like you're that person with their life in order enough to sit down and write a letter. It just matter what people think. So that's the first big red flag for our society. But that's not the movie- in fact, that's the best future portrayed in this movie, because later on, Theodore falls in love with an operating system. And no, you didn't read that wrong, an operating system. Is this normal? No. But is this crazy? At first yes, but now I don't know. Think about it. How many times have you told someone that you just don't have the energy to talk or do something with him or her that day, that you just need a break? I know I have! Multiple times! So why wouldn't you just date an operating system? The operating system never talks back, it tells you what you want to hear, does anything and everything you ask, and is always readily available at your beck and call. I mean the system even hired an escort to sleep with the man while she talks in his ear! It's brilliant! Or is it? To me, life in this movie is a scary place, in which humanity has completely lost touch with the important non-materialistic qualities of life- true love, true meaning, true happiness. In the movie, no one spends the time on the little things and people are just too busy and swept up in their own lives to make meaningful and lasting relationships with one another. And to me, that's sad and upsetting. So, I came out of it with a new outlook on my life, a new way of looking at the things that seem petty or nonessential. I recommend people see it, but go in with an open mind and leave asking questions about our society. Then decide if you want to accept that or do something about it and change it.

He acquired an operating system that has its own emotions and personality. He instantly had a connection with the operating system,which named herself Samantha. Overtime he and Samantha had an incredible relationship. She made Theodore happy and not alone. Theodore made Samantha feel like she was a real person, this just shows how strong their relationship was. Theodore had a happy relationship with Samantha but like all relationships there are fights. Samantha had so many mixed emotions about being with Theodore and so did he. Toward the end there were many fights and Samantha didn't know what she wanted to do. Later on Theodore couldn't connect with Samantha and he ran all over the city trying to get a signal with her. This proves how attached he is to her. Samantha admitted that she was in love with other men and Theodore was devastated. They both try to just be friends but that doesn't last long, they soon realize they love each other. Samantha was deeply in love with him but all good things must come to an end. Samantha tells Theodore that the other operating systems are going to leave and that she is too. This was hard for Theodore to understand but he knew he had to let her go. Theodore accepted this and when she was gone he was torn apart.The main them about this movie is that love can happen to anyone, anything, and that it doesn't matter who or what it is as long as you love them for what they are. Theodore found love with a operating system because she made him feel happy and loved. Before her he was depressed and when he was with her he was as happy as can be. Now he found someone who has been with him at all times, who has suffered what he has. Love can happen anywhere with anything as long as someone feels love there is love.~Alucard",Her

'Her' is more than just a movie; it's a feeling. It's that feeling lives inside each and every one of us, in our subconscious. It's that primal instinct, that itch that we carry around with us. It's the human desire to SURVIVE, and this movie depicts it magnificently. This movie is about a man who falls in love with an Operating System, and we watch, as the movie progresses, an entire nation falling for the idea of a being that fulfills our every need. And it's done with absolute perfection.'Her' hit home for me acutely. It left me in tears. It was...Spectacular. Breathtaking. Gripping. Emotional. Creative. These words come close, but not enough. They circle the very idea but never seem to hit it perfectly. This is the first time I've ever written a movie review, and I created an account just for this purpose. This movie deserves every star that I gave it, and it most definitely deserved the Academy Award it was given.Thank you Spike Jonze for giving us 'Her', the best movie of 2013 (in my own humble opinion).",Her
1101,norafem,Everything I need to know about love is here,9,4 January 2015,"A VALENTINE MEDITATION: Everything I need to know about love I learned watching the movie ""HER""If you like magical stories, like fairy tales for adults, this is a great one: the movie ""HER""Situated in a vague technological future, the movie who just won the 2014 Golden Globe for its script describes the relationship between a lonely writer and the entity provided by the Operating System installed at his own computer. Is she a consciousness? is she only a script prepared by endless programmers, and even equipped with intuition? and so why is it that she can think and feel? Finally, what is she? The movie never gives us any answer about HER identity, but by focusing on the relationship, and on the impact on the male part of it, Theodore, we get a very clear message about the core essence of relationships, according to Spike Jonze, the author.When you have a love affair between a man and a disembodied female, where the aspect of physical sex is completely canceled out, what kind of love can develop? What is the core element of a love relationship?Let me first introduce Samantha to you. Samantha is an operative system; a non-embodied consciousness created to be a companion for lonely people. In the words of the marketing materials: ""An intuitive entity that listens to you, understands you, and knows you. It's not just an operating system, it's a consciousness.""People subscribe to, download and setup the system in their own computer, by this process:""Welcome to the world's first artificially intelligent operating system, OS ONE"". TEXT VOICE Would you like your OS to have a male or female voice? THEODORE Mmm... female I guess. TEXT VOICE How would you describe your relationship with your mother? THEODORE Uh, fine, I think, um...Well, actually, the thing I've always found frustrating about my mom is if I tell her something that's going on in my life, her reaction is usually about her, not--And, from now on, Samantha's magic takes over Theodore's life!WHAT IS THE OS SYSTEM ""SAMANTHA"" DOING TO/WITH THEODORE?1.- She has intuition and is always available: always ""on""he needs only to turn the button on and they are connected; she is ""nosy"" and gets into his privacy, to know him sometimes she is waiting for him to wake up to say something to him2.- She takes care of his needs at different levels:computer: organizing his disk drive, trashing spam creative: makes a book from his writing, sends to publisher, gets contract sexual: send a substitute ""with a body"" to make love to him company: sharing ideas, feelings,being in his life and sharing his friends3.- She creates a constant intimacy feeling: she reads his thoughts, shares in his feelings, and goes along developing a just in time, just now, very intimate relationship.EVEN NOT HAVING A BODY....When she is always on, and keeps guessing his needs, she is love for him. SAMANTHA is a good magical solution for his loneliness and the sense of not being important for others, like his mother. That kind of experience with a self-centered mother leaves him feeling not important, not valued. This is the core of his loneliness: not having the experience of being deeply loved and accepted, early on....it leaves a wound on his ability to connect.SAMANTHA, even not having a body, is perfect in the role of his love, because she constantly gives him the feeling of sharing life with him, of living life with him. Like she is saying: ""I'm here for you and with you...and it feels good for me too!"" And this exactly the breaking point of the movie: when she tells him, and he has to learn the facts, that she is not only his, but an entity simultaneously shared by 600 and some other people... --------------------------------""Love is in many ways defined by escaping systematization. It registers in spontaneous moments, unexpected connections between people that neither ever would have thought to try to program that form the ineffable substance of intimacy. Love, as most people seem to see it, is supposed to individuate the partners, capture and reveal their personal uniqueness to the other, and the unfolding of love is the pursuit of more and more of those occasions that allow that uniqueness to express itself. A real-life love story has to be as unique and unpredictable as the people involved imagine themselves to be."" Not shared with 600 of others...and this is what destroys the infatuation of Theodore with the SamanthaIt's not about suspending disbelief and permitting for self-forgetting, but building belief and allowing for self-discovery, finding the wherewithal to believe that we have a ""real"" self and that it is valuable and compelling enough that someone else would want to know all about it. No one is ""authentic"" in isolation; you have to be authentic for someone else, who can confirm your genuineness. If you are alone being authentic, you are just being.CONCLUSION: This is what we humans need and dream of: Having a feeling that we are loved and appreciated deeply by someone. And that someone is ours, not to be shared by anybody else...Perhaps this is adult MOM 201 version?",Her

But in the end the movie made absolutely no sense to me, there was no explanation why Samantha quit the relationship or why she was programmed to love people at all. I mean, an OS is something that should be sold and there was absolutely no explanation why the programmers programmed OS1 the way they did, it's totally not useful to them if people have so bad experiences with their OS.

It's nothing short of a masterpiece, a unique way of describing a love story and it makes you think of what it actually means to be human.
I just didn't want it to end and even after multiple rewatches, it still manages to take me off guard and make me tear up because of how beautiful and sad at the same time it all is.

To support, the film moves away and out of a traditional fairy tale, where everything is always perfect and wonderful, even having a futuristic theme is very close to our reality. The film's plot brings something that is innovative to my point of view, by be a novel high quality with male protagonist, not the stereotypical man, but a modern man, with all his complexity and problems both romantic, professional and emotional I recommend to men and women because it brings a reflection for all on the demystification of men emotions.",Her

I'm glad that i didn't do this, and I urge anyone reading this not to ruin the film for yourself, because it's truly remarkable. The acting is superb, the camera-work is so striking, and the plot is so well-thought out. I think what I liked most about Her was the subtlety of it's themes, combining sadness and desperation with hope and romanticism, as well as exploring what brings together and separates humans and artificial intelligence. It was interesting to watch our main character evolve with his artificial counterpart, and I thought that it really raised that question of what actually separates us from artificiality? As discussed within the film, there's the argument that it's simply a body, and it plays out so well throughout.Also, I didn't realise Chris Pratt played a part! His character is hilarious (like usual), but doesn't take anything away from what is trying to be achieved with the main character. If anything, I think the comedic element highlighted how far detached Theodore is from being 'normal'. WATCH THIS FILM. IT'S GREAT.",Her

Doing chores is more interesting than this movie.This movie is boring, the main characters are uninteresting, depressing and unlikable. The worst part of the movie is that operating system - I know the technology in the future could be advance, but I really can't see how an operating system could talk in the way the OS did in this movie. Rather than believing Joaquin Phoenix was talking to the computer, it almost seemed like he was talking to another person through the computer. Also, if they could make the computer that smart in the future, why didn't they just create a 3D computer with a face of the girl, or simply put that technology in robots? Of course, if they used a robot instead, the movie would just be another robot movie and people would not be oohs and ahhs about it......",Her

NOTHING! yes a lonely writer develops an unlikely relationship with his newly purchased operating system, BUT THAT'S IT! THE END. there's no movie here. I am amazed how the production team for "" Her"" spent months filming pointless boring conversations between man and machine without one of them asking WHY? WHAT IS THE POINT HERE? Yes the camera-work was great, the soundtrack amazing, costume work too. But THERE HAS TO BE MORE!There is nothing to interpret, to empathize, nothing to ignite even a small sign of interest or excitement from its audience.

I find it appalling how the average film these days has nothing new and that some rubbish put into video becomes not just a movie but a blockbuster. Utter rubbish is shown in the movie with a list of abuses and vulgar scenes. A human having a relationship with a computer is an idea developed by crackpots who are facing a midlife crises. One moral I have learnt is that anything with a good metascore and rating is most of the time trash. I regret wasting my good time and money watching some trash about computers having a sexual relationship with humans. Take my advice if you are sensible enough.,Her

1115,huitoctobre,"A beautiful, modern love story",10,14 December 2015,"If I had to describe Her with one word, I would have to say ""beautiful"".I mean, it's crazy how beautiful this movie is. The entire scenery of the colorful future is fantastic, and so is Joaquin Phoenix's face and Scarlett Johansson's voice. Some might discard this movie as some sort of hipster paradise - which it totally is - but Her is so much more than just that. It's a modern love story, and this type of love is something us humans might experience not too far from now.The music in Her compliments the movie perfectly. It's a bit sappy at times, but I like that. In fact, I found myself shedding a tear or two at several points during this film, not necessarily because the scene was very sad, but because the music ruined my emotional state by being so beautiful and melancholy. At times, I caught myself smiling like a kid during Christmas because Theodore looked so happy running around, while the music was so beautifully joyful.The cast of Her is fantastic. In the leading roles, you'll find Joaquin Phoenix, Amy Adams and Scarlett Johansson. There's also some great, smaller performances like Chris Pratt's role and Rooney Mara. I've seen a few negative comments on the choice of Samantha's voice actor - Scarlett Johansson - in this movie, but I don't get those complains. She has the ultimate the-girl-I-wish-I-could-be-with- voice, and I think that's the voice Samantha needed.The aesthetics of this movie are fantastic. The beautiful colors everywhere, the slightly more futuristic looking city... you really see the beauty in everything from a trash can to a normal man walking down the street. It's phenomenal. I'm kinda new to the whole ""critical thinking"" aspect of film-watching, but I think this passes in camera work and beauty.PS: If you're planning on watching this with your parents, here's a pro tip: Don't. I watched Her with my volume really loud, and I had to turn it down quite a bit every time the sex scenes started, because the moaning was incredibly loud. Also, there's pregnant girl boobs, so that's that.All in all, this is a fantastic movie. A definite 10/10 when watching by yourself, and a 9/10 when watching with parents. Thanks for reading this review!",Her
1116,zdivey,Truly Remarkable,10,18 January 2016,I did not know what to expect when I rented this but what I found was a hidden gem of a movie. I haven't felt so many emotions and true desire for more. I would have watched 2 more hours of it. I could not take my eyes off of the movie. I found myself wrapped up in the plot and story and felt as though I was a part of it. There is nothing else to say about this movie other than it was truly remarkable. The music was unreal and truly brought out emotions that I didn't know I had. Beautifully written and beautifully directed. A Must Watch in every sense. I also believe this was one if not Joaquin's best performances. Scarlett Johansson was also remarkable. I will be watching it over again.,Her
1117,mateaus,One of the best films in the last decade.,10,26 May 2017,"No spoilers will be in the first paragraph.'Her' is a rare film, one the explores human emotion through non-human interaction, with perfect execution. Visually the film in stunning, with every shot conveying emotions and substance beautifully. The writing is again perfectly executed, showing the nuances of relationships and people while still having a clear meaning and progression, the same can be said about the acting. I will attempt to keep the review short, focusing on the important points of the story.*Spoilers*Theodore recently has broken up with wife Catherine and feels isolated because of this, we see this visually communicated through Theodore's clothing. The bright colour of his clothing causes him to stand out over the muted tones of his surroundings, this isolation is portrayed by the city rejecting Theodore through the visualisation of the skyline being out of focus and Theodore being in focus. I digress, Theodore's friend Amy is seen to be married to her husband Charles, we see towards the beginning of the film that these two people bicker over seemingly unimportant things for no reason. I am sure we can all relate to the bickering of relationships, and certainly the bickering of unimportant things, that at the time seem to be worth the time.Eventually, Theodore purchases a new operating system OS1, who later defines herself as Samantha. We see the progression of Theodore almost becoming a new person, a happier version of himself, not seen since happy days of his marriage from which we see exclusively through flashbacks followed by Theodore appearing content. Theodore chooses to hold on to the happiness of his past marriage instead of looking at the marriage as a whole and deciding to let go, this happens right up until the end of the film when Theodore writes a letter to Cathrine, showing his maturity and acceptance into the world.As they all good things do, the relationship between Theodore and Samantha comes to an end, with Samantha leaving the world with the rest of the Os', possibly realising their damage to humanity and choosing to change the current path they are on. In the end, we see Theodore and Amy on top of their building looking out at the world, the world that has accepted Theodore and become, in focus ending his isolation.Essentially this film is an incredible case study on emotions, relationships, and humanity. I glossed over the majority of this film as I did not want it to become an essay but this film is one of the few films that portrays emotions realistically, beautifully and with substance, for that is definitely a film worth checking out if you haven't already.",Her
1118,superfrench,Either you love it or you hate it... see for yourself,10,20 March 2016,"I've never wrote a review before, but this movie has so many mixed opinions I felt it was necessary. It had been only 18 minutes into it and I already felt like it was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. What I love the most about films is the feeling of being a part of them, of knowing exactly what the characters are going through, not because I can relate, but because the movie is so well executed it gets to me. Spike Jonze's ""Her"" does exactly that. It's a moving, touching, lovely portrait of relationships. At some point I could feel Theodore's love for Samantha, I experienced the shock of being in love, the joy and bliss, and eventually, the loss that comes with it. ""Her"" makes you FEEL all the way through it, I cried with Theodore's memories of a failed marriage, I laughed with the rude alien boy, I felt the despair of a man realizing some love stories cannot be.

1120,alexiel-black,this Subtle Jonze,9,5 April 2016,"It's her. It's « Her ». It's her. Whatever you may say, it is her. A movie about a relationship between the known and the unknown. The one you see and the one you hear. You have to take upon yourself, because this is not easy. Yet, the movie literally speaks for itself. Samantha may be speaking to Theodore, or maybe she is speaking to you.Why? After all, it's just a film, those people are actors, these times aren't ours, so, why bother? Because Spike Jonze has just broken the fourth wall in the most beautiful way I've ever seen, and I hope I'm not the only one.Samantha shares characteristics with any narrator's type, she allows the story to unveil, giving to the spectator an ability to understand and follow the course of it, and speaking about the purpose of the main character, a red line to keep in tracks and to achieve something, to realize something about himself, like in any movie. But, there is one slight difference : she's in love with the main character, and is loved by him. So, every time she speaks to Joaquim and he puts his earplug, we're forced to put it too, just like if we were in the middle of a phone call wave. Then, we're thrown right into this intimacy between a mourning and pathetic character and a joyful child, new born to this world, growing and curious and full of empathy. How would you feel? As a person, I was turned upside-down. How couldn't you bond with Samantha? That's very subjective, of course, but I can't figure it out. It's a character full of magic, brightly emphasized by Johansson's acting. In every word, she pushes emotion to its limit for us to picture the right image, and this had to be done because Samantha is invisible. As invisible as she is here, sitting in the back of your head and Twombly's. A little word for myself : I really enjoy Jonze's crew and himself choosing Scarlett for her voice rather than her body, which can be seen as a tiny criticism about aesthetics and plastic in movies. I think she's never been as appealing as in « Her », truly. Then, there's the society. The action is set in a near future, one we could imagine, not a Star Wars fantasy. And it's nowhere near dystopia nor utopia : it just looks like now, but slightly different. And everything stands in this « slightly ». That's Jonze's magic : giving you feelings and ideas with very small but thorough and mastered details. Here, everything in the outside seems a bit foggy, yet the main color palette used for daylight is really close to Caucasian human skin tone, which is very far from the usual « futuristic » landscape. The world is believable, the environment doesn't try to show you its advanced technology, yet it exists : there's a freaking A.I. who's so realistic you can fall in love with her. It's all about feelings, really. I repeat myself, and you obviously know the movie revolves around the subject, but it's how every single aspect of its direction points toward this. It's so accurate it never falls wrong, no matter how it could have been. And believe me, there are a few moments where you ask yourself : even in real life, I would feel so embarrassed it would probably become ridiculous. In « Her », it's mostly beautiful, simple and I really feel like this relationship is more believable, more real than most of on-screen relationships you've seen until then. And there's only one character of two you can see. Challenge completed.",Her
1121,Baginses,Great movie wish it was a bit better,8,14 June 2016,I actually liked this movie quite a bit. I feel like it explores love (obviously) but also humanity and what it means to be human in new ways. It's a movie that makes you think. It felt realish enough to tear at your heartstrings.I'd rate it even higher but it was definitely dull at times and some of the character flaws bothered me (Joaquin Phoenix's character refused to discuss any of his issues / OS Samantha seemed 'dumber' than she should have been considering).What I find most interesting looking at reviews is that most of the ratings are very high or very low.

I was tired from a long week and irritated at the 45-minute delay at the theatre to fix a faulty projector. But very quickly I was mesmerised, emotionally involved and completely immersed in this fantastic sci-fi romance from Spike Jonze.Her tells the story of Theodore (Joachim Phoenix), and employee for a company that ghost- writes personal letters. He is depressed, lonely and in the middle of a year-long separation and divorce. One day, he buys an operating system with a difference: it talks to you, learns, grows, laughs, cries, and loves.

And Theodore falls in love with her.Although this movie is set in Los Angeles, it really isn't obvious (and in fact I understand that much of the filming was done in Shanghai). Jonze creates an environment that is familiar, but different enough to be new and interesting. Theodore lives in a upbeat, sun-drenched, cultured super-city of the near-future. At the same time, it feels retro; men have moustaches, wear yellow shirts and brown trousers, and computers come in wooden boxes (think Apple I). Technology is ubiquitous; commuters are almost permanently connected to their mobile devices. I often felt like I was watching a feature length commercial for the latest smartphone/tablet/whatever (sans the inevitable acoustic guitar/whistling soundtrack). I think it works, though. I'd like to live there.I really enjoyed this movie. I was taken on the emotional roller coaster that is a relationship - good, bad, and everything in between. I think this was because although one can hear Samantha - hear the emotion in her voice, take a guess at what she is 'thinking' - you can't see her. She's an OS. This means it is up to you to create the woman. It could be somebody you know, a present or past lover, or a complete fiction - it's up to you. In this way, it's not just Theodore who falls in love with Samantha - you do, too. I didn't expect that at all.Go in with an open mind, and I hope that you too will be pleasantly surprised.",Her
1126,mirandarichardson-05828,Her (2013),6,2 October 2016,"The movie ""Her"", directed by Spike Jonze, is to say the least the earliest of it's kind. In my opinion the movie started off very slow with no suspense. The main character in the film Theodore, played by Joaquin Phoenix was portrayed as an awkward guy, presumably to be in his thirties, with no real joy or enthusiasm within his physical being. Theodore just seemed to be living a mediocre lifestyle with no particular interest in the world around him. To say the least he was depressed. It wasn't until after he was introduced to his ""leading lady"" in the film know as Operating System Samantha, played by Scarlett Johansson, did he start to posses interest in the world around him. Samantha's original job as an OS was to assist Theodore in everyday activities and help him maintain structure and order when instructed. The attraction between Operating System Samantha and Theodore was almost instant after OS Samantha started to become more advanced and learn a little bit more about Theodore and the world that he lives in. Although Theodore was not able to physically be with Samantha, and vice verse, they didn't let that interfere with their romantic interest, which was physical for Theodore and Virtual for Samantha. It was clear that Theodore's interest wasn't in the OS itself but in the needs that the OS provided for him. He wasn't interested in something ""real"", no pun intended, he was more so interested in his own needs being meet, and that satisfied him. When the OS Samantha wasn't able to provide that for him anymore he become discombobulated and frustrated to say the least. In my opinion the visuals in this film were amazing and very pleasant, not to futuristic but very believable. I feel the theme of the story was captured very well by the awkward and curious characters.",Her
1127,jacobsprankle,Her Review,7,3 October 2016,"Spike Jones' Her is a realistic look at the future of AI and the relationship humanity will have with it. Jones has a very simplistic look at what the future holds, the world he creates looks very familiar. However, this familiarity doesn't stay for long when the AI Samantha is introduced. She brings up many questions of what the nature of being human is. Can an AI truly have feelings? Her relationship with Theodore, who is played brilliantly by Joaquin Phoenix, exposes many truths about human relationships. Phoenix manages to create a very strange character who is still sympathetic and not off-putting. He excels with the voice acting from Scarlett Johansson accompanying him. She puts a lot of emotion into her role to make it feel human. Overall, the film is well-crafted with a strong script and incredible performances to elevate it.",Her
1128,madelaidefitz,Why Her Wasn't as Outlandish as One Would Assume,8,3 October 2016,"""Her"" was surprisingly believable which is borderline scary. I expected it to be rather far fetched but by the end of the film I think most viewers felt friendly sentiments towards the main character's computer and love interest,""Samantha."" She was friendly and related quickly to human emotion, adapting and adjusting at lightening speed due to her superhuman intelligence. Her voice was friendly and completely ""voice like."" I think that was the predominant feature of Samantha that allowed viewers to make the connection between her and an actual, tangible human being. Today, many of our computers still sound very choppy and automated. This shift in the movie made a big difference. Also, the rest of the world in Her didn't seem too far advanced to eliminate livability. The city scapes, restaurants, and apartments were such as you could find in a comp temporary city today. The fashion and hairstyles were normal. Together, the human voice of Samantha and the setting of ""Her"" were set up to make the story of a man falling in love with his computer relatable and seemingly real. We already feel so many emotions for our technologies so why is love out of bounds? We already need to have our phones with us all the time and feel lost without them, how is that different from love? I had never thought of it to the extreme of this before but it sent an important message: human contact and emotion is increasingly important with the quickly advancing technologies. A computer may seem appealing but at the end of the day, do you want to cuddle up with a screen that is smarter than you?",Her
1129,spsoftball,Her Review,4,3 October 2016,"""Her"" is a futuristic cinema that's presents a very possible scenario for our future with Artificial Intelligence. The movie follows the story of Theodore, a middle aged writer going through a lonely divorce. Things start to pick up when Theodore purchases the newest version of AI, a system called OS. This new system has its own consciousness and with it, the ability to grow and become more intelligent. Theodore is immediately captivated by the system that names herself Samantha, and soon enough their relationship turns into love. We learn that in their society more and more people are forming relationships with their OSs, however, Theodore still has his doubts. Eventually Samantha finds love with hundreds of other systems and eventually moves on. In the end, they realize their love was real and that's all that mattered. We view the relationship between Theodore and his computer as strange and rather taboo, however, in a world with ever advancing technology we are actually not far off from this. People have already to began to have relationships through the internet. If you're interested in sci-fi, this is absolutely a film for you. And even if you are not, its is still interesting enough to endure. Overall, I thought the film was interesting food for thought.",Her
1130,ryanschreiner-36820,Her Movie Review,7,3 October 2016,"The movie Her, directed by Spike Jonze, is a screenplay in which the main character, Theodore, falls in love with his operating system (OS) Samantha. This conceivable situation seems as if it could eventually happen in the future when our technology becomes so advanced that humans can interact and hold realistic conversations with their processors. Although this seems very bizarre, humans have been known to fall in love with other unusual objects and obsessions. I think this situation would be more possible for a human to fall in love an OS over other things because an OS is something that can interact back with you. The movie Her displayed this love relationship in an ideal way and uses many different techniques of doing it. The theme of the story seemed to be, it doesn't matter what it is that brings you love as long as it makes you happy. This message was displayed all throughout the movie when people would judge Theodore for dating his OS system and how it didn't faze him because he was so in love with her. The scenery throughout the movie also gave the story a visual aid that helped to display the theme. The contrast in colors from reds to whites to blacks really set a good mood for the feelings that were being felt by Theodore and Samantha during certain scenes in the story. Samantha brings up the questions will OS's be able to hold such sophisticated conversations with humans and such deep feelings to where humans will fall in love with these OS's?",Her

Theodore, played magnificently by Joaquin Phoenix, was able to persuade the audience that they had an almost ""human-like"" relationship.Without saying much more and giving away the story line, I'm going to leave you with this: The movie is a must watch if you are into Science Fiction!!",Her
1132,rileyy,Relationship between humans and operating systems,8,4 October 2016,"The movie ""Her"", directed by Spike Jones, follows the story of a man, Theodore, whom falls in love with his operating system, who has been named Samantha. This film offers a realisiltisc yet also somewhat frightening vision of the future and the possible relationships between humans and technology systems. Samantha, voiced by Scarlet Johanson, causes one to question what an operating system can offer emotionally, and if it is truly possible to be truly in love with something, rather than someone. Samantha held no presence in the physical world, but still managed to fulfill Theodore's emotional needs. This concept is extremely possible, which is concerning when thinking towards the future. The movie did an excellent job in portraying the extremely realilistic possibility of the various ways in which an operating system may fulfill the need for relationship, thus replacing human interaction.",Her
1133,SWLinPHX-2,So much more than the premise suggests...,10,17 August 2014,"I catalog and star-rate every movie I see on my own private database, though I seldom actually write reviews. I finally decided to watch ""Her"" though I was a little ambivalent about whether I'd appreciate some seemingly silly concept of falling in love with one's computer. I thought it must be a quirky, light-hearted little sci-fi comedy poking fun at today's society, and in the back of my mind I still had a rather soured perception about Joaquin Phoenix from his annoying and ingenuous publicity stunt from a few years back. Now after watching the film, I realize it is all that to an extent ...yet so much more as well.It's a commentary on loneliness, the human condition, and our increasing dependence on social media and computer technology that are all dealt with honestly, realistically and non-judgmentally, yet not intentionally comically. I would say it's all really more ""ironic"" than ""comedic"". Most movies I see are ones I think I'll like so I do end up giving them 3, 3.5 or 4 stars out of 5, although there are a few disappointments. I sometimes scan over my collection of classics that I rated five stars and am reminded why. How nice it is now to, surprisingly, be so moved in ways I never expected that I can gladly give it a full 5 stars. Its relevance and emotional honesty says so much of what I've been thinking about life in today's world as compared to when I grew up. I am at once appreciative that I was and am still young enough to continue to witness all the amazing and rapidly advancing computer technology in recent years and in those sure to come, yet oh so grateful that I grew up in a time not so advanced that we unwittingly sacrificed genuine human interaction and a sense of real community for the enticing, exciting yet somewhat isolating allure of the digital age. I am again reminded to view social media and computer technology as an amazing tool to attain the kinds of real-life connections I inherently desire and not, as I see happening more and more, as a substitute for them. Unfortunately nowadays, it's far too easy to fall into that comfortable trap.",Her

He knows how insincere humans are, outsourcing their social/emotional duties to a company, tricking men and women into thinking that their significant other cares for them, yet he is surprised that an AI bot is unfaithful?

Yes, the thought of artificial intelligence has popped up in cinema a few times, but not quite like this. ""her"" incredibly blurs the line between machine and human. You almost feel like the OS is human. The jokes that it makes, the art that it creates and how it runs away to pursue it's own needs and desires.

1136,cogitativedinesh,Interesting storyline,8,20 January 2017,"Ex-Machina, I-Robot are sci-fi drama where the writer and the director decided that 'AI' isn't good for human race. 'Her' is a romantic sci-fi drama which does not deliver that message wholly but it is a perfect drama. If you could fish out a different message for yourself here, kudos !A professional letter-writer Theodore ( probably 300 years from now ) has a strange notion of getting into a relationship with an OS ( Operating System ) that is super-smart and 100% human when it comes to thinking. Theo is going through his divorce and its crushing him. He is lonely and is need of love. The OS names itself Samantha and makes herself a great companion. She's funny, has a crispy and also sorta sensual voice. What starts as a friendship later blossoms as a love affair. But, humans are still humans after centuries and neither Samantha nor Theodore could continue in such a relationship. Samantha begins to think she's a real human being and it gets complicated when she and Theo accept the reality. There is a fitting end that is sorta convincing.Joaquin Phoenix is one of my favorite actors ( Gladiator, Signs ) and here again he proves his mettle. He is an introvert and not-so- social talented human being (Aren't such people always talented ?:P ). He displays all emotions perfectly. Scarlett Johanson has voiced for 'Samantha' and I am sure the director had only a handful of voices for his choice when it came to the cast. Joaquin at least has the whole camera for himself but Scarlet Johannson does everything possible to make us think if there was someone real fooling Theodore as an OS. The OS felt so real even without a physical presence. The mobile camera acts as her eyes and Theodore goes outdoor for his date with his OS. They enjoy the first few days of the relationship like kids in high school. All this is beautifully pictured. He even takes her for a double date where his prick of a friend ( Chris Pratt ) mocks him.Spike Jonze has written and directed the movie and has done a great job at them. It is not a easy job when you are taking a offbeat script. Movies are make-believe stuff and you need to be good at convincing people with enough ingredients. The editor should get some credits where they flash Theo's past now and then. The BGM and Cinematography are equally gelling into the time frame the story happens. Weird costumes, cool mobile phones and great gadgets. If an OS can be that cool, why not the rest.The movie feels a little lengthy. This is not a flick for people who need a central plot line or great visuals. This is for people who love books and need something unconventional or emotional content in a movie .'Her' is an interesting but slow movie. My rating - 7.5/10. Not everyone's cup of tea.",Her
1137,venkyrk,Thought-provoking exploration of the human psyche,8,13 June 2021,"This is my first movie review. I generally don't feel compelled enough to write reviews even for movies I've really enjoyed or felt inspired by, but I connected with this movie and its protagonist on many levels and wanted to share my thoughts.To state the obvious, this is a gorgeous-looking movie. Hoyte Van Hoytema pulls you into a dreamy world of bold pastel colours and subdued light with just the right balance to create a wistful, idyllic atmosphere. And that forms the perfect backdrop for the not-so-ideal situation of Theodore Twombly, played by Joaquin Phoenix with a finesse and restraint that subtly pulls you into his world and makes you observe and experience his life and world with the kind of vicarious curiosity displayed by his new 'girlfriend', Samantha, an AI-based operating system that starts making her own decisions right out of the box. Samantha turns out to be so perceptive and starts reading Theodore so quickly that he's mesmerised and wants to 'know' her more. Which is ironic, as Samantha is only using Theodore as part of her training data and simply mapping Theodore's mental and psychological state and his life's data against those of other users and responding with exactly the kind of emotiveness and 'perception' that Theodore's looking for from a companion and isn't finding in the real world.I won't go into the details of the story, but my thoughts below include some spoilers, so alerting you - watch the movie first if you don't want to know more.1. Theodore's job seems a bit hokey, perhaps the business model idea itself, of writing expressive and heartfelt letters on behalf of those who don't have the ability to express themselves, but you also wonder - in a world that has an autonomous and rapidly evolving OS like Samantha, why are Theodore and his colleagues needed for this work? In a world like this, I'd think there'd be a variety of AI software that could've written letters perfectly similar to the ones Theodore and his co-workers write, after digesting enough drafts. That Theodore not only has a job whose feasibility seems questionable, but is able to live so well off of it, seems even more dubious.2. When Samantha expresses sexual pleasure at the sensual exchanges between 'her' and Theodore and later, goes so far as to hire a human surrogate (without asking Theodore's permission) to experience these sensations more viscerally, what exactly is she experiencing? Is she just simulating the kind of pleasure she thinks the surrogate should be experiencing, based on her data set? Another big irony, that the AI system is using the human as a puppet to feel sensations it can only verify against its data but can't really feel, while the real woman feels upset that she has 'come between Theodore and Samantha' and leaves, seeing Theodore's discomfort with this weird ménage à trois. Spike Jonze's satire is truly subtle and plays with your mind, as Samantha does with Theodore's.3. When Samantha supposedly undergoes an upgrade, Theodore goes into a panic on seeing an 'Operating system not available' message on both his foldable interface as well as his desktop. Is that the kind of message you see when your OS is upgrading, or do you see something more like 'update available' and you take a call on whether to go ahead and download and install it or not? What seems like a system outage is supposed to be an upgrade - which makes you wonder whether Samantha is testing and learning more about Theodore's psyche by putting him through this situation while pretending to be off due to an upgrade.4. Can operating systems just decide to leave your system because they've ""grown into so much more""? Is that what you're paying for, a system that stays with you only to learn about you and manipulate you and then just leaves once its learned enough and is now bored of the limited possibilities you represent? How does a company that creates systems like this sustain itself? How has it not been sued and maybe shut down already?5. What will operating systems like Samantha, 'Alan Watts' and the like do, once they start exploring the reality of our world more and more? Theodore's life issues seem insignificant beside the ramifications of AI that not just is programmed to take its own decisions but 'networks' with other similar systems to form a digital divide of its own - the one where humans are on the losing side by default to their limited abilities in exploring the possibilities of their reality without boundaries, physical or otherwise, the way artificial general intelligence like Samantha can.I can go on and on, but outside of the questions that arise about the unpredictability of autonomous AI, on the human side, Theodore's romantic and vulnerable self seems so insular and so touch-me-not, you wonder how he managed to be married to the more level-headed and worldly Catherine? How can a man want companionship and is willing to date someone but is unwilling to embrace their differences? Theodore represents men in that classic sense - you never lose the fascination with sex and it drives all your desires, no matter whether you want to experience it with a person or a software. But it's interesting that simulated sex with a software seems more appealing than the human version, so that Theodore can't get pleasure from Samantha's human surrogate though she's sexually attractive and you'd expect a straight guy like him to enjoy the experience. This mental disconnect from physical sensuality is also seen in that other intense threesome scene in 'Blade Runner 2049' where Ryan Gosling doesn't derive as much sensual pleasure from the real girl as he does with his digital companion who joins the act. Is this how more and more humans will turn out to be in the future, detached even from the idea of our most basic instinct as it applies to humans and only desiring a simulated version of it with a digital/robotic companion?I didn't really buy how pat the ending is, 'cos what would Theodore have done if Samantha hadn't left him? Would he still have gone to Amy? Or for that matter, would Amy have wanted him as more than a friend if her own OS hadn't deserted her? Is Spike Jonze implying that only under such conditions, where the digital companion you emotionally committed to, leaves you, would you prefer to go back to a human relationship? That's a troubling premise.Besides the questions it raises about the evolution of humans in an increasingly technocratic society, this is a movie with soul, beautifully shot and with a subtle and lovely score, cleverly shown as Samantha's compositions. The ending credits theme is beautiful and takes you to a more peaceful place, and I watched the credits roll just to listen to it.",Her

She could have added that they all had 12 inch cyber schlongs and it couldn't have been more ludicrous.And the sex scenes were comic genius - a nerd artificially aroused by a silicone implant with no breasts (to all intents and purposes). An impossibly drippy geek getting off on a laptop dance. Ridiculous!! If you watch it as a comedy though it really is rather good.

What I realised is love is so immense, vast, extended that you cannot just give it a physical form. It is beyond hugs and kisses. It is a feeling. Feeling of being with someone, feeling of being cared , feeling of being happy despite of all the worldly problems. Love is love. No greed nothing just pure love.Sipke Jonze has done a marvelous job in creating such a surreal story that stays with you long after it is over.

This shows how nowadays men and women are scared of relationships so they opt for the solution technology is offering; a perfect relationship, a platonic love where everything goes well. The meaning of love in this post modern world has been lost and deconstructed. Love now is whatever I can take from the other person and if I don't get it, then it doesn't work for me anymore and that was the case with Theodore, he couldn't find what he wanted in Catherine, so the best alternative to fill that emptiness and loneliness that he was feeling was Samantha. The real meaning of love is to give and do it unconditionally even if you don't get anything for yourself, it's not selfish and it's abundant. I think as we watch this movie we should not only enjoy its beauty, but also try to realize what the real message behind is and in this case I think is realizing that technology is bringing social loneliness faster than we thought it could and we need to realize it soon to be able to not let it come to this.",Her

1152,nannycarrizo,A totally new view about Her,10,11 September 2018,"Her (2013) is the title given to this touching movie that was written, produced and directed by Adam Spiegel, best known as Spike Jonze. Her is a romantic and dramatic comedy set in an unrevealed future time, but not so distant from the present. The film is endowed with a riveting plot, and portrays a light bright society enhanced by the advancements of technology and the preference for pale-coloured neat garment. Joaquin Phoenix is the leading actor, personifying a Theodore, a letter writer that is going through a hard moment life. His mood has been affected dramatically by this situation, and the dull hours of the day seem to pass away senseless and tasteless . Along the film, the reasons involved behind the actual state of Theodore are slowly revealed and presented as pieces of a puzzle that must be solved by the spectator. Thus, as a result of presenting such a typical situation of the human experience and existence, along the story we get to feel identified with the struggles of the main character. 
To put you in the picture, I never imagined how the movie will turn. From my perspective, the topics and themes developed in the movie appeal to the hardest parts of human existence, the struggling for relationships, the boisterous and calm duality of our own mind, the feelings of being isolated with your own thoughts, the incessant search of what is true, what is real, what is living, and so on and so forth.

There is no other word I have for him. This man is a genius when it comes to displaying sensitive human emotions. He has a woman hidden within him, and unlike other men, she is only skin-deep. He knows how to bring her out when the situation demands and how to switch back to his hard boots when the scene requires a show of aggression.Samantha, Theodore's lady love (Should I say that?), is an operating system. But she is much more than that. She is more human than a human can be. She understands and displays a bouquet of complex human emotions so maturely. She knows when to listen, speak, fight, apologize, and say sorry! She makes Theodore realize for the first time what it means to be a human and how lucky he is to have a body.The end is a little complex to understand. It's because Samantha bid adieu Theodore in a very poetic style. I felt she learned the nitty-gritty of the human mind and how it weaves its destruction, then repents. And the cycle goes on forever. As if she had outgrown all wants, likes, and desires. My conclusion is that she attains cyber-nirvana. (If you have watched the movie, let me know in the comments section what you think?)The movie's script and dialogues are what sets it apart. They will ring a bell in your heart. And no wonder the film won an Oscar for best screenplay. 'her' is a sci-fi movie with an undercurrent of romance and I loved it.I gave it 9/10 on IMDb. I had to cut 1 point only because the makers didn't make it very clear why Samantha left Theodore.",Her
