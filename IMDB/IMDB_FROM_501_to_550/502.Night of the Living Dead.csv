0,MartinHafer,"Considering the budget was a little over $39.50, it was an amazing film",7,2 August 2007,"I have never particularly enjoyed NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, as it's not a genre that I particularly care for--after all, if you've seen one brain-eating zombie film, you've seen them all. However, I strongly commend this film for helping to create the genre as well as getting one of the best examples of an inexpensively produced and excellent film that made a fortune (some others being CARNIVAL OF SOULS and the original LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS). Now I won't go so far as to give the movie a hugely inflated rating like some, after all the acting was at times pretty shabby (particularly by that stupid blonde). But it did have a simple but clever script, good special effects given the budget and time in which it was made, decent direction and scared the crap out of audiences--something many horror films fail to do. If you love the genre, then this is a must. Otherwise, it's not a must-see unless you are making a study of excellent bare-bones film making.",Night of the Living Dead
1,Leofwine_draca,THE movie which invented the modern gut-munching zombie genre,10,6 September 2016,"This is one of those all-time classic horror movies, enjoyed by generation after generation and extremely notorious for being graphic and frightening, just like THE EXORCIST and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. It's also one of the films responsible for ushering in a whole new wave of horror in the 197's (for good or bad), where the emphasis was on gore and realism instead of the Gothic fantasy tales produced in the '60s by Corman and Hammer.It's amazing, really, that a film made on an extremely low budget (with locals as extras) and basically set in just one location can have such an excellent reputation. The reason this film works is that everything is perfect: the scares, the acting, the camera-work, the makeup. The black and white photography is a virtue in this case; instead of dating the film (keep your distance from any suspicious colourised versions you see floating around) it emphasises the fear of the unknown, the fact that in the shadows something horrible could be waiting to pounce.The opening of the film sets the scene admirably and is the creepiest part. After a bit of dialogue between a brother and sister in a cemetery (including the infamous line ""I'm coming to get you, Barbara!""), we see a man stumbling across the graves in the distance, quiet, slowly closing in. This is our first sighting of a zombie and remains one of the most subtle and chilling moments in the history of the genre.Of course, with a film of this status, there have got to be flaws, one being the character of Barbara, who is quite simply an idiot. She doesn't help, she looks stupid, and she acts badly with it. Frankly I could have done without her character completely, she adds nothing to the film, does nothing apart from sit around and be simple. Thankfully this atrocity is countered by Duane Jones, who plays the hero of the piece; he's believable and one of those characters you really feel you can turn to and rely on in moments of need. Karl Hardman makes a good and slimy antagonist, and the rest of the cast all do well, considering the fact that they were amateurs.As well as the gently creepy moments, there are plenty of sudden shocks, hands bursting through windows, a close up of a rotted face. These counter the quieter and more psychological shocks well. The way that the number of zombies outside the farmhouse gradually builds up is a gradual slide into hopelessness, portrayed very well and preparing us for the final horrific moments where the zombies invade the building. I love films with siege situations, everything from DOG DAY AFTERNOON to ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13, and this is one of the very best.Although it was made in the '60s, the gore level is high for this film; today I would say it isn't suitable for the squeamish although obviously in the wake of the slasher overdrive it's not quite as shocking as it was on first release. A trowel murder is particularly nasty (and you have to admire the ingenuity of using chocolate sauce as a substitute for blood!), as are some scenes of cannibalism, which have been oft-copied. Action fans should also give this film a go, as there's plenty of shooting and Molatov cocktails being thrown around, although this film is more dialogue-concentrated than, say, DAWN OF THE DEAD. NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD is one of those rare beasts, a horror film which actually does deserve its own reputation and shouldn't be missed.",Night of the Living Dead
2,SnoopyStyle,Classic cinema,9,20 October 2014,"John and his sister Barbara go to visit their father's grave out in rural Pennsylvania. They notice a strange man walking. It turns out to be a zombie who attacks John. Barbara escapes to an abandoned farmhouse. Then a black man named Ben arrives. After several attacks from the zombies, a group hiding in the cellar comes out upon hearing the radio. The father insists on hiding in the cellar. His girl had been bitten by a zombie. There is also a teenage couple.This is a classic not only as horror, but also as indie. It is also important as general cinema. It is that good. It reintroduces zombies into a significant sub-genre in horror. It allows a confident combative black man to be the lead. It rises above its low budget origins. It was a mistake to show this for the little kids which is sometimes the practice of the day. This is definitively an adult movie. It is a serious adult movie.",Night of the Living Dead
3,Hitchcoc,The whole thing is black and eerie,7,15 March 2006,"In grad school, I had a roommate who lived in western Pennsylvania. He pointed out to me that after the making of this film, they rented the house to people who wanted to have overnight parties there. We almost did this, but schedules got in the way. I had heard so much about this movie, when I finally saw it, I was expecting too much. Like silent films or art films, the second and third viewing convinces one that these are trend setters. Because I had seen other movies like this, I thought it was clichéd, but then realized that those movies were the clichés and this set them up. The zombies are frightening, the feasting on human flesh is disgusting, those poor people, trapped in that house, not just fighting the enemies outside, but their own, inside, make for quite a film. It's easy to laugh at this because of inexperienced actors, cheap sets, and, basically, pretty bad special effects. Nevertheless, there is a throbbing threat that begins with the car in the graveyard and goes all the way to the unfortunate ending. It's a very frightening movie and set the standard for a raft of others to come. I don't like slasher movies and I'm not fond of gore in film, but it is a part of cinema today, and a lot of imagination went into this.",Night of the Living Dead
4,Prismark10,The rise of the dead,6,16 August 2018,"George Romero's black & white cult low budget zombie film, Night of the Living Dead is now regarded as a seminal classic.It is not a great film. The acting is ropy, the zombie effects are not that good and it is too talky. However it did rewrite the rules for low budget horror films.Two siblings are visiting their father's grave and are attacked by a strange looking drifter. The woman, Barbara (Judith O'Dea) runs to an abandoned farmhouse to escape him.Ben (Duane Jones) a black man also escapes to the farmhouse where she meets Barbara who is in shock. Ben barricades both of them inside the farmhouse by reinforcing the doors and windows.They encounter several other people who have been hiding out in the cellar. They learn on the radio that radiation contamination from a space probe has somehow reactivated the brain of dead people. These people were now devouring the flesh of the living who themselves would come back as zombies.It is a classic base under siege scenario with various types of people bickering, arguing and reluctantly joining forces. The film is notable that the lead is played by a black actor who is ordering the other survivors around, even shouting at them. In retrospect that looks like a brave piece of casting.Jones does give the film's best performance. O'Dea is pretty bad though, the zombies are more animated than her.",Night of the Living Dead
5,claudio_carvalho,My Favorite Horror Movie,10,30 May 2013,"Barbra (Judith O'Dea) and her brother Johnny travel by car from Pittsburgh to the countryside to visit the gravestone of their father in the cemetery. Out of the blue, they are attacked by a strange man and Johnny is murdered. Barbra runs and releases the brake of Johnny's car since the keys are in his pocket, and flees to an isolated farmhouse, where she locks herself inside. Barbra is in shock and soon she finds a man, Ben (Duane Jones), who is also escaping from the inhuman creatures and he reinforces the doors, windows and openings in the house. He also finds a shotgun and a radio and they learn that the radiation from a satellite that was returning from Venus has somehow reactivated the brain of the dead.Then they find five humans hidden in the basement: Harry Cooper (Karl Hardman), his wife Helen (Marilyn Eastman) and their daughter Karen (Kyra Schon) that is sick; and Tom (Keith Wayne) and his girlfriend Judy (Judith Ridley). Harry has an argument with Ben, since he believes that the basement is the safest place for them and Harry does not agree. Along the night, the tension between the two men grows while the house is under siege by an increasing legion of living dead. ""Night of the Living Dead"" is my favorite horror movie and I do not know how many times I have watched this movie (the last times had been on 31 March 2001 and 15 January 2002). I was very young the first time I saw it and I was impressed with this movie. Today I have just seen a colorized version and despite my preference for the original black and white classic, I have nothing to say against this latest version.""Night of the Living Dead"" is the debut of the cult director George A. Romero and it is amazing the movie he made with an extremely low-budget. The story is scary and tension increases along 96 minutes running time. The conclusion is ironic and a sort of justice against the decision of Ben, who refused to stay in the basement and caused the death of the whole group. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""A Noite dos Mortos-Vivos"" (""The Night of the Living Dead"")Note: On 10 August 2014, I saw this film again.On 13 September 2015, I saw this film again.",Night of the Living Dead
6,nogodnomasters,They're coming for you,8,30 January 2020,"The film was a good throwback: Pontiac, rotor dial phones, typewriters that go click, suicide doors and AM radio. The film starts out with irreligious Johnny (Russell Streiner) and the summer solstice. Neither one has anything to do with the outbreak and I am not sure how radiation ""brought back"" from Venus could cause mutations to dead cells and not living ones.Barbara (Judith O'Dea) one of the first ""final girls"" of zombie films was one of the worst. In fact, the acting left much to be desired. Duane Jones was selected for the lead, not because Romero was on a Civil Rights kick, but because Mr. Jones had experience with the theater. Black and white was chosen because they didn't have the blood color down that well.No swearing or sex. Brief nudity (Carol Wayne...not THE Carol Wayne.)",Night of the Living Dead
7,classicsoncall,"""Kill the brain and you kill the ghoul"".",7,31 August 2005,"A threatening musical score counterpoints a tranquil country road setting in the opening scene of ""Night of the Living Dead""; that road appropriately leading to a cemetery. Very soon, a childhood torment becomes a reality as brother Johnny repeats to his sister - ""They're coming to get you Barbra..."" The first undead creature they encounter results in tragedy, as Johnny stumbles and cracks his head on a stone. Barbra (correct spelling as listed in the credits) for her part breaks the first rule of zombie escape as she heads for a confined space, a lonely country home in the middle of nowhere.We learn that others have beaten her there, having retreated to safety in the wake of mass revivals of dead corpses, the story gradually revealed via a series of radio and television broadcasts. Apparently, radiation on an earthbound satellite that was part of a Venus probe has triggered some kind of awakening in the brains of the recently deceased. The victims have become a ""virtual army of unidentified assassins"", having a penchant for the flesh of living human beings.It would be easy to dismiss NOTLD as a trash zombie flick, but if you follow it closely, an intelligent exposition of the story transcends the film's limited budget and it's skimpy production values. In fact it's the dark and grainy aspect of the movie that gives it a character and a step up on the typical ""B"" grade horror flicks of the preceding era. The classic scene of the nighttime advancing corpses is one that will stay with you long after the movie is over.The movie maintains it's story line consistency as well; when the Cooper's young daughter succumbs to her illness and dies, she comes alive hungry for human flesh and without regard for her closest target, dear old mom. In turn, Helen Cooper comes back none the worse for wear after young Gina hands her a thrashing in spades. As the zombie horde finally breaks into the farm house, protagonist hero Ben barricades himself in the cellar against his own earlier advice, killing the Cooper's a second time, as advised by news reporters covering the countrywide phenomenon - ""Kill the brain and you kill the ghoul"".It's the little things that writer/director George Romero pays attention to as well that make this a horror classic. Remember brother Johnny - well he shows up later in a quick cameo as a member of the zombie horde, returning for his sister.I recall how ""Night of the Living Dead"" created a stir upon it's original release in 1968. Now almost forty years later, movie making technology has advanced to the point of leaving virtually nothing to the imagination. But your first glimpse of the bloody skeletal head at the top of the stairs in NOTLD is the kind of image that nightmares are made of, after your imagination takes over.",Night of the Living Dead
8,gavin6942,The Start of the Modern Horror Film,8,15 April 2014,"A group of people hide from bloodthirsty ghouls in a farmhouse.As everyone in the horror community knows, this is the grand daddy of them all -- the start of the modern horror film, the first in a long line of zombie films (even if they are never called zombies here). And the introduction of George Romero, one of the all-time greatest masters of horror.I am not clear how the popularity of the film grew. Actress Kyra Schon says she was not asked to attend a horror convention until 1988 -- twenty years after the film's release -- and was even teased by her classmates. And the social commentary of having a black man as a leader was never intentional, though contributed to its significance later on.I have wondered if perhaps its falling into public domain was its greatest asset. While it may have not helped the bank accounts of those involved, it did allow the widespread use of the film, and it has been referenced in other films countless times. Has this further pushed the film into public consciousness?",Night of the Living Dead
9,lee_eisenberg,"corny, but important",10,27 July 2005,"My 10/10 rating of course means that ""Night of the Living Dead"" is so corny that it's a masterpiece. It's hard to believe that it never was intended to be a social commentary but ended up being such, what with the hero being a black man, and the cynicism taking over the country due to the Vietnam War. Of course, the real stars are the zombies (although the word ""zombie"" is never used). Silent and slow - but deadly - they are some mean mothers. George Romero created a veritable horror classic. There have been many other zombie movies since then, but only ""Shaun of the Dead"" was really worth seeing. To truly understand what the genre means, you have to see ""Night of the Living Dead"". Because remember, they're coming for you...",Night of the Living Dead
10,jboothmillard,Night of the Living Dead,10,13 September 2005,"It would have been better if all three of the original films were in colour, but this is still a great classic from director George A. Romero. Basically the film starts with Barbara (Judith O'Dea) and her brother Johnny (Russell Streiner) visiting a graveyard to place some flowers, and Johnny is trying to scare his sister because of her nervousness in graveyards. Then soon enough a man comes along, and attacks Johnny, but this is no ordinary man, and Barbara doesn't wait around to see him properly. She finds herself hiding in what seems to be an empty house from more of these ""creatures"", eventually joined by black character (there's one in all of them) Ben (Duane Jones). As they try and board up the house and protect themselves from these things, they find the phones are dead and there is only one radio and television channel being broadcast, all emergency. They also find they are not alone and that there have been people hiding in the basement for ages, these are Harry Cooper (Karl Hardman) with wife Helen (Marilyn Eastman) and sick (from being bitten by one of the creatures) Karen (Kyra Schon) and friends Tom (Keith Wayne) and Judy (Judith Ridley). The television and radio broadcasts confirm from many sources that these creatures are recently dead people rising back to life, and most believe this is the cause of a satellite crash which is continuously spreading radiation. They also explain that these creatures have only one instinct, to feed on human flesh, and like the daughter, turns into one of them, and eats her own father, and kills her own mother (both then controversial moments). In the end, all survivors except Ben are either killed by their own doing or by the undead, and all bodies burned on the bonfire by farmers, and Ben is mistakenly shot (another then controversial moment) and also burnt. The film may be old, but it still has the power to shock and maybe sicken audiences, even if the picture quality isn't brilliant, e.g. lighting techniques, but still a good classic horror. The film was number 93 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, and it was number 53 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments. Outstanding!",Night of the Living Dead
11,Woodyanders,Holds up as a bold work of considerable artistic merit,10,22 February 2018,"Director/co-writer George Romero and co-writer John Russo bring a fierce and subversive undiluted nihilism to the basic formula horror premise of the dead coming back to life as hideous flesh-eating ghouls that's lost none of its sting throughout the decades: Whether it's a couple of loved ones returning as lethal zombies so they can kill their own mother or sister or the noble Ben (a fine and commanding performance by Duane Jones) being shot dead with a bullet to the head after he's mistaken for a zombie by a posse of trigger-happy rednecks, this film pulls zero punches. Romero and Russo tackle head on major issues that remain timely and topical even today: The unreliability of the clueless media, the danger posed by average citizens having easy access to firearms, people failing to put their differences aside in order to work together so they can survive a perilous situation, and society starting to come apart at the seams when faced with a baffling problem that it's patently unprepared for and hence unable to properly deal with. In a movie rich with dark and delicious ironies, one of the richest and mot biting ironies of all is that the idea proposed by the selfish and cowardly Harry Cooper (well played to the slimy and sniveling hilt by Karl Hardman) to hole up in the basement is much better than Ben's insistence on remaining upstairs. Wholly deserving of its classic status.",Night of the Living Dead
12,ccthemovieman-1,Reputation Far Exceeds Reality,2,9 April 2008,"What has all the fuss been about with this movie? Can somebody tell me? This was not scary. It was just stupid, with no-name ""fair"" actors, at best. The dialog is laughable; the special-effects are too dated to be taken seriously in 2008 (actually, by the 1980s, too). Some films get get reputations early on and all the national critics follow like sheep, giving you the same unwarranted hype about how great a film is, and this ""Night Of The Living Dead"" is a perfect example of that. A horror movie is supposed to raise a few hairs on the back of your neck, not put you to sleep. These ""zombies"" look like Roger Ebert and Leonard Maltin - maybe that's why it's gotten rave reviews.Trust me, this is a total waste of time.",Night of the Living Dead
13,rmax304823,Spawn of the devil.,6,18 December 2010,"This was a true original, a labor of both love and craftsmanship for George Romero and his friends. It was made for a pittance in Pittsburgh. And it began a series of imitations and sequels, none of which get bonus points for determination or originality.Judith O'Dea and her brother, Russell Streiner, visit their parents' grave in a remote cemetery. O'Dea prays solemnly while Streiner, evidently a non-believer, playfully mocks her and teases her about a disheveled man approaching them -- ""Here he comes. They're coming to get you. Woooo."" And suddenly this creepy character who looks like Art Carney DOES grab her and viciously starts wrestling her to the ground. When Streiner intervenes, he's knocked out, allowing O'Dea a few moments to escape. It's a shocking scene. The gray and barren cemetery looks like the setting for a family drama or even a comedy, and it's suddenly horror time.O'Dea winds up being barricaded in an empty farm house along with half a dozen other varied characters. One of them, inevitably, is the stock character who is domineering, dilatory, and stupid. Prima inter pares is a bright, industrious, practical African-American, whose race is never brought up.The trapped humans can't make any phone calls as zombies, by ones and twos, gather around the old house. It quickly becomes apparent that they're afraid of light. At the same time, a light bulb goes on in the head of the experienced viewer, that sooner or later the power will fail and the electric lights go off, leaving the house in darkness except for what light can be provided by improvised torches, burning furniture, and Molotov cocktails.It's a good cheap movie with a couple of revolting scenes, including the horde of revenants chomping with no visible enthusiasm on the barbecued bodies of a young couple caught in an exploding pickup truck. Chomping on the beautiful young woman is not so objectionable but there is such a thing as excess. It's a nice touch that Judith O'Dea is so shocked by her narrow escape and her brother's death that it takes her some time to recover. Usually, the character gets about thirty seconds.One by one, the living humans are pulled out of the house or otherwise captured by the zombies and eaten by them. Here the direction is sometimes very clumsy. The windows have been hastily boarded over. There are a dozen zombies outside with their hands reaching in through the spaces. You have a rifle and you know you can kill the zombies by shooting them through the head. So -- do you stick the muzzle of your rifle through the spaces between the boards, where the mortified hands can grasp the barrel and pull the rifle away? No. No, you don't.I didn't care for the ending at all. A sheriff's detail has been making its rounds, killing the zombies off until all are now gone. As they approach the farm house, the lone survivor peeks at them from a window. ""There's another one!"" And, POW, the lone survivor is no more. Everybody -- including those we've come to care for -- winds up mincemeat. ""King Lear"" was a tragedy too but it tried to tell us something about human nature. In this instance everyone dies because the writers decided arbitrarily that they should.Still gets bonus points, though, for being the first of its kind.",Night of the Living Dead
14,ma-cortes,This powerful and classic horror film is the Romero's directorial debut with low budget,7,24 April 2009,"Romero's gruesome first film, combining gore, 'bona fide' frights horror and in documentary style with skillful characterization, it's one of the most successful independent films of all time. A mysterious plague caused by a satellite that expands a high level of radiation, it creates the recently dead to rise from their graves and scout the countryside and surrounding a farmhouse for feed on and where find shelter a hapless group. The legions of dead people who stalk the house are looking exasperatingly for live humans .The first time the Zombies appeared was in ¨White Zombie(1932)¨. From then on Zombies remained a firm staple of terror B-genre , bringing the dead back to life was a popular pastime in the 30s and 40s. The early zombies were basically genteel beings and generally likable and agreeable types. Romero created in Pittsburg his own production company Image Ten Productions with his friends, John Russo among them and they each contributed 10.000 dollars and formed the budget for his first movie which made Romero world famous. George A. Romero cast an African-American Duane Jones, unusual by the time.When Romero directed this claustrophobic picture , he gave birth to the modern Zombie genre and the film has had a lasting importance, giving interesting consideration to the violence executed by the zombies. It was initially dismissed as exploitation, but when was re-released , it struck deeply with a disillusioned youth angry with the desperation about Vietnam. It was one of the first successful independent terror productions influencing and inspiring countless imitations, copies and rip-offs. Followed by three equally cellebrated sequels, ¨Dawn of the dead(78)¨where the zombies attack a shopping mall ,¨Day of the dead dead(85)¨ about flesh-eating zombies taking over the world and scientific experimenting on zombies and ¨Land of dead(2005)¨ with high budget played by Simon Baker,Asia Argento and Dennis Hooper.

15,BA_Harrison,Perhaps the most important and influential horror film of all time.,10,17 August 2008,"As I type this, exactly four decades have passed since George Romero's Night of the Living Dead changed the face of horror cinema forever, introducing fans to the concept of the modern flesh-eating zombie. It is testament to Romero's skill as a director, and the brilliance of the basic premise that, forty years on, the film still has the power to chill and thrill, and that its influences are still being felt in horror cinema today.The simple yet ingenious plot sees a group of people trying to survive a night in a farmhouse which is besieged by the living dead. With only a handful of disparate central characters, a slowly increasing sense of dread and tension, and an ever growing horde of ghouls trying to sink their teeth into the living, Romero delivers a non-stop ride of terror that any self-respecting horror fan should make it their duty to seenot once, but as many times as they can.From it's opening atmospheric scenes in a rural graveyard, to the final zombie onslaught and the shocking twist ending, Night of the Living Dead is an unmissable marvel of low budget movie-making: brilliantly written, innovative, well executed, and throroughly enjoyable from start to finish (if you like to be scared, that is).And to all you young whippersnappers who might scoff at what I have to say.... next time you sit down to enjoy a 'Resident Evil' or a '28 (insert unit of time here) Later', remember.... it all started with this film.

16,paul_haakonsen,The night that it all started...,7,21 January 2016,"I am a zombie aficionado, no doubt about it. And as such, then of course I enjoy this 1968 movie by George A. Romero, because it is a milestone in the zombie genre. ""Night of the Living Dead"" is essentially the foundation for the zombie genre, and it paved the way for the genre and shaped it into what we have today. And as such, then Romero really established something unique and cemented his own name to be forever associated with the living dead.I am not going to be a fanboy and look past all the flaws and shortcomings to this movie, because they are there, for sure. But still, this is an entertaining movie, and taking into consideration the year in which it was made and released, was quite a bold venture into the cinema.Without delving too deep into the storyline, as I assume that as a horror fan you will already be more than familiar with ""Night of the Living Dead"" in one of the many variants it has come in. It is about a group of strangers trapped in a small farm house with hordes of the living dead surrounding them, wanting to eat their flesh.The story has been made immortal by George A. Romero, certainly, and it is an entertaining story that is brought to the screen by a rather visionary directing at the time being. And the cast that they had gotten together for the movie were also doing quite good jobs. There were some rather memorable performances throughout the movie.As for the effects, well, take into consideration that this movie is from 1968, so it would seem rather crude by today's standards. But the effects serve their intent and purpose well enough, and helped to flesh out the movie on the screen, no pun intended.""Night of the Living Dead"" is a movie that you can't be familiar with if you are a zombie aficionado. And even for newcomers to the zombie genre, then ""Night of the Living Dead"" is a MUST watch to fully embrace the genre and understand its roots.",Night of the Living Dead
17,Quinoa1984,The Grandaddy of all modern independent and/or horror movies.,10,21 February 2000,"I've been reading a book about the making of this film recently, and it made me fall in love with it all over. It's the original and on some level it can't be beat for its originality; it's like when the Rolling Stones first hit things off with Jumping Jack Flash and that was it fr rock and roll – so many after would go for it, make their own greatness, but it's the first and, at its core, most elemental.George Romero and company made a film that takes the vampire myth – the director freely admits to borrowing from the novel I Am Legend – and changing them to flesh-eaters, as it would be something much more visceral. It's a horror film about systems breaking down really, perhaps the first of its kind to address it in a group dynamic. And it wasn't afraid to make it real by giving us real people; the actors aren't all professionals, but some had training, and Duane Jones as Ben, though not ""written"" for a black actor, is really the only one that could've pulled it off with such humility. We know why he's mad at the situation he's in – we would be too.Race, class, power, and, as Romero put the whole ""zombie"" concept, revolution, all in a story filled with gruesome deaths, REAL scares (the opening cemetery scene is a knock-out), and it takes its time to build up to the WHAMMY moments that knock you down; by the last ten minutes, you'll hopefully, if you are locked into it, be little slabs of jelly.",Night of the Living Dead
18,tavm,George Romero's Night of the Living Dead retains some of its classic stature,8,6 October 2009,"After having just watched Carnival of Souls for the first time, I rewatched this one especially after finding out George A. Romero was inspired by the previous film when making this. It starts with a grown brother and sister named Johnny (Russel Streiner who also produced) and Barbra (Judith O'Dea) going to the cemetery to place a wreath on their father's grave. It's there that the first ghoul arrives to attack the sister and kill the brother. When Barbra goes to an abandoned house, Ben (Duane Jones) is the only one there since the dead previous tenant is upstairs with her face skin already eaten. It later turns out there are others emerging from the cellar. Among them are Tom (Keith Wayne), his girlfriend Judy (Judith Ridley who was married to Streiner at the time), Harry Cooper (Karl Hardman, the other producer who also did makeup and engineered the sound effects), and his wife Helen (Marilyn Eastman who would eventually become Hardman's real life spouse). The latter couple's daughter Karen (Kyra Schon who's Hardman's actual offspring) is lying in the cellar since she got bitten by a zombie. I'll stop there and just say while this movie was not completely scary, it was effectively atmospheric and provided a great shock at the end, even more so when the stills (also provided by Hardman) were presented during the closing credits. Some of the dialogue provided by Romero and John A. Russo might have been a little too talky but they do provide enough explanation as to why things happen as they did. And you gotta dig the stock music from the TV series ""The Fugitive"" and an eventual ""MST3K"" entry called Teenagers from Outer Space. There was later a 30th Anniversary Edition with an added opening and closing scene but I don't recommend that. But I most definitely recommend this, the original Night of the Living Dead.",Night of the Living Dead

With this one, George A. Romero produced the horror equivalent of ""Citizen Kane"". His black and white photography, and direction, is outstanding. And, Mr. Romero's excesses are in check; every indulgence seen on screen gratifyingly fits the mood of the film. Karl Hardman, John Russo, and Russ Streiner are certainly most valuable players. The ""non-acting"" approach of heroic Duane Jones (as Ben) and the cast is effective, and refreshing. Influential and inspirational, the film's ""anti-Hollywood"" and/or ""low budget"" flaws have been rendered irrelevant. A startling masterpiece of light, shadow, and sheer will.********** Night of the Living Dead (10/1/68) George A.

20,BandSAboutMovies,My home!,8,15 March 2021,"I've debated writing about this film for the site for a long time. It's beyond a seminal movie and it's also from right where we call home. There's probably no modern horror movie as important as this one for so many reasons and so many films have their inspiration right here.I've spent a lifetime in advertising, so I can see how making television commercials and industrial films as part of The Latent Image pushed George Romero, John Russo and Russell Streiner to make their own movie.And horror movies? Horror movies sell.Shot between June and December 1967 in Evans City with friends, relatives, local actors and interested locals, this movie was made for around $114,000 but looks like so much more. The crew had been through the ringer - they did the original Calgon ""Ancient Chinese Secret"" commercial - and they knew how to get the most out of every shot.You have no idea what it was like as a kid to drive past Evans City nearly every day, knowing that the dead lived there.The movie was a huge success, obviously. That's why we're talking about it here. And yet, there's so much that makes it a regional film, as it has local people like horror host Bill Cardille in it. And it feels, well, exactly like living in Western Pennsylvania. We've been preparing for the zombie uprising since before people knew there was such a thing.The movie starts with Barbara (Judith O'Dea) and Johnny (Streiner) in a cemetery, arguing over visiting their parents. Their sibling games soon give way to terror when what looks like a homeless man murders Johnny and sends Barbara racing away, finally discovering what seems to be an abandoned farmhouse. There, she meets Ben* (Duane Jones), a black hero saving a white woman in a time that these things just weren't done. But the true joy of Night of the Living Dead is that unlike modern elevated horror, this is no message movie. These are just the right people to tell the story.It's funny because Romero has often cited Richard Matheson's I Am Legend as his inspiration, but that author has said that this movie was ""kind of cornball."" What does he know?The movie ups the tension when we discover that a married couple, Harry and Helen Cooper, and their daughter Karen have been hiding in the basement, The young girl has been bitten by a ghoul and Harry is obsessed with barricading himself and his family in the house while Ben wants to escape. In truth, no one is right and everyone pays the price. There is no happy ending in Evans City.Perhaps the most astounding thing to me about Night of the Living Dead is its public domain status. Its original distributor, the Walter Reade Organization, never put a copyright on the prints. There was one under its original title, Night of the Flesh Eaters, but when the name change occurred, Walter Reade also removed that copyright notice.That's why when the VHS era started, you could actually buy this movie, as well as why it shows up in so many other movies and in DVD multipacks. There's also the unfairly maligned Savini remake that this site needs to get to someday, which I love because Barbara is a more capable heroine and also because I saw it in a theater near Zelienople and when they said the name of the town, people lost their minds.Roger Ebert's review of this film has always stuck with me: ""The kids in the audience were stunned. There was almost complete silence. The movie had stopped being delightfully scary about halfway through, and had become unexpectedly terrifying. There was a little girl across the aisle from me, maybe nine years old, who was sitting very still in her seat and crying ... It's hard to remember what sort of effect this movie might have had on you when you were six or seven. But try to remember. At that age, kids take the events on the screen seriously, and they identify fiercely with the hero. When the hero is killed, that's not an unhappy ending but a tragic one: Nobody got out alive. It's just over, that's all.""That's probably why I like it so much.*According to an interview on Homepage of the Dead, Karl Hardman and Marilyn Eastman said, ""Duane Jones was a very well educated man (and he) simply refused to do the role as it was written. As I recall, I believe that Duane himself upgraded his own dialogue to reflect how he felt the character should present himself.""",Night of the Living Dead
21,Coventry,George A. Romero recreates the entire horror genre! Night is one of the greatest American movies ever!!,10,6 April 2004,"Cinema freaks all over the world (and horror buffs in particular) should bow their heads and thank Romero endlessly for this film he made. Night of the Living Dead is an undeniable masterpiece any way you look at it and a stunning victory for low-budget artists, rich on inspiration.
WARNING: Dangerous plot and structure spoilers from here!!Horror anno 2004 would have looked completely different if it weren't for Romero and his risky, innovating views. He single-handedly rewrites the entire genre and adds some radical new ideas. Extremely brutal and thought-provoking ideas that teach us that good DOESN'T necessarily triumphs over evil or that the hero's fade isn't automatically secure. In fact, there aren't any heroes in Night of the Living Deadonly scared victims who're fighting for their lives. The film starts with a moody tone, showing two young siblings on their way to visit their father's grave on the countryside. A tall, slow moving man approaches them and from that moment on the film turns into a non-stop wholesome of frightening images, unbearable tensions and downright nightmarish events. Still not knowing what is going on, a group of isolated people has to hide themselves in a farmhouse, while evil grows numerous around them in the form of recently deceased human beings! As a viewer, you can't help but sympathize with the players, yet their situation becomes more hopeless by the minute and even if there is a slight bit of hope for themit doesn't take long before Romero adds a new disastrous twist. This immensely controversial structure keeps on rushing by at high speed until it explodes into an astonishing anti-climax that leaves everyone breathless! You really have to rewind and double-check if what you saw at the end actually happened! See it in order to believe what kind of apocalyptic and inhuman ending Romero thought up here. Night of the Living Dead is a shocking portrait that makes your blood pump faster to your heart for an hour and a half non-stop. Surprisingly simple and modestly shot, but ten times more effective and haunting then any other horror movie ever before. An essential cinema experience that has to be seen by every self-respecting film fan George A. Romero's film is slightly influenced by the equally brilliant `Carnival of Souls' (a still vastly underrated film by Herk Harvey) but he himself opened the way for upcoming cinematographers such as David Cronenberg, Tobe Hooper and John Landis. There's no end to this film's influence and importance! The uncut original '68 version is favorable viewing material over the 30 years special edition that contains extra footage. There's an additional opening sequence in that one that more or less spoils the atmosphere right from the beginning. Tom Savini's 1990 remake, on the other hand IS worth a watchsince that one was made with an overload of respect for Romero's debut. Night of the Living Dead unquestionably receives a rating 10 out of 10, which still doesn't says enough about its brilliancy! If you haven't seen it yet.do it now!",Night of the Living Dead
22,michaelRokeefe,Ghoulish to the extreme. Unforgettable.,7,21 October 2001,"This great word of mouth horror flick kick started a career for writer/director George A. Romero. Shot crudely in black and white, with the impression the budget was not much more than a shoe string. Quickly this film reached cult following and is a great movie to watch in a party gathering. One third of the east coast is terrorized by the recently deceased and these slow stumbling zombies crave human flesh. The earliest form of defense is to shoot and then burn. After all; bras, draft cards, flags...almost everything was targets of the torch in the late 60s. A group of people think that they have found safety in a farm house near a cemetery. Hammers, nails, shotguns, kerosene and fruit jar cocktails barely slows down the ghoulish carnage.Playing in this underestimated classic are: Duane Jones, Keith Wayne, Judith Ridley, Marilyn Eastman and Judith O'Dea.",Night of the Living Dead
23,Theo Robertson,Flawed But Still Entertaining,7,20 July 2003,"I was flicking through the TV guide which told me the remake of NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD was being shown on the Sci-Fi channel so I sat down to watch it. I did like the ground breaking original so eagerly awaited seeing the 1990 version which started with a car driving down a lonely country road just like the original , it was also filmed in black and white just like the original and it was at this point I realised I wasn`t watching the remake- I was watching the original . This wasn`t the first time a certain TV guide got films mixed up because a couple of weeks ago it confused the 1967 war film THE YOUNG WARRIORS with the 1983 vigilante thriller about high school students and their poodle wiping out scumSlightly disappointed I wouldn`t be seeing the colour remake I still sat down to watch the original because as I said I remember liking it from years ago . I wasn`t disappointed with what I saw but the flaws do jump out at you and bite you in the neck . The acting isn`t very good with Judith O Dea over acting with the rest of the cast under acting . This a great pity because if we had the same type of performances seen in something like 12 ANGRY MEN this movie would have been a masterpiece . I also couldn`t help noticing a few editing errors where it`s suddenly pitch black outside then it flicks to broad daylight then it`s pitch black again , and I don`t think I`ve seen many films recently with such an intrusive soundtrack . I can however forgive these flaws because NOTLD is guerilla film making at its very best , it`s got a simple strength and that is it has a very good script where both imagination and drama grabs you and doesn`t let go - A crashed satillite returning from Venus reanimates the dead ? Utter nonsense of course but the scenario is so well written you can`t help being swept along with the terror as the protagonists watch the world disintergrate on TV . Compare this movie to THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and tell me what one is more enjoyable ? No contest is it ?I liked this movie many years ago and still like it today . Such a pity the production values didn`t come up to the standards of the script , but that said it`s still more compelling than the stuff coming out of Hollywood today",Night of the Living Dead
24,Hey_Sweden,"""Yeah, they're dead. They're all messed up.""",10,28 October 2016,"Something unusual is happening in the Eastern third of the United States. The unburied recently deceased are returning to ""life"" and feasting on the flesh of those that are still living. And the problem seems to keep getting worse. The story focuses on seven characters in particular, who are forced to barricade themselves inside an isolated farmhouse. Ben (Duane Jones) is a real take-charge kind of guy, and he must deal with a near-catatonic Barbara (Judith O'Dea), and a harried husband / father, Harry (Karl Hardman), with whom he argues about methodology.People regard this as a landmark horror film - not just a landmark zombie film - for very good reason. It's all the more impressive since it was the feature filmmaking debut for the young George A. Romero, who wrote this with his friend John Russo. His direction is slick and assured, and the end result is a definitive example of how to work with a minimal budget. In fact, the lack of the kind of spit and polish that one would get with a Hollywood product only helps to completely sell the material, rather than distance us from it. It has a vivid, frightening atmosphere that draws us right in, and its characters are convincing. Harry may be an obstinate Jerk, but it's not as if he never makes any sense. One can see his argument, as well.The black & white photography is superb, and Romeros' sense of pace is wonderful. He doesn't make his audience wait long for the bad things to start happening. His images, sequences, and dialogue are now the stuff of legend. ""They're coming to get you, Barbara."" The stock music used adds immeasurably to the appeal. And while its moments of grisly violence may not disturb a modern viewer to any great degree, this was considered quite shocking and gory in its day.The no name cast is uniformly solid. Jones is a tough, decisive hero. O'Dea is just fine, although given how her character ultimately becomes kind of useless, this may be a sticking point for some people. Hardman is excellent as the human antagonist. Marilyn Eastman, Keith Wayne, and Judith Ridley are all appealing in other key roles. And who can ever forget the face of S. William Hinzman as the very first zombie that we see? Russell Streiner (who produced the film with Hardman) and director Romero appear unbilled.The legacy of this horror masterpiece pretty much speaks for itself, with several sequels and scores of imitations resulting for almost half a century now.This one is a must see - and not just for horror fans.10 out of 10.",Night of the Living Dead
25,Doylenf,Primitive looking horror film still shocks but is no masterpiece...,5,16 December 2010,"I was duly impressed that a film made for $114,000 could gross something like $12 million, but then--as the old saying goes--never underestimate the bad taste of the public. And that about sums up what I think of this film's impact on the horror genre.The dead come back to haunt the living. How they come back is one of those science fiction theories that lacks real plausibility but that didn't stop the screenwriter from concocting this tale of impending doom. There's a film noir quality to the low-key lighting effects as the main characters huddle inside a house that's been boarded up to prevent the carnivorous zombie-like creatures from devouring them.If you get your thrills from seeing flesh-eating zombies, this is for you. Not only is the gore rather explicit, but close-ups of hungry zombies smacking their lips over a meal is what makes this the sort of exploitation film Hitchcock tried to stay away from. He got his effects with a bit more wit and wisdom.For a low-budget thriller, the performances are about what you'd expect. DUANE JONES, as Ben, is the hero of the tale and he does give the best performance in the film, which is not saying too much. It's the script that could have used some refinement with dialog that's enough to give you a few chuckles before the tale reaches an unsatisfying and rather abrupt ending.",Night of the Living Dead
26,preppy-3,Classic horror movie,10,23 July 2006,"The dead come alive to eat the flesh of the living. Seven people are trapped in a remote farmhouse trying to figure out how to get away while dealing with each other.This was once considered the goriest horror film ever made. It was (I heard) banned in several countries and had an R rating. We've gone far beyond it--it now plays on commercial TV uncut and has a PG rating. So while it's nowhere near as gory as it was once considered it still stands as a grim strong horror movie.It was made on next to no budget--and it shows in the shaky camera-work and threadbare sets. The script is just terrible. Some choice lines--""Bash them or burn them--they go up pretty easy"" ""They're dead--they're all screwed up"". So there's a lot of unintentional humor. And Judith O'Dea's ""acting"" is so bad it gets laughs from audiences.The rest of the cast though is pretty good--especially Duane Jones. It was shot in black and white which actually helps--it gives the film a documentary feel. And, despite all the dumb lines, this film maintains a grim tone throughout. Also there's no happy ending or stupid love story in here.This film broke down barriers in terms of how much gore could be shown. Critics liked it and it was a big hit. Without this we never would have had films like ""The Exorcist"" or ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". It may not scare you but it's never dull and pulls no punches. I give it a 10.",Night of the Living Dead
27,LeonLouisRicci,Just A Little Too Real For Comfort,9,8 November 2013,"Certainly no one can call this the First Zombie Movie. They have been around at least since White Zombie (1932), I Walk with a Zombie (1943), and Plague of the Zombies (1966). But no other Walking Dead Movie made an Impact like Director George Romero's Ultra-Low-Budget Gore-A-Thon. It Refused to be Ignored and Limited to its Very Limited Release. No Distributor of Note would touch it and the Movie Barely made it to Screens. But there is the Rub. It did make it to just Enough Movie Houses to cause more than a Stir, it caused an Explosion of Raves and Outrage.The Film was Seen by enough People at Drive-Ins and Grind-Houses that it could not Possibly be Overlooked. The Movie is so Visceral, with its Documentary Feel that the Viewing Experience was Unsettling to say the Least. Anyone who saw it was Affected in some way or another. It was just Real Enough Looking to be Scary and just Amateurish Enough to let the Audience in on all the Demented Fun. Maybe.This was 1968, the Year Before the Moon Landing and if you were paying Attention, in the Background they were Blaming a Returning Space Rocket's Radiation for the Dead coming back to Life and Devouring the Living. Apollo Grandstanding be Damned. It was this sort of Subtle Underpinnings along with Grotesque Gorging, combined with Claustrophobic Conditions that made this one Helluva of a Spook Show in 1968. Beware of many Public-Domain Prints that are Really Bad Quality.",Night of the Living Dead
28,poolandrews,Classic horror that changed the genre for the better... It still holds up pretty well even today.,8,26 September 2005,"Night of the Living Dead starts on an ordinary Sunday afternoon, just like any other. Barabara (Judith O'Dea) & her Brother Johnny (co-producer Russell Streiner, uncredited) are about 200 miles outside Pittsburgh in an isolated graveyard where their dead Father is buried. While laying a reef they are attacked by one of the recently re-animated living dead (S. William Hinzman), Johnny is killed but Barbara manages to escape to a nearby farmhouse. There she meets Ben (Duane Jones) whose truck has run out of gas, together they fight off a few zombies & begin to board the farmhouse windows & doors up. They are not the only people seeking safety & shelter however, in the basement Harry (Karl Hardman), his wife Helen Cooper (Marilyn Eastman) & their ill daughter Karen (Kyra Schon) plus two teenage lovers Tom (Keith Wayne) & Judy (Judith Ridley) are also hiding from the ever growing hordes of the undead outside. They must work together to try & escape the constantly growing in number flesh-eating zombies that surround the farmhouse & seem determined to get in...Co-edited, photographed, co-written & directed by George A. Romero who also has a small cameo Night of the Living Dead was the first film in Romero's fantastic series of zombie films with Dawn of the Dead (1978) following, then came Day of the Dead (1985) & more recently Land of the Dead (2005) & is an absolute classic that every horror fan should see at least once. The script by Romero & John A. Russo works very well, even today. It moves along at a nice pace & never becomes dull or boring. I liked the fact that Night of the Living Dead features real people trying to survive & not concentrating on phony Government bodies & authorities, the character's are both believable & well balanced. I like the idea of them being real people with real fears. The farmhouse makes for a great isolated location & the film builds up well as more & more zombies swarm over the house & we lean as the character's learn through news broadcasts although the exact cause for the dead to rise is somewhat vague & isn't touched upon or explored in great depth which wasn't a problem for me at all, in fact I'd have probably preferred it if no solid explanation was given at all. With a supposed budget of around $114,000 Night of the Living dead is a bit wobbly around the edges but is technically fine, as long as you don't expect the production values of a massive Hollywood blockbuster which unfortunately I imagine most people do these days. The black and white cinematography is acceptable & works in the films favour, continuity isn't too bad, director Romero manages to create some great scenes that will forever live on in horror film history like the opening in the cemetery & the terrific downbeat ending that works perfectly, the music is non-discript & bland but expected considering it's mostly free stock music & the special effects are decent as well with a dead body that has lost it's face, some rotting zombies, some gunshot wounds & we even get some cannibalism & intestine eating. The acting is OK & about as good as one would expect, no-ones going to win any awards but then again no-one embarrasses themselves too much. Night of the Living Dead is a classic, it has stood the test of time very well & makes for an entertaining watch even now. Definitely worth watching, recommended. The remake Night of the Living Dead (1990) is also a very fine film as well.",Night of the Living Dead
29,dbborroughs,Not one to watch alone at night and in the dark,10,20 March 2004,"This is the classic film that reshaped the horror genre as we know it. Certainly its hard to see that now since it has been ripped off and spoofed so many times. Still despite its age and all the rip offs, it has lost none of its power. I'm sure that if one were to sit and watch this at night with the lights off there is a good chance it will frighten you into screaming more than once. As cliche as the line ""They're coming to get you Barbara"" is it still sends chills down your spine because you know they are indeed coming.The tales of this little film from nowhere are legendary, parents thinking it was a stupid horror film dropped there kids off for a day at the movie, only to pick them up hours later crying and babbling about the horrors they witnessed.(Who said the fake documentary feel was perfected by Blair Witch?)This is one of the great films of the cinema and should be seen by anyone who loves film, horror or otherwise. And do yourself a favor turn off all the lights and watch it late at night...",Night of the Living Dead
30,lastliberal,They shot me!,8,9 April 2007,"This is a classic horror film that wasn't bad at all until towards the end. It is about living dead or zombies and they certainly grossed me out. It was kind of funny until the barbecue, and then is became a little gruesome. It makes me afraid as they will even eat my barbecue, which usually gets a little burned. I guess they like it crispy for the most part, but the entrails were just plain disgusting. It is just not right what they did to Ben (Duane Jones). Barbara (Judith O'Dea) was like a zombie herself the entire movie. I guess it was the trauma. It was funny watching them leave or toss their smokes without concern in the wood house. It even had nudity, which surprised me. You have to see the classics to appreciate the never movies.",Night of the Living Dead
31,zardoz-13,The Landmark Zombie Film of All Time!!!,10,13 April 2011,"Freshman director George Romeo reinvented the zombie movie with his low-budget, black & white chiller ""Night of the Living Dead."" Previously, virtually all zombie movies revived the undead through the use of voodoo, as in the Bela Lugosi classic ""White Zombie"" and the RKO feature ""I Walked with a Zombie."" Primarily, these zombies were manipulated like puppets by a human master, but ""Night of the Living Dead"" changed the modus operandi of zombies. Romeo's reanimated dead were controlled by nobody but their ravenous cannibalistic appetite for human flesh. Although he produced this nail-biter on a reportedly minuscule budget of $114-thousand, Romeo exploited his dearth of financing and an unknown cast fully to his advantage because we in the audience weren't sure either who would die or when they will bite the dust. Romeo made three sequels ""Dawn of the Dead,"" ""Day of the Dead,"" and later ""Land of the Dead."" In the first two sequels, the heroes change, but Romeo adhered to his humans-holed-up-against-the-zombies scenario. In ""Dawn of the Dead,"" the human survivors barricade themselves in a shopping mall, while in ""Day of the Dead,"" they fortify themselves in a missile silo. The other thing that set this threadbare thriller apart from other chillers was its explicit content. You actually see mutilated dead people as well as zombie munching on human body parts.""Night of the Living Dead"" opens innocuously enough with quarreling siblings Barbra (Judith O'Dea of ""November Son"") and Johnny (Russell Streiner of ""The Majorettes"") visiting a cemetery to see their father's grave. The obnoxious Johnny does his best to scare his sister Barbra because she abhors cemeteries. Little does poor Johnny know that a cadaverous-looking man limping through the cemetery is a zombie. Moreover, this man (Bill Hinzman of ""Satan Claws"") attacks Barbra. Johnny intervenes, but the zombie kills poor Johnny when he smashes Johnny's head against a tombstone. Barbra locks herself in their Pontiac and searches for the key. Too late she realizes that Johnny has the key. Meanwhile, the desperate zombie picks up a brick and smashes a window with it. Mind you, this doesn't seem like the act of a mindless monster. As the zombie struggles to get to her, Barbra improvises and releases the hand brake so that the car coasts downhill. She manages to escape and finds the farmhouse. The zombie staggers after her and things look bleak. An intelligent African-American male, Ben (Duane Jones of ""Vampires""), shows up and wards off the zombies with a tire-iron and a torch. Eventually, Ben supervises the motley collection of survivors as they contend with the mounting numbers of zombies. While Ben struggles to board up the house, Romeo relies on a radio newscaster to provide exposition about their predicament and present a bigger picture of disaster. The Zenith radio plays as integral a part in the action as any of the human participants. As he ransacks a closet, Ben discovers a repeating rifle and ammunition. Not long afterward, Ben and Barbra learn that a family has hidden themselves in the basement. The premise of ""Night of the Living Dead"" is that the dead get a new lease on life thanks to radiation from a crashed rocket. The radiation revitalizes them so they can walk the earth and feast on the flesh and blood of defenseless mankind. It seems that a space probe returning from Venus exploded in the atmosphere. The only way to kill these shuffle-footed corpses is to shoot them in the head. Meantime, if firearms are available, people can rely on flaming torches to hold these corpses at bay. Seven total strangers take refuge in a secluded Pennsylvania farmhouse where a legion of corpses besieges them. The zombies comes in all sizes, shapes, sexes. In fact, one of the zombies is played by a naked woman! Essentially, ""Night of the Living Dead"" is like a cavalry versus the Indians with the Indians having surrounded and cut-off the cavalry.""Night of the Living Dead"" has a terrific ending that is laced with irony.",Night of the Living Dead
32,grantss,The movie that started the zombie genre,6,27 February 2016,"Brother and sister Johnny and Barbra are visiting their father's grave in a remote cemetery when suddenly they are attacked by zombies. Barbra finds refuge in a farmhouse, along with some other people...The movie that started the zombie-horror genre. Looks dated now, because its format has been copied so many times. Looks fairly amateurish, though that's the idea.Plot is pretty standard, but the rough-and-ready cinematography creates the atmosphere and the realistic feeling.Acting is mostly pretty poor, but, then again, these are no-name actors, often in their first movie.",Night of the Living Dead
33,Boba_Fett1138,Low budget horror really doesn't get any better than this.,8,19 December 2006,"It's amazing how one low-budget flick influenced and redefined an entire genre.Before ""Night of the Living Dead"", zombie movies were mostly movies that relied on its atmosphere and not necessarily its horror or gore and were mostly set at exotic, far off, locations. Zombies weren't flesh eating monsters, they're were slaves that were controlled by a master, as showed in classic zombie movies such as ""White Zombie"" and ""I Walked with a Zombie"". George A. Romero completely threw this existing genre elements overboard and almost completely reinvented the genre. Sometimes I miss the old zombie flicks but George A. Romero introduced us to a totally new and great world of horror movies, that influenced many later movies. Copied a lot, never surpassed.Perhaps the best thing about the movie is that its low-budget but that this mostly doesn't show on screen. With creepy zombies and simple locations, George A. Romero creates a creepy, as well as realistic (and maybe because of that creepy) atmosphere. The movie could had easily gone over-the-top and became a real campy one. Considering the resources they had, they did an extremely good job with this movie. The movie is shot in atmospheric black & white. Perhaps this was done to tone down the graphic moments of the movie? Or just because it was the cheapest thing to do? But whatever the reason is, it works well for the movie and its atmosphere and it reminded me of some old '30/'40's atmospheric horror classics. George A. Romero definitely knew his classics.The story is kept very simple and chooses not to really explain anything. It focuses on just a few characters and mostly chooses not to show anything else that is happening to the world at the moment. It makes you feel close to the characters and their fears. It's one of the reasons why ""Night of the Living Dead"" works well as a creepy horror movie, although it nowhere ever gets really scary or real tense. The movie is mostly predictable, which is also due to the formulaic, stereotypical horror-characters that we're all accustomed to but in the '60's still were quite renewing and became later genre-defining. Still the movie is a bit too amateur like for my taste at times. The directing and editing is really off at times and the acting is just plain bad. The two main character played by Duane Jones and Judith O'Dea pull off quite alright but everyone else is terribly overacting and clearly has no talent for the movie business. It was like watching an Ed Wood movie at times but luckily the moments and atmosphere of the movie compensated for this.As for the gore and graphic moments, it's was pretty shocking for '60's standards and so was the fitting ending but of course in todays perspective it's all rather toned down, also especially when you compare it to George A. Romero's later movies, such as the direct sequel ""Dawn of the Dead"".Not as good and entertaining as ""Dawn of the Dead"" but considering the resources and the enormous influence this movie had on later genre movies, this movie remains a classic horror must-see!8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Night of the Living Dead
34,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Unforgettable classic,8,9 October 2009,"If or when you watch this, try to make certain that it is the regular version, and not the 30th Anniversary Edition, which substitutes about fifteen minutes of film with other footage... what they take out was great the way it was, and what they replace it with actually takes away from this as a whole. It should be noted that Romero was not involved in making that cut. Turning our attention back to the original... this is a marvelous argument, when making a case for fans and young enthusiasts directing. When they are talented and/or have something to say, it can turn out this excellent. This was immensely shocking when it came out, and to this day it's powerful. The script is well-written and treats the audience with respect. No one here acts stupid simply because it was convenient for the author; if or when they do, it's believable, such as the person being (understandably) emotional, and you're at no point pulled out of the experience of the viewing. And in fact, the well-developed, credible and diverse characters do a lot of smart things, and you find yourself cheering for them and hoping they make it, rather than with the newer flicks, where, frankly, it's not uncommon to have the reaction that goes something like this: ""...well, if you're that daft, maybe they should kill you"". The pacing is spot-on, you never feel completely safe for the hour and a half, but it doesn't overwhelm you to the point of over-stimulation, either. This masterfully builds and maintains an atmosphere of terror and impending death, in a bleak and unpleasant world. George understood that horror does not have to involve a force that moves swiftly; they don't even have to possess superior physical strength. The fear comes from this grotesque twist on the mundane and usual. People, potentially even someone you used to know. And it is also derived from the determination, the unstoppable nature... and that they do not need to be fast. Time is on their side... and so are numbers. The acting is a tad mixed, though none of it is downright poor, and O'Dea is stunning, playing catatonic. It's worth mentioning, too, that this has a teenage-ish couple who are in love, without them being constantly randy, irritating or dumb. It's honestly rather sweet, and adds to the humanity of those we follow in this. I will not give away very much of the plot, though I can reveal that this starts with two siblings driving to a cemetery. The dialog is well-delivered, and exposition is handled convincingly, and comes across as being natural. This is intense, scary and dark. It helps to try to forget everything you know about the zombie-sub-genre from later releases. The music is a well-composed score, and always fits. FX are well-done for the time and the budget, and definitely inventive. They don't distract, and they work. There is a moderate amount of gruesome and fairly graphic, bloody violence, disturbing content and gore in this, as well as brief nudity, and mild and infrequent language. The Trilogy of the Dead disc set includes a photo gallery of 8 stills, 5 pages of liner notes, and a trailer. I recommend this to any fan of these movies. 8/10",Night of the Living Dead
35,kevinolzak,"Lean, mean, uncompromising, relentless, a Pittsburgh triumph",10,18 January 2021,"1968's ""Night of the Living Dead"" quickly pulls us in with siblings playfully arguing after spending three hours driving to a lonely cemetery to place a wreath on their father's grave, brother Johnny (Russell Streiner) ever the cynic, recalling how scared sister Barbra (Judith O'Dea) was long ago at this eerie place, and still is: ""they're coming to get you, Barbra!"" No sooner has he said it than a lone stranger (Bill Hinzman) accosts the stunned Barbra, her brother quickly coming to her rescue but killed when his head strikes a tombstone, the terrified girl unable to drive away without the car keys (still in Johnny's pocket), running endlessly until finding an abandoned farmhouse with a locked gas pump nearby, a partially devoured corpse on the second floor. It's not long before she's joined by Ben (Duane Jones), a studious intellectual who lucked into an unoccupied truck after a run in with these 'creatures' at a roadside diner, boarding up all doors and windows until he can figure out a plan of action. A 1939 radio (and later a 1952 television complete with rabbit ears) conveys the seriousness of their emergency, that mass murders are taking place and the killers are reported to indulge in consuming the flesh of the people they kill. At the midway mark the two discover occupants hiding in the cellar, Harry Cooper (Karl Hardman), his wife Helen (Marilyn Eastman), their injured daughter Karen (Kyra Schon), and young couple Tom (Keith Wayne) and Judy (Judith Ridley), all gathering together upstairs to learn more about the escalating horror. Director George Romero himself handles the mike as a Washington reporter asking questions about the Venus probe that might be responsible for the sudden resurgence of the recent dead (some form of radiation), coming back to life mere minutes after dying so that funeral arrangements must necessarily be discarded and the body burned, otherwise another so called 'ghoul' will rise to feed upon the living. Ben thinks it's advantageous to remain upstairs while Harry argues that the cellar is the safest place, neither side willing to yield until the need to find shelter at a rescue station requires the use of Ben's truck if they can distract the ghouls long enough to fill the tank. Disaster strikes as the gasoline is ignited by a burning torch, Tom and Judy roasted alive to provide sustenance for the eager horde, Ben shooting the cowardly Harry in response to his reluctance to unlock the door, dying in the cellar as his now undead daughter is prepared to rise again. The barricades fall, a stunned Barbra becomes the unlikely victim of her own brother Johnny, Helen's attempted escape but a short one as she finds daughter Karen feasting on her own dead father before grabbing a trowel to stab her mother repeatedly in gruesome fashion. Now the only remaining survivor, Ben retreats to the basement to await the coming dawn while Sheriff McClellan (George Kosana) and his brigade march toward the farmhouse. Here at the 79 minute mark we find a newscast conducted by WIIC-TV reporter Bill ""Chilly Billy"" Cardille (beloved host of Chiller Theater), inquiring how a ghoul can be killed: ""beat 'em or burn 'em, they go up pretty easy!"" (Chilly Billy puts in a shorter appearance ten minutes later, roughly 120 seconds on screen). Ben hears gunshots and decides to see what's happening, the resulting climax an uncompromising yet inevitable finale to a lean, mean movie that expertly pulls no punches, a rarity in its relentless approach with no trace of comic relief. Renowned critic Roger Ebert was quick to point out the reaction of children dropped off to see what parents assumed would be a fun time with a typically cheap horror film, its bleak, documentary style all too real for young minds more easily terrified. Cowriter John A. Russo denied any inspiration from Vincent Price's ""The Last Man on Earth,"" but Romero did admit being influenced by its Richard Matheson source material, the 1954 novel ""I Am Legend,"" the title changing from ""Monster Flick"" to ""Night of Anubis"" to ""Night of the Flesh Eaters,"" filming off and on in two week spurts from June to November 1967 on location in Evans City PA. Not once are the creatures referred to as zombies, the filmmakers barnstorming ideas on what would be the most horrific thing a human being can do to another, cannibalism the ultimate choice, spawning five direct sequels by Romero and countless imitations over the decades, not truly flowering until after the release of ""Dawn of the Dead,"" inspiring a rash of Italian ripoffs of often dubious quality. The original sporadically made the rounds in syndication beginning in 1971, and on a personal note your author first viewed it for Halloween 1978 on Pittsburgh indie station WPGH-TV, channel 53, all alone in a darkened household, no better way to endure its indelible chills.",Night of the Living Dead

Scary to the marrow and its cast of unknowns add a singular presence of 'hey this actually could happen'- sensibility.

Ben, the main character, was incredibly adept and quick thinking for his first zombie apocalypse. In fact, Ben was the only sensible character in the whole movie.This movie wasn't about cinematic beauty or even cinematic seamlessness. This was about situation.

38,evanston_dad,The Zombie Movie to End All Zombie Movies,10,10 July 2007,"Perhaps the premier example of how low-budget restrictions can work to the advantage of a film.George Romero's 1968 grindhouse shocker is the granddaddy of every zombie flick made since, and it remains by far the best. A scrappy group of survivors hole up in a deserted farmhouse to take a stand against a horde of rampaging zombies. The usual social dynamics present in movies like this are turned on their ear by the fact that the most capable of the group is black, and Romero makes no attempt to hide the thread of racial tension that this creates. The terrible film stock and remedial editing hide the otherwise likely laughable makeup and special effects, so that the zombies are truly scary, and the gore truly nauseating. This is a visceral, gut-churning and terribly scary, scary movie.Grade: A+",Night of the Living Dead
39,AlsExGal,A great old indy horror film,9,22 November 2009,"Along with ""Carnival of Souls"", this movie stands out as one of the definitive black-and-white horror movies of a bygone drive-in movie era. This movie scared me horribly when I first saw it back in the sixth grade. I had seen other scary movies before, but I think what makes this film so frightening is that there is a somewhat scientific explanation involved and that the horror is occurring to average people. The terror is not due to some supernatural occurrence that we know to be fantasy such as a vampire or some other relic from a 30's or 40's Universal horror film. Also, the drama is playing out in and around a farm house in rural Ohio, not some mythical haunted mansion. This puts you into the dilemma with the players. The fact that such bad acting is in play here just adds to the realism rather than making the film campy.This movie showed something that could have only occurred pre-Watergate. At one point, the people trapped in the farmhouse discover a television and turn it on in search of news of what is going on. Something almost as remarkable to today's audiences as the dead rising from their graves is seen to occur. In Washington, reporters confront a government official about the situation, the government official tells the reporters the truth, and everyone believes what the government has told them. All of this would be truly remarkable in today's environment of mutual mistrust between citizens, government, and the media. Also, although we don't have actual vampires as the villain here, we have a similar dilemma. As the radiation causes the dead to become animated and seek to eat the flesh of the living, each time a victim is bitten, that victim eventually dies only to rise minutes later seeking the flesh of the living themselves, producing a problem that grows geometrically, just as vampires do.Finally, this film has something important to say about race. Unique to 60's films, the group in the farmhouse accepts Ben (Duane Jones), an African-American man, as a leader since he is smart and a quick thinker. This portrayal of an African-American as protagonist and problem solver is also unique to films of forty years ago. The ending is quite powerful, and you have to ask yourself, did race have something to do with the actions of the rescue posse? I don't know if this question was hung out there intentionally by the film's creators for the audience to ponder, but it is a point that is almost impossible to ignore.",Night of the Living Dead
40,Uriah43,The Zombie Movie That Changed the Genre,9,4 October 2012,"As all serious zombie fans know, this film is the ultimate zombie movie. And while it may not have been the ""first"" zombie movie ever created, it set the rules and the standard for which all other zombie films are judged. Now, that is not to say that there aren't good zombie movies out there. But this is the film that essentially started the modern zombie genre. It's as simple as that. Filmed in 1968 on a budget of only $114,000 it has made over $30 million. It was also selected in 1999 to the National Film Registry. Not bad for such a low-budget movie. And because it was so low-budget, the director (George A. Romero) had to be extremely creative. So he filmed in black and white, enlisted ordinary people dressed in clothes from Goodwill and even used chocolate syrup to simulate blood. And it worked! He also used unknown actors like Duane Jones (""Ben"") and Judith O'Dea (""Barbra"") to play the lead roles. And they turned in the performances of their careers. Again, there are plenty of good zombie movies which have been made since this one. There are also plenty of very bad zombies movies made since this one too. But if you're looking for one that is extraordinary then you need look no further than this particular film. On that note, because of an error when they initially registered it, you can probably view it for free over the internet as it is in the public domain. Like I said, it's the best zombie movie--and probably one of the best horror films--you will ever see. So if you haven't seen it then it's worth your time to check it out.

A group of strangers take shelter in an isolated farmhouse, as the long deceased inexplicably rise from the grave and hunger for human flesh. That's in it a nutshell. Director Romero shows he knows how to use sheer tension and good tight dialog to invoke an overwhelming sense of dread. True this isn't his best film (that would be the amazing Dawn?, but it did pave the way and to simply overlook that would be a great disservice indeed.

The problem, it is very bottom heavy...nearly all the chomping action is at the end of the film and the rest of the film is just arguing and nailing boards over windows and doors. I did not find this movie had all that much social commentary in it, lets face it the guy was wrong holding up in the cellar was the smart move to make...just not holding up in the cellar and sneaking around when help finally arrived. Still it is not all bad as the zombie attack at the end was good and it was rather bloody for a film of its time and you have to know Romero did not have much of a budget so he did the best he could with what he had. Also, if it were not for this movie other zombie movies including the much more superior Dawn might not have been made. Still you can tell it is his first effort and the rules for zombies had not yet been established as sometimes they run here, but most of the time they are slow. In the end there is good and bad, I actually prefer the remake in 1990 to the original version, much better actors and effects in that one.",Night of the Living Dead
44,The_Void,One of the most important films ever made,9,5 October 2005,"Night of the Living Dead wasn't the first film to ever use the idea of an apocalypse; The Last Man on Earth did almost the same thing four years earlier - but it was Romero's film that popularised it, and this film is pretty much responsible for every zombie film ever made post-1968. Through excellent black and white cinematography, a claustrophobic atmosphere and some shocking scenes of zombie slaughter; Night of the Living Dead is an out and out horror classic. This film upset many people upon it's release in 1968, and despite being over three decades old - the film has lost none of it's nastiness. The plot is very simple, and it follows the idea of the dead returning to life and feasting upon the living. We follow a farmhouse full of people trying to evade the carnage. There is never any solid explanation given about why the dead are returning to life - only an idea about radiation from space. This actually helps the film, though, because there is never an attempt to save humanity or discover why it is happening; we just follow the people in trouble, and that immensely adds to the horror.Romero constantly makes sure that the audience is aware that we're following a group of people without much hope. The scene is always isolated, and the sparing use of radio and television gives the protagonists their only window into the wider world. Romero's use of the camera enforces the isolation in the farmhouse. He uses a lot of close-up's and angled shots, which adequately show the closed space. One of the things that this low budget zombie flick will always be remembered for is the fact that it was the first horror film to feature an African-American. This casting is just one example of Romero's lust for rule breaking, and there are many moments of zombie carnage in the film that seem to be there just to upset the more conservative Americans. These scenes also serve the film in it's bid to be frightening, and when combined with the hopeless, downbeat aura of the film; it's all very horrific. Many of the 'zombie rules' were created in this film, and the build up to the ending that sees two of the main characters killed is absolute pure brilliance. On the whole; horror cinema wouldn't be the same without this film. The fact that it's aged so well is no coincidence.",Night of the Living Dead
45,zetes,People actually prefer this to Carnival of Souls?,7,13 March 2003,"First thing first: Carnival of Souls kicks this movie's butt so hard that its spine shoots right out of its skull and launches forward so far that it breaks the world record for javelin throwing. The first fifty minutes or so are really terrible, about as clumsily directed and written as anything I can think of. Romero can't think of anything for Barbra (Judith O'Dea, whose look should prove without a shadow of a doubt that Romero had in fact seen Herk Harvey's film) to do than sit around staring insanely. The other characters are just as bland and illogical, although it's nice to see a black hero. Duane Jones gives the film's only decent performance. The only way Romero knows how to move the narrative forward is with the television and radio news programs, which provide us with far too much explanation for what's going on. The movie starts to pick up when the (far too many) characters attempt to escape the house in which they've boarded themselves up. There are a couple of surprises along the way, and the dread does begin to build. But then the final twist is far too predictable. Whatever little it was building towards falls apart. 6/10.",Night of the Living Dead
46,trashgang,the first one...didn't really deliver,6,8 June 2011,"No one will believe me when I tell them that this is the first time I saw Night Of The Living Dead. I'm in the genre from the eighties but as you might know, I'm not into 50's and 60's flicks. And this one shows me again why. I agree that it was the first flick that started it all but face it, where's the gore. zombie flicks are know for their gore and here most bites are done off-screen. The zombies itself looks really well for the time being but still it's all a lot of talking. If you look at Dawn or Day then that's something different. the red stuff flows and the gore is there. naturally it wasn't really done to show gore but look at Blood Feast. It did contain the red stuff and the gore and don't get me wrong. A good horror doesn't need blood, look at Halloween or Texas Chainsaw. No drip is included. It is one that you must have in your collection to have all the 'of the dead' titles but for me, too much talking and didn't deliver any frightening moments, maybe the zombiechild in the cellar but still...Of course it's famous as the first zombie flick were zombies really walk and don't wander around, S. William Hinzman did set a new thing towards the zombie flicks. He will always be the name as first walking zombie just for his face alone, a thing George noticed as he was in the crew and not as an actor in this flick. The rest is history.

The producers could help with the US budget! Chilling but the acting is sort of Death Race 2000ish, awkward, but believable enough. Speaking of Death Race 2000, I bought Night of the Living Dead and Death Race 2000 for 2.98 at Zellars for a cheap movie night last weekend. The DVD's were cheaper than renting at Rogers or Block Busters. Enough off topic review, the directing and story save the movie's short comings. The survival concept keeps the viewer interested. I noticed a few events I would have done different. Why would they turn all the house lights on, would that not attract more Zombies? The windows get boarded up, but the kitchen window is left unboarded. The ending is effective, how the protagonist thought he survived. Well, you'll see if you watch this movie. A 6 out of 10.

One, just how many elements Romero used again in his Dawn of the Dead, the way the women are sidelined at first, the way the 'ghouls' move, the use of the media to tell the background story and a non white lead etc but also how surprising it is to find just how well made and scary this is. Not, frightened out of my cinema seat scared, as when I saw it on theatrical release but still, in your face, jumpy and relentlessly worrying. Considering how influential the movie has been over the years it shouldn't be a surprise to be reminded how good it is but it certainly is remarkable how well this seemingly modest b/w film from the late sixties holds up and still packs a punch with no wasted moments from the brilliant humour infused opening to the dramatic and nuanced ending.

The monster that is the zombie has been a little experimented with before with the film ""White Zombie"" but never like the dark depths that George took it too. To think that this film almost never would have made it to the public since George threw it in the trunk of his car thinking nobody would ever buy it, low and behold not only did the film sell but has one of greatest group of fans to follow it. Such a degrading film for it's time with naked, scarred up, chewed up zombies eating human flesh, there was no film like Night of the Living Dead. The metaphor that we are guaranteed 2 things in life: birth and death, the slow inevitable death that is walking towards you as if you are looking at your future self is just horrific. George was way ahead of his time and that's why Night of the Living Dead still gives me nightmares to this day.Barbra and Johnny drive to rural Pennsylvania to visit their father's grave. When Barbra is afraid Johnny teasingly frightens; whereupon they are attacked by a zombie. Johnny tries to rescue his sister, but is then presumably killed when the man shoves him head first onto a tombstone. Barbra flees, with the killer in pursuit; eventually she ran off to an empty farmhouse where she discovers the half-eaten corpse. Running out of the house, she notices a man named Ben arrives in a pickup truck, drags Barbra back into the house, and barricades the doors and windows. Meanwhile, hiding in the cellar are a married couple, Harry and Helen Cooper, their daughter Karen, and teenage couple Tom and Judy. Harry asks everyone to hide in the cellar, but Ben deems it a ""deathtrap"" and remains upstairs. As they fight through the night for their lives, they try to escape to a safe house but the zombies outside have pulled up the table with the salt and pepper and are a bit hungry for some human flesh.George casted a black lead, which was so unheard of at the time, I'm sure he never looked at the color but what a groundbreaking moment. He's the smart man who knows how to fight and even hit a white woman, what risks George took with this movie. The film is by no means perfectly made, but you have to understand that this was a low budget film made by a group of friends, however, when you think compared to today's low budget films that have no story with it, it's all about the gore, Night of the Living Dead broke that mold. I have a little tradition every year on Halloween, I have to watch this movie because it is one of the best horror movies of all time. How could you not still get the chills when little Karen turns into a zombie and goes after her mother with a shovel, her mother screaming ""Baby!"" and falls crying and screaming as her daughter just continues stabbing her to death, God, what a horrific scene! Taking a chance with a depressing ending, not to spoil too much as I feel that I already have but I envy anyone who sees this film for the first time because I like to see their reactions to this movie. A groundbreaking film, a horrifying story and a cast and crew that gave all effort, Night of the Living Dead is a terrific scary movie not to be missed.9/10",Night of the Living Dead

53,Red-Barracuda,Seminal 60's shocker,9,5 August 2008,"This little 60's movie is one of the most important in the horror genre. Not only was it the first of George Romero's zombie films but also one of the first films to take a traditionally supernatural horror idea, give it scientific plausibility and deliver it with both a gritty realism and shocking violence. This was a horror film that was part of the new breed of movies that had started to be made in the late 60's. Its shocking ending recalled the nihilistic final scenes of the likes of Bonnie and Clyde (1967) and Easy Rider (1969). Its violence echoed the horrors of the Vietnam War that was raging at the time. It went against type by casting a black man in the lead role. Night of the Living Dead was truly a bona fide counter-culture horror movie.Shot on an incredibly low budget, the grainy black and white image gives the film a somewhat unique feel. How many other films that have depicted gory violence have not been in colour? Admittedly this was a budgetary decision but it does give NOTLD an almost documentary feel at times, which gives it quite an unusual impact. Perhaps the one low-budget limitation that does let the film down is the library music used. This unremarkable soundtrack really feels like it belongs in another movie and doesn't do too much to add to the claustrophobic terror on the screen. But, in every other respect, this is low-budget film-making at it's best. Not only is it a thrill-ride but it is intelligent. Every character is flawed in some way, i.e. can we honestly say that the hero Ben ultimately made the right choice in defending the house?Night of the Living dead is not the best in Romero's zombie series but it is a hugely influential work. It not only laid down a template for all zombie movies that followed but also, along with Hitchcock's Psycho (1960), was one of the American horror films from the 60's that presented it's terrors in a contemporary world and, as a result, helped usher terror films into the modern age.",Night of the Living Dead

I feel the black & white really enhanced this flick - it gave it an eerier effect than a colour film ever could. The B&W gave the zombies an almost ghostly and most definitely a ghastly appearance. I think if this movie would have been in colour then it would not have the strong appeal and overall creepiness to it that the B&W gave.This is a wonderful late at night film that I would highly recommend to fans of the horror genre.

There are some very graphic moments of the ""ghouls"" eating flesh, but it isn't gratuitous - the purpose of those shots seems to be to introduce the viewer to the same horror being seen by the characters. Inside the farmhouse, as this small group tries to survive, the focus is on the dynamics between them, shifting back to the ghouls only when an escape plan is worked out. Radio and TV are used very effectively to allow the characters (and the viewers) to gain knowledge of what's going on not just at this farmhouse but all over. Interestingly for 1968, the movie portrays a black man (played by Ben Hanser) as taking charge of the situation in the farmhouse. That the radiation came from outer space plays upon a fear that did exist in the early years of space flight - what if something terrible came back from outer space with an astronaut? (Remember the lengthy quarantines the early Apollo astronauts were subjected to after their flights.) The low budget feel of the movie isn't a problem, and in fact in some ways adds to the creepy feel. I might take issue with the title. It gives away what might have been the highlight - struggling with the authorities to figure out just what these ""murderers"" actually are",Night of the Living Dead
57,StrictlyConfidential,Certainly Worth A View,6,27 March 2020,"If the viewer is actually willing to not only look beyond ""Night of the Living Dead's"" low-budget production values - As well as its obviously amateurish direction - Then - I'm certain that they are bound to be drawn into this truly ghoulish story of flesh-eating zombies that (surprisingly enough) still manages to pack a wallop 52 years after its initial release.Now, I would never say that ""Night of the Living Dead"" was a bona-fide zombie masterpiece - But, hey! - When you seriously think that this particular picture actually broke new ground (way back in 1968) in the genre of horror - I think that it rightfully deserves some special consideration and due respect for itself.....

I always give the same answer  Night of the Living Dead. There is no movie that fills me with more of a sense of unease, literally has the hair on the back of my neck standing on end, and causes me to actually look in the dark corners of a room like George Romero's masterpiece. Fear is so subjective that I am fully aware that what frightens me might not automatically frighten you. But in the case of Night of the Living Dead, I have trouble understanding how anyone isn't affected the same way I am. It's that powerful to me.I'm not the biggest Romero fan in the world, but I am of Night of the Living Dead. What he was able to accomplish with an obviously limited budget is nothing short of amazing. Romero created more atmosphere in the opening ten minutes of Night of the Living Dead than most directors with unlimited budgets ever could. Some of the acting may not be the best you'll run across, but for me that only adds to the film's authentic feel. They seem like real people trapped in that house. The special effects may not be as realistic as those in other zombie movies, but I've never seen what someone eating a kidney really looks like. It works very well with me. Finally, the ending is as bleak and powerful as any horror movie I've seen. Most directors would have been tempted (or forced) to give it a happy ending. Thankfully, Romero isn't most directors.In short, Night of the Living Dead is the stuff of real nightmares.",Night of the Living Dead
59,gridoon,Highly atmospheric but very dated.,6,19 November 1999,"I've seen ""Night of the Living Dead"" a couple of times by now and I believe that this movie, historically important as it - undoubtedly - is, doesn't hold up very well. Two major reasons:1) It's technically dated. While the b/w cinematography is excellent and the zombies look quite convincing, the ""nervous"" editing style often looks clumsy and inept.2) There are some huge lulls. All those radio and TV bulletins, which are supposed to be ""enlightening"" and explain what's going on, actually interrupt the action boringly. Watching the heroes watching TV for about 10 minutes isn't that interesting.There are some chilling moments in this film, and the pessimistic finale is ironic and brilliant, but the film as a whole just isn't as effective as it (probably) was during its first release. Another person here mentioned that it's also kind of a homage to ""The Birds"". I agree, but even with a higher budget, this film would still be far inferior to that amazing Hitchcock classic.",Night of the Living Dead
60,lost-in-limbo,Game Changer.,10,7 August 2020,"George A. Romero's regional b/w ground-breaking zombie classic laid the ground work for many to follow, often imitated, but few ever do come close to surpassing, let alone matching the raw, intense and simplistic horror experience of the straggling dead rising up to feast on the living. While the zombies were always a threat, Romero made sure that we never got too comfortable. By playing up the stress, fear and conflict of the self-preserved human nature between one another boiling to the surface, when encountering something you just can't comprehend and that's heighten by its close quarters farmhouse. When it came to the shocks, they're effectively staged, topical shades thematically underlined and the ending is so iconic. So what else can I say - it gets better, every time I revisit the film.P.s looked great in 4K on the big screen after only ever watching scratched up prints of this benchmark horror classic.",Night of the Living Dead
61,ElMaruecan82,Pray for they'll never come at you,9,11 January 2012,"""Night of the Living Dead"" looks like a nightmare, feels like a nightmare, as a matter of fact, it IS a nightmare; a harrowing experience we impatiently wait for its conclusion, something that disturbingly raises itself above all the preconceived notion of cinema's horror and give the genre a whole new resonance in 1968. And George Romero, a then gifted 29-year old director, pulls the strings of our emotions with a remarkable craftsmanship, guiding us from disbelief to shock until one of the most haunting endings from any film, all genres considered.I liked ""Braindead"" and ""28 Days Later"", but as much as I 'enjoy' zombies' film, I didn't expect much when I watched ""Night of the Living Dead"". I respected it for it's the one that started it all but I couldn't apprehend that the film would scare me more than ""Jaws"" or ""The Exorcist"". But the more I think of it, the more I realize that this is precisely the mindset Romero expected us to have, to better catch us off guard. And in a way, the low budget quality of the film and its B-movie feel, plays a significant role by adding a level of realism in the nightmare, making it much scarier. The black and white, the relative anonymousness of the actors, the shakiness of the camera emphasize the realism of the movie as it looks like the cameramen are also trapped in that nightmare, a more sophisticated direction would have deprived the film from that crucial touch.The film borrows though some tricks from previous masterpieces of horror. Take the ghouls, the way they walk, the sounds they make, their hideous faces are already disturbing but what provokes the sheer sensation of terror is the mass effect. Imagine one ugly cockroach invading your room, you know you can handle it, but if it's an invasion, the only reasonable reaction is to escape. The film, like Hitchcock's ""Birds"" is driven by the same sense of urgency introduced by the first zombie coming at Barbra, the seemingly heroine of the film, and completed by the discovery of the corpse with a fleshless face in the farmhouse, one of these powerful moments that make you take the film a little more seriously. And like in ""Birds"", the horror is emphasized by the fact that we don't know why and how these things happen, all we have is the clues given by the national broadcast program on radio and TV, punctuating the films between so many thrilling sequences.Trapped in this claustrophobic setting, we're left with people trying to figure out what to do and where to hide? Not only the decisions must be taken quickly but the debates going over the things to do create an even more heart-pounding subplot. There are obviously two polar forces, the hero Ben and the cowardly Mr. Cooper, and while the acting is sometimes perceived as a minor force in horror film, here, the two characters approach their roles with a remarkable level of authenticity. At one point, Cooper asks with disbelief if he was supposed to get off the cave and help a woman because he heard screams, Duane Jones' reaction is perfect, he quietly replies: ""yes, exactly"", the film is one of there trapped-into-critical- situations that makes you forget it's about monsters but human beings trying to act for their survival. While we can't help but root for Ben, at many points, we feel like we wouldn't have been as heroic as him.And during that hellish journey, Romero's mastered directing enlighten us about the zombies in the most unsettling ways: when the teenage couple dies in an unexpected explosion, the horror of their death is not enough, we endure a gruesome aftermath where the ghouls take their bodies and start eating their flesh in an orgy of blood and human remains. The part is disgusting because we knew the victims, and taking their death for granted wasn't enough, Romero intelligently avoids the horror's tricks that tend to undermine deaths' shocking value to relief the audience and make the protagonists, witness from these deaths, their potential demise. And while panic reaches the consciences, the death's imminence highlights people's inner personalities, and the antagonism between Cooper and Ben evolves until the house gets too small for the both of them. The directing even allows some subtle moments where Ben sees Cooper hiding behind a door when he was supposed to let him enter the house, then, we understand that rooting for a character is almost pointless, as confirmed by the catatonic state of Barbra, the female lead.In the process, all the protagonists are getting killed and become ghouls themselves, contaminated by the presence of Cooper's daughter who was bitten by zombies and eventually become one, and it only takes the providential help of TV for Ben to understand how to kill the ghouls, by shooting in their heads. The morning after, an armed posse executing zombies one by one and while it could have ended as a classic B-movie, Romero's film ends as a disturbing masterpiece when Ben who survived all the nightmarish mayhem is taken for a zombie and takes a bullet between his eyes. The film ends while the credits show him disposed with the other ghouls in a bonfire ready to be set. I really didn't see that coming, and I was left speechless staring at the TV screen many minutes after the film finished. How could they have killed the hero? With the assassination of Martin Luther King, I guess it's almost impossible to overlook a social commentary aspect, but whether it was intentional or not, the ending is the strike of genius that cements the film's greatness. In a year full of heart-pounding thrillers like ""Rosemary's Baby"" or ""Bullitt"", ""Night of the Living Dead"" is a groundbreaking tour de force that would change the face of horror forever.",Night of the Living Dead
62,Pjtaylor-96-138044,In the heat of the zombie apocalypse.,7,9 August 2019,"Romero's classic practically invented, never-mind defined, the zombie genre. It's single-handedly responsible for the majority of tropes associated with it - including but not limited to 'killing the head', zombie cannibalism and 'turning once bitten'. 'Night Of The Living Dead (1968)' also set the standard for the kind of stories told using these shambling creations. Not only did it establish a sense that the in-fighting between humans is far deadlier than the actual foes lurking outside, but it also paved the way for the 'horror as social commentary' angle that a lot of features now aim to replicate. Whether or not it was an initial intention, the film is actually about racism. The main tensions that plague our human characters are, it's implied, racial and the bleak ending makes it clear that even the end of the world can't wash away humanity's prejudice. This subtext is bold, especially when you consider the time and political landscape to which the piece was released. I mean, a black protagonist is, sadly, rare enough today. That's why the movie's statement still stands strong even if you watch it purely for its straight-up horror. That's entirely possible, too. It's clearly inspired by silent horror of the 1920s - especially an extended sequence in which a traumatised woman runs around a proverbial haunted house - and the Universal classics of the 1930s (apparently the iconic zombie saunter was inspired by Boris Karloff in 'The Walking Dead (1936)'). It pushes boundaries in terms of violence, though, with on-screen cannibalism, brain bashing and other gory injuries being pretty prevalent. The choice to shoot black-and-white makes things feel markedly more realistic, almost like one of the many news-casts used to deliver exposition throughout the experience. It also masks the fact that the blood is, in reality, chocolate sauce. The narrative itself is slightly slow, especially as it transitions from the first to the second act, and some of the character conflicts don't quite ring true - especially considering where they end up. Still, you care about all the core characters and things get suitably tense towards the end. It's important to remember, too, that the picture is paving the way for an entire generation of filmmakers. As such, the plot developments that seem so familiar - and, even, old-hat - to modern audiences are actually brand new, seen here for (essentially) the very first time. Audiences in 1968 mightn't have even known the villains were dead; the title could've been hyperbolic, after all. Overall, the piece is entertaining, downbeat and socially-conscious. Sometimes, where it all started seems all too familiar. Still, the film holds up to this day. It's an easy recommendation to fans of the genre. 7/10",Night of the Living Dead
63,ThomasDrufke,Paved the Way for Zombie Films for Decades to Come,7,22 October 2019,"If for nothing else, Night of the Living Dead is a fascinating look into a world of television and film that wasn't flooded with undead material, whether it be 3 Walking Dead related shows, or Zombie sequels like this past weekends Zombieland 2, it's a much different time now than it was in 1968. So if you judge the film as being one of the first true zombie films to take off in the mainstream, it's a much more enjoyable experience. Heck, this film does something that most undead flicks don't which is adding a certain amount of intelligence to the creatures, like using weapons? No matter, you can appreciate the craft from George A Romero, even if it doesn't hold up as much as you'd like.7.0/10",Night of the Living Dead
64,Cineanalyst,Undying Relevance,9,12 April 2020,"""Night of the Living Dead"" is a remarkable film for manifold reasons: a low-budget exploitation horror film cum cult classic turned widely seen and acclaimed masterpiece culturally and stylistically; credited with redefining a word, ""zombie,"" never muttered in the film, yet launching the subgenre of zombies popular throughout media to this day; a movie supposedly never intended as social commentary, nonetheless, prominently featuring an African-American lead and an ironic, tragic ending during the Civil Rights movement, on the eve of of the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. Even today, with the current pandemic, the picture takes on added relevance, with the characters and audiences sharing in stay-at-home orders, glued to such communication and news devices as radio and TV, fearful of the encroaching enemy outside, coming to get you.Of course, in reality, one may be more likely to be viewing films such as ""Night of the Living Dead"" than boarding up their doors and windows. Regardless, as with subsequent zombie movies, there's the spread of disease, although, here, there's not so much a virus as some space-age radiation nonsense (""The Andromeda Strain"" written the next year and later adapted as a 1971 film contains a similar premise), although, indeed, the following year, the first men on the Moon would be quarantined over such concerns. The lead, Ben, at one point, voices concern over the disease their ghoulish attackers may be spreading. The Cooper's daughter, infected by one, is somewhat quarantined in the cellar--although social distancing becomes a problem. Even though the radiation raising the recently deceased is reported as the main cause of outbreak, then, there is still an element of it being a contact--albeit, specifically through biting--disease.While many look back to Haitian or African folklore or, as director George A. Romero specifically cited, the vampires from the novel ""I Am Legend"" (adapted as movies in 1964, 1971 and 2007), I see a more specific cinematic influence here, namely, ""Frankenstein"" (1931) and its sequels. Like Frankenstein's monster, the undead here are slow-moving, foot-dragging and mute or otherwise grunting reanimated corpses. They are scared and held back by fire. Heck, I think I even caught a brief glimpse of one ghoul that was wearing Frankenstein-esque makeup. The main difference, I suppose, is the cannibalism, but the killing of the living remains. So, too, to an extent does the metaphor of monster as movie. Granted, unlike Frankenstein's monster, the zombies aren't edited together from various body parts; rather, they disassemble the flesh and organs from others--something of the inverse of Frankenstein's creature and more akin to the mad doctor as filmmaker consuming raw material to make a meal. Recalling the history of nitrate film, too, the main threat to this reanimated picture is a decomposing body and, ultimately, catching on fire.How striking, then, that ""Night of the Living Dead"" was photographed in black and white and oft with chiaroscuro lighting and filmed at night--in the vein of those classic Universal monster movies and horror films of yesteryear. A generally effective score, too, is recycled from other sources. On the other hand, the style here was otherwise revolutionary, with camera angles seemingly chosen on the fly, sometimes abrupt editing, canted views to reflect the strange and uneasy subject matter--guerrilla filmmaking to reflect the sudden and relentless attack from the army of undead. While I must scratch my head as to why characters hide from slow moving and relatively smart (they use tools, after all) but weak zombies, yet, now, in the age of fast and strong zombies, characters choose to run from them, the shacking up in a country house here is admittedly affective of a claustrophobic and isolated panic. Moreover, it should be remembered that this was a gory picture in its day.Intended as such or not, the casting of an African-American lead was a stroke of brilliance, as well, and quite rare in American films then. The picture assumes considerably more subtextual resonance. Romero may've realized this after the fact, as he seems to have intentionally layered more social commentary into subsequent projects, whether, say, the Vietnam War in ""The Crazies"" (1973) or materialism in ""Dawn of the Dead"" (1978), for example. Consequent of this casting, ""Night of the Living Dead"" plays as an interracial couple shacking up, where the black man is the ""boss,"" and being attacked by a Zombie Klan, apparently all white, only to, then, be further slaughtered by a Bull Connor type sheriff and apparently all-white militia. The struggle between Ben and Harry also seems to take on a racial dimension. The concluding still photographs, as audio continues and only to be interrupted by fiery motion, plays out like police or news reporting on the results of a lynch mob. It's not so much that Ben may've been tragically mistaken as ghoul, rather that he was seen as inhuman in the first place by undeadly racism--a disease passed on from since-deceased ancestors but rising like the dead to attack the still living, one that the TV talking heads and radio voices may portray as mostly coming from the Southeastern United States, but a wound that, in fact, has spread all over the place.Sure, ""Night of the Living Dead,"" a low-budget exploitation flick isn't as technically and performatively flawless as a Hollywood studio product. There's too much telling and not showing, including by radio and TV, and Ben and Barbara waste time telling each other stories, one of which sounds more extravagant than anything Romero and company could've filmed within budget and, worse, Barbara recites the opening sequence we just watched. The actress playing Barbara isn't great, either, and she's certainly done no favors by a scenario calling for the damsel-in-distress routine, nor are some of the other characterizations more than generic. Indeed, it doesn't look or sound flawless. We sacrificed those production values and assembly-line touches seen in the countless, mass-produced entertainments from Hollywood to see something we hadn't seen before. And the shock was so great that the studios and other filmmakers reintegrated the zombies, as well as other themes and style, back into their machinery. They're no longer coming to get you; we've long been slayed and have been consuming such fare ever since.",Night of the Living Dead
65,gbill-74877,"Great beginning and ending, but slow in the middle",7,4 April 2019,"4.5 stars out of 5 for the first and last 10 minutes, which are fantastic. Those wild camera angles at the beginning, ""they're coming to get you, Barbara"", and the way we're plunged into the action is great stuff. And without spoiling it, the entrails, that scene in the cellar, and the very end - especially the end - wow, it's brilliant. I also loved the casting of an African-American (Duane Jones) for the intelligent, resourceful lead, which director George A. Romero did simply based on his audition, independent of race. The inadvertent result of that is a powerful layer to the subtext which shows men not getting along and fighting one another even when they're hunkered down under zombie attack.The reason I didn't rate the overall film higher is the hour to an hour and fifteen minutes in the middle (yes, 70-80% of the film). It's painfully slow, and I thought Romero focused too much first on the nailing up of the place, and then on the argument about whether to go down into the cellar or not. The worst segment was the back and forth between the young couple before they go out to get gas - it's laugh out loud bad, between the wooden dialogue, poor acting, and tight shots on her insipid face. All I wanted there was either a meaningful scene, or a return to the zombies, who had been absent for far too long.I find myself trapped in the reviewer's dilemma of wanting to credit a movie for the period in which it was made and it's ground-breaking influence, but at the same time, being true to my experience in 2019. I wouldn't want to pop it in again or recommend it without reservations, both of which top out my score in the higher end of the average range.",Night of the Living Dead

67,secondtake,"Turning Tables on Race, Horror, and Hollywood",8,21 June 2009,"Night of the Living Dead (1968)Breakthrough film, low budget but high styleThis is a great, creaky horror film, with shades of 1920s expressionism and 1960s hip/underground counterculture. It is really nutty and crude and grotesque, but brilliant and scary, too. There's no question that it's rawness makes it seem like our own home movie, and so our own reality. It's not just a Hollywood trick to have zombies breaking down your door.The fact that the main character and most sane person is African-American is no small thing. Not only does this logically pull from the Haitian roots of zombi-ism, but it breaks barriers of basic interpersonal racial hierarchies. That is, the movies, lagging behind much of real life, had rarely played the black male in a lead role with such honest lack of self-consciousness before--maybe ever. I'd have to wrack my brain to see what other films are contenders, and I don't mean to dis the great contribution of Paul Robeson, Sidney Poitier, and others (which includes a number from the 1960s), but Night of the Living Dead is at least a contender in adding to a normalcy for the next generation, a seemingly more liberal and ""enlightened"" society of young people who are now, thankfully, the norm. Look who's president.What makes the movie important beyond this, in terms of movie-making, is that it fits in with a broader trend to a naturalism in the details, that now-famous shift in the late 1960s to filming with less polish and more everyday believability. I just watched MASH (1970) and was surprised to see it there--you forget how movies from the early/mid 1960s, even great ones about middle class people like The Apartment (1960) and Breakfast at Tiffany's (1961) or even The Odd Couple (1968) are stylized and ""perfect"" in some controlled (and brilliant) way. I like those kinds of movies, sometimes prefer them very much, but I see the penetration of this other kind of home-movie no-nonsense truth. And so do other people. Night of the Living Dead is the highest grossing film of 1968.You do wonder why our hero doesn't just call for help at the end. He is too smart to just get shot, but once that happens, the film does something conspicuous--it turns to still frames in a newspaper kind of texture, as if we are seeing documentary photojournalism in print. This adds to a kind of realism and finality, but it also reminds us of African-American victims of violence in the 1960s, seen this same way in the news. The fact that the white authorities are typical rural guys of the time, rednecks in some stereotyped way, and that they casually kill this black man, takes on significance.Not that the zombies are real, or that the acting is consistent (it sometimes is stellar). But as a style, you enter the film with different eyes, and different--not lower--expectations. Like watching a silent film, or Star Wars, or any variety of movie, you learn how to watch it right away, and adapt to its rules. The world within this film is bizarre and gripping and fabulous, in every sense of the words. Director Romero puts it together with such intuitive artfulness, you accept all its foibles as necessary to the end. Don't expect The Shining or Frankenstein or any alternative horror flick, and take its odd genius for what it is.",Night of the Living Dead

69,ironhorse_iv,"This Zombie movie is contagion, you will get bitten!!",7,11 February 2013,"Without Night of the Living Dead, there wouldn't be any Walking Dead or any of the modern history 'walking contradictions Zombies' movies. Before this movie, zombies were mindless human beings control by voodoo witches or doctors. Surprising there is no zombies is this film, at less not call 'zombies'. They are call 'Ghouls' here. George Romero wasn't really trying to make a zombie movie at all. At first, Romero was making a teenage alien movie comedy. After failing at that idea, the straight angle is that Romero didn't made the zombie movie. He mold it, drawing inspiration from Richard Matheson's I am Legend, a horror/science fiction novel about a vampire-like creature plague that ravages the world and really much rip it off. Night of Anubis and Night of the Flesh Eaters later becomes Night of the Living Dead- the modern day gore full horror. I would rather see a horror movie that could actually scare me to just one with a bunch of gruesome scenes turned into a movie. While this movie has some pretty ugly gore scenes, the story plot is very interesting. Since the movie is in the public domain, there is many versions of the film such as colorization version. The colorization version is alright, but seeing green zombies just reminds me of Frankenstein. I would rather have the grey zombies in the color version. The original copies are the black and white low budget film that tells the story of survivors of the zombie apocalypse whom trapped in a rural farmhouse being attacked by unnamed living dead creatures. Night of the Living Dead takes place in real time (there are no forward jumps or flashbacks), bringing us an hour and a half of a group of people defending themselves from murderous zombies. This temporal continuity is quite unusual in contemporary film. The first survivor is Barbara (Judith O'Dea), a main character whom trauma makes her useless. She is over-acting. Act naturally, Judith. It's interesting how women are portrayed in this film: Quiet, defenseless, reliant. Barbara while visiting somebody's tombstone with her brother Johnny was attack by the very first zombie played by Bill Heinzman. Bill Heinzman plays it off following Boris Karloff's monster in Frankenstein in the way, the creature moves. WIthout Bill Heinzman, we couldn't know how zombies can move. She is the first character to come into view, but the real hero is Ben (Duane Jones), the only survivor who has a bit of common sense and looks like he might be the only one worthy to survive. Without giving it away, the ending to the film is shocking. The movie came out the same year Martin Luther King was assassination. I really don't buy the happy accident casting for it was controversial to cast a black actor at the time. There clearly some social commentary in the film due to the dramatic shift in tone from most other horror movies at the time, the constant emphasis in the radio and TV broadcasts of just how inhuman these 'zombies' are and how people should feel no problem dealing a tremendous blow to the head, and the merry band of rednecks who are chomping at cigars and blowing the hell out of everything they encounter. It didn't help that theme of 'zombie' came from Haitian culture. For me, the creepiest, most unnerving part of the movie isn't the zombies, but rather that theremin-scored photo montage that plays over the credits. A lot of people think the movie was made due to the late 1960s critique of American capitalism with the zombies represent capitalists, and ""cannibalism represents the ultimate in possessiveness, hence the logical end of human relations under capitalism"". I can see the movie themes being something about the Vietnam conflict to racism in America. I just don't see that. I think of it as just a good zombie flick with no message. Yes, the movie is low budget with bits of bad editing from day to night. The zombies can be a bit silly in the modern term with over-acting. Also having intrusive soundtrack, but the movie does have some reason to be well-known. Check it out, zombies fans.",Night of the Living Dead

It got an 8 but it is such a good movie 8 is underrating it. George A Romero is a great writer and director. Duane Jones was a great actor. Judith O'Dea is a great actress. She this movie.,Night of the Living Dead
71,tomgillespie2002,A staunch reminder of Romero's genius,10,10 October 2012,"It's difficult to imagine a pre-zombie world nowadays, given that film, TV and computer games are now littered with the walking dead. The term 'zombie' had been coined many times before, possibly earlier than 1932's White Zombie, but was a label given to creatures and humans under voodoo spells in many different incarnations. In 1968, writers John Russo and George A. Romero took the term and applied it to the walking dead - brainless creatures who existed for nothing other than human flesh; a shuffling army that would stop only if their brain was destroyed, or their head removed from their body. The film was Night of the Living Dead, and although it was ridiculously criticised for its gory content (which was very extreme for its day), changed the face of horror forever, and would influence movies right up to the modern day.The now-familiar story begins with siblings Barbra (Judith O'Dea) and Johnny (Russell Streiner) visiting the grave of their father. With Johnny teasing Barbra about monsters and ghoulies, a man attacks Johnny, causing him to hit his head on a gravestone while Barbra flees to a nearby house. Traumatised by what she has just witnessed, Barbra is joined at the house by Ben (Duane Jones), who quickly starts boarding up the house to halt the encroaching zombies. They watch the news reports on the television about this strange attack, while married couple Harry (Karl Hardman) and Helen (Marilyn Eastman) emerge from the cellar, claiming their daughter has been attacked and is lying unconscious. With the outside fires set by Ben only delaying the zombie onslaught, they must hatch a plan to escape.It was alarming watching this film again after a number of years, after devouring many horror films in the past ten years or so. Living Dead's basic concept and plot devices have been used time and time again throughout the decades, and is a massive testament to the legacy of the film. It plays out like a guidebook on how to make a zombie film - the retreat, the do-good male lead, the annoying guy with a shirt and tie, the make-or-break run for the escape vehicle, the overwhelming final attack - are now so familiar. Yet after seeing this basic plot played out hundreds of times, Night of the Living Dead still seems fresh and ground-breaking, never coming across as clichéd or a tired idea.Of course, most horror films lack the social bite or political commentary of Romero's zombie series. While its 'sequel' Dawn of the Dead (1978) used its shopping mall setting as an attack of America's consumerist obsession, Night uses its informative news reports as a damning indictment of the U.S.A.'s gun-ho attitude and ultra-violent tendencies towards infiltration, possibly a reaction to the country's ridiculous response to the emergence of communism. And although Romero's claims that Duane Jones was cast solely on his audition, rather than the fact that he was black, the now-legendary final scenes prove to be either a massive bit of luck, or a pre-meditated stroke of genius from the writer's as a metaphor for the racial tension that was so prevalent in 1960's America.All that aside, this is simply great horror. Though (in my opinion) Romero's follow-up Dawn of the Dead is a better film, Night of the Living Dead is where it all began. It's grainy, hand-held, black-and- white cinematography not only adds a low-budget dirty quality to the film, but also proves what greatness can be done with an original idea, a lot of heart, and a heap of innovation, regardless of what your budget may be. Obviously, it's not scary anymore, and the gore levels are incredibly tame by today's standards, but the tension and claustrophobic atmosphere is still as effective as I would imagine it was back in 1968. And the final moments of pessimism that the film leaves you with does nothing but ensure the film is engraved into your memory. Romero may have lost in touch with his modern zombie films, but this is a staunch reminder of the horror auteur's genius.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",Night of the Living Dead

73,poe426,Redefined the fright film...,10,14 January 2002,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** It's midnight, and the theater is fairly crowded. People are whispering; shifting uneasily in their seats; waiting. The house lights dim, and the curtains part. Ominous music begins as we open on a black and white shot of a deserted back road. A car appears in the distance, moving along the winding road toward us; passes; turns up a hill and cruises slowly through a cemetery. The car comes to a stop and a bickering brother and sister, who have come to put a wreath on their father's grave, get out. The brother pauses before getting out when he hears the car radio come back on. Ominous music. They go to the grave and place the wreath on it. The brother teases the sister, trying to scare her- and then notices a man, dressed in a black suit, moving toward them. The brother runs off, leaving the sister to fend for herself when the man in the suit suddenly attacks her. At this point, the carefully measured camerawork of the preceding shots gives way to canted low-angle chaos. And so begins director George Romero's creepy classic, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD.Eschewing the staid cliches of the past, Romero and company give us zombies with ""bite""; ghouls fresh from the grave who crave human flesh. Unlike many of its predecessors, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD delivers- in a big way. Crossing lines few fright films of worth have ever dared cross, Romero gives us numbing horror as well as well-drawn characters in tense life-or-death situations. Although ""inspired"" by Richard Matheson's brilliant vampire novel I AM LEGEND (as well as the first feature film based on the book, THE LAST MAN ON EARTH, with mis-cast Vincent Price in the lead), NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD quickly branches off into its own dark terrain, which Romero explores unflinchingly with his stark, documentary style of filmmaking. It was a powerful film when it was first released, and it's a powerful film today. Romero redefined the zombie in fright films, and thereby helped redefine contemporary film (along with Alfred Hitchcock). Not bad for a regional ""fringe"" filmmaker.",Night of the Living Dead
74,johnnyboyz,"Superlative in its direction and the ability it has to work to its premise given the minimal budget; Romero's film is a taut, engaging and groundbreaking slice of cinema.",9,11 December 2010,"I think it's safe to say that Night of the Living Dead now has a certain status which sees it stand alongside other such film canon entries which double up as legendary pictures of the genre. It's a status that sees it nicely slot in with the likes of Hitchcock's Psycho; Carpenter's Halloween and the original Nosferatu as additions to a genre which arrived with a bit of a bang and have seemingly been inspiring film-makers as well as fascinating those that study the subject alike, ever since. Towards the end of Romero's 1968 picture, you can quite literally see both the very fabrics and the core conventions of a sub-genre being born; you quite literally observe the very ideas and traits many films since have been inspired by and taken inspiration from, like the three mentioned examples and a range of others in the genre's canon, the mannerisms and aesthetics which were being explored for the first time appear to have gone on to inspire and influence. Contextualised, the film is beyond ranking or rating; the final thirty or so minutes not only stares into the abyss, it ventures beyond the damn thing and into a whole new realm of both genre reinvention and guerrilla movement film-making.To a modern audience, the film's premise sounds old hat but here explored within this particular field for what appears to be for the first time and here done with wonderful invention and execution. The film will open with a car speeding along an isolated country road to some foreboding music, that sense of them trying to escape or get away from something feeling prominent, before the two of them in Barbra (O'Dea) and her brother Johnny arrive at a graveyard to pay tribute to a deceased family member. The editing is slow, deliberate and shows things such as a car driving for extended periods; Johnny even hears something on the radio which cuts out or judders but dismisses it quickly so we too write it off as nothing specific. The film goes to some lengths to detail Johnny as the sort of person he, with his sister defensive in the background as she gets on with what's to be done, whereas the dialogue is non-specific to any kind of plot. We get the feeling the two of them are quite rich, what with their clothing; new car and fact they've driven so far for something according to some as so minor.It's here Romero pulls the first of a few rugs out from beneath us, an attacker in the cemetery killing the character, in Johnny, we came to learn the most about during these early exchanges, while Barbra escapes via the car to some chaotic editing thus completely upsetting the balance from what came before. The terror and immediacy of the situation is emphasised when she arrives at a local farm house, the emphasis on the anonymity of the character when compared to Johnny doubles up with the ambiguity and mystery surrounding precisely why the attacker did what he did and what the creatures outside approaching desire, as well as where she goes from this point. Barbra is saved before effectively being pushed back to a mere supporting role following the arrival of a young coloured gentleman in Ben (Jones), whose presence then reveals a family of three hiding out in the basement with two others whom are a couple. Here begins a somewhat terrifying hour and a half upon which many have fraught to follow; an historical piece doubling up as a fascinating piece of drama during which we will become involved and engrossed.Ben is perhaps the closest thing we have to a lead, a man of most probably quite humble backgrounds appearing as the sharpest; smartest; most heroic and most logical individual within the premises of the farm house. His ability to adapt to the situation in the manner he does, put across via his reaction to the deceased farm house owner in comparison to that of Barbra's as well as his fortifying of the house proper highlights an extension in power of a previously marginalised minority over that of the richer, more upper-class white individual incarnated within the character of Barbra. The holing up is not without interior incident, father and husband Harry (Hardman) believes the basement is the perfect place for waiting out the strange goings-on whereas Ben believes being on ground level with exits and room to move works better. Romero goes to great length to show the boarding up, nailing up and fortifying of the house; the extended sequence of this as well as the arguing between what is the best course of action essentially a listing of various ""zombie"" sub-genre conventions quite literally being announced and embedded into film form in list fashion.Historically as well as a gripping piece of drama, it is quite stunning. Romero etches out as much tension as is possible, the film dismissive of any kind of formula in one sense because it is composing the formula in front of our very eyes. Its ability to spread focus and attention on each character inside of the house as well as those on the outside trying to react to the situation instills a greater extent of chilling reality come the finale. Romero's film features several sequences of the characters gathered around an in house television during which the fictional anchorman distributes information regarding the creatures therein now effectively serving as the basic pieces of knowledge regarding zombies that audiences have taken to every single film of this ilk ever since. In this regard, as well as many others, the film is amongst one of the best; most terrifying; most immersive and most important ever made.",Night of the Living Dead

78,SAMTHEBESTEST,The guardian of all Zombie Horror Films..,7,16 October 2020,"Night Of The Living Dead (1968) :
Brief Review -The guardian of all Zombie Horror Films. Actually this cannot be called a Zombie film as this Zombie thing was introduced later but this deserves to be named as the Guardian/Ancestor of those films. Moreover this is human horror story and too damn realistic and horrifying to handle unless you enjoy fake make up monsters instead of humanly possible ghouls shown in this film. Night Of The Living Dead is about a group of people who have locked themselves in a house to hide from flesh eating ghouls roaming outside who are causing a mass murder. It is engaging from the beginning because it doesn't give any time to charcters to introduce themselves which was never useful in such a script so in result we see the first monster in the very first 5 mins. There is no stopping after that and we keep seeing lots of them and then we are introduced to other people hiding in that house. Screenplay takes charge from the beginning and doesn't lose it for entire 96 minutes of this narrative. Background score seems outdated now but must have been trendsetter then, I am not quite sure. Cinematography is excellent, i could feel the cameraman's feelings while looking at those close angles, zoomed shots and those 2 mins with end credits are shot outstandingly. All the actors in the film came from unknown and stage background hence they put non dramatic and sober acts. George Romero had a terrific script and design in hands but in spite of having heavy burden of making a groundbreaking horror film, he didn't stotter. He delivered a fine piece of new-style horror filmmaking. Night Of The Living Dead is known as Cult with which i don't agree completely but i agree with the fact that it is certainly a Great Movie and an inspiration to the filmmakers in this genre.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest",Night of the Living Dead
79,matthewssilverhammer,"Not only the originator, but the perfecter",9,14 August 2017,"It's shocking that this was a micro-budget directorial debut, as it really is just top-notch movie-making in every way. The script is great, with penetrating themes, & characters that are so well-drawn. The direction is confident & artistic. The largely improvised dialogue is so full of great quotes (""They're coming to get you, Barbara"" ""Yeah, they're dead. They'reall messed up."")

80,insomniac_rod,The truly first break-through Horror movie. The king of Zombie cinema.,10,5 August 2006,"This is probably the only Horror movie that makes me think ""this movie was way ahead of it's time!"" or ""how brilliant is this script and how it has influenced GENERATIONS of Horror film makers"". This movie is worth the hype. There isn't anything wrong with ""Night Of The Living Dead"". This is Romero's masterpiece for many factors. The whole zombie situation idea is revolutionary. Romero took the basics from the zombie movies from the 30's and 40's and takes the sub-genre into a macabre new dimension. Also, the direction is simply excellent. Romero knew how to shock a still naive audience in the late 60's. He created a creepy movie based on it's dark, scary atmosphere. I'd say that this is the best example (along with The Texas Chainsaw Massacr) of an unsettling movie. Forget about ""Dawn Of The Dead"", ""Day Of The Dead"", ""28 Days Later"", etc. This is the king of the Zombie sub-genre. The sequels were highly influenced by the splatter and gore wave that the Horror experience in the 70's and 80's but it wasn't space enough for scariness or atmosphere. The sequels are all about fashion film making and new techniques of gore and visuals. ""Night Of The Living Dead"" is scary enough in all aspects. Visuals, music, plot... Duane Jones is also somewhat a hero in the genre. He delivers one of the most complete performances in Horror cinema history. His performance is solid and believable even that the situations are extremely fictitious. He's surely on the top 5 performances ever in the genre. I cannot praise this movie enough as it's truly a breakthrough movie in the history of cinema. Even that I'm not a fan of the sub-genre, I give the respect that this movie deserves. The ending is truly great, it's chilling, well directed, and leaves a lot for the imagination. No time for happy situations this time. I wonder if this movie shocked audiences big time as ""The Exorcist"".",Night of the Living Dead
81,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"B horror movie trappings, but a surprisingly effective classic",8,3 November 2009,"George A. Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead"" is not standard horror. In fact, there are several minutes where this classic zombie film is just plain boring. There is brilliance, however, in the film's static nature, like how one of the main characters, Barbra (Judith O'Dea), is in speechless shock for most of the film. And despite the horror fan's craving for gore, suspense and active characters, ""Living Dead"" tantalizes its audience and then stuns it with unexpected turns of events instead of using the typical rise-and-fall horror structure.""Living Dead"" could be described as the king of the B horror movie. Its title, flesh-eating half-humans and cheesy violence keep the movie walking that fine line between horror and comedy. The difference is that the plot contains events that break horror conventions. Look past the use of Bosco chocolate syrup and black and white film in 1968 and you'll notice the film is more about humans vs. humans than it is humans vs. zombies.The story opens with a girl and her brother visiting their father's grave when they're attacked by a zombie. The brother gets knocked out while the girl runs and takes shelter in a nearby vacated home where she's later discovered by Ben (Duane Jones), the take-charge type of horror movie character. They board up the house and light fires to keep the zombies away and soon they discover five other people were hiding in the cellar. Together, all seven of them argue about survival tactics and things get heated between Ben and Mr. Cooper (Karl Hardman).""Living Dead"" ends up being one of those films exposing how human nature rears its ugly head in these kinds of life-or-death situations. Padded by some probably unintentional racial tension between Ben and Cooper, as the arguing continues you are forced to wonder who the real savages are: the ones outside the house or the ones inside it. Culminating in an excellent and largely unpredictable ending sequence as the zombie threat becomes imminent in the house, ""Living Dead"" ends up becoming a surprise to everyone.With sub-par acting, unnecessarily long scenes of the news playing out over the television and nothing that's actually scary, it's amazing how ""Living Dead"" manages to win over its viewers. There are literally just scenes where Ben is boarding up the windows listening to the radio and you wonder if the zombies are just chilling outside playing cards or something. But there's great effectiveness when Ben keeps telling Barbra to stay calm and not be scared and she just won't say anything, much to our dismay. ""Living Dead"" is more psychological than you'd ever expect from something with all these B-movie characteristics.",Night of the Living Dead

83,Anonymous_Maxine,"The one that started it all, etc, etc, etc.",9,2 April 2004,"It was interesting to see Night of the Living Dead turn into such a cult classic, and I think that one of the biggest reasons that that happened was because of its simplicity. You might notice a trend in the horror genre, the less extravagant they are the better, and this is a perfect example of the less extravagant category. Shot in black and white several decades after color became normal in mainstream film, Night of the Living Dead scares through some of the same tactics later used by other classic horror films, notable Halloween, with the slow but relentless Michael Meyers stalking constantly. He's slow, but like the zombies in this movie, he is virtually unstoppable. Granted, the zombies can be killed with a shot to the head or some other way of separating the brain from the rest of the body (pleasant, isn't it!), but their sheer numbers compensates for this weakness. Because we don't see the events that lead up to what is famously referred to as `an epidemic of mass murder being committed by a virtual army of unidentified assassins' (White Zombies fans are sure to prick up their ears at this radio broadcast), it's reasonable to assume that the vast majority of the human population has fallen victim to the walking dead, and the people we see barricading themselves in the house are the few remaining survivors.
One of the strange things about Night of the Living Dead is the way it is structured, or I should say the time that it takes place. A lesser director might have concentrated on the widespread attacking and panic that lead to most people being turned into zombies, but not only would that not have been possible with this movie's famously miniscule budget, but it's not really the point. That timeline would fall flat because it would force the movie to focus on a few select people, who would just happen to be the ones that survived long enough to become characters with names and personalities (well maybe just names, let's not go crazy here, this IS a horror movie). It would kind of kill the suspense.While it may seem that the movie started right on the middle of things and that we've already missed all the good stuff, I think it's important to keep in mind that, given the movie's budget and intentions, George Romero wanted it to be as simple as possible. It has a little bit of a character study, featuring characters in an extreme crisis situation who can do nothing but quarrel amongst themselves like blithering idiots who can't stand to see anyone else in power (as well as a blonde woman who periodically can't even speak). The movie is about a bunch of people thrown into this situation and how they deal with the situation and each other in order to survive the night. It's telling, for example, that throughout the entire trilogy we're never given a real reason for why people were turning into zombies in the first place, because it doesn't matter.From a technical standpoint, the movie is brilliant because of Romero's sheer ability to get so much out of so little. The movie is crudely shot, but I think that actually adds to the effect because it gives it something of a documentary feel, not the polished look of so many modern horror movies whose special effects do nothing more than remind the audience constantly that they are movies. Night of the Living Dead really couldn't afford to look so fake. The acting is terrible throughout, but the important part is that the zombies looked at least halfway like zombies. Consider the abysmal sequel (which was recently remade into one of the best horror modernizations ever created), in which the zombies look like nothing more than masses of extras with cheesy blue make-up all over their faces. In this movie, it's not hard to see that the make-up is crude, but the crudeness of the film stock as well as the shooting itself gets past that. Ironically, it's more effective because you can't really see it so clearly. Night of the Living Dead has become a cult classic because of how daring it was (in such ways as the horribly ironic ending) and how frightening it managed to be despite its miniscule budget. Granted, even this titan of a horror classic has been subdued to the point where it tends to generate more respect than fear (as is the case with most older horror films which are actually well made), but it's position in film history is unmistakable, even today, when it's sequel has been massively improve by a recent remake. It is black and white and seems ancient, but Night of the Living Dead remains a movie for current aspiring horror filmmakers to study and emulate.",Night of the Living Dead
84,southdavid,Graveyard Shift,7,13 April 2021,"In preparation for the upcoming ""Army of The Dead"" from Zack Snyder, we decided that now would be a good time to go back and look at the forerunners in this loose collection of films, sequels and remakes that make up this iconic series. Where else to start but with Romero's influential 1968 original.Whilst on a trip to lay some flowers on their long-departed father's grave, Barbara (Judith O'Dea) and Johnny (Russell Streiner) are attacked in the graveyard by a relentless assailant. Separated, Barbara runs to an isolated farmhouse with her attacker in slow but consistent pursuit. She's saved by Ben (Duane Jones) who tells her that the attacker is not alone, and dozens of people have inexplicably started attacking strangers with little regard for their own wellbeing. He fortifies the house as the number of assailants rises, but unbeknownst to them, they are not the only people taking refuge there.This viewing was an interesting one for me. I've seen this film many times before and can accept some of its low budget issues. I can appreciate the film for its influence, inspiring hundreds of filmmakers from around the world to just take up a camera and make their story. You can draw a straight line from this film to ""The Evil Dead"", ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" even to non-horror stuff like ""Clerks"" and ""Blood Simple"". Though not the first ever Zombie movie, this is one that establishes a lot of principle ideas, most particular the relentless bleakness, they cannot be overcome - you have already lost and it's only a matter of surviving as long as you can.However, my wife has no such built in admiration and it was clear that she didn't enjoy it much. Seeing it though her eyes a little bit, those budgetary constraints show up - particularly in the dialogue, both the rough and ready semi-improvised nature of it and just the simple act of whether or not it was audible. It's quite slow to get started, with a long time spent with Barbara as she tries to get to the house and some of the editing across the version I saw was pretty brutal. The characters, beyond Ben, aren't particularly well distinguished and the performances are generally fairly poor. (They are all amateur actors after all)But, this is my review and my respect for the film and it's place in history trumps the failings that you can pick on. Reverence if not flat out love.",Night of the Living Dead
85,jzappa,Very Progressive Film-making For 1968,8,1 October 2006,"Night of the Living Dead is different in every way from any movie of its kind up until its release in 1968. For example, its cinematography is gritty, blunt, and brassy, with brutal closeups, truly lurid imagery, and inspired use of hand-held camera-work that sends you head on to the edge of your seat. Another example is how its characters are in no way horror film stereotypes. Aside from its hero being a mild-mannered, confident, and dignified black man, which was a bit bold of George Romero in the '60s, especially in making a low-budget independent debut, all of its characters are their own beasts. They are down to earth, with very human flaws and realistic emotional responses to everything.I don't consider this film to be very scary, though. Yes, it has a very creepy atmosphere, great suspense, and two jarringly wicked scenes of violence. It has a perfect setting for a movie about being trapped by surrounding zombies, a crumbling old house amidst a long field and a graveyard in the country. However, despite its ranking as one of the most popular movies of the horror genre, it doesn't afford the luxuries of an ideally scary film, such as being kept up at night, your dreams being affected, its weight on your mind for the next couple of days, having a strange feeling of not wanting to be alone at night, your nerves being on end, etc.Romero, however, delivers a great, infinitely inventive movie. At its core, the plot basically consists of debating on a decision between staying upstairs in a house or going down into the cellar. I mean, come on. What formula could that possibly be following? Its back-story is told in a very very clever fashion, as the hero rapidly goes through the house securing the windows and doors and preparing weapons and building fires whilst we hear the radio in the background with an announcer informing us of the epidemic and what places have been overtaken by mysterious stoic killers and how their victims have risen and begun killing as well, and we as the audience put the pieces together. In this review, I've given just a few reasons why I think this film is so well-written and well-directed. Granted, you will never see any of the actors doing much else, and thankfully so on account of their incredibly campy performances, save for Duane Jones, who plays the hero, Marilyn Eastman, who plays the humble but sneering wife of the egotistical family man who constantly fights Jones, and the earthy, laid-back man who leads the posse. It's a low-budget film, though, but it's very original and spawned many lesser clones.",Night of the Living Dead

In spite of the obvious low budget and the inexperienced actors, this movie pulls through. It is a genuinely scary movie in spite of the grainy quality of the film, the obviously dated quality of the movie, and the many slow spots. It never fails to entertain you; compel you to watch it through to the ending. It has a documentary-like feeling to it which lends an eerie realism to the entire production. This is a strange movie; it looks strange, and feels strange, as we learn through the news casts that radiation was the cause of the dead returning to life. All things are explained, yet there is a sheer totality to this movie which is really very disturbing.I was entertained and completely chilled, which says a great deal. I am a rare horror fan who is not into zombie movies. But this was absolutely one of the very best of the genre of horror, and THE best of the zombie sub-genre. If you liked this movie, you may also enjoy Serpent and the Rainbow. It has the added element of having been based on actual events. It rates a 9.1/10 on the movie scale.It rates a 9.9/10 on the Romero scale.It rates a 6.5/10 on the splatter scale from...the Fiend :.",Night of the Living Dead
88,Captain_Couth,Cinema of George A. Romero: The start of something big! Zombies!!,10,12 June 2004,"Night of the Living Dead (1968) was the one that spawned several sequels (some official others not) and hundreds of knock-offs. The movie takes place in the Pittsburgh countryside. Innocently enough a brother and sister are visiting their father's grave site when they encounter a strange individual. He attacks and kills the brother whilst the sister flees the scene. She stumbles into a country farm house that will later become a house of horrors. Meanwhile a young black man seeks safety inside the house and tries to make it into a refugee from the chaos and death that's follows him. Awesome horror flick. This has to be one of my favorite horror films of all time and the best movie franchise. Often imitated but it's never quite exactly duplicated or replicated. George A. Romero and company came across something big and it changed the face of horror forever! Followed by two darker sequels and an excellent remake. Black and white hasn't felt so creepy since Nosferatu!Highly recommended! One of the essentials.Followed by: Dawn of the Dead Day of the Dead Check out Last Man on Earth, it's the original Night of the Living Dead and it's just as good. But I have to give the nod towards N.O.T.L.D. George A. Romero is the man!",Night of the Living Dead
89,freemantle_uk,Classic Low Budget Horror,10,20 September 2008,"This was the film that put the zombie genre and George A. Romero on the map. It is a classic example of low budget film-making at his finest how great Romero was and is at making films.The film is set in rural Pennsylvania, and in a small house a small group of people are having to survive against the newly raised living dead. In the house is a family, with a sick child, a black man who becomes the leader, a mentally damaged woman and a young couple. As events unfold they find out through the media that the dead had risen and that only way to stop them was to shot them in the brain or cut off their head.It's a basic story but it is layered. The film has a lot of scares in it and the apocalypse story is very exciting. There is a political sub-context to the film, especially in the politics of race, because this was one of the first films to have a black man as the major hero of the film. Other intreputions of the film is the Vietnam war and the Cold War. Romero is a very political director and this was carried on into his other Living Dead films.The story behind the film is also interesting. It costed $10,000, which even in 1968 was a pitent. Romero had to use up very favour available to him to get this film made.The special effects are simply, but easily covered by the black and white film and the acting isn't great, but the people in this film were amateurs, you didn't expert Oscar winning acting. There is also a bitter ending to this film, which I thought was very fitting for this type of film.If you like horror films or zombie films then this is a must see.",Night of the Living Dead
90,Stevieboy666,Seminal zombie classic,8,27 May 2018,"Any self-respecting horror fan should be familiar with the plot for this one - when Barbra and Johnny visit their father's grave he is attacked and killed by a ghoul, while she manages to escape and find refuge in a farmhouse. Inside she finds other survivors but before long they are surrounded by flesh eating reanimated corpses...
Zombie films were nothing new in 1968, they could be traced back at least until the 1930's (White Zombie), and a few had been shot in colour by this time (The Dead One - 1961; Hammer's Plague of the Zombies). But what sets Romero's film apart is that here the dead aren't brought back to life by voodoo but by radiation, therefore giving a modern, scientific explanation to it. And unlike previous zombies these ones devour human flesh. Both these factors were to prove pivotal in the sub-genre and 50 years on countless zombie films have been made (not always a good thing!). Horror critic/historian Kim Newman credits NOTLD as being the first modern horror film and indeed he has a good point, though in my opinion I would give that honour to Hitchcock's masterpiece Psycho. And gore by 1968 was nothing new (the films of HG Lewis, eg Blood Feast).
This was filmed on a low budget and at times it shows. Some of the acting is a little wooden, including a few of the ghouls. But Romero manages to deliver a powerful film in which the tension steadily builds (it is quite heavy on dialogue at times) to it's shocking finale. I'm not including a spoiler but one death in particular is very brutal, especially for it's time. There are obviously political references here too, just as there are in say Dawn of the Dead.
It's a movie that deserves to be viewed several times but be warned - there are many releases out there and they can vary greatly in quality. These include colourised versions, one of which I have just watched. OK, it shows up the gore but otherwise it's pretty pointless. This was filmed in black and white and that's how it's meant to be seen. If you consider yourself a horror/zombie fan but have not yet seen this then you really need to!",Night of the Living Dead
91,dee.reid,The dead will walk...,10,22 September 2004,"""Night of the Living Dead"" was like a shotgun blast to the face of those who thought that this was going to be another pointless ""B""-flick where the hero gets the girl and slaughters hordes of flesh-hungry zombies with a vengeance. Not so, as many found out and like any classic horror film, ""Night of the Living Dead"" has rightfully earned a place in cinema history as a landmark.Released in 1968, post-Kennedy's shattered vision of Camelot, an ambitious filmmaker named George A. Romero grabbed up a camera and started rolling, capturing the actions and horror of a group of people who hold up inside a farmhouse as hordes of the living dead storm the countryside and proceed to lay siege to the terrified occupants inside.There are no heroes in ""Night of the Living Dead,"" only people who make quick decisions and end up either dead or alive to reap the consequences of those decisions. Most characters are either strong and determined (like Duane Jones' character) or are blatantly stupid and reckless (Karl Hardman's character).""Night of the Living Dead"" did of course, virtually define a new genre - the zombie flick. Romero would follow up ""Night"" with two sequels: the adrenalin-laced action epic ""Dawn of the Dead"" in 1978 and the claustrophobic, tension-filled closer ""Day of the Dead"" in 1985. And there were also plenty of knock-offs over the years too.What helped to make ""Night"" so popular was that it was filmed in no particular style, thus giving it a unique and genuine feel; it was almost as if what you were seeing on screen was actually happening. Looking at ""Night"" during the day is surely your best bet, since I certainly wouldn't recommend doing so.Even in 2004, ""Night of the Living Dead"" still shocks its viewers, with the gore, tension, and genuine frights. Tom Savini (George's right-hand special effects man on ""Dawn"" and ""Day"") would later remake ""Night of the Living Dead"" in 1990.10/10",Night of the Living Dead
92,atinder,A really good Zombie movie,8,20 January 2010,"Before I start, I would like to say that I was not Fan of Black and white movies, before watching this movie i did try to watch 13 Ghost and The House on Hauted hill which were both in black and white, i just could not get into those movies.As this movie was in Black and White, it did put me of for while and I could not wait any longer and this was movie that got into watch Black and White movies.Now back to this movie The plot The dead come back to life and eat the living in this low budget, black and white film. Several people barricade themselves inside a rural house in an attempt to survive the night. Outside are hordes of relentless, shambling zombies who can only be killed by a blow to the headThis is great Zombie movies the acting was great and atmosphere was spot on and Zombies were really scary and Creepy for the time this movie came out, it maybe little out dated now but still is creepy. I did laugh at the end, it was funny.The one thing i did not like was the scene with fighting scenes were not well made and i didn't like those sound effects at all in that scene.

93,JoeB131,Excising a childhood demon,8,30 May 2011,"I have to say, this is one of the first movies that ever kept me awake at night.Growing up, we had (the original) Svengoolie and Creature Features on local Chicago TV. ANd usually, they played such harmless fare as the Universal Monster movies and ""I was a teenage (Fill in the blank)"" films.So then Sven decided he was going to play NOTLD! And it was a very different horror film, one that gave me ""Zombie Nightmares"" for years. What made it different is that the heroes didn't prevail at the end. The character of Duane survives to the end of the film, but is accidentally killed by the redneck posse. So the ending was kind of ironic and scary.Hey, let's talk about Duane, shall we? He's the hero of this film, and it was quite a stretch in 1968, the year Dr. King was killed, and NBC was mortified by the notion of William Shatner kissing Nichelle Nichols. Yet here he is, not only being heroic, but talking down, beating and eventually killing the fat, white character.Obviously, this film was made on the cheap, but it was made effectively. I think the problem is, Romero has spent the rest of his career trying to replicate the effectiveness of this film with bigger budgets, better actors and more advanced special effects, and not pulling it off.",Night of the Living Dead
94,GiraffeDoor,"Wonderful atmosphere, lacking plot.",6,27 May 2019,I really want to dig this.I like its distinct and vivid visual style using the shadowy and grainy black and white images to great effect with a wonderful sense of composition too. The zombies mostly just look like detached people and it gains a lot from that.The essence of the movie of is the horror of how regular people treat each other in desperate circumstances but the bickering and power politics feels a bit familiar by current standards and the script though ambitious and intelligent does drag.,Night of the Living Dead

Yes, some of the criticisms are valid, the low budget photography and effects, slow passages during some of the exposition, etc. Overall however, this film has earned its classic status. Particularly powerful, in light of today's Hollywood fixation on the happy ending, NOTLD's ending is extremely powerful in its sense of hopelessness and its black irony.",Night of the Living Dead
96,Foreverisacastironmess123,"""You can be the boss down there, I'm boss up here!""",7,12 February 2019,"Ok so this is this great legendary horror classic that a lot of people consider one of the best ever, and I like it too but I think it's reputation is a little greater than the actual movie, it's a little slow and gets a bit too dull and draggy in the middle for me to personally regard it as great, and it may very well be responsible for the modern zombie movie as we know it and created a lot of the rules behind our beloved shambling flesh eaters, but I just think there are numerous better classic zombie flicks out there, not least of all the sequel to this one, which is my very favourite! What I enjoy the most about this film is the grim atmospherics that come from the low budget rural settings, as well as its keen focus on the characters as their situation hopelessly falls apart and they fail to work together enough to survive the night. I love how effectively the tension slowly grows throughout and how it goes from being unnerving to downright terrifying in the final act. Gore-wise it's pretty tame now, but back then I'm sure the whole experience was quite a bitter pill for the audiences to take, with the utterly hopeless and oppressive world that it presented, where there was no happy ending, no answers given, and where the unsung hero of the story gets unceremoniously shot down and burned away like nothing... it's a very political movie, and the late great George Romero had said that he kind of stumbled into making it that way, but that's a little hard to believe when the mere fact that the main character and leading man being played by an African American in 1968, was political enough, but then you see him punching out a hysterical white woman and taking charge of a chaotic situation after usurping the white male patriarch as it were, is overtly so if you take the decade into consideration, as well as quite a powerful and heartbreaking statement in the closing images of how the poor man ends up, even today... It took courage to end the movie that way, and Romero was right to stand by it and not compromise his grim vision. Duane Jones really carried a lot, if not all of the movie with his performance, which must have been a bit of a burden on him to make a strong impression, but he certainly did it all with grace. Of the various titles they were considering at the time I'm glad they chose the one they did because it's one of the best horror movie titles of all time, it's iconic. There was a kind of dark allure there that made a million teens and their sweeties want to hit it up at the drive in back in the day! Once again there are other zombie pictures I love more, but this solid old milestone that pushed the envelope and made zombies a household name is of course deserving of a little consideration as it deserves its place in horror movie history and remains an engaging and haunting work by a brilliant young director that is always worth revisiting.

97,snoozejonc,Powerfully effective low budget movie,9,13 February 2021,"A farmhouse is besieged by zombies.I can't say I enjoyed Night Of The Living Dead, but I appreciate that it is brilliantly made and the impact it had on future horror movies.The plot is quite simple, a group of people try to survive an onslaught of 'ghouls'. We not only witness the gruesome horror of the reanimated dead, but the awful actions of some of the living in response to it.I've been guilty of overthinking movies in the past but there feels like there is a subtext. You should probably google to find deeper opinions on the matter, but the lead character is an African American and given that the movie was made in the latter part of the sixties, how the character conducts himself in comparison to the white characters it is (for the era) quite provocative. Also what happens at the end is pretty shocking and I'm sure plenty has been read into it, along with what (politically/socially) the zombies and living represent. Personally my take is that it (irrespective of politics or minority/majority groups) gives a pretty pessimistic view of humanity in survival and chaotic situations.What impresses me the most is how on a small budget George A Romero managed to create something truly powerful and plausible considering the subject matter. Roger Ebert famously wrote a review not of the film, but of the audience's horrified reaction, which is not surprising when you consider the era and how realistic the gore seems with the black and white cinematography.Performances seem real due to the improvised dialogue and non-glamourised characterisation, like we are watching a documentary about an actual apocalypse. The news reports shown are particularly effective to create an atmosphere of impending doom.Every zombie movie or television show owes everything to Night Of The Living Dead and, for me, along with Romero's sequel, Dawn Of The Dead, it is the high point of the genre.For me it's is a 8.5/10 but I always round upwards.",Night of the Living Dead
98,drownnnsoda,Excellent Low-Budget Classic.,10,20 September 2006,"George Romero's ""Night Of The Living Dead"" is (in my opinion) among the very best of low-budget horror classics, right up there with Tobe Hooper's ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". This film opens with Barbara and her brother Harry, who drive six hours out into the countryside to visit their mother's grave and an isolated cemetery. While paying their respects, Harry reminds Barbara of a childhood memory, and while trying to scare her, they are approached by a man who is walking very strangely along. The man grabs Barbara, and Harry begins to fight with him, until his head is thrown against a tombstone. Barbara tries to escape in the car, crashes, and begins running through the woods. She finds an old farmhouse in a field and hides out there, and notices an entire clan of these walking-dead. After time other people arrive at the farmhouse, also hiding from the living dead. While hiding in the house, listening to a radio for updates on the mysterious phenomena, the zombies begin to break in - and they have to fight back. It's up to them to save themselves from these flesh eating zombies .The most influential and probably the most bootlegged movie of all time (due to the movie never receiving an official copyright), ""Night Of The Living Dead"" is a classic on every level, and that's saying a lot because I don't really care for zombie movies to begin with. I'll openly admit that too, I'm not really a fan of zombie films - I think they're alright, but they're just not really my thing. But ""Night Of The Living Dead"" is the exception. The film is black and white, and I really enjoy old films like this so I thought it was really neat because it gives it a vintage feel. The acting - eh, it's okay. Not bad, not great - just average really. But it doesn't really matter. The story is the strongest and most unique element of the movie, and the special effects used were phenomenal for the time, especially considering this movie's beyond-low budget. The zombies looked great and the gore effects looked fine, but you have to consider that this film was made in 1968. There are some great scenes in the movie, and the opening scene where Barbara is chased through the desolate forest by the mysterious man was terrifying.All in all, ""Night Of The Living Dead"" is a horror classic. I don't typically like zombie movies, but I loved this. It's packed with a great story, some good gory scenes and chases, and some fairly realistic-looking (and scary) zombies! What more could you ask for? Definitely watch this one, it's one of the great horror classics of all time. I think most of us can confidently say that this is the king of all zombie films. I'd also recommend the eerie 1962 low-budget horror, ""Carnival of Souls"", if you enjoyed this film, because it's just as good, if not a tad bit better. 10/10.",Night of the Living Dead
99,Cristi_Ciopron,"Impressive, masterly--much,much better than its reputation might suggest",9,10 August 2008,"I must say from the beginning that I was quite impressed with Romero's filmmuch more than the things read about it have prepared me to admire. I did not find anything smacking of social critics ,of social protest or leftist propaganda. Its huge success and reputation were fully merited. It has a remarkable touch of originality and freedom. It's one of the very few horrors seen in a while by me that is actually scary. It's not leftist propaganda, but a straightforward horror drama with a SciFi premise. The documentary look is very felicitous. This is a GOOD film, beyond the genre's complicity.In LIVING DEAD at least, Romero was a director who really had something to sayin terms of movies, I mean, not as leftist manifestos. Here's a B movie of the highest rank, with merits at the facevalue. Very good, very impressing, powerfully conceived, scary and uncanny. This impressionistic take it adopts enhances greatly the force of the events described. Romero was a director of conceptionof cinematographic conception.Romero's feature is one of those movies that are in fact much better than you were ever told (others,to name a few, areROPE,THE MAN FROM LARAMIE,Maté's thrillers,etc.). I repeat, if necessary, that it's not a leftist parable, but a horror that succeeds in being a good movie. It does not need the academic rubbish about being a concealed parable, a '60s protest, etc.. Those who say such things need to get a life and start enjoying films for what they are, not for hidden agendas.",Night of the Living Dead

She finds herself with a sensitive but tough African American man (Daune Jones) and a few people (Karl Hardman, Marilyn Eastman, Keith Wayne, Judith Ridley and Kyra Schon) in the house. Then later, they finds themselves trapped in the farmhouse and these strange people are trying to get in the house. The people trapped in the house find out that these strange people are actually the dead coming back to life from a freak accident by a space probe, which is return sent by NASA. This space probe is highly radioactive that wage a relentless attack, killing (and eating) everyone in their path.The premise of this film does sound Hokey but it works, thanks to Co-Writer/Director:George A. Romero (The Crazies, Martin). This is Romero's first film. Romero borrows inspirations from the film-Carnival of Souls (1962) and Richard Matheson's novel-I Am Legend (Which it was previously filmed as The Last Man on Earth and The Omega Man). Romero wrote the script with John A. Russo (The Return of the Living Dead). This is a smart screenplay. The only real fault is the Cast, which it is a mix of professional and amateurish performances. But in someways, that what makes the film realistic. Romero and Russo never let their characters have the easy way out. Night of the Living Dead went on to be a Cult Favorite and went to be a Worldwide Hit.The Best DVD to view ""Night of the Living Dead"" is from Elite Entertainment. Which the DVD contains two audio commentary tracks by the Cast & Filmmakers. DVD is presented in the Original 16mm aspect ratio. DVD has been remastered in THX with Superior Picture and Sound Quality with the original Mono soundtrack with the first time in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD also contains the original script, trailer, film parody titled ""Night of the Living Bread"" and more. Night of the Living Dead ended up remade in 1990 with the original creators:George A. Romero and Producers:Russell Streiner and John A. Russo. The remake is not as affected as the original. But the original 1968 film proves that the Original is always better than the remake. DVD from 20th Century Fox is been colorized and the film looks odd and even foolish in color. DVD has an fine Pan & Scan (1.33:1) transfer and an good digitally remastered:Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound (Also in DTS 5.1 Surround Sound). This DVD is also included in the original Black & White (Which the Elite DVD has an sharper transfer in the Black and White Print). Too Bad, the Black & White Print only has the Dolby 2.0 Mono Sound. Since the Colorized version has the Dolby/DTS Tracks! DVD's oddest feature is the running commentary by the Mystery Science Theater 3000 Fame:Mike Nelson!. Which Nelson comments has some amusing moments and hilarious jokes about the cast in the film. Despite the DVD from Fox, the Elite DVD is worth getting. Only die-hard of the original 1968 film will get the colorized version on DVD. The new DVD from Dimension Extreme has an new stronger Full Screen transfer although the sound reminds Mono for the 40th anniversary edition. It has some of the same special features from the Elite Disc like commentary tracks for example. But the best thing about the new DVD is the 83 minute documentary from the cast & crew talking about... how was like to make this instant real cult classic and an 15 minute featurette with Romero. There's plenty of DVD's of Romero's movie out-there, because it doesn't have no copyright. Romero and the producers would have been richer in their wildest dreams if they put that copyright.

Big budget horror is rarely disturbing; it's too slick, too studied to convey any authentic menace. Even the film's opening library music carries more atmosphere and dread than a dozen horror flicks with studio backing.NIGHT's black and white photography gives it a newsreel enamel and doesn't remind us that we're watching wool being pulled over our eyes. The actors, all solid, are unknowns, so, once again, the horror seems more real, less manufactured.Confining most of the action to an isolated farmhouse outside Pittsburgh adequately sells the wider menace and creates a sense of claustrophobia.

106,Witchfinder-General-666,One of the True Horror Greats,10,11 September 2008,"""Night Of The Living Dead"" is not only a film that all Horror fans must see, it is a must-see to anyone even remotely interested in cinema. George A. Romero's 1968 masterpiece is, without any exaggeration, one of the most important and influential films ever made as it basically recreated the Horror genre and influenced everything to come - and all that with a low budget and actors most of whom had never been in a film before. Literally every Zombie flick ever made after 1968 took its influence from ""Night Of The Living Dead"", and it is debatable that the world of Horror cinema will ever see classics of a comparable influence again. This immensely creepy and genuinely scary stroke of genius is one of the most brilliant masterpieces the great genre of Horror has ever brought forth, and no Horror lover or cineaste in general could possibly afford to miss it.The film delivers everything one could possibly desire in Horror: constant tantalizing suspense, genuine scares and shock moments and an incomparably creepy atmosphere which is intensified by a stunning black and white cinematography. The plot is, as one could guess, about the dead coming back to life. Dead people rise from their graves and walk the earth as living dead, hungry for the flesh and blood of the living. The reasons for their awakening are only vaguely explained, with an undefined radiation. The film ingeniously explores a small group of people who are forced to form an alliance in a small remote farmhouse, desperately trying to prevent the masses of flesh-hungry fiends from getting in. Hardly another film could claim a mood as genuinely creepy and menacing as it is the case in ""Night Of The Living Dead"". The masses of brainless, flesh-eating zombies looking for the living to feed on are doubtlessly one of the creepiest sights a cineaste will ever stumble upon. Arguably THE classic shocker of its time, ""Night Of The Living Dead"" has long become one of THE all-time classics in cinema.Zombies had walked the world of cinema ever since Edward Halperlin's 1932 masterpiece ""White Zombie"", in which Horror icon Bela Lugosi enslaved the dead via Voodoo. It was George A. Romero, however, who established the idea of flesh-eating Zombies with ""Night Of The Living Dead"" - which makes this one of the most innovating films ever brought to screen. The film itself also had its influences - Italian director Ubaldo Ragona had created a masterpiece with an equally apocalyptic atmosphere four years earlier, in 1964, with ""The Last Man On Earth"" (starring Vincent Price!). Another film that influenced this one is Herk Harvey's ""Carnival Of Souls"" of 1962. All three films are masterpieces that no Horror fan could afford to miss, yet it is this one which single-handedly changed the entire Genre forever. The gore is extreme for its time, and it is save to say that people back then must have been shocked about the explicitness of graphic violence. The main shocks, however, are provided by the stunningly creepy atmosphere that will leave audiences breathless even after repeated viewing. I am sure I don't stand alone among my fellow Horror fans when I describe this film both as one of my personal favorites of all-time, and as one of the most innovating, creepiest and greatest masterpieces ever in Horror. I can not praise this film enough, so I will end this review with a recommendation - in case you have not seen this, stop what you're doing and go for it right now! ""Night Of The Living Dead"" is an essential masterpiece of Horror and no fan of cinema can afford to miss it! 10/10",Night of the Living Dead

Night of the Living Dead is a classic horror movie, but on the surface, it is the story of a group of people, all from different backgrounds (race, creed, class) and are put into a situation where they need to work together in order to live. For 1968, having a ""Black"" lead was beyond popular. Romero re-creates the wheel of the film industry as proves everybody wrong.

In 1968, there was no way of knowing that a ""little"" film would open the floodgates for a new era in cinematic fear, oft-refined by the original ringmaster himself, George Romero. But it did, and for fans of the genre, it is a contribution we should all be thankful for.For those who know Romero and his contributions to horror (while ignoring misfired sidesteps like ""Bruiser"" and ""Monkey Shines""), Chilly Billy's line is a contradiction of the anarchic chaos at work in his filmography. The director has often stated that his debut is about ""revolution"" (and it certainly came at the end of a decade known for at least declaring it), but as I age, I find myself wondering just whose revolution is taking place amid all the warring elements (unless, of course, Romero is commenting on a revolutionary mentality, in which many factions adhering to many different ideologies and persuasions knock heads and only worsen preexisting problems). It has become more apparent with each successive film that Romero hedges his bets with both human and zombie, while pledging a moderate loyalty to neither.The ambiguity and cynicism of ""Night"" still leaves a seriously unsettling mark. If anything, Romero set his film apart from the classical style of Universal, the period pieces of Hammer, and the Gothic offerings of Italy's Mario Bava by transgressing mere hints of moralistic commentary and twist-of-fate ironies and transposing them into an instantly recognizable, rural American setting (the countryside of scenic Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania)populated by people not unlike our friends and neighborstherefore blurring the line between cinema as mere gaudy escapism and pushing it closer toward something resembling pure, visceral experience. The perfectly integrated use of stock music only adds to the unfolding documentary reality.The film begins in a deserted world, save for brother-and-sister duo Barbra (Judith O'Dea) and Johnny (Russell Streiner), who have traveled to an isolated graveyard to place a wreath on their father's grave. There is an altercation with a mysterious man, and a terrified Barbra flees to an isolated farmhouse. Soon after, night falls and a faceless horde of zombies descend upon the building, as a small group of survivors take an increasingly desperate stand against the walking undead. Romero (and co-writer John Russo) uses this seemingly simple scenario to catapult fireballs of scientific and sociopolitical subtext through the general survival plot. And the survivors are an interesting bunch, shrewdly undercutting the director's point that a half-dozen humans in an escalating situation will find ways to pick apart, antagonize, and even kill one another, equating themselves (if not more so) with the bloodthirsty carnivores outside the door.My first experience with ""Night"" came late in my childhood, with next to no foreknowledge of what I was in store for. Responding in a manner similar to how I'd later (at 12) react to Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead,"" I found myself shocked, impressed, and generally in awe of what I had just witnessedgranted, I found the dialog scenes of the middle act to be stretched and tedious (and if the film retains a glaring flaw, that's it), but the film overall broke a lot of my perceptions of what was ""acceptable"" to show in a black-and-white film. Accustomed to the goreless, vulgarity-free ""propriety"" of movies-sans-color, I expected a relatively coy experience (which couldn't be farther from what I got), and nothing remotely resembling up-close gore, glimpses of nudity, or a half-dozen curse words. In addition to its commentary and well-crafted suspense, another reason ""Night"" holds up so well is because it truly is a turning point in the streamlining of carnage in mainstream cinema. As much as Romero enjoys pushing our moral and political buttons, his films endure for just giving us a blood-caked good time. With zombies.",Night of the Living Dead
109,questl-18592,The OG Zombie,7,4 November 2020,"This was a fun one to finally check out and cross off the list of shame. Given it's age, I'll keep my review here brief and to the point. The biggest thing here is deciding how to properly weight a movie by cultural significance. It's widely agreed upon that this is ostensibly the progenitor of the zombie movie and that is an incredible, historic and remarkable feat that makes it worth watching, if only for it's cultural significance. The flip side is that this movie came out in '68 so it's not exactly the most cutting edge, the acting isn't particularly nuanced for a lot of people, Barbara is a very annoying damsel character and we don't even get the full zombie visual feast here. That said, it is legitimately tense at times, it's creepy and effectively done and basically the humans are the only weak link here.Absolutely worth watching just for the sake of watching it and it's still a legitimately good movie. If you're able, at least stream it somewhere but I'd say it's worth a rent for the casual film fans and a buy for full on aficionados and addicts.",Night of the Living Dead
110,adamjohns-42575,It still terrified me!,4,15 July 2020,"I can only judge this film by today's standards, but I can see why it was so well received back in the 70's. I'm a big baby when it comes to horror films, so even watching it during the afternoon when the sun is shining I was still a little bit scared.
Ramero managed to keep the tension throughout, even though there wasn't actually a lot of attacks by the Zombies and they have certainly changed over the years. I'm glad we have a rule book for how to survive a Zombie Apocalypse and how to defend against them now, because it seems back then that they were brighter than some living humans?Some of the acting was pretty bad, in fact it was only really the character of Ben that seemed to have any ability at all. I did kind of hope that they would all get eaten actually, except Tom because he was cute.
I also loved the ironic ending, holding out for so long against the undead only to be shot by your rescuers.Not a bad story for undead fans, but essentially not my thing. I had to give up watching The Walking Dead, because it was too real, so I just hope I don't have nightmares tonight. It would have a higher score if I liked the genre, I only watched it to expand my horizons.",Night of the Living Dead
111,a_chinn,"Admittedly dated and corny at times, NOTLD is as hugely influential on modern horror and popular culture",10,17 July 2018,"The granddaddy of modern zombie films and arguably also the progenitor of the modern day horror film. NOTLD's story should be familiar to modern horror audiences, even if you've never seen this film before, as this film's influence on survival horror films cannot be emphasized enough. The recently dead mysteriously rise and come to life to mindlessly feed on the flesh of the living, who then in turn become the undead themselves to create more undead flesh eaters. The film follows a disparate group of survivors who have found shelter in an abandoned farmhouse where they barricade doors and windows, share information/stories about what they think is going on outside, bicker amounts themselves over what to do in the situation, and all of the usual tropes we typically see in horror siege films. Writer/producer/director George A. Romero gets credit with this film for creating the ""rules"" for zombies (i.e. zombies are slow and dumb, anyone who dies will rise to feast on the living, you must destroy the brain to kill a zombie, etc.), in much the same way Bram Stoker made established the rules for modern vampire depiction with Dracula in 1897 or how Curt Siodmak established the rules for werewolves with his script for ""The Wolf Man"" in 1941. Romero's zombie rules are taken for granted at this point, but it's a major achievement that may not be quite appreciated, to have essentially invented a movie monster that has continued to endure for over than 50 years. Romero's zombie rules have been followed by most zombie movies up until ""28 Days Later"" when filmmakers and authors started playing with the rules (much the same way that's been done with vampires and other creatures of the night), but Romero's rules have still been adhered to by everything from Max Brooks' ""Zombie Survival Guide"" to Robert Kirkman's ""The Walking Dead."" Without ""Night of the Living Dead"" we would never have had the many end-of-the-world classics like Lucio Fulci's ""The Beyond,"" Sam Raimi's ""Evil Dead,"" Stuart Gordon's ""Re-Animator,"" Robert Kirkman's ""The Walking Dead,"" Charlie Brooker's pre-Black Mirror TV mini-series ""Dead Set"" or the above mentioned ""28 Days Later,"" not to mention a ton of great zombie fiction from authors like Stephen King, Joe R. Lansdale, and Brian Keene, or some great tongue-in-check zombie films like Grindhouse's ""Planet Terror"" or Simon Pegg's ""Shaun of the Dead,"" or some fun lesser but entertaining zombie films like ""REC,"" ""Dead Snow,"" ""Dead Alive,"" ""Zombieland,"" ""Le Horde,"" ""Shock Waves,"" ""Juan of the Dead,"" ""The Dead,"" ""Night of the Comet,"" ""Demons,"" ""Pontypool,"" ""Return of the Living Dead,"" or the super gory ""Zombie 2"" (Wondering about Zombi 1? Romero's sequel to NOTLD ""Dawn of the Dead"" was released in Italy as ""Zombi"" and this Italian production was marketed as a sequel). Romero also gets credit with ""Night of the Living Dead"" for establishing the horror film siege scenario that's endlessly been used to this very day (everything from ""Assault on Precinct 13"" to ""Aliens"" to ""From Dusk till Dawn"" to ""The Mist"" to ""30 Days of Night"" to ""The Purge""). Sure there were siege films going back as far as ""The Lost Patrol"" or ""Rio Bravo,"" but Romero established the plot, story, and genre elements that remain strong to this dya. The cultural influence of this ""Night of the Living Dead"" cannot be emphasized enough. Looking at the film on it's own, Romero doesn't just tell a zombie siege film story, but also injects a smart political subtext into the film about race relations. Ben, a black man, and Mr. Cooper, a privileged white man, clash throughout the film as to if it's better solidly barricade themselves in the basement or to stay upstairs with the partially barricaded doors and windows to have a potential path for escape if needed. It's notable that Ben has the only gun in the film and Mr. Cooper desperately wants to literally wrench it from Ben's grasp to take control of the situation. For a film in the 1960s, it's quite provocative to cast a black man in in the heroic lead role, telling a group of white people what to do. Romero admitted that he didn't write the character of Ben as a black man, but that after casting the excellent Duane Jones, the story began to take on these elements of race and politics. SPOILER ALTER! At the end of the film, it's undeniable when Ben, the only surviving member of the group, is casually killed by a redneck posse and his corpse thrown on a bonfire, quickly followed by black & white newspaper photographs of the incident, that the audience would think of the recent assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcom X. ""Night of the Living Dead"" also works as a Cold War parable for US involvement in Vietnam. The US has better technology and know how, but were overwhelmed by the sheer numbers and the relentlessness of those who they were fighting. So overall, although the acting is admittedly not the best (except for Jones) and the production values are pretty low, ""Night of the Living Dead"" is a classic that has greatly influenced innumerable books, movies, comics, TV show, and popular culture ever since and in ways than cannot be over stated.",Night of the Living Dead

Oh yeah, we'll also have one of these ""dark theater"" guys create a new score and act in it too. This is one of the worst ideas ever folks. I was not impressed at all with the incorporation of new footage that was shot over 30 years later. It was just silly, the dialogue, the acting, everything. It's just so hammy. On top of this we're supposed to pretend that old Bill Hinzman and young Bill Hinzman look alike. It's thirty freakin' years later! He doesn't look remotely as scary as he did back then. If I didn't know he was Bill Hinzman, I would have no idea. Maybe I could get over the new footage if it wasn't so pointless.

113,Samiam3,Horror forever,8,5 June 2009,"Night of the Living Dead is about as cheaply made as movies get, and as revolutionary. The fact that it is a cleaver metaphor for 1960's America, has been heavily emphasized as part of the brilliance of George Romero's film debut, but the real reason to love this movie, is the revolution it started in the genre. Many horror film's have since followed in Romero's footsteps, but none have ever, and will ever match the uniqueness of Night of The Living Dead.The plot is simple and practical. A handful of people who escape death take refuge in an abandoned house, where they make a stand against a army of zombies, corpses brought back to life because of a recent radiation catastrophe in the country. One of the many brilliant traits of the the film is the way it is shown, in grainy black and white for a more haunting and almost ancient cinematic effect, like the classic horror films with Lugosi and Karloff.Night of the Living Dead is a sensation. Unfortunaly due to all the action and gore laden zombie films which have come out ever since, contemporary viewers might find this one a little boring, but any true fan will love this and should see it regardless of the controversy.",Night of the Living Dead

116,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,The one that started it all....,10,18 May 2013,"Although it is not needed to be said, for any zombie fan, it is anything but obligatory to view this movie because director George A. Romero is the guy who started the whole trend of making zombie films. For the year 1968, this movie had a lot going for it. As for those who may not find that older films have much appeal, this one does. Its story not only carries its own origin but also contains a well thought out written tone and a very addicting plot. Not to mention this film even has gore. Yes, gore.The premise is very basic, a group of random individuals happen to meet up at house to hide from flesh-eating entranced humans, otherwise known as zombies. Bruce Capristo, the head of the makeup department did a great job at making the zombies look like normal people. Yet, the audience and characters alike can tell the difference between themselves and the zombies. Weird as it is, this will be the only movie Capristo would take credit for. After this he did not move on into other movies. It's also surprising to me how after this movie became a hit, that none of the actors really moved forward with their careers either. Because of this, the actors in this movie remain ""no-name"" actors.Which brings me to my next point: characters. In most cases, when a movie has such a basic premise, character development ends up taking a back seat. Why? Because most audiences are more interested in seeing the plot device in action more than they are in the main characters. But what Romero and his screen writing partner, John A. Russo did was balance the screen time between the scenes of confronting zombies and the lead roles discussing how they're going to escape. This keeps the audience from becoming too bored with too much dialog or too much zombies. This holds true because too much of one thing isn't good in general. There needs to be a balance.What remains the most potent about this picture is just how overwhelming this situation is and how quickly hope can be lost if this were to be a reality. Oddly enough, one would think that because zombies move so slowly, it would be easy to evade them. Better think twice about that claim. Even for these undead beings, they are relentless. To think if you had twenty to fifty of them around you,...sounds like its time to curl up in fetal position and go to that happy place every person has in their head. This is what Romero does with his audience, by creating a hopeless tone. It will seem like any direction taken towards escaping won't work and it's done very effectively.But while this is effective, another great aspect to this tone is by instilling a small glimmer of hope every time an opportunity opens. This is what makes this story so gripping. I would feel right to let go and give up, but it wouldn't because you know there has to be a way to win. Also, the musical composer, William Loose did a fair job at the score. It definitely sounds like music and it does contain a reoccurring theme for the film and for the zombies themselves, so it does work.The last area that surprised me was just how gory this late 1960's black and white film was. I mean, how did audiences back then take this film? People must have flipped out so much that it caused mass hysteria. It's obvious in a lot of scenes that the people parts used in the zombie scenes were animal parts but wow. I'm surprised Romero was let back into the film business after that. I actually wasn't expecting much at all but I'm pretty sure Romero had a lot more to put on the screen. I liked how things went with Romero's first film piece. It was evenly paced and kept me wondering what would happen next. How many films are like that nowadays?Film legend George A. Romero has brought a treasure to generations to come, even if many would call it at the time malignant. When in fact, zombies are exactly that in our culture today. Night of the Living Dead is well constructed and boasts gross imagery even for 1968.",Night of the Living Dead
117,Sandcooler,Grainy black and white nightmare,9,19 October 2005,"This thing may have been made is the late 60's,but it hasn't really lost any of its charm. It's something between a drama about people who can't seem to live with each other in a decent matter, and then suddenly hey, flesh-eating corpses. Romero somehow kept the indoor scenes interesting though there isn't really much happening. Just people bickering. Although the ending is kind of a shocker, it was in fact kind of appropriate to indicate the madness. I wasn't too happy about it upon seeing it though. This movie was really influential, but the only zombie movie that could really achieve this level was the follow-up ""Dawn Of The Dead"". All the rest just has that feel that it would never exist without Romero, and that it has its best visual ideas from this one. I could call it a masterpiece.",Night of the Living Dead
118,slayrrr666,A Classic in every sense of the word,9,9 April 2008,"""Night of the Living Dead"" is a somewhat overrated film but is still a classic of the genre.**SPOILERS**Traveling to a cemetery, Barbara, (Judith O'Dea) is savagely attacked, and seeking an escape, she comes across an abandoned farmhouse in the middle of nowhere. After a while, Ben, (Duane Jones) comes to her aid, and together they decide to stay in the house for protection. Later that day, from the basement emerges Harry Cooper, (Karl Hardman) his wife Helen, (Marilyn Eastman) and local kids Tom, (Keith Wayne) and his girlfriend Judy, (Judith Riley) and they decide to formulate battle plans against the threat outside. When it's finally decided that zombies are the ones outside, having arisen from the ground due to a radiation leakage from a returning space rocket, the house is boarded up but they still come after them on numerous occasions. After trying many different ways of getting out, they resort to increasingly dangerous ideas and attempts to get out alive.The Good News: While overrated, this is still one of the better entries in the genre that has a lot going for it. One of the main things is that there's one of the greatest mounting dread style of film ever done. This one here has a fantastic time building up the tension and gradually making it so that the villains here are built up into a credible menacing force. By doing it with one of the simplest of tactics, gradually getting more and more numbers for each attack, since there's nothing more unnerving than being attacked by a greater-growing enemy, and here this exploits that masterfully. In the beginning it's obvious there's only a couple outside amongst the group, but by nightfall there's a whole horde out there and it's done by introducing a couple new ones during each attack, making it obvious that their numbers are growing and it affects them accordingly. Of course, it would all be moot if the attacks weren't good, and here they are really glorious. It's hard to pick a stand-out one, since there's a lot of great ones that should be rewarded, but this one doesn't have a stand-out as they all are. The initial clearing of the house is fun, the journey to the gas pump is thrilling and ends in glorious irony, and the sequence where they break through the barrier into the house and must both repel the attack and replenish the defenses is one of the classic battles in the film among the many, since it manages to both keep the film entertaining and interesting by having a lot of action on-screen all the time as well as keeping the film suspenseful since it shows that there's stronger attacks each time and are trying to keep the intruders out with less-successful measures each time. That is a fantastic ability, and by incorporating it in here, this one keeps the film running along and interesting all the time. The final half of the film is where it's best parts are at, since it features all the defenses breaking down, general pandemonium as everything happens at once and there's a general feeling of excitement and intrigue as to what's going to happen, especially once the zombies finally get into the house. It's also helped along by one of the greatest endings in the entire genre, being both logically, cruelly ironic and just flat-out surprising all rolled into one gigantic barrel, and it's all the better for it. The last big punch here is the outright-classic pacing. The film wastes no time in getting things going and rarely pauses, not wasting time on numerous story threads or subplots. The action is always centered on the group of people trapped in the farmhouse, with only brief glimpses at the outside world achieved through their television set and radio. This is a masterful touch, as it really puts the audience in the house with the characters. The viewer knows nothing more than they do, will only learn what they learn when they learn it and no more. This really heightens the sense of claustrophobia that comes with being trapped. These here are the film's best points.The Bad News: This here had some problems with it that lower it's rating slightly. The biggest flaw here is that the middle portion of the film is that there's nothing in here all that impressive about the film. After the attacks subside and they're safely inside the house, it begins a long series of scenes that are simply everyone yelling at one another for the duration of the time, and it's hard to stay interested in a film when that's all that's happening. The yelling is over the most moronic things as well, which makes it harder to make it through these scenes since we get nothing else in here other than those sorts of scenes, and it gets grating after a while. There's also some qualms about the idiotic decisions made, especially about the daughter. It's known by all the characters that a bite or scratch turns the victim into a creature, yet this one decides that the best place for rehabilitation is inside the house, with no medical treatment for the condition in reach of everyone around them. There's also smaller problems, mostly based around the zombies. A long way has come in the design of the creatures, and these primitive-looking ones could be seen as a down-grade by some. The last one is the black-and-white photography, but its nothing major. These here are the film's few problems.The Final Verdict: Somewhat overrated due to certain areas of the film, but still good enough to be one of the better films out there in the genre. Still quintessential viewing for all horror film or zombie genre fans, while it's hard to think of who won't enjoy this one.Rated R: Violence and Language",Night of the Living Dead

Director George Romero proves how much can be accomplished with a shoe string budget. His take on the re-animated dead person coming back to seek human victims idea is the inspiration for many similar films, but nobody has equaled this movie. He creates a very believable scenario for these average folks struggling for their lives against an ever-increasing army of blood-thirsty ghouls. I love how they move slowly and mindlessly, yet, with only one weakness, prove to be formidable and dangerous.A cast of mostly unknowns, but that is used as a plus; the audience can identify with these everyday people in this situation. The acting is pretty intense and believable; I was particularly impressed by the little girl zombie-fied: she was scarier than Linda Blair in Exorcist. Another strength is how the ""outside world"" information funneling through was so effectively done as parallel to the farm house group's story.

123,dunmore_ego,Night of the Actor's Studio Rejects.,5,20 November 2009,"1968. While Kubrick unveiled 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, while Polanski birthed ROSEMARY'S BABY, while Franklin J. Schaffner unleashed PLANET OF THE APES, George A Romero, a director who couldn't direct, got together with a bunch of actors who couldn't act and lumbered out NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. And the world became a stupider place.Romero was the Sex Pistols of movie-making. He didn't really know any chords (self-admittedly a student, piggybacking off the techniques of his heroes), but he worked with the little talent he had to bludgeon his way into the industry.The budget is non-existent, the story is basic - dead people come to life and attack living people - the music is genuinely chilling, the camera angles creatively discomfitting, the gore is graphic, the film-making sparse, the acting non-existent. The effect: priceless.NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD is arguably the seed that started the moronic zombie movement in film. The zombie concept - the reanimated dead - was not new - on film, it dated back to at least FRANKENSTEIN (1931) and NOSFERATU (1922); in literature, popularized by the world's most famous zombie, Jesus Christ.Romero was the Eddie Van Halen of zombiedom - he didn't invent fingertap, but everyone points to him when they think about it.Called groundbreaking (rightfully) at the time of its release, LIVING DEAD suffers credibility so many years on simply due to one thing - the community theatre performances. A film is only as good as the actors who are trying to suspend our disbelief on the screen. If the actors are not in the moment, neither are we.So don't revile me for comparing this budgetless B-Lister with the A-List movies above. That is the main excuse for bad movies of this ilk - the cry goes up: ""You have to take it in context! You have to compare it to films of its time!"" Well, I just did and, budgetary considerations aside, in 1968 there was still such a thing as Actors. But NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD had none.And don't read too much into the politics of Duane Jones, an African-American, in the lead role. By Romero's own admission, he was simply the best actor in the group (which says very little, believe me). He relates the anecdote of having the film ""in the can"" in the trunk of his car and hearing the news of Martin Luther King's assassination. Suddenly, Duane Jones was a symbol of righteous blackness.As Ben, Duane Jones leads a motley group of ""indicating"" actors boarded up in a farmhouse, to escape zombies on the prowl outside. An allusion to radiation is made as the cause of the zombie epidemic. (Radiation: the universal contaminant! Only one million 1950's sci-fi films use it!) One by one, all Ben's compatriots are killed or eaten by zombies.Final scenes show white doughy guys scouring the countryside indiscriminately killing people who look like they're milling aimlessly. You wouldn't want these guys patrolling your local mall. Neither would you want to look dazed, having just escaped a zombie - doesn't sit with white doughy guy protocol of ""shoot first, don't ask any questions."" Which happens to be George A. Romero's film-making protocol.--Reivew by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).",Night of the Living Dead

On a dark night, the dead come back to life and feast on the flesh of the living. Barbra and her brother, Johnny are attacked, but Barbra makes it to a seemingly abandoned farmhouse to take refuge. Other survivors named Ben, Harry, Helen, Tom, and Judy join her, and try to board up the house to stay safe. There is competition between Ben and Harry over who should be the leader.

I'm presuming you know the story. The living dead come back to life.. something about radiation.. and they come and raise living hell! Plenty of unforgettable moments in this one, most notably Judith O'Dea's performance at the beginning, and Duane Jones in the end.

Made on a shoestring budget, written, filmed and directed by the now legendary George A Romero, this is a must see for all horror fans. As a film, it has only two real flaws, the acting and the dialogue; but then 50 years later bad acting and script are expected in even the higher budget horrors. It also has a brilliant ending, one of the most famous in all horror. A must watch.",Night of the Living Dead
127,mstomaso,"Low budget, creepy and unique - legendary for a reason",9,15 May 2005,"This landmark 1968 horror-shocker is a great example of what can be done with a limited budget, a simple idea, and some dedicated and talented participants. Very nicely shot, mostly well acted, NOTLD grabs your attention from the very beginning to the very end - and what a classic end it is.The story begins with Barbara (Judith O'Dea) and her brother visiting the grave of a friend of their mother, and takes off almost immediately, as they are attacked by a horde of cannibalistic zombies. Narrowly escaping, but losing her emotional balance in the process, Barbara escapes to a house a bit farther down the road where she meets Ben (Duane Jones), the hero of the film. They discover a family with a sick little girl and a young couple in the basement of the house and they all get to work barricading themselves in and preparing weapons and other defenses. The rest of the story concerns the group dynamics between these survivors as the dead close in on their refuge, the story of what is going on in the rest of the USA - revealed through TV reportage and radio broadcasts, and sheer survival. The human side of this film is an interesting and accurate character study concerning what happens to people whose very lives are threatened.The horror of this film is, unlike a lot of its recent descendants, less a matter of blood and gore than a matter of the real active horror of realistically depicted scenes of murder, death and cannibalism. Though the black and white footage involving blood and gore is certainly effective, there may not be quite enough of it for today's average horror fan. The photographic techniques of this film are innovative and powerful - showing just enough of the sheer hideousness of the film's basic concepts to disturb viewers, but not enough to allow them to detach from the film's protagonists.I strongly recommend this film to anybody interested in the art of film making, and to those who enjoy the horror genre, though it is hard to imagine any serious horror fan who hasn't already seen this.",Night of the Living Dead
128,gedikreverdi,One of the ancestors of a whole new sub-genre with an infuriating ending,8,15 August 2021,It's almost everything what you could ask from a zombie flick. Barbara and her brother got attacked at the cemetery in the opening scene. She got to escape and they eat her brother. Ben and Barbara ended up at the same house. He boarded up the windows and scared them away with fire. And another group came from the cellar. Cooper the annoying old man and his wife and another young couple. Cooper's daughter had already been bitten. She eventually killed her parents. And the young couple died in the explosion at the truck when they were by the fuel pump in the garden. The daughter killed her mother and ate his father and the young couple perished gruesomely but that's not enough. Ben was the sole survivor but in the morning the rescue team mistook him with a ghoul and shot him thru the window when he was in the house with a gun. I am not a huge fan of zombie flicks but this one is such a masterpiece and every horror fan should give it a watch.,Night of the Living Dead
129,IonicBreezeMachine,George A. Romero's B-movie classic redefined horror and zombies in one fell swoop,8,17 October 2021,"When siblings Barbra (Judith O'Dea) and Johnny (Russell Streiner) visiting their father's grave are set upon by a viscous disheveled man, Johnny is killed and Barbra is forced to flee for shelter in a nearby farmhouse. Barbra, still shaken from the shock of seeing her brother killed is eventually joined by Ben (Duane Jones) who takes measures to fortify their farmhouse hideaway as more flesh eating ghouls bear down on them.Created by John Russo, George A. Romero, and Russell W. Streiner from their Pittsburgh based production company, The Latent Image, which had specialized in industrial films and TV commercials. A massive commercial success upon release making $12 million domestically against a roughly $100,000 budget the film was subject to much controversy due to its violence and gore with many critics expressing disgust with the film. In the years since its release, the movie has become a respected cultural touchstone admired not just for its contributions to redefining the horror genre and establishing the modern day framework of the ""zombie""(here called ghoul) and the story beats and tropes, but also for its strong direction from George A. Romero, and strong performances particularly from Duane Jones as Ben whose casting is seen as an important benchmark in black leads in film.The movie does a great job at establishing its simple premise and deriving tension not just from the flesh eating hordes, but also from the interactions between the characters. Duane Jones is very good as everyman Ben who carries himself with a no-nonsense drive while also carrying human fallibility with bursts of frustration or anger. Judith O'Dea is a good foil as Barbra with her character very much psychologically broken from bearing witness to the violent carnage and unable to communicate or think clearly. Other characters are present in the movie as well such as Karl Hardman as the stubborn Harry Cooper or Keith Wayne as the well intentioned but overly impulsive Tom and every character has a distinguished trait that brings life and energy to the confined setting of the farmhouse with character often expressed just as much in what's not being said as what is. The movie is a chilling apocalyptic nightmare with its limited confining location and dark aesthetic used to great effect to create chills and desperation.Night of the Living Dead is a classic for a reason. From its strong central performance from Duane Jones, to the tension filled direction by George A. Romero, to even the socio political subtext that can be read into with the film's chilling ending and underlying but never spoken tensions Night of the Living Dead has more than earned its legacy.",Night of the Living Dead
130,gizmomogwai,Genuinely suspenseful and creepy horror classic,8,19 October 2009,"There's not too much story to the 1968 horror film Night of the Living Dead, just a basic idea of having a few characters trying to survive being trapped in a house threatened by flesh-eating zombies. Yet today Night of the Living Dead is considered to be the quintessential zombie movie; it even went into the National Film Registry. Whether it deserves classic status is something I'll ask in this, one of my reviews on horror and Halloween-themed movies and TV episodes this October.While the plot is fairly simple, Night of the Living Dead is good for a genuine old fashioned scare, without relying on overly graphic violence (though there is a lot of violence). It creates an atmosphere of suspense. Radio and TV reports seen in this movie establish a sense of crisis in a large part of the United States. The news that the zombies attacking the living are eating their victims is grotesque; seeing the zombies actually doing this is scary. When the zombies are swarming the house, the suspense is thick. How will Ben survive? Nevertheless, I found myself questioning some things. I've always wondered why zombies attack people- if these were good people before they died, what is it about death and coming back that suddenly makes them evil? Maybe the zombies aren't the people they were in life, they're just mindless living things that by nature need to eat. The movie suggests radiation caused the reanimation of the bodies but doesn't give any conclusive answers as to what the zombies are- basically, leaving its audience to decide for themselves.Feminists have criticized this movie, according to Wikipedia. Indeed, I did notice the character Barbra is helpless, speechless, then hysterical. But the other women are able to debate what to do; one woman guards a young child who has been bitten by the zombies. The women aren't perfect, but neither are the men. Even the hero Ben, in deep trouble, flees to the cellar which he had argued earlier was a death trap- I guess he decided he was wrong. All of these characters die- but why? What was the point to that? Maybe, Wikipedia suggests, it was a reflection of the violence of the Vietnam War, which was still being fought when this movie was made. It's something to ponder anyway.Happy Halloween.",Night of the Living Dead
131,mentalcritic,"Hilarious, atmospheric, and frightening, often all at once...",10,13 November 2000,"When I set out to review the 30th Anniversary Edition of Night Of The Living Dead on DVD, I had no idea of the treat I was in for. My editor advised me to look at the 30th Anniversary edit first, but I went against that and looked at the original 1968 cut first. I am glad that I did, because the 30th Anniversary edit takes all the impact out of the film. Zombies and other such flesh-eating monsters are much more frightening when you cannot completely explain their actions and motives, which makes the writer's attempts to recut the film so that it does further explain them all the more laughable.But I am getting ahead of myself here. It is hard to imagine what the audiences of 1968 were thinking as they sat down to a film that, at a fairly luxurious pace, shows a pair of siblings driving out to a small town cemetery to place a wreath on the grave of a relative. More than three decades later, the brother's haunting line ""they're coming to get you, Barbra"" is often used to introduce menus on DVDs containing one version or another of this work. Ninety percent of this line is in the delivery. It sounds so creepy that it accounts for most of the atmosphere in the film.The zombies themselves often look indiscernable from their living (in the true sense of the word) companions. Whether this was deliberate, or simply an effect of the low budget, I have no idea. By the time the delivery of the aforementioned line and the stock music sinks in, it becomes a moot point. These zombies convince because of the acting rather than the special effects.In a world where multiplex theatre and cookie-cutter garbage from the RIAA supposedly bring in millions of dollars per year, it is easy to miss the message that I got out of Night Of The Living Dead. Indeed, directors of certain other zombie films seem to have missed it. In essence, the zombie is the ultimate expression of mediocrity. They move slower than a Uwe Boll film, they can be easily beat down, but there is just so many of them that they overwhelm through sheer force of numbers. They don't think (although the same can be said for many who are supposedly alive), but they can help undo the best-laid plans. It is a pity modern directors don't seem to get this, but zombies are the ultimate statement about the society based around endlessly buying junk we don't need that is around us.The most striking thing about the film is that it has a vivid and rich atmosphere that many modern horror films lack. In spite of being shot full-frame, the film's visuals look more striking and vivid than many modern films that were shot anamorphically (this means you, Soul Survivors, et al). The scenes in the graveyard particularly benefit from the narrow, constricted, monochrome photography. There was an unofficial web site for a black metal band that proclaimed monochrome to be the only real thing in the world, and this film does a lot to further that argument. The stark look of the scenery and the characters furthers the horrific element. Like in The Evil Dead some twelve years later, George Romero chose his locations very well, giving the film a still-life look in many places.The film's pace never really gets above a crawl, but that helps it in many ways. The slow, tense atmosphere builds to a culmination in the end credits that, through simple still photography, communicate just how mad the world has gone in the past ninety minutes. Unfortunately, the writer of the film attempted to recut it in 1998. Among his many mistakes were the addition of attempted explanations for the sudden plague of zombies. Another was the addition of an unsubtle religious tone. When one experiences the beauty of Romero's original version, one realises the tale works more when it goes into less detail.I gave the original Night Of The Living Dead a ten out of ten. Don't bother with the 30th Anniversary Edition. It is another classic example of why revisionism in film does not work. The original has retained its influence for more than thirty years, and there is a good reason. See it now.",Night of the Living Dead
132,jaredmobarak,Yeah they're dead. They're all messed upNight of the Living Dead,8,25 October 2008,"The seminal zombie flick, Night of the Living Dead, can now be crossed off my list of films I need to see. Here is a tale of the undead that is still copied and paid respect to today, some forty years later. Even writer/director George Romero continues to add installments to the saga with his most recent entries gracing theatres in the past few years. It is interesting to note that this film, the most notorious zombie flick, never uses the ""Z"" word. This might be because the word just wasn't part of our lexicon. Instead we are treated with the slow moving ""ghouls"" leaving ""partially devoured"" victims in their wake. It really is just low-budget terror entertainment more than anything else. I had always heard about its great social commentary, and I guess you can make parallels to the red scare and communism, but in the end it's all really just a film to instill fear in the young and laughs for the unaffected.I jest a little about the laughs as this is not as poorly acted as one might think. Sure there are moments of cringe-worthy deliveries and over-acted moments, but for the most part everyone is restrained enough to allow the themes of survival, heroism, and humanity's penchant for destruction to resonate. From the get-go I will admit to being worried, especially with Judith O'Dea's shrill screams for her brother to stop scaring her""Johnny!!"" I think the amateurish acting helps lend some character to the film, though, being such a cheaply made one, (I mean that cost-wise not production-wise as the film is very well made), especially since Romero shoots most of it in close-up. It's as though he wants us to see firsthand and up close the mostly unsuccessful attempts at naturalism.The sheer simplicity of it all is what really stands tall when the credits finally role. At the center of the tale is this inexplicable outbreak of the recently dead being brought back to life with a hunger for human flesh, thus turning their victims into ghouls too. Scientists believe the destruction is a direct result from a satellite beacon returning from Venus that was shot down as it entered our atmosphere with extremely high levels of radiation  possibly the most obvious comment on the Cold War. Horrors have always been the strongest comment on politics and societal distress because of the inherent fear they bring. Films give us an embodiment of the evils and monsters out there waiting for an opportunity to strike. With Night of the Living Dead, we are being overtaken by radioactively triggered automatons, stumbling into our homes looking for blood. Could this be the mechanical and emotionless face of Communism seamlessly integrating their way into our world? A wave of fear that people who look just like us could in fact be the enemy? Maybe. The ghouls consist of our brothers and sisters and friends, and once they have been turned, they show no remorse or kinship, only a lust to turn you too. Huh, maybe I've changed my mind during the course of writing this review; I guess there is more social commentary than I initially thought.To get back to the surface, though, the story of these three small groups, trying to survive against the onslaught, I enjoyed what Romero did. He gives us the semi-localsTom and Judyboth young and unsure of their place, doing what they can to help, but letting emotions get in the way; the older stubborn Harry Cooper, entrenched in his views that his need for self-worth shields him from the right and smart moves; his wife and ill daughter caught in the middle as they must stick with Cooper no matter if he is wrong; and our outsiders, Barbra and Ben, caught up in the mix and truly the wild cards. Barbra is catatonic for most of the film, but her eccentricities cause immense unease and some of the best tension offered. As for Ben, Duane Jones is the epitome of the manly man hero. His take charge attitude is perfect as he will never back down to Karl Hardman's overly brash Cooper, nor allow the wild Barbra get to him, willing to smack her if needed. Ben is the one with a head on his shoulders, looking for survival no matter the cost, trying to help as many as he can, but unafraid to leave them behind if they don't want to jump onboard.So, when all is said and done, Romero has crafted something here that I'm sure was odd and unique back in 1968. This is the backbone to every zombie story you can think of, it started a trend that doesn't seem to have an end in sight. Utilizing the media as a main character even in his first film, the newscaster becomes a voice of reason. Our implicit trust in the man on TV/radio, the person accessible to everyone and therefore must be the authority on the subject is the real scary aspect of the story. Our heroes do what they are told, not because it's the right thing, but because it is the popular choice. I will say that the ending is superb and in tone with what had been going on. America as a land of cowboys, shoot first and ask questions later  ah, McCarthyism at its finest.",Night of the Living Dead

It's also good to watch a movie made in 1968 with a black man not only as the star, but also a hero.

135,hnt_dnl,Dubious progenitor of the zombie genre!,2,31 October 2015,"NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (1968) is an example of a film where it seems like simply because it was the FIRST of it's kind, it gets undue praise for being a great film and in some circles the best. Here is where I beg to differ! Unlike, say, ""The Maltese Falcon"" (forefather of film noir) or ""Psycho"" (creator of the slasher genre), NOTLD doesn't really stand out or hold up as a film. The aforementioned movies have a style, interesting characterizations, sharp dialogue, and classic lines that make them truly memorable. I'm no film snob, but I also know when a movie is just not good, and NOTLD is just...not...good!Directed by George Romero, NOTLD is obviously made on the cheap, shot in black-and-white, and possessing an all too lifeless, monotone tone throughout. The main female, the (coming to get you) Barbara literally goes mute for most of the film due to the terror of seeing the first zombie, most coincidentally after her nerdy, jerk of a brother teases her as a wannabe-ghost in a graveyard as they are visiting a family member's tombstone. Barbara escapes the attacker (her brother not so lucky) and she finds a nearby farmhouse, where she holes up. THIS is where the cliché elements of the zombie genre had their began! In addition to Barbara, a ragtag group of people join her, the heroic loner Ben, the bickering married couple Harry and Helen and their daughter Karen, and the young tween couple Tom and Judy. This group of strangers must band together to fight the zombie threat. Ben and Harry are at odds as they butt heads as to the best courses of action to survive. The men strategize and plan, while the women just kind of stand there and support them, or say nothing like Barbara! The misogynistic time in which the film takes place is all too apparent, but it's interesting that Romero cast an African-American as the male lead in essentially a film that founded a new genre. Usually, it's stereotypical casting in films like this one and it takes forever for the liberal world to catch up!While Romero should be credited for starting a new genre and taking risks that other directors might not have taken, the movie itself is a very flawed, dull exercise to get through.

136,MrGKB,This is where the long walk began...,10,11 August 2013,"...toward the contemporary zombie mythos of ""The Walking Dead"" and every cannibalistic living dead film in between. I first enjoyed ""NotLD"" on the big screen way back in the antediluvian days of college, pre- videotape/DVD/BluRay collections, pre-Internet, pre-Androids etal., when Romero's unassuming film was burning up the midnight film circuit and burrowing deep into the collective unconsciousness of horror fans and cinemaphiles everywhere. Little did I know at the time just how influential this little homegrown nightmare would prove to be, but there was no denying its raw power to shock and unsettle unsuspecting audiences, and all on a budget just somewhat above rock bottom.Imagine, if you will, several hundred Boomer college kids packed into a darkened auditorium, most of them likely intoxicated on one thing or another, all eager to see this scary movie that so far they'd only read about. They knew that Roger Ebert hated it, which only made it more alluring. They knew it pushed the boundaries of graphic depictions of murder, and that, too, made it all the more the forbidden fruit. And, perhaps most of all, they knew it wasn't a ""Hollywood"" movie, and that made its rising star all the brighter. Imagine now that very first viewing of that rough gem in all its lo-fi glory...Almost a half-century later, even the most forgiving retrospectives will admit to the film's flaws; only the most churlish could deny them. The acting is at times unpolished, and the make-up is simply crude by today's standards (one can only wonder how it might have looked had Tom Savini not been dragooned off to Vietnam). The camera-wrangling is well-informed, though, by Romero's prior commercial experience, eminently bolstered by darkly evocative lighting and editing; the choice to shoot in black-and-white was, of course, a financial one, but turned out to be the serendipitous one as well. I can't even conceive of this film being in color, and have steadfastly refused to ever watch the colorized version. ""NotLD"" remains a classic example of inspired (and inspiring) make-do indie film-making and quite rightfully deserves its many accolades and awards of honor. It's far from perfect--even the script is a let-down at times with its occasionally clunky dialog--but it hits all the right dramatic notes, tapping into a nervous zeitgeist in a way that still works in a post-9/11 world--perhaps even more so than ever.If George A. Romero & Co. hadn't made ""Night of the Living Dead,"" I have no doubt that someone else would have eventually come up with something similar. But he did, and the face of horror and indie cinema in general is all the better for it. Long live the living dead!",Night of the Living Dead
137,one9eighty,"They're coming to get you, Barbara!",10,30 September 2020,"Released in 1968, George A. Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead"" is the grandfather of all modern zombie films. It might not be the first zombie film to grace the silver screen, that's an honour reserved for Victor Halperin's 1932 ""White Zombie"" which starred Bela Lugosi, but Romero's classic is what shaped the zombies films that you know today. It is a classic masterpiece that was well ahead of it's time, it left a lasting impression in film history - and importantly for me, I bloody love it.Brief Plot:
A small group of stranger's board themselves up in a Pennsylvanian farmhouse to escape waves of cadavers that have come back to life from the dead to feast on the flesh of the living.Detailed Plot:
When siblings Barbara and Johnny visit their father's grave in Pennsylvania they are attacked by undead corpses. Barbara manages to escape and takes refuge in what looks like an abandoned farmhouse. Another stranger turns up and does his best to secure the building from the walking dead. They are surprised to find 5 more people taking refuge in the house, who have so far remained hidden and safe in the loft. What little news they can get from TV and radio is grim and does not offer much hope. With fear of the walking dead mounting, and trapped in an confined and isolated location, tempers flare and emotions deteriorate but the rag tag group have to try their best to survive until help comes.My Thoughts:
Wrap-up:
This is one of my all-time favourite films, and one of the films responsible for my love of horror and zombies. It holds a place in my collection (and heart) that I can never envisage it losing. Although NOTLD isn't a complex film by today's standards it offers complexity in different ways; in the interpretation that you take from it, in what you believe to be going on, the dynamics of the characters and their interactions, the isolation, the fear, the confined space. Different people have studied different aspects of it and written all sorts of essays about it. Some people saw this film as a critique of Cold War politics and the potential fallout; some people saw the film as a look a domestic racism in America during the late 1960's; it's been suggested that the film might be a subtle nod to the destruction of humanity caused by the Vietnam War; maybe it's the birth of the nuclear family; pollution on Earth and man's over-use of resources.... It could be seen and read in all sorts of ways and that's part of its strength. It is amusing though, because in truth the film was a case of people wanting to make a horror film on the cheap with a semi-original idea and lots of passion. What started off as a small concept with a small budget, grew into something massive and ground-breaking - something ahead of its time by a long way and something that changed horror and entertainment forever.
I loved NOTLD the first time I saw it, and it is something that I do not get tired of. I watch all the spin-off's, unofficial sequels, homages, and parodies (etc), and none of them ever get close to the original. This film has a great cast bringing great performances. Even the actors who are untrained do a brilliant job, because they believe in what they are doing, and they are having fun. By today's standards the violence and gore are mild. Undoubtedly the best example of how a low budget film can be a success with the right ingredients added to it, this iconic masterpiece is owed so much from other films that followed it too. If it wasn't for this film we might not have film and TV shows like ""28 Days Later"" (2002), ""Shaun of the Dead"" (2004), ""The Walking Dead"" (2010 - ?), ""Cabin in the Woods"" (2011), ""Evil Dead"" (1981), ""The Thing"" (1982), ""Braindead"" (1992), ""Re-Animator"" (1985)... we might not even Michael Jackson's ""Thriller"" (1982) video!! If something has modern zombies that are not controlled by voodoo or magic - we might not have had it without this. Even computer games owe this film credit - ""Call of Duty"" has a zombie mode, ""Left 4 Dead"", ""Red Dead Redemption: Undead Nightmare"", ""Dying Light"", ""State of Decay"", ""Dead Island"", ""Resident Evil""... the list goes on.
Finally, another reason why I love this film... The 'good guys' lose.",Night of the Living Dead
138,CitizenCaine,Romero's Influential Debut Still Retains Its Effects,9,3 June 2004,"Probably one of the most influential horror films ever made, George A. Romero's Night Of The Living Dead still has the power to scare the living daylights out of people. Perhaps more than any other horror film, Night Of The Living Dead capitalizes on the current events of its time, and uses them to good effect. Taking advantage of the anti-war sentiment, civil rights struggle, and cold war paranoia present at the time, Romero paints a portrait of an America as its own worst enemy. Seven people are holed-up in a farm house, trying to fend off a group of cannibalistic zombies. From the opening cemetery scene until the bitterly ironic ending, the film never releases its grip on the audience. One truly hair-raising sequence takes place in the cellar near the end. Filmed in the Pittsburgh area on an extremely low budget, Romero uses primarily amateur actors and acquaintances to film the movie. As a result, the acting is mostly poor and at times feels like a stage rehearsal, especially the house scenes with Judith O'Dea and Duane Jones. Jones is the only actor that comes close to resembling a performance; he's also notable as one of the first black actors, if not the first, to play a lead role in a horror film. The order in which the actors meet their fates also defies convention. Filmed in an era when there was a lot of experimentation with color film, the film is a grainy black & white, adding to its claustrophobic and pseudo-documentary feel. Although we've become desensitized to horror shocks these days, the film is still often thought of as one of the most stomach-churning horror films ever made, bar none. The film was re-edited slightly with a new opening scene for its 30th anniversary, but avoid it at all costs. It significantly lessens the opening scene's suspense from the original with extremely laughable acting.

This landmark of independent film-making is a true jewel that should be the text book for every aspiring filmmaker, as well as a movie that every horror fan must have in their collection.The plot is amazing in simplicity, a couple of siblings visit the grave of their father when suddenly, a man attacks them and kills the older brother. Barbara (played by Judith O'Dea), his sister, runs away looking for help, only to find herself locked in a house as she notices that the killer was just one of the many living dead who are rising from the grave to eat people.It does seem like a simple story, but that is just because the zombies are only the plot device to gather inside the house a diverse group of people, and Romero goes on exploring the human relationships and the nature of good and evil. The movie is like the direct heir of Hitchcock's ""The Birds"", where a similar device is used to gather the characters and explore them.Besides the similitude with ""The Birds"", Romero goes boldly to new levels, trading the Hitchcocknian suspense for visceral horror, giving us the basis for gore in horror movies. The movie is very violent for its time, and sets the tone for the 70s explosion of horror movies.The acting is surprisingly good, considering that the actors had few or none acting experience. Duane Jones as Ben, gives a larger than life performance, and it is amazing the job he does with the role.The ending is still powerful and its social cometary (something that Romero always tries to put in his movies, with mixed results), is still valid today.Overall a classic, Romero would create his masterpiece a few years later with ""Dawn of the Dead"", my only complain is that it seems that he'll never top those achievements again. 9/10",Night of the Living Dead
140,The_Movie_Cat,Is this supposed to be funny?,7,31 January 2000,"In 1987 the Canadian film critic John Kobal conducted a survey amongst 80 other well-regarded critics to find out the critically-accepted `100 greatest movies'. With voting ranging from 22 different countries, only five horror works made the grade. `Das Kabinett Des Dr Caligari', `The Bride of Frankenstein' and `Freaks' all reached positions ahead of this George Romero work, yet it did succeed in pipping `Psycho' to 97th place. Conversely, at date of writing it fails to make the IMDb top 250, a factor which seems to prove that the general public do sometimes know best.Knowing it has such a high critical standing is an intimidating point, making the viewer feel that they must surely be missing something, or that they cannot correctly ""read"" a film if they don't enjoy this one.Certainly, the direction is above standard, but slanted camera angles with no psychological merit (which notably decrease as the film goes on) do not make it ""art"". There are some very well-mounted scenes, and I was amazed to discover a scene where a zombie (or ""Ghoul"" as they're called here) walks impassively forwards while being shotgun-blasted to the form of incidental music that is almost identical to that used in the Terminator movies. Okay, that was a pop culture reference, but many more are there to be found. The influence this film has IS admirable - I estimate that if you saw a hundred movies then ten of them would have shots that unconsciously imitated ones from Night of the Living Dead.Yet while it's influential, it is also INFLUENCED. Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens, the afore-mentioned Psycho and Polanski's Repulsion are all heavily drawn upon to craft this work. And direction is the only field in which this picture can stand up. Characterisation and acting are not strong points. Keith Wayne and Russell Streiner portray the square-jawed, straight-laced ""jocks"" so memorably lampooned by Barry Bostwick as Brad Majors in The Rocky Horror Picture Show. In fact it was this, along with the amount of clumsy exposition and dated melodrama that convinced me that Romero was joking when he made this movie. All it needs is a laughter track to make it a class-A comedy, except it isn't that funny either.Why doesn't the forest or the house catch fire when they throw petrol bombs everywhere? Why does Duane Jones begin the film as a proactive central figure then end it as a slightly-demeaning black stereotype? How is it possible to crash your car into a tree at five miles an hour? How can you kill something that's already dead? Why do some of the flesh-eating zombies visibly hesitate before devouring the contents of a butcher's shop? These are all questions that require answers but none are forthcoming.The ending is remarkable, and memorable, and the film overall is okay, worthy of a six. But the notion of taking what is an old-fashioned, good-time flesh-eating radiated zombie flick and saying it has socio-political undercurrents just doesn't hold water. Sure, the lead is black and that's commendable in the genre, but he still hits women and shows no remorse over murder. The concept of adding a subtext that really isn't there is what causes the overpraise of many a half-baked movie. One of the hundred greatest films ever made? They were joking, weren't they?",Night of the Living Dead
141,harry-76,Horror Film Classic,7,6 July 2000,"It was interesting to view in 2000 for the first time, the George A. Romero 1968 original black and white, ""Night of the Living Dead.""  While not being a horror film fan per se, I was nonetheless impressed with the wide spectrum of quality footage in the production.  It ranged from awkward and mediocre to outstanding and brilliant. These varied bits could appear in a single scene, without warning. Further, the plot's devices could not all be held up to close scrutiny.Responses to this film will no doubt vary as widely, depending on how the proceedings ""grab"" one.  I can see New York Times critic Bosley Crowther's original points, being mostly ""turned off"" by the often amateurish ""ring"" to the presentation. Coming at a time when it did, who could have forseen this becoming a ""landmark, seminal"" production, ""re-defining"" the horror genre, and becoming a revered ""cult classic"" lasting into the 21st century?Yet for ""Night"" to claim these things, it has to really  have something going for it, and it does: some creepy effects, genuine jolts, suspenseful moments, and horror shocks. The leading actor, the late Duane Jones, had some talent, good looks, and a fairly natural way with lines. Since he's on-screen most of the time, it's up to him to provide stabiliy to the proceedings. Although he seems to lack a little acting experience (as does the rest of the cast) what he does do is to provide the ""glue"" to Romero's uneven structure, anchoring it pretty solidly.A genuine plus for the film is an excellent sound track, brilliantly conceived and executed: a superior blend of human, instrumental, and natural sound effects -- wrapped together with a fine score. Much of the editing is likewise on a high level, and the photography, while reportedly grainy in some prints, also has the reputation for high-tech fidelity in remastered versions.The film's conclusion is history-making for the genre in particular and drama in general.  Romero seems to be making more of a significant statement than might meet readily the eye. It's a work which can be deciphered many different ways, and its stark black and white photograhy assist in making this portrait a tabula rasa to which one can bring one's own horrific interpretation.Anyone for a stroll in the cemetary?",Night of the Living Dead
142,SmileysWorld,The king of low budget horror films,8,24 January 2002,"The budget was low.The actors were not the top of the heap,yet Night of the Living Dead is a very effective horror film.It was the film that no doubt set the standard for horror films of today.The whole idea of freshly dead corpses returning from the grave to feed on the living makes my hair stand up,even without the movie.I find myself comparing this film with 1999's The Blair Witch Project.They are similar,not in what they are about,but in how they were made.Both films took very little money to make,used no big name actors,and were very successful and effective in presenting their respective stories.Night does get rather gory and disgusting in places,but overall is worthy of the title of ""classic"".",Night of the Living Dead
143,aesgaard41,One Of The Best Horror Classics,10,31 March 2001,"This is the movie that set the standard for realism in horror movies even if barely anyone follows George Romero's example. It is more a study into human behavior as several strangers are trapped in a farmhouse and have to fend for themselves and depend on each other. Just to throw a wrench into the works, one of the strangers turns out to be a jerk and the local news is only being to inform the public of what they know so these people have to deduce what is happening on their own. There is no real indication as to what is causing all the zombies (living dead) to rise from their graves, nor is the reason needed. The movie has a very good plot, excellant acting and a fantastic atmosphere.",Night of the Living Dead
144,Ben_Cheshire,"Supoib! Romero invents the slash-and-burn horror flick, and the results are exciting! Subtext included.",8,4 June 2004,"Granddaddy of the slash-and-burn style horror flick, it gave birth to Halloween, Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street, Scream and other landmark films in the genre, not to mention zombie flicks like Evil Dead and 28 Days Later. Romero began the no nonsense approach to horror: he uses shadows and shaky camerawork to build psychological suspense, along with the emotional breakdown of the main female character and the isolated, closed-in setting; but unlike suspense thrillers, or in the recent Kill Bill, the suspense is not followed by a cop out, like a sword fight that is over in one blow. There are living dead in this film. At some point, in fact, at many points - they will attack. Their hands will claw through boards at the humans. And they will eat the flesh of their victims. There will be no cop-outs here!A scene towards the end of this involving a child is surely one of the most frightening scenes ever filmed, in my opinion. There also appears to be a sub-text involving white america's fear of black people. The main character is black - but we don't meet him from the beginning. We meet a typical happy-go-lucky white American brother and sister. Romero leads us to believe these two will be the main characters, the main good guys who have to save the world from the living dead. But he throws this on its head after ten minutes, when the man is killed, and the woman spends the rest of the film in shock, incapable of protecting herself or others from the advancing dead. She flees the scene where a strange creature killed her brother, and comes across a farm, where she meets a black man. She suspects, and we are supposed to suspect, that he is one of the dead - ie, an enemy - but he is not, significantly. He becomes the hero of the film, taking charge, making plans and getting everyone else in order, when they can't really cope themselves. The chilling ending of the film is where the main comment from the subtext comes, but i can't say any more about it, because i don't want to spoil it for you.",Night of the Living Dead
145,RanchoTuVu,"1968-Bobby Kennedy, Martin Luther King, and Night of the Living Dead",9,16 December 2010,"Most everyone who posts about this film has seen it before, probably on numerous occasions. Maybe it isn't quite as scary now as it was on its release in 1968 when it caught everyone by surprise. The commercials for it at that time looked pretty intense, so anyone who did go see it on its original theatrical release got pretty much what they deserved. At the time there was simply nothing to compare with it. It's relentlessness never let up for even one moment. Even now, watching it and knowing everything that's coming, those first fifteen minutes as Barbra escapes into the farmhouse are some of the most effective horror minutes ever made.",Night of the Living Dead
146,tonypeacock-1,Stick with the film. Reflect on it.,7,15 June 2019,"I watched the first few minutes of the film and thought I was watching some grainy, student film! It is very low budget and bereft of the modern colour, CGI and big budget backing of films released today.However I stuck with the film and it had a terrifying storyline. A group of people barricaded in a farmhouse whilst the population of zombies increases exponentially outside.Throughout a black character, Ben (Duane Jones) seems to be the only sane character amongst the group in the house. Being calm, organising the others for survival. Bravo. Some of the other characters display what shall I say, wooden acting abilities.The film obviously made a positive impact because there have been remakes and the George A. Romero directed zombie films have spawned a 'franchise' over thirty years or so. It is a film that grows on you. Indeed I have waited two days before scribing any thoughts.I watched an original black and white print although I read of some colorized versions? The film was made in 1968 at the height of racial tensions in the U.S. that is why I mentioned the Ben character. The film does have a racial undertone between Ben and Harry in the house.The ending is one of those not to be revealed cinematic moments and only adds to the film and pushes up the rating. A film that began for the first twenty minutes or so with a 3 becomes a 4 by the end. I highly recommend.",Night of the Living Dead
147,Son_of_Mansfield,The Bloody Beginning of Romero's Zombie Saga.,10,19 March 2006,"There had been other movies about the dead walking, and there have been legions since, but there has always been something special about Night of the Living Dead. The black and white photography help the makeup effects and the sparse sound effects and music, restrained by the non-existent budget, add to a general sense of emptiness and dread while the lack of star power gives the movie an odd documentary feel. Also, The little moments work: Barbara seeing the dead woman at the top of the stairs with her face eaten off, the sight of zombies surrounding the house, the stories of how everyone got there, the little girl killing and eating her mother, and the final shot of a white hunter killing the sole survivor, a black man. All chilling sequences that add to the whole, but what makes this horror movie great is the social dynamics that are explored. The destruction of the group from within, the boundaries the can't be escaped even in the most dire of situations. The flaw, if any, is that Duane Jones' character is the central character. It is his story that we should have been following from the beginning. But squabbling aside, this is still an excellent horror movie that is the best film in Romero's saga and still packs a powerful punch after nearly four decades.",Night of the Living Dead

I don't watch the Walking Dead, and as of this writing I haven't seen any of George A Romero's other zombie flicks. But Night of the Living Dead very much impressed me. A simple premise somehow able to terrify us. Barbara Blair (Judith O'Dea), and her brother Johnny Blair (Russell Streiner) are visiting their father's grave when they are attacked by a strange man (S William Heinzman). Johnny is killed but Barbara makes her way to an abandoned farm house. There she meets Ben (Duane Jones) and later the two of them meet Harry Cooper (Karl Hardman), his wife Helen Cooper (Marilyn Eastman), and a young couple Tom (Keith Wayne) and Judy (Judith Ridley). As the people are revealed to be zombies and the terror continues, it puts the people in the house in a worse and worse state. In particular Ben and Cooper have been put on opposite sides of leadership. The film is scary not only for the creepy zombie effects, but for the realistic animosity inside the house, perfectly showing one of humanity's greatest flaws. The way that we see the rivalry between Ben and Cooper play out throughout the film, is very reminiscent of William Golding's Lord of the Flies. Even though it's cheap looking, they don't show it as a monster movie, they show it as a real disaster.",Night of the Living Dead

150,virek213,Romero Awakens The Dead,8,15 October 2010,"It is very rare nowadays in Hollywood that $112,000 will cover anything more than the cost of catering on most movies. And yet that was all it took for George Romero and a number of friends of his in Pittsburgh to make what is without a doubt one of the most significant horror films of all times, the 1968 shocker NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. Detested by a lot of critics in its day for several scenes of unsettling gruesomeness (though Herschell Gordon Lewis' gore films earlier in the 1960s beat him to the punch for true stomach-turning horror), the film is now understandably highly prized of its relentless, logical approach, and for being so utterly uncompromising.Not much more needs to be said about the plot: it merely involves seven people who have barricaded themselves inside a rural Pennsylvania home after having been attacked by flesh-eating ghouls who have returned to life from the dead as the result of an exploded Venus probe bringing back a dangerous and unknown form of radiation. What Romero and his co-scenarist John Russo (who took partial inspiration for this film from Richard Matheson's classic 1954 end-of-the-world vampire novel ""I Am Legend"") show, however, is the strain built up by the way the characters, especially the ones portrayed by Duane Jones and the film's co-producer Karl Hardman, react to the horror that engulfs them...whether to stay on the ground floor, or to hide in the cellar, and how best to escape even as more and more of the undead surround the place. As it turns out, of course, there is no real way out, and there is no actual good end to the whole horrible situation.Romero, who would continue his travail through the world of the undead through several sequels over the ensuing four decades, shot this film in black-and-white largely on location just outside of Pittsburgh over several weekends in the second half of 1967. NIGHT has, in many ways, the feel of a 1950s ""invasion"" film (think INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS), but its setting of an isolated house under siege clearly has its roots in Alfred Hitchcock's 1963 classic THE BIRDS; and the scenes of the ghouls munching on human flesh, though brief in nature, were then, and in many ways still are, shockingly contemporary. The cast of primarily amateur actors does well at being totally naturalistic, and the low budget look of the film gives it a documentary feel that hadn't been seen in horror films before, but which would be revisited in THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE and THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT.Even after four decades of parody, imitation, and sequels, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD is still not for those with weak constitutions, and for those who have seen far more graphic shockers, it will likely seem painfully old-fashioned. But for true horror connoisseurs, it is up there with the very best, and is an essential film of its kind and its era.",Night of the Living Dead
151,gigan-92,A Definitive Film of the Horror Genre,10,4 January 2012,"A+ This film is a legend and masterpiece of cinema, especially to the horror genre. It was the 60s, the production had been dead not even a decade, and films like ""Psycho"" were just lying the groundwork for a new breed of horror. In 1968, here came George Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead"", and boy does it please.Firstly, of course, the gore is a real treat. It may be the first of its kind, but it doesn't hold back in the least. The make-up effects are very impressive and the combination of low-key lighting and the use of black-and-white cinematography create an aura of hopelessness for the film. The constant newscasts give it a very real feel to it all, almost equivalent to a documentary of sorts. And the character storyline is really quite awesome, creating splendid amounts of tension when the zombies aren't even on-screen. Duane Jones was a perfect, as well as tragic protagonist, and I really want to thank all the actor and actresses within the film. Most were at the time stage actors, and with genuine talent they helped excel this movie into film legend. One main reason in itself to adore this movie, and why I think it's an unbeatable classic, is that it represents a time when young film makers could gather together and make a suspense filled masterpiece without the limitations of large distributors trying to hinder the process to their liking. The movie builds terror thru dialogue and without sacrificing atmosphere, its greatest feat.

The movie tells the story of a group of people who try their best to hide from a bunch of bloodthirsty zombies in an adandoned farmhouse. I really do like how Romero directs this movie but the casting is decent with a few over the top performances but otherwise it is still a well done horror movie. At the time this movie was released the zombies looked so realistic not only because of the makeup, it was also because the movie was shot in black and white instead of color. The movie should have gotten Oscar for the makeup for the zombies, and as well as the terrifying music score. When i saw the zombies feed on human flesh in the film thank god I didn't feel like puking because all that stuff was fake but inside we feel disgusted.

It was close to midnight as I felt sleepy and decided to go to bed despite the noise and chatter of my crowded house. My Parents threw a party with friends and relatives all about. My room was the furthest away despite the noise. I jumped into bed and clicked on my small Black and white TV. As the screen appeared I see a reporter wearing horn rimmed glasses in a noisy newsroom with teletype machines ringing in the background as he describes the escalating carnage of ghoulish deceased beings ravaging the cities and town of the United States. I thought it was the local news reporting this outrageous unbelievable story. I was so gullible and naive at the tender age of 12. I yelled out that the Dead have come to life put on the Television for all to see. My obnoxious Uncle Bernie says very funny oh I saw that zombie Picture last year. Then posted on the screen on top the words in white read,""A DRAMATIZATION!"" I was so embarrassed. Any way I continued watching the movie by my lonesome. The basement scenes are forever edge in my memory as you see the impossible odds stacked against the living few in the boarded up farm house in nowhere, Pennsylvania. The clock ticks ever so slowly as the dead count grows and our players are wondering if help will ever come .Duane Jones gives an outstanding performance as the protagonist. The glue that holds the group together in this terrifying situation. Harry Cooper (Karl Hardman) the antagonist who insist that everyone should stay in the cellar for cover against Ben's (Duane Jones)objections to be more aggressive against these Zombies. Barbra (Judith O'Dea) was in a catatonic state throughout this film jabbering about her brother Johnny hoping he's still alive despite getting his head crushed against a tombstone. What also shocked me the most wasn't the gore so much or the violent death scenes. The Coopers sickly girl with a trowel in her grasp taking the life of her Mother was unforgettable. The appearance of Wrestling Announcer Chilly Billy Cardille. Cardille a Pittsburgh celebrity in his own right who hosted the ever popular Chiller Theater. His appearance was sort a comfort, familiar face. My eyes opened, as I thought to myself ,""there's a familiar, friendly face."" Hired by Vince McMahon Sr. President of the World Wide Wrestling federation as the voice of Wrestling in the Northeast corridor of the United States. The matches were shown on the UHF Spanish channel in New York. In the early 1970's Bill was fired. Bill was replaced, nepotism by a goofy kid with cleft chin,southern accent,bulging eyes, saddle shoes and wearing a red blazer Vince McMahon Jr. Cardille was certainly a relief in this movie despite the blood,gore and ravenous ghouls fighting to get a piece of the living flesh throughout the long night in countryside.The Ghouls ripping away the boards from the vulnerable edifice. To cut the tension in those gross scenes, writer George Romero gives us at times a rest-bud, a relief as News reporter Bill Cardille gives the Sheriff a badly needed cup of Joe. Sheer genius on the part of George Romero as his film effort was on time and way under budget. George claimed he could make a better Zombie Apocalypse movie than a professional studio.

Nine months later when Halloween was on the horizon in 1999, I shopped at my local Wal-Mart where they had been selling the VHS/DVD horror movies and I just happened to see this film standing in the shelves and I decided to purchase it. Take my word when I say that it'll make you have dreams.The film starts out in a cemetery where a brother and his sister go out to place flowers on their dead relative's tomb before seeing a strange man walking in their direction who happens to attack both the siblings as the brother gets his head knocked on a tombstone. The sole survivor goes to a local house to hide out where other people are involved in hiding from the strange beings.""Night of the Living Dead"" is a scary flick, and I don't doubt that at the time when people saw this film in the early days they had nightmares.

What I do like about it is it kind of explains the zombie situation better than most movies through radio and television clips. It was basically NASA's fault in a way. A mismatched group holes themselves up in a house and a lot of the movie was the conflict between characters on how best to survive. One of the characters was infuriating.

160,nickenchuggets,Romero's genius on full display,10,28 April 2021,"As countless others have already stated, I think everyone can agree that this film is nothing short of a masterpiece. The black and white camerawork adds a mysterious and foreboding atmosphere to a movie already filled with chilling imagery. The reason why it is simply one of the best horror movies ever made is because it's like the Beatles of zombie movies. It changed everything about the genre and influenced everything that happened after it. Virtually every zombie film coming out nowadays can trace its origin back to this one. Romero was a revolutionary figure in the genre and pioneered the use of zombies as we know them today. Before this film, zombie movies were few and far between, and the zombies in them bore little resemblance to what comes to mind when people think of one now. If you want to understand how truly inspirational and influential this movie is, all you have to do is look at any zombie film released since this one, and see how many have zombies that look like walking corpses, eat human flesh, can only be killed by destroying their brain and cremating the body, transmit the zombie virus by biting humans, and prefer to swarm their foes in a large group. The movie definitely does its job when it comes to holding the audience's attention for the entire duration. Romero knew just what scenes to film and what order to put them in so that it can captivate and amaze the viewer. It takes the zombies in the film a while until they are able to show up at the farmhouse in a large horde, and so the viewer will have to keep watching to know what happens to the survivors in the face of these overwhelming odds. As the undead congregate all over the surrounding area of the house, the audience begins to understand that what the zombies lack in intellect or fighting prowess, they make up for in sheer numbers, and that's what makes them scary. Towards the end, it really does feel like a hopeless situation as the cadavers begin to overrun and spill into the house itself, but there's no way I can do it justice. You'll have to see it for yourself in order to experience the eerily silent approach of hundreds of the flesh eating monsters. This is a rare instance of a movie that never loses its haunting power and scares every time I watch it (for me anyway), and throughout the whole thing there wasn't one single moment where I lost interest. Each scene feels urgent rather than the characters talking just for their enjoyment. Overall, Night of the Living Dead is a must watch for any self-respecting horror aficionado, and without Romero, zombies as we know them might not even exist today.",Night of the Living Dead
161,chaswe-28402,Interesting narrative,7,24 September 2016,"Doesn't quite hold the attention at all times. Patchy acting. The plot may not be totally original for 1968, but, in spite of its flaws, it's highly memorable. The essential story is that the group of defenders is not finally defeated by the ghoulish menace that surrounds it, but by its own internal inability to unite and work together to counter the threat. There is also an underlying suggestion that this dissension is caused by the fact that the hero of the situation, and the only one with any authority and sense of decisive purpose, is undermined because he is black. He's also by far the best actor, and carries the film. The suggestion is that oppression, of whatever nature, can only be defeated by resolute and united opposition. There is also the suggestion that this sense of oppression is generated by ghosts; in other words that it's a paranoid illusion.The women, except for the totally traumatised Barbara, are attractive but utterly hopeless, and amateurish actors. Barbara has one good line in the very effective and creepily atmospheric early part of the film, when she says to her doomed brother: ""You just complain in order to hear yourself talk"". The eventual climax can be seen coming a long way off. But it's still powerful, and devastating. This is another example of how a thoughtful, seriously low-budget picture can resonate and outscore and outlast a multitude of blockbusters. Thought-provoking.",Night of the Living Dead
162,acedj,A masterpiece,9,13 January 2020,"This is the film that gave birth to the zombie films we love so much today. While visiting a grave sight, Barbara and her brother are attacked by a zombie. Barbara manages to escape and finds safety in an old farm house. Soon other survivors find their way there and battle the hoard of the undead. This movie was made for around $50, but what it lacks in special effects, it makes up for in heart and suspense.

163,ethanbresnett,Quite rightly hailed as a classic!,8,26 August 2021,"Although a little dated in some ways, the Night of the Living Dead holds up very well over 50 years after it's release.One of the reasons behind this is that it balances it's human drama and zombie/ghoul action very well. The human characters feel authentic, have good dialogue and have some genuinely interesting and engaging interactions (something lacking from plenty of zombie films).The zombies are very well done. The effects are not as graphic and grotesque as the likes of the Walking Dead as expected, but they are creepy and sinister in their own way.We are given a very solid plot too. The action commences almost immediately, and we are drip fed exposition and explanations throughout the film which was a great decision in terms of the pacing.What really gives this film its charm and its enduring ability is the direction from Romero. Right from the get go there is a sense of unease and dread injected into the very fibre of the film. The whole thing is full of tension and suspense.From the camera work to the score to the setting, everything just fits together to make Night of the Living Dead a terrific piece of cinema.",Night of the Living Dead
164,domino1003,"They're All Coming To Get Us, Barbara",10,23 September 2005,"""Night of The Living Dead"" was the first horror film that I had seen. I remember it well: I was an 8 year old and my mother took me and my siblings to the drive in. I don't remember what the second film was, but I remember seeing this movie. I also remember getting so scared that I didn't sleep well for almost a month.Years later, I still creep out when watching this film (Although I had seen worse over the years). The first scare is always the best, they say.A fallen satellite that leaked radiation causes the dead to come to live and wreck havoc on everyone. However, the core of the film centers on an isolated farmhouse in which a group of people (included a young girl that was bitten by a creature)are trying desperately to survive the attack. Barbara (Judith O'Dea)is practically catatonic, having watched one of the creatures kill her brother;Ben (Duane Jones)seems to be the one in charge and with a level head, despite the constant antagonism against Harry (Karl Hardman), who is insistent on staying in the cellar rather than staying upstairs; Tom and Judy (Keith Wayne and Judith Ridley)are the typical young couple in love and Helen (Marilyn Eastman), Harry's wife, is more concerned about her daughter Karen (Kyra Schon), than her jerk of a husband.Never mind about this little character drama. Let's talk about the zombies.There's nothing creepier than watching zombies. Their only goal is to EAT. They're not picky (You see one eating a bug). And they are insistent. They want the occupants of the house for a midnight snack, and nothing will stop them (Except fire and a blow to the brain).George Romero's cult classic film still hold up to this day (Forget about the remake of this film). The ending will bum you out (To this day, I just can't watch the ending). However, if you're a newbie and have avoided this film, then you gotta watch it.",Night of the Living Dead

Coming so late to it, it's clear how it has cast its shadow over so much I've seen before this. I was deeply struck - in the context of 2019's political situation - how radical it must have been to have had a black character take positive control of the situation, to become the most level-headed and able person in the crisis.

167,Gafke,"""They're coming to get you, Barbra...""",10,22 March 2004,"This is it. The original, the classic, the indisputable King of the Zombie movies. The year was 1968. Not many people knew what film gore was, nor had they ever seen an African American man play a hero in a horror film. Night of the Living Dead was so far ahead of its time that it continues to blow people away to this day.The moody black-and-white film begins with a creepy score and a brother and sister, driving to an out-of-the-way cemetery to place flowers on a grave. Barbra, the sister, is not at all comfortable about being in a cemetery, and her dorky brother Johnny knows this. When he sees a tall, vacant looking man stumbling through the headstones, he teases his sister that the man is ""coming to get her"" in what is now a piece of classic film dialogue. What Johnny does NOT know is that the man is indeed coming to get her...but he gets Johnny first. From the moment Johnny's head is bashed in, all innocence in the world ends. Barbra must now run for her life, stumbling barefoot through a once-pastoral and now sinister countryside. The ghoul follows her to an abandoned farmhouse, where the rest of the cast soon assembles.Ben, our hero, quickly takes the lead. He is level-headed and calm, despite the horror that awaits outside. Whilst Barbra sinks into a near catatonic state on the living room couch, Ben boards up the windows and gathers the weapons, never giving in to the panic that we know he must feel on some level. Ben is a true hero, a humanitarian and a gentleman. He is also the only black character in an all white cast. This must have been unthinkable in 1968, as Ben takes charge of the small group of survivors and is quick to punch a white loudmouth jerk right in the face when the man becomes unreasonable. The rest of the cast includes the loudmouth's pretty wife, their daughter who has been bitten by a zombie and is slowly dying, and a young couple who are clearly very much in love. Oh yeah, and the hundred or so zombies milling around outside the house, eating bugs and attempting to break into the house and get their hands on the living within. This film has aged very well and its gore scenes remain quite shocking, considering the time it was made. The camera never flinches; we are shown stark, clinical footage of zombies eating human flesh and ripping at intestines as though it were a game of tug-o-war. In the films most harrowing scene, we even get to see a little zombie girl commit matricide with a garden trowel. Through it all, the camera simply stares at the atrocities with a detached eye. It is truly chilling.The final scene of this film is utterly devastating. I was literally in shock the first time I saw it, my mouth hanging open at the horrible injustice of it all. There is, needless to say, no happy ending. But this film is so innovative, forever changing the genre, that it has to be seen if only once. George Romero's film is absolutely flawless, simply because it is so rough, so low budget, and yet so grittily realistic and shockingly different. This film is pure horror. You won't soon get it out of your head. It has the power to disturb for a very long time.",Night of the Living Dead
168,skybrick736,Night of the Living Dead,9,24 August 2014,"There has been zombies movies prior to Night of the Living Dead but none of them jump started the zombie genre like George A. Romero's first zombie mega-classic. The movie starts out very somber and dark which sets the mood for the entire film. One of horror's most quoted and iconic lines ""They're coming to get you Barbara"" still is chilling knowing the details that soon follow. I admire Romero's balls by casting a black male, Duane Jones, as the hero and voice of reason. The arguing and bickering between the characters really illustrates the lack of hope people may face in life threatening situations. There is so many great scenes in the movie but the one that still gives me chills to this day is the mothers scream during the stabbing mania by her own daughter. As an old movie it definitely holds up today and for me has replay value since I watch it here and there.",Night of the Living Dead
169,malkane316,Quick Reviews!!,10,7 February 2005,"The beginning of all modern horror films, and along with Psycho the most influential horror movie ever. Although it draws on many of the early monster movies of the 30's, with a seemingly unstoppable beast tracking down prey, and enhancing the atmosphere of those films for the new wave audience. However, aside from that NNOTLD is a breed apart from anything else at the time. Tonnes of gore, shocks the cinema goer had never experienced, unexpected twists and turns, downbeat, scary, with unusual protagonists and new ways of story telling, the world didn't know what had hit them.It was the late sixties. Veitnam was proving that America was not all-powerful, and asking questions about who were the good guys, about motivation, about the human race as a whole. Anti-war protesters were being beaten and gassed for what they believed, while America was attempting to destroy another place...for what they believed. Hippies were spreading a message of love, new ideas were flourishing in all areas, from making peace to making war, and technology was becoming more important and influential. The result was that the good guys were often over-looked, good deeds were mostly forgotten, and many lives were thrown away aimlessly and without purpose. Those who survived wondered why, and had no clue why they were here. It seemed outside, bigger forces were at play, and that unseen beings were controlling the public. NOTLD was released.A brother and sister are travelling to their parents' graves in the countryside, a trip that has become an annoyance rather than a mark of respect. Johnny, the man taunts his sister Barbara like he used to as a kid, scaring her, saying the infamous line 'they're coming to get you Barbara'. A man walks towards them and suddenly attacks without warning. Johnny is killed and Barbara flees to a nearby farmhouse. She enters a near comatose state. Another man arrives, Ben and begins to board up the doors and windows, telling Barbara that he too was attacked by a number of people, and witnessed a town coming under siege. The attackers seem to have no regard for their own safety, and feel no pain. Soon people who had been hiding in the basement appear, and together the group try to figure out what to do. The TV says the attackers can be killed by a heavy blow to the head, and seem to be scared of fire. It seems that, inexplicably the dead are coming back to life and eating the flesh of the living, who in turn become zombies. The group argue over the best solution, tensions arise, and all the while, the number of zombies outside grows, waiting.The film has great depth and terrific acting from amateurs. No-one is safe from harm here, and it seems that the group's downfall is because they are human and cannot work as a group because personal interest and opinion always interferes. The zombies do not argue, they will happily wait for their chance and strike with stunning force, as a unit. If you take down one, there are 10 more closing in. The group could have escaped earlier, by running past the few zombies, and it seems the house becomes their coffin. If they had not fought amongst themselves they may have had a chance. But even then, where would they have gone? Ben as the main character is seen as revolutionary because he was black, but this was not in the script. Romero has since become a champion of the disenfranchised- women, children, other races. His performance is strong. Judith o' Dea as Barbara does not have much to do, but is good, and the other stand out is Karl Hardman as Cooper. He has a wife and injured daughter and feels Ben is endangering them with his schemes. Tom and Judy are a local farm couple, innocents who try to think clearly and are punished for it. Indeed it seems that when a good plan comes around, it is stopped in its tracks with devastating results. Though human error is the major mistake in a darkly ironic twist.Although it was filmed in BW, the gore is there. People are eaten and burned, flesh is chewed on the full screen, bullets are driven through chests. The shocks are genuinely shocking, and the film's atmosphere is claustrophobic and we sense the dwindling of hope. The overall tone of the film is stark, and it seems the future only holds violence. The film struggled to find distributors, and was shown in matinées to unsuspecting youngsters-we can only imagine their reactions. Truly a horror classic, and one of the most nightmarish films ever made, with a view of the world as a terrible place filled with pain and stupidity. We cannot overcome creatures which cannot think. Death is shown as a creeping inevitability, and the good guys almost always lose. 10 out 0f 10.",Night of the Living Dead
170,Didier-Becu,NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (DIDIER BECU),7,6 April 2004,George A. Romero will probably be one of the greatest horrorcineasts ever and the debut of him is stunning and groundbreaking and a real example to show that you can scare your audience with a real low budget. The movie is a sort of mother from all other zombiemovies to come as this type of movie would be repeated over and over (also by Romero himself). Filmed in black and white (quite unusual for a movie shot in 1968) we follow a brother and sister who must seek some forgotten grave. What starts as a joke soon turns out in a nightmare as the dead are awake and yes they kill... Purists will have tons of pleasure to rate this as a masterpiece of B-movie as this is indeed a so called wrong movie but what a suspense and how brilliant it has been acted in. A real classic that is often repeated but rarely made as good.,Night of the Living Dead

The ending was expected but not in the way it way.It didn't have bloody scenes which we expect from every zombie movie. It instead depicted scenes of murder, death and cannibalism. The black and white footage involving blood and gore made the movie more effective.I would recommend this film to anybody interested in the art of film making and to those who enjoy the horror genre.

Sure, it's techniques are a little rough, the story is dumb, and the acting will not win any Oscars but for sheer ""jump out of your seat"" appeal, it's got it all. This film has been reviewed so many times that there probably is not a lot more to say about it. I first saw it at a Midnight Movie in 1970 and couldn't believe what I was seeing. It was particularly gory for the time.There are great lines that have become part of the cult vocabulary...........""They're coming to get you Barbara"".....""What's happening""............""Where's Johnny"". The ending is totally unexpected and the scene where the truck blows up and the ghouls attack to eat what is left will certainly trigger your gag reflex.

175,jcbutthead86,One of the Greatest Horror films of all time. A Landmark Classic.,10,7 September 2012,"George A. Romero's Night of the Living Dead is one of the greatest horror films of all time that along with Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho gave birth to the modern Horror film. Made on a shoe string budget(114,000$),NOTLD is one of the most terrifying and scariest horror films ever made and set the standard for other zombie films that followed. It's not only one of my favorite horror films it's one of my favorite films period.Night Of the Living Dead tells the story of sister and brother Barbara(Judith O'Dea)and Johnny(Russell Streineryard) who arrive at a grave yard to visit their father's grave. While there, Barbara is attacked by a man and when Johnny tries to save Barbara Johnny is killed by the attacker.It turns out the attacker isn't a human,but a zombie back from the dead. Scared and frightened, Barbara runs off,but stops and runs into a farmhouse where other people including a man named Ben(Duane Jones) have occupied the house. Now, Ben,Barbara,and the other survivors must find a way to fend off the zombies and survive the Night of the Living Dead.Night of the Living Dead is not only a great horror film,but, a great film that came out at the right place at the right time in 1968. Violence was in the air and NOTLD portrays that well on the screen with a bleak outlook. In 1968 the Vietnam war was happening and was splitting America apart,racial violence and tensions were at an all-time high,and Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy were both assassinated. NOTLD while a horror film was also statement about what was going on at the time in America,showing us the viewers that America was at war with no only the rest of the world,but themselves as well. One of the other things I love about NOTLD is the bleakness and hopelessness of the film where you feel that no character in the film is safe no matter what whether your a hero or villain. It doesn't matter who you are or where you are a zombie will come and kill you and eat you and it's a disturbing concept. The shy's away from film clichés and offers no salvation or safety or hope. I also love the fact that the film was shot in black and white and shot almost like a documentary adding to the film's dark and gritty tone. The scary documentary feel of the film gives you the feeling of realism where it feels like your in the film with the characters and going through what they're going through and you can relate to the characters and their bad situation. The characters aren't Horror film stereotypes,but real people that are not one note and when things start to go hell you feel bad for them. This film was at the forefront of cynical 70s Horror cinema or cinema in general that was getting away from film where characters lived happily ever after. This was a very revolutionary at the time and still is. NOTLD paved the way for low budget Horror cinema in the 70s and 80s otherwise without this film there would be no landmark Horror classics such as Halloween,The Evil Dead,The Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Re-Animator just to name a few and also influenced and inspired filmmakers such as John Carpenter(The Thing,Halloween),Wes Craven(A Nightmare On Elm Street,The Last House On The Left),Sam Raimi(The Evil Dead)and Tobe Hooper(The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,Poltergeist)and will continue to influence and inspire filmmakers for years and generations to come. The violence and gore in the film is disturbing and for it's time was something wasn't seen before The film and pretty along with Psycho reinvented violence in Horror film. George A. Romero would push the gore and violence even further with Dawn Of The Dead and Day Of The Dead. NOTLD is also great because of how it portrays zombies. You will be looking over your shoulder. Before NOTLD zombies in horror films were more associated with mostly voodoo and the supernatural,but in this film the zombies are regular people people that are your family members,friends or neighbors. There's nothing scarier than the people you love becoming zombies and wanting to eat you and kill you. I also loved the fact that George Romero cast an African-American in the role as the hero in the film was a bold move to do and whether the casting was intentional or not. The ending of the NOTLD is amazing and one of the most shocking and powerful endings in film history and it's a finale that adds to the greatness of NOTLD and is an ending that will stay with you after you watch the film. A brilliant conclusion. The acting and cast are great here. Duane Jones is excellent as the hero Ben one of the few African-American hero's in a horror film. Jones brings a dignity and take charge attitude to the role and it's a great performance. Judith O'Dea does a wonderful job as Barbara bringing a believable performance to the role. Karl Hardman is great as the villain Harry Cooper a character that we don't always like,but does have a couple of points about living and being safe. Marylin Eastman does a fine job as Helen Cooper,Harry's wife. Keith Wayne and Judith Ridley do good jobs as Tom and Judy the young couple. George Kosana(Sheriff McClelland),Bill 'Chilly Billy' Cardile(Field Reporter)and S. William Hinzman(Zombie In Graveyard)give good performances as well.George A. Romero's direction is excellent bringing a frightening and stark reality to the film with the tilted camera angles and black and white photography. Romero's direction gives the film an almost documentary feel to it and a gritty realism. Great job by Romero.In final word,If you love Horror films,Cult films,or films in general I highly suggest you see Night Of The Living Dead,a landmark Horror classic that will stand the test of time is a film that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",Night of the Living Dead
176,evening1,Nihilistic view of humanity,6,4 September 2019,"Ben (Duane Jones) is the kind of guy you'd like to have around when all hell breaks out and you are very, very afraid.When an epidemic of cannibalistic murder erupts, Ben doesn't waste time panicking or wringing his hands. He gets busy boarding up the windows and doors, and voices full faith that he and his barricaded peers will escape or be rescued.Director George Romero effectively conjures a gothic tone in this black-and-white classic by setting his story in the Pennsylvania hills, complete with a thunderstorm, cemetery, desolate farmhouse, and offhand attitude toward religion.Post-modern horror touches arise with the population's cluelessness about the cause of the siege (i.e., there is speculation that the dead have been reactivated by radiation) and a lack of closure that exists with the demise of the story's hero. An atmosphere of moral disintegration reigns, as desperate people take desperate action they'd view as immoral under normal conditions.This movie employed an unknown cast and the acting often seems wooden, but that adds to the somewhat campy tone. Judith O'Dea is fair as shell-shocked Barbra, whose brother is the first human we observe to fall to the ghouls. I liked the performance of a dysfunctional family holed up in the cellar of the farmstead (i.e., shades of ""Psycho"" arise in the little girl's eerie reanimation).However, the highest kudos go to Jones, who deftly juggles the challenges of unexpected leadership in his role. I was sorry to read on Wikipedia that this gifted actor died of a heart attack at age 51.",Night of the Living Dead
177,GeorgeRoots,It Won't Stay Dead!,9,17 July 2014,"One of the first independent films ever-made. As soon as they finished cutting it in Pittsburgh, they chucked the movie in the back of a truck and drove up to New York to sell it. Also recently released in 2013 was a documentary about it I've been meaning to watch. There's such a wonderful history behind this movie. It was the first to feature ""intense scenes of gore"", inspirations arose from Director George A. Romero's love of the industry's ""thirst of bizarre"" at the time, as well as Richard Matheson's classic novel ""I AM LEGEND"". The house contained no running water so people would clean off in the lake nearby, and what started as a horror comedy the small film crew matured ideas as they went along. Soon wrapping up production, and alas the rest is history and the beginning of a cult phenomena.One of the first movies to break many society taboos, by casting a coloured man as a main character and hero no less. Five people are stuck in a house, where surrounding corpses have suddenly risen from the dead and began eating the living. Whilst little news can be heard from the outside world, the bodies are edging ever closer to the inside of the house and some of those still alive are not as mentally strong as others. Can these people set aside each others shortcomings, or will weakness be the downfall for all of them? It's a fantastic character study for the era, and in the final stages it just proves everyone is holding out for themselves. Everyone is diverse enough to challenge your perception of who was right, and ultimately who was wrong.From the opening credits with its eerie music and sirens already piercing your heart, the visual scenario is a normal day like any other. Obviously now thanks to the likes of Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining"" (1980), and Michael Haneke's ""Funny Games"" (1997) etc. Your average car driving down the open road scene could not be anymore sinister. To top it off in 10 minutes this idyllic countryside scenario descends into a hell so unique for its time, it has been debated whether or not the MPAA film rating system loomed large in the public eye soon after because of it. It redefined the word ""Zombie"", and no wonder it continues to remain an icon of pop culture. George shoots with no restrictions, and the foreboding atmosphere and stringed instrumentals build high tension that echo that of the classic universal monster features. All of which culminates in an ending still shocking and highly controversial.Final Verdict: An absolute classic that will continue to age extraordinarily. 9/10.",Night of the Living Dead

The radiation from a fallen satellite has caused the recently deceased to rise from the grave and seek the living to use as food. Several people barricade themselves inside a rural house in an attempt to survive the night. Outside are loads of zombies who can only be killed by a blow to the head. Anyone who dies during the crisis of causes unrelated to brain trauma will return as a flesh-eating zombie, including anyone who has been bitten by a zombie. The only way to destroy the zombies is to destroy the brain. A young woman visiting her father's grave takes refuge in the nearby farmhouse, where she is met by a man who protects her and barricades them inside.

179,Eternality,It's not about zombies. It's about us.,9,19 August 2010,"In the late 1960s, a 28-year old filmmaker with a small budget released a film that would alter the course of horror cinema. His name was George A. Romero, and his film was Night of the Living Dead. Perhaps the first zombie picture to enter mainstream consciousness, Romero's feature debut would become one of the most important horror films, influencing filmmakers worldwide from Lucio Falci (Zombie, 1979) to Danny Boyle (28 Days Later, 2002) to Jaume Balaguero and Paco Plaza (Rec, 2007). Such was its importance that the National Film Preservation Board (USA) decided to enter it into its registry.Night of the Living Dead has a simple premise – a group of people struggle to hide from bloodthirsty zombies in an isolated farmhouse. Except that these people are a group of misfits, strangers to each other. There is a resourceful and rational black man, a white woman in shock, a simple-minded man with his overly concerned lover, and a selfish family man (Mr. Cooper) with a wife and a wounded daughter. Conflicts occur mainly as a result of Mr. Cooper's comic stubbornness and refusal to listen to the black man, giving the film not only an additional ""villain"", but also a source of light-hearted relief in a dark film.For a horror film, Night of the Living Dead is substantially creepy, with the level of tension escalating as time passes. Romero's zombies are slow-walkers, afraid of fire, but never stop until they get what they want – to attack, kill, and devour live human beings. For a black-and-white film shot more than four decades ago, Night's portrayal of gore is surprisingly realistic; scenes of zombies eating an assortment of human remains e.g. limbs and organs, still retain their ability to shock in this day and age when extreme violence seems like the norm.Presented like a documentary of sorts, Romero's film is a startling and powerful commentary of the psychology of the American conscience in the 1960s. Themes include the fear of the mob, the white man's fear of the black man, the (emotional) weakness of women, and the fear of Armageddon are expressed through the characters whose actions and words are heavy with meaning. Romero also portrays the authorities (on television, no less) as distant folks who are unclear of the situation on the ground, and who think that relaying the magic phrase ""we are doing our best as fast as possible"" would allay the fears of a concerned citizenry.While the world has made great strides in dealing with racism, organized crime, gender inequality, and at the same time promoting diplomacy, Night of the Living Dead is still strangely relevant today as when it was first released. Perhaps our fears transcend time, rooted in memory and experience. In addition, Romero's film is also a strong rallying call for us to unite together to solve issues regardless of differences, petty or not.

181,tcchelsey,THE HORROR THAT KEEPS ON GIVING!,10,27 October 2021,"Never once was the word ZOMBIE ever mentioned in NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, and yet this cult of cult classics is largely regarded as ""THE"" inspiration for the zombie genre, if not culture. Producer George Romero, in the footsteps of Ed Wood, scraped up a little over $100,000 dollars (equal to about $800,000 today) to fund the film. And if you want to know the hard truth, Wood actually raised MORE money than Romero back in the day! NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD may actually have had its beginnings in Vincent Price's THE LAST MAN ON EARTH, made in 1964 and in Italy. The storyline is strikingly similar, with Price battling homicidal zombies, and almost as graphic. Another reported source was INVISIBLE INVADERS (1959) featuring a large cast of walking zombies. In all fairness though, producer Herschell Gordon Lewis remains the grand daddy of gore, with a series of gruesome BLOOD FEAST opuses he churned out in the mid 1960s. The difference is that Lewis' films were hard core, straight in your face blood spatter, while Romero put some thought into the assembly, if at least a psychological slant. Romero did his homework, and one scary Halloween film he did produce, though quite unaware it would become legend. Co-star Judith O'Dea commented that she auditioned for the role in a horror film (to get an acting credit on her resume), believing it would be filmed and forgotten. Case in point, such juvenile props in the form of Bosco chocolate syrup for blood and roasted chicken (from a local market owned by a cast member) for human flesh and bone! OY! O'Dea added that there was practically no script, just direction and/or suggestion, so lines were added off the top and in the moment of each scene. Shear genius or not, Romero took a chance and rolled the dice. Another interesting footnote is that the eerie music score was partly lifted from a 1950s cult drive classic, TEENAGERS FROM OUTER SPACE (1959), and this subsequently inspired an LP album after the film's debut. Talk about a Royal Flush. The film made millions and remains popular on dvd to this very day. Compared to the cycle of contemporary horror films, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD has aged gracefully, but it still packs a ""sentimental"" jolt every now and then and must be commended for its ultimate dare in the first place. Filmed on location outside Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, which even brought wide acclaim to a small town cemetary where it all began. For horror buffs, completists and/or just about anyone else who can enjoy the psycho analytical ride into the post hypnotic twilight zone. The opening drive up the lonely mountain road into zombie oblivion remains addictive. A Friday night Halloween weekender and mindbender!",Night of the Living Dead
182,Jacques98,Pretentious and boring to the modern viewer.,1,1 September 2008,"Even for its time, minus the fact it brought zombies to mass media, I really see nothing special about this movie or anything that sets it apart from all the other typical 60's horror movies.If you take away the zombies and put birds in their place, this movie could have been The Birds. If you took out the zombies and birds and replaced it with a psycho, it could have easily been Psycho. And so on . . .That is my main complaint. Yes, this movie brought zombies to the mainstream, and I am insanely thankful for it in that right. I think for that alone it deserves to be remembered for centuries past its time. Besides that, however, nothing about this movie stands on its own two legs. Everything from the sets to the characters to the situation to the camera style was borrowed. Nothing, and I mean NOTHING, about this movie can be called even remotely original, even for its time.From a modern view, this movie is pathetic. None of the intensity of zombie video games like Dead Rising or the scares of Resident Evil. None of the coolness of more modern zombie movies like 28 Weeks Later or other newer Romero films.In its time, I'm sure I would have given it at least a 9/10 because it would be the first time I'd have seen zombies on screen. But zombies existed long before the big screen. Now, decades later, I have a hard time figuring out why I even watched it.0/10",Night of the Living Dead

From the creepy placidity of the opening credits to the eerie freeze-frame ending in which the hero is burned next to (did I see right?) the first victim, Johnny, and the first 'Living Dead' we see, this movie has it all. Everybody and their sexual fetish know that in horror, it's better to suggest than to show, and NOTLD builds and builds and builds on this, with moments that take the action to another different place, I am talking about the scenes in which the survivors are watching the news; it creeps you out even more, because, as said in one of the two other movies of the trilogy, 'It's everywhere.' The characters may seem stereotypical, but at a closer look, they develop, particularly Barbara in her last minutes, where she dives into danger to save Helen, if only for a few seconds, and then meeting an untimely, sad and shocking end (off-screen) at the hands of her own brother.Anyway, to anyone who boos this movie, I say, watch it once, and tell me if you don't feel like you ARE in it.",Night of the Living Dead
184,geminiredblue,The Best Horror Film Ever Made!!!,10,14 June 2011,"The 60s was a prime time for innovations in horror/thrillers. Right at the beginning, Hitchcock released PSYCHO. A few years later, he'd do it again with THE BIRDS. In 1966/67, CARNIVAL OF SOULS was released and proved that a low-budget horror film could be successful. In 68, Roman Polanski released ROSEMARY'S BABY. In between, there were countless others that pushed the envelope and shaped what would become the modern horror/thriller. But NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD is the definitive one. Eschewing the need for stars, big-budget special effects, and color footage (not by choice, but due to budget constraints), Romero and his team set out to tell the most terrifying tale ever imagined. By now everyone knows the story, so here's the overview: Seven survivors wind up trapped inside a farmhouse as ravenous, undead hordes gather outside and attack them. In terms of on-screen violence, this movie was quite shocking for its time. We get blood dripping down walls, zombies eating body parts, half-rotting corpses, and excellent zombie make-up. The acting is good from all cast members. It's easy to identify and sympathize, but the filmmakers never make any one character out as a true villain or hero. Also, the terror doesn't always come from the zombies. In fact, Romero seems to take delight in showing us man's inhumanity to man, as one-by-one the survivors struggle against, argue with, and ultimately doom themselves. On the television and radio reports, they get assurance that help is on the way, but help might arrive too late. And ultimately, the supposed heroes/vigilantes are no better than the zombies. Taken from a socially relevant standpoint, the movie works at showing the fear, biases, and turmoils that plagued many Americans during the 60s. Vietnam was in full horrific swing, various movements and revolutions were occurring, crazed gunmen killed people from towers, and at times America was divided against itself. NOTLD works at showing all of that ugliness. Fear saturates every second of this film, and it works because true horror occurs where the tragic and terrifying meet. While nowhere near as graphic as films that would follow (including Romero's own sequels) none has quite the impact as this low-budget black & white film. Which is why, in my opinion, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD is the best horror film ever made!!!",Night of the Living Dead
185,thenolanfan,Review - Night of the Living Dead,6,22 February 2020,"For me, this movie doesn't earn is reputation. I'm not a fan of ""zombie movies"" because often those movies put the emotions away and concentrate on violence. This movie is not violent, it create an atmosphere, but the story is not personal, you could have put any actor in any role, it will still be the same movie. I don't feel like acting performances were made to create a character because all the writing is bland with no substances.On the other hand, the ending is really good an unexpected, but still that wasn't enough for me.Also, as many claims, this wasn't the first zombie movies of modern cinema. In fact, most expert agree that the true beginning to this type of movie was ""White Zombies"" with Bela Lugosi.In conclusion, this movie is particularly interesting for the history of filming nor for any artistic attribute, I don't highly recommend it.",Night of the Living Dead
186,revival05,Here comes the guy who don't worship this movie...,8,22 April 2000,"I've been waiting a bit too much for NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. All the time, I've wondered and thought how it would be, what was going to happen. No real expectations, but I still was a bit over-excited when I started the movie.
The opening scene was great! I was just waiting for a zombie to pop up, but it came in one hell of another way! The rest of the movie is, I'm afraid, decent. It's not a horror-masterpiece. Sure, it's an important film to the genre, and it's also very cult concidering Romero's popular sequels DAWN OF THE DEAD and DAY OF THE DEAD. My rating would be a lot higher if it wasn't for the script. The dialogues are toasted. The acting is ok, and almost every character is disturbing. The only thing George counts on as entertainment, is zombies. But since the zombies looks more like ordernal people (and moves like one), it doesn't get much more than a decent film. And the ending is maybe one of the most stupid endings in a movie ever.

187,TheCorniestLemur,"And thus, the BRAAAAAIIIIIIINS began",9,31 May 2021,"I think George A. Romero's brain was about 20-30 years in the future when he made this.I mean think about it: pretty gory for the time, black protagonist, in one location, which is all the rage with indie films for the last few decades, maybe even some political commentary in this dumb black and white 60's horror film, and of course, it pioneered a particular genre of people not being total dumbasses in horror films.Oh, and zombies too, I guess.And when I say people not being total dumbasses, I make an exception for Barbara, who I can only assume Romero realised he made a terrible mistake casting when they shot the first few scenes, and then just made her catatonic as soon as she no longer served the plot.But it's a very small complaint, especially when this film has aged nearly perfectly, and, if you watch it with the knowledge that it's thanks to this that we ever got films like 28 Days Later, Shaun Of The Dead, games like Left 4 Dead and Dead Rising, and god knows how many more things ingrained in the public consciousness, it's still very enjoyable today even though it has been mimicked and copied hundreds of times.The performances (sans Barbara) are all great, it's really, REALLY impressively shot and edited for having such a tiny budget, there's some pretty great music on offer, and while the story may feel cliche nowadays, this is just one of those films where it doesn't matter to me, cause it was the first, and still it manages to be one of the best.I may hesitantly suggest that the pacing drags a bit in the middle, and that the ending feels anticlimactic to me, but I can appreciate the political commentary that is (maybe) there, it just feels kind of like they didn't really know how to end it until the budget ran out and they had to come up with something.But if Dawn Of The Dead is as good as people say, it probably isn't because Romero lost his braaaaaaaaiiiiiiins just yet.",Night of the Living Dead

The script works very well and there is surprisingly little of the actual zombie stuff. A lot of the movie is about the dynamics between the people in the house.There are a few apparent goofs like the transition from day to night in a few cuts and the acting is a bit over the top at times, but overall I felt the delivery was very consistent. The finale is very well handled and the actual ending makes quite a lot of this movie.It's a classic for sure.",Night of the Living Dead
189,tnrcooper,"If you like horror movies, this is where it all started",10,24 August 2011,"This is a genius film. It can be analyzed on so many levels. It is a comment on the failure of the prevailing socio-political order at the height of the tumult of the '60s, in 1968. It is a comment on race in that the black hero of the film (Duane Jones as Ben) fends off death, only to ultimately succumb to an ignorant mob of white men in a truly pointless death. Via the character of traditional Harry (Karl Hardman), we see the passive approach toward change-hide in the cellar and hope that one survives. This might be analogized to many in the United States at the time who resisted change and tried to ignore it and hoped that they might weather the storm as they were. This is in bold contrast to the character of Duane whose resourcefulness and hard work engages the zombies, come what may. This might be analogized as the youth, as minorities, as folks who wanted to see a new way of doing things and would push to secure it.The film itself is quite spare in its style, which to me makes it quite ripe for metaphor and interpretation. One can see, in the vivid, sharply-drawn characters, the outlines of prevailing schools of thought driving the coruscating changes of the '60s.The story of the film is that a group of people find themselves trapped in a home with zombies zeroing in on them. They are stuck in the house and are trying to survive the attack of the relentless flesh-eaters. The group is composed of a family- which lives there and whose daughter Karen (Kyra Schon) has already been bitten by the zombies. They, including the old-fashioned Harry and his wife Helen (Marilyn Eastman), with whom he is feuding, are in the cellar. A young man named Tom and his girlfriend Judy (Judith Ridley) who are a bit more forward-looking have also taken refuge in the house although they are a bit more willing to join Duane upstairs in taking on the zombies directly. The decisions they make about where they will take their stand will determine whether they will defeat the zombies or not.The film was heavily criticized when it was released for some of the imagery which was quite gruesome. In watching it now, it retains the ability to shock, and the matter-of-fact way in which the zombies continue to attack, not in a graphic way, but simply unrelentingly, gives the film the continued ability to scare. As noted, I found the film quite acidic in its commentary on Vietnam, on race riots, on changes in demographics and on a country in flux, but if you just want to watch it simply for a good scare, it would work that way also. Director George Romero has conjured up a compelling story onto which one can attach all sort of meaning and the cast, most especially lead actor Duane give great performances. There are some very scary moments in the film and its importance, as a pioneering horror film was recognized several years ago when the Library of Congress accorded it protection as a work of enduring value. It's not hard to see why.",Night of the Living Dead
190,meathookcinema,An Absolute Masterpiece,10,31 October 2018,"A mysterious radiation thought to have been brought back to Earth after a space probe to Venus is bringing the dead back to life to feast on the living. A young woman named Barbara is visiting her dead father's grave with her brother Johnny when...This film has so much of a great reputation amongst horror fans and cinema scholars alike. Does it live up to this?In a word- YES. Not only does it feel real (it's based in the America it was made in and looks almost like a documentary) but you get the impression that the events that take place in the course of the film could actually happen. We are witnessing the fabric of society unravelling magnificently due to the disaster which has occurred. Life (and death) will never be the same again after this literally Earth-changing event.Hitchcock may have ripped up the horror rulebook by disposing of Janet Leigh's character Marion Crane early on in Psycho when the audience wrongly thought of her as the main female character who would make it to the end of the film. But George A Romero goes one better in Night. Barbara is still in the majority of the film but is so traumatised by her ordeal that she is rendered catatonic for the rest of her tenure. And what a great performance it is- a mental breakdown captured on celluloid, a brilliant portrayal of a response to trauma. Watch the scene where Barbara comes across the music box. It's one of the most unsettling scenes I've ever seen.Romero also holds a mirror up to societal tensions and conflicts throughout the film. Duane Jones as Ben is the lead of the movie but is also African American- unheard of except when depicted by Sidney Poitier in mainstream Hollywood films that felt groundbreaking and progressive but also marginalised. These films squarely tackled race (and rightly so). But Jones just happens to be black and this is never mentioned in Night. His race isn't an explicit issue in the film- but maybe directs the actions of other characters (check out the conclusion to Night. There are MANY different readings and interpretations of this. It's the most shocking ending I have ever seen in a film and just as relevant today as it was back then. I actually get a shiver down my spine just thinking about it and what we see during the end credits of this film).But there are other societal echoes within Night. Notice how Ben gives his monologue regarding the backstory as to how he ended up at the farmhouse. Jones is truly astonishing especially here. But then watch how he reacts when Barbara tells her story- her account is no less serious or devastating as she's just seen her brother being knocked unconscious after being attacked by a member of the undead during an event that should have been humdrum and routine. She is termed hysterical by Ben who tells her to calm down. Different oppressed sectors of society with equally disturbing back stories to tell but instead of each being given their time to share their experiences, a member of one group tells the other to effectively shut up. 50 years on, this film is still relevant.This film also has a lot to say about the family of that time. The traditional family is under attack from the zombies (as Robin Wood expressed using his theory of 'Return of the Repressed'). The notion of Mom, Dad and 2.4 children (possibly with an apple pie on the table) is no more. The new family in the farmhouse consists of disparate members of society who are forced together to survive against what has gone wrong in the outside world. In fact, in one scene we see Ben actually taking apart the notion of the family and the household from within as he starts taking apart furniture like the kitchen table to barricade the doors and windows with. The scene where the mother is stabbed to death by her daughter who has been bitten by a zombie represents the death of the outdated notion of the family in it's purest form. The new killing and replacing what and who has gone before.The first time I saw this film it had actually been colorised but still worked. The thinking behind this colorisation was probably the video company thinking that all horror films made within a certain timeframe were 'kitsch', camp and unworthy of serious analysis or enjoyment. I believe the term is 'so bad it's good' (vomit). I remember an advert for a screening of the film on the UK's Channel 4 that billed the film as a typical 60's drive-in B movie- cue emphasis on bad acting, rubbish make-up and all round tack. Wrong on EVERY count.It was a revelation when I first saw the film as it was intended to be seen in black and white. It's actually a beautiful film with every frame resembling the work of the Nouvelle Vague rather than some Grindhouse fodder made on the cheap to be shown to the stoned.I saw this film yesterday on the big screen. It was the Criterion 4K restoration and it looked and sounded amazing.If punk is seen as Year Zero for music then this is Year Zero for horror and one of a whole slew of films that represented a turning point for American film in general.Fun fact- this is the film on in the background when Harold is having a sandwich made in Halloween 2 (1981).",Night of the Living Dead
191,Toronto85,Night of the Living Dead,9,27 May 2012,"Night of the Living Dead was the first real horror movie I ever watched. I was about ten years old, and it scared the living crap out of me! While it doesn't give me nightmares like it used to, it is still an enjoyable and creepy film to me. After being attacked in a cemetery while visiting her father's grave, the ""main girl"" Barbara makes her way to a seemingly abandoned farmhouse. It is their that she meets up with six others and they battle to survive a world-wide zombie attack. There isn't much else to say about the plot. It is a 'survive the night' type of zombie film. I always wondered what I would do in the situation that they all were in. Would I do what Ben said and stay in the boarded up house, or what Mr. Cooper suggested by going down into the cellar and wait for help? Both options are set up for doom unfortunately. And that's what the entire ""Dead"" series meant for me. There was no hope or chance of survival. No matter how much the characters fought to stay alive, there was no chance of it.Night of the Living Dead is to this day one of the best horror movies ever made and is the first of it's kind to be made. There is one scene that stuck with me always and gave me nightmares when I was a kid. The scene where the daughter kills her mother with the gardening tool. It was done brilliantly and was probably very shocking back in 1968 when this was released. This is one movie that everyone should see at least once.9/10",Night of the Living Dead
192,antagonist117,"A very basic, and surprisingly reactionary, zombie flick",3,17 June 2013,"Did the perfect zombie (or ""ghoul,"" as this film's antagonists are dubbed) movie spring forth from the head of George Romero fully- formed, or did subsequent iterations simply fail to build on his promising idea? You know the drill even if you are not a zombie connoisseur: the murderous undead are on the loose, and a diverse band of survivors must overcome their disagreements while staving off the hordes. Romero achieves his vision in ""Night of the Living Dead"" despite financial and technical limitations. Yet the vision itself is so limited that it hardly extends beyond the premise. In this movie, as in many later knock-offs, there is little character development, little consideration of the theological or scientific implications of the situation, and— despite frequent claims to the contrary and the casting of a black lead actor—little social commentary. The ending is suggestive of the paranoia and pessimism that afflicted many in 1968, but the script's unironic portrayal of women as submissive and incompetent does not indicate a desire to engage with social issues of the day. ""Night of the Living Dead"" is decent as far as it goes, but it does not go far, and the genre has rarely aimed higher in the nearly 50 years since.",Night of the Living Dead
193,frankwiener,Trailblazing,8,29 March 2018,"I should alert readers that I am not very knowledgeable about the modern zombie genre, so my review should be taken accordingly as one by an unenlightened old geezer who is not at all hip to the twenty first century.This classic horror movie's greatest strength is the successful ""creepiness factor"" that was so carefully developed by director George Romero from the very first moment. After many viewings, I am still terrified when the man walking among the cemetery monuments (Bill Heinzman) suddenly begins to attack Barbara (Judith O'Dea) before moving on to her brother, Johnny, (Russell Streiner), and then begins to chase her into an isolated farmhouse before being joined by what becomes an army of his fellow ghouls, mysteriously raised from the dead. Heinzman not only imitates Karloff very well, but he looks like him! It's a very frightening nightmare brought realistically to life on the screen.Although the music is stock material, it was well chosen for its fear effect and downright eeriness. Considering its low budget, Romero's ability to create a film that reaches such a high mark on the chill meter is very commendable. In other words, I was scared spineless from the very start.One of the problems with the film, however, is that it fails to sustain the intensity of its opening scenes and loses its punch along the way. I understand that the dialogue is often spontaneous, but it is also often weak, as is at least some of the acting. This may be controversial, but I didn't get the racial theme that many IMDb reviewers noted. I saw Ben as just another ""non-dead"" victim without observing any social or political significance in the color of his skin. Harry views both Ben and Tom, who is white, with contempt. I didn't understand why Ben didn't shout out ""Help! I'm not a zombie!"" as soon as he heard gunshots outside. He had to know that the zombies were incapable of aiming and shooting weapons. Also, the scientists and military officials in Washington were not very credible. They were actually laughable, as was their silly dialogue.In spite of the weaknesses, this film remains as a remarkable, pioneering classic in the horror genre, and it will continue to arouse much fear and trepidation within me for some time to come.",Night of the Living Dead

Duane Jones was excellent here. He should have become a big star. This was 1968, and Jones was the only black actor in the movie-yet there is not a single reference made to race. That was admirable. The film has a genuinely creepy feel to it. I wouldn't quite call this the best horror movie of all time, but it does contain the most horrorfying scene of any horror movie I've ever seen.

He is also the driving force of the movie. Not too sympathetic, but always up and about even if a bit unstructured, he fights stubbornness and prejudice.The music gets too dramatic and typical for its time sometimes, but also it has some fine eerie moments.

198,Jared_Andrews,Still Scary even 50 Years Later,7,25 July 2018,"A film that popularized ""zombie movies"" never actually uses the word ""zombies."" The living dead are only referred to as ""ghouls."" To an audience that presumably didn't understand the concept of a zombie (since they were not very widely known at the time), it's explained quite well and in a cleverly deliberate manner. None of the characters immediately understand what is happening because why would they? Only through a series of newscasts does the situation become clear. The characters learn that the recently deceased have come back to life (thanks to some radiation effects) to kill and devour the living. This is their first encounter with what we will later call ""zombies.""'Night of the Living Dead' is, like many horror classics, a movie that is eventually scary. By that I mean it's not scary right away like modern horror movies. The first half is a bit slow and totally dated. It doesn't really hold up in a cinematic way, and it certainly isn't frightening. It comes across as unintentional comedy, or perhaps even intentional comedy. Either way, the material is inherently silly and benign. Around the midpoint, something genuinely horrific happens. Then the tension escalates, and the possibilities suddenly seem endless. Everyone felt somewhat safe up until that point. Sure, one character had died and it is implied that plenty of other unseen people had died off screen too, but the deaths and violence are tame. This moment opens up the floodgates. From there, a series of atrocities take place that would still be considered shocking today and were most certainly beyond shocking when audiences first saw them in 1968. These moments aren't so funny. Even though the film is 50 years old, I still won't mention spoilers, because that's the level of respect I give to these moments. They deserve to unleashed on viewers without prior notice.In addition to making a visceral fright fest, Director George Romero also tackled racial dynamics, though he admitted this was unintentional. Nevertheless, this commentary resonated with audiences in an impactful way. In the 1960s, Black characters were hardly ever presented as heroes or even as equals to their white counterparts on screen. But the lead in this film is a competent, composed Black man who takes charge when everyone else behaves hysterically in response to the ""ghouls."" A white man feels threatened and compelled to assume control. Though none of this is directly addressed in dialogue, one cannot help but notice the implications. It gives the film layers and makes it more than just a well-crafted zombie flick.It's an additional element like this that makes 'Living Dead' an all-time horror classic.",Night of the Living Dead

So much so, that the MPAA ratings system would be created.A group of people are trapped in a farm house where a bunch of the undead are waiting outside.Night of the Living Dead is a film that for me, while a good film, is better to be appreciated than enjoyed. Let's be honest, this film is truly groundbreaking for it's time. Without it, we would not be having the zombie media that we have today like The Walking Dead. But, like any groundbreaking film, there has been better films since. But again, I can still appreciate what this film was able to do. The film's flaws are mostly budgetary but that is what makes the film interesting to watch as a look back at independent film making. Other flaws include how female characters are written which is something Romero expressed regret about since. The characters overall are not very interesting. The only character I truly care about is the main character Ben (Duane Jones). Now the film has racial tension in key scenes which, according to Romero, was not the point because the character of Ben was going to be white but Duane Jones, a black man, had the best performance. This just makes the film more interesting to watch. It is basically a character study. I really enjoy seeing the characters strategizing about what they should do next. The film is filled with hokey moments overall but nothing that takes away the overall creepy and disturbing nature of this film. The black and white nature of this film truly helps with the overall creepiness. I should note that I watched the 2004 DVD release that had both the original black and white version and the color version and for my first time viewing, opted to watch the film as it was originally released. The film is extremely slow paced. Perhaps a little too much. Yes, it does help build the tension and at times effectively so. But there is also backstory and exposition which is a mixed bag. Especially when we are given back story for characters we frankly do not care about too much. Finally, the ending. All I can say is that for someone who does not know, they will surely be shocked.Night of the Living Dead is a good film. But there are films that are more enjoyable since this film's release but there is no doubt about this film's significance in the horror genre.",Night of the Living Dead
201,jcholguin,A movie not to be forgotten,10,20 July 2001,"This is one movie that will live on, long after the living dead are all destroyed.  I can still remember that night in 1968 in East Los Angeles one of the lucky ones that had a seat while so many were sitting in the aisles of the theater.  Screaming girls added to the tension of the opening scenes in a cemetary with the haunting words ""Barbara.""  Oh, what a movie classic of its time!",Night of the Living Dead
202,Casey-52,"If anyone speaks against this movie, they are blasphemers!",10,3 April 2000,"Since so many people have given such wonderful reviews before me, I won't even try to write a lengthy essay on the importance of ""Night of the Living Dead"". In short, it saved horror from becoming a joke (it wasn't doing too well around 1967 and 1968) and redefined how zombies were viewed by the general moviegoing public. I can't think of one horror fan who has not seen this film and if you are reading this and STILL haven't seen it, go out NOW and rent it, buy it, anything. You owe it to yourself to see this!While lots of fans find Judith O'Dea's character Barbara very annoying and catatonic, she is only a realistic portrayal of how an already unstable woman would react to the crises she is put through (attacked by a stranger, witnessing her brother's murder). True, Barbara does become an unimportant character about 25 minutes into the film, but she is still a commanding presence by the sympathy she evokes from the audience. Judith O'Dea is my favorite performer out of the whole film, even though Duane Jones, Karl Hardman, and Marilyn Eastman give better than average performances. Unfortunately, out of the entire cast, only Jones moved onto other movie work. The others slipped into obscurity and have turned up at horror film conventions to sell their wares. I have personally met Bill Hinzman (the cemetery zombie), John Russo (co-writer), Karl Hardman, Marilyn Eastman, and Kyra Schon (the zombie girl) and they are all very nice, down-to-earth people overflowing with information and memories about the shoot.George Romero is still working today and is one of only a few great horror masters still making actually effective genre films (along with Wes Craven, Dario Argento, Tom Savini, and a few others). The entire film is a compelling character study, a series of shockingly graphic zombie attacks, and unparalleled terror created by an isolated, claustrophobic, documentary-like filming style that Romero would later use to his advantage in other films like ""The Crazies"" and ""Martin"" (see those, too!). Once again, if you hear anyone speaking against this movie, truth is that they weren't in the right state of mind while watching it, are closed-minded, or just expected more gore effects. Instead, an intelligent movie was set before them and they couldn't handle it. I recommend this movie more than ANY other film in the horror genre, you WILL NOT or SHOULD NOT be disappointed!",Night of the Living Dead
203,Afracious,The Scariest Film Ever Made,10,29 September 1999,"I watched this film when I was ten-years-old and it terrified me. I had nightmares after about the world being overrun with zombies and it is still the best scary film I have seen. The beginning of this film is set out brilliantly to intimidate and startle us. The music is menacing and so stinging and striking, the black and white desolate setting of the graveyard, a sense of loneliness and helplessness as the zombies engulf the trapped people, and the impending doom for them as it becomes apparent the ghouls are extremely numerous and savage. And the bickering and distrust between the trapped people in the farmhouse. The cheap budget of the film adds brilliantly to the effect it has, and just shows how you can make a truly great scary horror film with little financing. A great original horror film that has been imitated but never surpassed.",Night of the Living Dead

It could have been better in many ways and although it may not be the best undead film (for that is opinion) it is inarguably the most important. The two most influential undead films would have to be this and ""RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD"" (1985, O'Bannon).I recommend this film because I think it's great.",Night of the Living Dead
205,grygotis,A crude and historic masterpiece,10,1 November 2021,"I rated this a 10 simply because it was in 1968 by far the most frightening film I had ever seen and due to its historical significance in the horror genre. There are plenty of reasons it is not a 10 among them really bad acting by the entire cast other than the lead, Duane Jones, and bottom of the barrel production values. However, that latter detriment is also an asset to this film's epic eeriness. It also suffers in logic immediately in the very opening when the first zombie seems to have the intelligence to look around for a rock to help him break a car window. One could pick on this all day, but it remains the quintessential zombie movie of all time and somehow it still stands the test of time and has been influential as hell. It has also been remade a few times, it has had many sequels of which some have also been remade and amazingly a few in all of this haven't been bad! On top of its many frightening aspects in 1968, the ending was indeed also a major and dark shocker. I still dread seeing it occur.",Night of the Living Dead
206,gregorycanfield,"They're coming to get you, Barbara!",10,20 October 2021,"A landmark horror film, and the granddaddy of all zombie movies. This was probably also the first horror movie to contain explicit gore. Except for one specific scene, the gory elements don't work. Watching the ""ghouls"" eat flesh is simply disgusting, and compromises the movie's overall impact. Fortunately, the movie also has much genuine suspense and some truly horrorfying scenes. The one gory scene which does work is also the most shocking and disturbing scene of any movie I've ever seen. It is when the injured little girl viciously attacks her own mother. The cold, vacant look in that girl's eyes. It's the stuff nightmares are made of. No aspect of this movie is better than Duane Jones' great performance. Jones was the only black actor in the movie, and no reference was ever made to race. For 1968, this was an amazing thing. No reason that it should have been amazing, though. Jones was simply the best actor for the part. The movie also deserves credit for how it gets ""right to the point."" The story starts off in a seemingly ordinary way. The brother and sister (Barbara and Johnny) soon come face to face with one of the ghouls. Everything else evolves from that scene. Again, a great, landmark horror movie.",Night of the Living Dead

It is black and white which gives it character it might have lacked in color. The graveyard setting in the first few minutes of the film is etched into every horror film lovers head and stays there never to come out. The ending of course is Romero driven and also trend setting. It was a first in it's own right and a must view for anyone interested in the top horror movies. I would tell you much much more but I don't want to spoil it for the precious few who have never seen it or heard of it. Enjoy at your own risk and don't eat a heavy dinner before seeing this one or you may not be able to keep it down.,Night of the Living Dead

As a classic it's something to watch and cross off, but it didn't leave an impression on me.",Night of the Living Dead
210,LanceBrave,A New Culure Arising to Devour the Old,9,1 December 2014,"Horror fans like myself like to say the classic age of horror lasted until 1960, when ""Psycho"" signaled the start of the modern age. Though its true that ""Psycho"" might have been the first true modern horror film, it took the rest of the decade for the genre to catch up to Hitchcock's masterpiece. The movie that truly signaled the changing of the guard, that dragged horror kicking and screaming into the modern age, was George A. Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead."" The film's biggest contribution to the horror genre, and all of pop culture truthfully, is the modern conception of the zombie. Before this film, the only version of zombies known to the world were the traditional voodoo zombies, undead servants controlled by a master. In ""Night of the Living Dead,"" the zombies are corpses risen to life to feed upon the flesh of the living. The only way to kill one is to destroy the brain through whatever means. These are the rules that have come to define the entire zombie genre. For the record, Romero never intended to completely redefine the zombie. In his original script, he referred to the creatures as ""ghouls,"" a similar but distinct mythological creature. His main inspiration for the movie was Richard Matheson's ""I Am Legend,"" which was a novel about vampires. These specifics ended up not mattering. From the moment it was released, the ghouls in ""Night of the Living Dead"" were zombies. Henceforth, everything that acted like them were also zombies.Another aspect that has elevated the film into the upper-echelon of great horror movies is George Romero and his actors taking the material one-hundred percent seriously. The director intentionally invited a number of subtextual angles. ""Night"" is about the end of the sixties. The film is literally about a new culture arising to devour the old one. Society as we know it is overturned. The rules of life and death, as traditionally understood, are completely rewritten. Early on, Johnny makes a dismissive reference to religion. Later on, a news report says there's no time for ceremony when disposing of the dead. Religious certainties are invalid now too.If ""Night"" isn't the first modern horror film, it is, perhaps, the first post-Vietnam horror film. There's a stark quality to the way the film is shot. It frequently feels like a newsreel. These aren't movie stars in a glossy production. These are normal people involved in horrifying circumstances. In opposition to generations of Gothic horror films, the horror isn't in some exotic forgien land. It's in your backyard. By the same accord, the film brings the horror of Vietnam home. Romero and company have repeatedly denied the casting of Duane Jones, a black man, in the lead role having any significance. Yet his presence undeniably affects how the viewer watches the film. For all the layers in the film, its most universal point is that mankind is incapable of communicating. If Ben and Mr. Cooper worked together against the zombies, they might have survived the night. Instead, they bicker, argue, and compete. Humanity will never be able to get anywhere because we can't stop arguing with each other over petty, pointless bullshit.You can read a lot into ""Night of the Living Dead."" As sophisticated as the writing is, ""Night"" is still a low budget horror film made by a first time crew. The seams show repeatedly. The camera positions are frequently awkward, sometimes creating unintentional dutch angles. The editing can be hazardous and sudden at times. The film is scored with stock library music which frequently blares and is as inelegant as possible. The story has a thrown-together quality at times, reminding the viewer how quickly and cheaply it was shot. George had a lot of stuff on his mind but the writing is still, at times, pulpy. Barbara is a defenseless woman who spends half of the movie as a frantic wreck and the other half unconscious on a couch. There are long sequences of characters walking through the house or boarding up windows which come off slightly as padding.If ""Night"" wasn't remember for birthing the modern zombie genre, it would be remember for its then-shocking amount of gore. The movie was released in a post-""Blood Feast"" world so it's not like splatter films were a new concept. However, no movie before ""Night"" treated gore in such a visceral way. Zombies have bloody holes blown through them, which they easily shrug off. Ben stabs one ghoul in the head with a tire iron. The most infamous moment follows the explosion of the pick-up truck. An undead orgy of feasting follows, the zombies fighting over a trail of intestines and chomping down on organs and body parts. Though crude, the gore is still sickening today strictly because of the matter-of-fact way its handled. The film is going for shocks. A little girl stabs her mother to death with a trowel before gnawing on her dad's arm. Ultimately, the downbeat, bleak tone of ""Night of the Living Dead"" grants its violence more power. This is a world without happy endings. The government doesn't swoop in at the end to the save the day, like ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers."" Instead, slack-jawed rednecks shoot the hero in the head, mistaking him for a zombie. The ending is sudden and nihilistic but more than makes its point.A strong helps seal the deal. Duane Jones is charismatic and gives a committed performance, even making Romero's sometimes awkward dialogue work. Karl Hardman is also notable as the bristly, hard-edged Harry Cooper. Some of the actors, like Keith Wayne or Judith Ridley, aren't as good though, giving stiff performances. Sometimes the low budget details are distracting, sometimes they are affective. Either way, ""Night of the Living Dead"" is unforgettable, still scary to this day, and surely one of the most influential horror films ever made.",Night of the Living Dead

And it still is the straightedge in this genre, not even reached by himself. Why is it so special? The time it was made was during the US-engagement in Vietnam, the public opinion was on the edge of a turnaround. This was a good feed for young artists trying to convey their dark vision via motion pictures. The black and white and the locations appear cheap (for a movie). The effect of that is that the people and places also seem familiar, the audience doesn't get the chance to push it away on ""them"". And then suddenly this unexplainable horror breaks out. How do people react? Some found militant militia armies. Some can't bear the situation and take refuge in insanity. Others show boundless egoism, instead of helping others.

217,shaun98,Effective and atmospheric,7,21 October 2002,"*possible spoiler?*After more than thirty years, ""Night of the Living Dead"" stands as one of the most influential horror films ever made. Despite its low budget, it still holds up reasonably well. In fact, a more polished film might not have been as effective. The grainy, gritty black-and-white cinematography evokes the feeling of a documentary instead of a fictional construct. As events progress, there is an urgency and immediacy that no amount of money can buy. There is a feeling of mounting dread, as we feel trapped in a nightmare with the characters. The more we see, the less confident we are that anyone will make it out alive. The ending, which I would not dream of revealing, is a genuine shocker. It shows what true horror can do when not touched by corporate interests. For his entire career, Romero would make every effort to make quality films on the fringes. He has not always been successful, but rarely has he been accused of selling out.Duane Jones has been noticed as one of the first black leads in a horror film. This may or may not have been a deliberate attempt to make a social statement (availability surely played a role as well), but he turns in a credible performance as Ben. At first I was concerned about the effect Judith O'Dea would have on my enjoyment of the film. Her ""girl in distress"" character was shrill, but thankfully she goes comatose and allows the remainder of the movie to focus on more worthy supporting characters. Karl Hardman gives strong support as a fellow survivor who cannot get along with Ben, even putting his life in jeopardy. The film makes creative use of radio and television media to transcend its budget limitations, as we are barraged with reports of zombies taking over the entire east coast--and beyond. This is not an isolated incident. This is a major problem that is sure to have profound repercussions far and wide. The highest levels of government are in a panic over what to do about the problem. These portions make up some of the most compelling material in the NOTLD, and give a more epic scope to what might have otherwise been a more claustrophobic (and less compelling) film. The effect is chilling. Its sequel, ""Dawn of the Dead,"" would take the concept even further, becoming one of the few follow-ups to stand above the original.*** (out of ****)Released by the Walter Reade Organization",Night of the Living Dead

219,diand_,Seal of approval,6,22 February 2017,"Now this is firmly embraced by the (art) community in the form of LoC's and MoMA's seal of approval, it has been beautifully digitally restored in a 4K DCP version. As the mother of all zombie movies it deserves this treatment.Made in 1968 on a low budget most of the crew had multiple roles in the movie, thus we see the producer back as a zombie for example. Romero placed the movie in real, ordinary locations and that was one big innovation for the genre. And it is after all these years still scary as hell in the horror scenes, but the long preparation scenes in between and radio and TV broadcasts coming through are now somewhat old-fashioned and actually boring. The ending is still as intriguing as the movie itself.There has been a lot of second-guessing about the double meaning of this movie. While the sequel was clearly about consumerism, this has over the years had many interpretations: criticizing American society, the wrongs of cold war politics, racism, misogyny, government and media disinformation and mistrust, the Vietnam war and the military at large. A certain theme is the overall apathy by the general public, the so-called silent majority. Gary Streiner, sound engineer of the movie, dismissed most interpretations recently during the Berlinale Classics screening as unintended but in interviews Romero has said the movie reflected the tensions of the time: ""It was 1968, man.

221,Zombified_660,One of the best movies ever made...,9,12 June 2005,"When I first saw Night of the Living Dead, I was about 17 or 18, and 5 years on, and about 30-40 odd horror flicks later, if you ask me what the best horror movie I ever saw was, Night of the Living Dead is still right there, the only answer in my mind. Yes, Psycho is more artistically shot, yes, the Shining is more epic, but nothing matches the sheer raw atmosphere or impact of this giant among movies.As is often the case, it's much harder to write coherently what makes a movie great than explain a movie's minor flaws, but I'll try my best to explain why I think this is such a wonderful film. For a start, the movie's rough, untouched look was a stark contrast with the glossy look of films that were coming out of Hollywood at the time. Look across at The Italian Job, made around the same time, and the movies are like different worlds. Shot in grainy undoctored black and white, NotLD has a brutal, almost documentary feel that's rarely been improved upon, and makes the horror immediate and tangible.The way the movie looks counts for a part of its impact, but the movie's taut, knife-edge atmosphere, jarring shocks and brutal violence count for the rest. Simply put, Night of the Living Dead eats movies like the Ring whole and spits out their bones, even all these years on. From the first zombie attack right through to the chilling, unexpected climax, it has you by the throat and refuses to let go. Even by today's standards, this is a violent, chilling ride that you won't soon forget. Parts of this movie are still absolutely horrifying, and scenes like the zombie child turning on her mother are so intense and visceral that no studio nowadays would dream of allowing them. Basically, this movie is horrific, resonant and just downright nasty, and you won't be able to shake any of it from your mind, which is just how a horror movie should be.Personally, I can't think of a movie more worthy of the title of 'ultimate horror movie' and I know people will dispute that, and you're welcome to do so as this is just one man's opinion, but Night of the Living Dead will always be my choice. I don't think indie horror, or indeed film itself would have been the same without it, and I'm damned if it isn't still one of the scariest films I've ever seen.",Night of the Living Dead
222,jed-estes,He Did It!,10,16 August 2006,"George Romero did it! He made the first modern day Zombie movie and not only that he added political commentary. What a great guy. Without him there would be no Resident Evil or any other knockoff. He is the man and this is the proof. The newsreel feel is impactive and makes you feel like your there. Wow, how fun would that be to really be fighting Zombies and killing neighborers that you hate. There's a project for you George Bush. This film is awesome because it has a black lead and is one of the first major films to do so and I feel that is highly over looked that it did so. Most people just want to put this off as some sick sixties movie but what it really is, is the dawn of cinema. This movie pulled us out of the night that was girls in despair and guys who owned castles. This film along with Easy Rider showed us that the every man had a story to tell. Even as morbid as this tell is it is still about social class and how the sixties population saw them selves.

I don't know how it ends, who lives, if anyone, or if it has a 'happy' ending, ie; are the zombies dispatched back to the grave and the world made safe once again?This horror flick, and it IS truly horrifying, is the most frightening reel of celluloid ever made in my experience. I get about as far as the point where the girl and the black guy are trapped in the farm house with the zombies scratching and groaning at the doors and windows. I invariably and automatically hit 'stop' when the first one ends up IN the house with them. I just can't take it. It may have something to do with living alone and wondering what is thumping around in the dark downstairs at 3 am (it's usually the cat).I give this movie a 10 because it is the greatest of its genre, which is low-budget, acted by total amateurs from the local technical college or something and filmed in grainy black and white in absolutely real and recognizable places, like the old farm houses that dot the landscape in my neck of the woods and old cemeteries out in the middle of nowhere.It's a dreadful experience and highly recommended for those with perhaps less imagination and stronger stomachs.A crunch and chomp fest for the connoisseurs of gore amongst you.",Night of the Living Dead
224,SeriousJest,THE Seminal Zombie Flick,7,17 June 2014,"It's black and white, and the special effects are primitive, but this is THE seminal zombie film. Like all good horror flicks of its era, it stays compelling through suspenseful storytelling and making its viewers think they saw more gore than they actually didalthough some of the cannibalism scenes were more gory than I would have expected for a film of its time.This movie, Romero's feature debut, was made in the true spirit of an independent film. The line between cast, crew, and producers was virtually non-existent, with actors serving as screenwriters, producers, stuntmen, makeup artists, electronic sound engineers, and still photographers. Romero manned the camera himself for some scenes, as well. According to IMDb, Romero borrowed the house in which most of the movie was filmed from an owner who was going to have it demolished anyway. However, the house did not have a true basement, so the basement scenes were filmed in the editing studio's cellar. Romero also borrowed the car featured in the film. To simulate blood, he usedBosco chocolate syrup.Romero was a Carnegie-Mellon Institute graduate, and, also according to IMDb, this was the first movie filmed in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The Pittburgh police even provided personnel and equipment. The day that the final editing and voice-over dubbing was completed in Pittsburgh, Romero and Russo put the reels into the cans, threw them into the trunk of the car, and drove straight to New York City that night in hopes of having it screen at any willing theater. However, the film's world premiere ended up taking place at the Fulton Theatre in Pittsburgh on October 1, 1968 (At 8PM, admission by invitation only). The movie was met with a standing ovation.Per IMDb, this film became one of the most successful independent films ever made, one of the last big hits of the drive-in era, and one of the first movies added to the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress. Nonetheless, Romero saw very little profit from the film since, thanks to his lack of knowledge regarding distribution deals, the distributors walked away with practically all of the profits. Since the film makers forgot to include a then-required copyright notice in the movie, it slipped into the public domain.This flick is also a great example for discussions concerning African Americans in film. Film historian Donald Bogle believes that most black people in 20th-century American films can be classified into one of five categories: Toms, Coons, Mulattoes, Mammies, and Bucks. However, according to IMDb, the character of Ben was originally supposed to be a crude-but-resourceful truck driver, with no specification to race. After Jones, in real-life a self-serious, erudite academic, auditioned for the part, Romero re-wrote the part to fit his performance.Furthermore, the character of Ben was originally written as an angry person, and, upon receiving the role, Jones expressed concern that the character be rewritten to remove some of the anger – such as the scene where Ben hits Barbara – afraid of how it would be widely perceived in the United States at the time to see a black man acting in this way. The nation was plagued with high racial tensions during the late sixties, and the film was released to theaters shortly after the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. Nonetheless, Romero and most of the rest of the predominantly white crew decided against it, thinking they were being ""hip"" by not changing it. Years later, Romero lamented that he had not taken Jones' concerns more into consideration, and thought that he was probably correct. Romero expressed that he wishes he could speak with the late Jones again, asking him how he felt about the film's legendary status, and believes Jones would just say ""Who knew?"" and laugh.For my part, it was pretty cool to see a black man in a 1960s film play such a confident leadership role amongst a white cast. It seemed to me that the part of Ben could have been played by an actor of any race, as long as he was good, and Jones performed very well.For more reviews and a kickass podcast, check out www.livemancave.com",Night of the Living Dead
225,anthonyf94,Zombies apocalypse as reformulation of human society,8,3 September 2019,"The first film of Romero is kind of pioneer opera: with this movie it was born the zombie as the public imagination thinks about it. The movie is done with poor instructions and budgets, and this enlarge his qualities for the fact that is more incredible how Romero obtained certain effect and because this makes the atmosphere more anxious and obscure.One of the most interesting thing is the fact that Romero use the zombie world to talk about living beings: escaping from zombies became a sort of re-creation of society (where all human conventions are abandoned, for example the lack of trust in a black man, that also created a lot of polemics when the movie was published), in a home without comfort and with the necessity of a hierarchy or at least of an social order. People that are out of this order risk to be taken by the zombie.But the plot is not so optimistic and also the main character, that can resist until the end and defeat the zombie, is exchanged by a zombie by the policemen and killed. The point of arrival is the transportation of zombie system also in human beings still in live, and in them world made of violence and untrustworthy.",Night of the Living Dead

This film still impacts today but just imagine what an uproar it made when it come out in the late 1960's showing the walking dead feasting on the flesh and innards of living humans.This is a horror film that horror fans watch over and over.This little black and white low budget film has continued to shock and awe horror buffs for almost 40 years now and it is truly one of the top 5 greatest horror films ever.You've got to be kidding if you call yourself a horror fan or a movie fan in general and have never seen this masterpiece.""They're coming to get you,Barbara!""

228,dave-sturm,It all started here,10,14 March 2008,"I was 19 years old when this first came out and I was fortunate to see it in a downtown Baltimore theater with a packed audience that didn't know what to expect. When it ended, several in the audience leaped out of their seats and shouted at the screen in outrage. Everyone else just sat there stunned, me included. I think most everyone there realized they had seen something historic.They had.Growing up in the Sixties, I liked horror movies. Horror movies starred Vincent Price or Peter Cushing. They were set in castles. Girls in low-cut nightgowns fled down hallways. Outside, it was always thunderstorms. There was a secret passage. Etc.That style of horror was almost instantly bankrupt when ""Night of the Living Dead"" came out. Just as John Wayne-type westerns became obsolete when ""A Fistful of Dollars"" arrived.I think the moment in the movie that I realized -- and I think the audience realized it -- that a line was being crossed was the fate of the little girl in the basement. To this day, I think that sequence is the single most horrifying moment in all film.I've seen the movie many times and most of the sequels.

229,ksj870,Most Overrated Horror Movie Ever Produced,3,16 October 2012,"George Romero's Night of the Living Dead is almost universally revered by horror fans of all stripes. It is generally afforded a high ranking on any respectable list of the best horror films ever made, and some genre critics and fans rate it as the finest picture the field has ever produced.As such, it is in fact the most overrated horror film of all time.Compare Night of the Living Dead to other horror films usually cited as among the best ever - films like Psycho, Jaws, Halloween, the Karloff version of Frankenstein - and the flaws in Romero's film become painfully obvious. The acting is all over the map, production values are weak, and the script is essentially juvenilia. The only area in which the film does excel is cinematography. Romero does make creative use of the camera and the film's atmosphere is effective. But this alone can't make up for the rest of the movie's shortcomings.Nor can all of the film's weaknesses be blamed on a low budget. The story is an early tract of 60s counterculturalism, with its shadows of moral relativism and nascent political correctness. The script tries hard to rebel against stereotypes, but in fact relies heavily upon them. Essentially a morality tale without a moral, Night of the Living Dead is doomed by its soulless core. A pretentious amateur production poorly conceived and badly executed, Night of the Living Dead is anything but the classic it is supposed to be.",Night of the Living Dead

Even though I didn't love Night of the Living Dead as much as most people seem to, I have to appreciate how masterfully this film is done and how much it has impacted not only modern movies but modern pop-culture as a whole.I really liked the first third or so of the film. I was really surprised by how quickly the film got to the point, the first zombie is introduced within the first minutes. I also really liked the transition into the house. It gave the rest of the movie a brilliant setting that was both claustrophobic and unnerving. Romero also balances the danger of the zombies masterfully with the danger the people within the house pose to each other.Although I didn't find Night of the Living Dead to be the masterpiece that so many people think it is, I can't help but appreciate everything it has done for cinema.",Night of the Living Dead

Gradually as the characters are introduced within the farmhouse, the film becomes more of a tense thriller, as the zombies are seen less and referred to more. The theme is now the struggle experienced by a group of strangers against an unseen foe. Romero further builds his world by inserting scenes from television broadcasts amidst the character dialog. We know only as much as the television allows us to see, which is all the people in the house are permitted to see.By this point in the film it is feeling more like a stage-play with gripping performances from all the cast, with the drive-in, sci-fi movie feel no longer there. After an hour, the film has convinced us enough what is happening is real and this is when the living dead return into the equation.",Night of the Living Dead

234,thelastblogontheleft,"A Classic, and Deservedly So",8,10 July 2017,"This was director George A. Romero's feature film debut — wild to think about considering the classics he has under his belt now (Dawn of the Dead, Creepshow, Monkey Shines) and just how known his name is. Reading some of the reviews that were made at the time is equally wild, such as this one from The New York Times: ""Night of the Living Dead is a grainy little movie acted by what appear to be nonprofessional actors, who are besieged in a farm house by some other nonprofessional actors who stagger around, stiff-legged, pretending to be flesh- eating ghouls.""I mean, they aren't wrong, but this movie still holds up as a cult classic among horror lovers — who HASN'T said ""they're coming to get you, Barbra!"" in an imitation of poor short-lived Johnny's voice? It did well upon its release, too — despite a budget of just $114,000 it grossed $12 million domestically and $18 million internationally. It seems surprising now, since much of mainstream horror is FILLED with unspeakably disturbing images, that it was criticized at the time for its ""explicit gore"". It's part one of three (followed by Dawn of the Dead and Day of the Dead) — the stories for each film all written at the same time but executed with quite a few years in between each release — and Romero has talked about it being heavily influenced by Richard Matheson's 1954 novel I Am Legend.It was the first movie to introduce the modern idea of a zombie — though they never use the actual word, opting instead for both ""murderer"" and ""ghoul"" — as a reanimated, flesh-devouring creature.It's heavily ad-libbed and roughly shot — no real bells and whistles here, though I admired the stark black and white and the use of shadow and light throughout. I think it added to the movie in a real way to have it feel so raw and real.Whether it was initially intended by Romero or not, there's lots of commentary and themes throughout: on society in the 60's as a whole and peoples' disillusionment towards law enforcement and authority as a whole, the Vietnam war (""We may not enjoy living together, but dying together isn't going to solve anything.""), and racism (Ben being chased by an all white zombie mob with a torch was very reminiscent of the Ku Klux Klan, the upper class white man being offended and angry by Ben not ceding to his wishes and to his grabs for power, Ben surviving an attack of the undead only to be killed by a group of white law enforcement). Romero has said that he didn't cast Ben — a black lead among an entirely white cast — on purpose, or as any kind of statement; he said he simply gave the best audition. But once Duane Jones was cast and they started filming, they became aware of the symbolism and the themes that it was important to play into. In general, it was less about monsters turning against people, but people turning against people — there is no real community formed, no solid efforts to work together to face the threats head on. They are very divided throughout the whole film, and more of them are killed by human error and mistakes rather than the undead themselves.Barbra was like a silent movie star — so expressive despite not much dialogue. She becomes almost catatonic early on in the movie, and there's lots of tension between her and Ben in several scenes — again, playing into the racism and general attitude towards people of color in the 60's.I do love that they never call them ""zombies"" — one of the news reports on the radio said ""there is an epidemic of mass murder being committed by a virtual army of unidentified assassins"", they are called ""marauding ghouls"", and, one of my favorite lines: ""yeah, they're dead, they're all messed up"". Apt.There's several amazing shots that I loved: the shot of the open field as the ghouls all silently lurch toward the house is great. The overall feeling of dread and suffocation is awesome. Them feasting on the bodies in the car was definitely a contributor to the ""explicit gore"" mentioned. And the zombie daughter killing her own mother by repeated stabs with a spade — as writer R.H.W. Dillard, a defender of the taboo in the film, said, ""What girl has not, at one time or another, wished to kill her mother?"".But maybe my favorite was when the zombies finally are fully encircling the house, beating on doors and windows, and the camera pans to each actor as they express their concern and fear, the lighting as dramatic as ever, everyone SO expressive. The ghouls are slow but unrelenting, and in that moment you kind of feel the full weight of hopelessness.And then there's the ending — solidifying humans being more dangerous to one another than any outside force, the unreliability of those in power, and the fear of any ""outsiders"" clouding our judgment to a fatal degree. I loved the darkness of it, the finality.I don't think I even need to say it, but it's a classic for a reason — worth a watch if you've never had the pleasure (or a re-watch if you have!).",Night of the Living Dead

Don't listen to the people who regard it as ""boring"" and ""old"" - this movie is a lot less boring than ""Psycho,"" for instance (though I like Hitchcock movies in general).""Night"" is made in the same vein as other claustrophobic thrillers like ""Lifeboat"" and the ""Twilight Zone"" episode ""Five Characters in Search of an Exit.""

A lot of time is spent establishing the zombies almost to the point of repetitiveness but once it gets going the action is fast paced and urgent. The glimpses into the outside world through TV and radio work really well and add an impressive and gritty realism. No time is wasted on back story and little is ever known about the characters which I think works well and the tensions feel real. The low budget is obvious and I'm not sure it really stands the test of time as a really great film but it certainly was pioneering.,Night of the Living Dead
238,scott-sw,Best of the low-budget drive-in horror movies,9,7 March 2008,"I recall seeing Night of the Living Dead on Halloween Night, 1983 when MTV celebrated its fifteen year anniversary. For the first time, I was exposed to this cheesy, yet dark and bleak horror movie. Most people know the story. Barbara (Judith O'Dea) is visiting her mother's grave with her brother, Johnny. While there, they are attacked by a zombie. She escapes to a small farm house where she meets Ben (Duane Jones). Barabara has lost her faculties so it is up to Ben to board up the windows and doors as the flesh eating zombies multiply. They finally meet some other residents who have been holding up in the basement. This includes Tom (Keith Wayne) and his wife, and the nefarious Harry Cooper (Karl Hardman). At this point, Ben and Harry fight amongst themselves as well as the living dead. Yes, the dialog is cheesy, the acting is bearable (if that), and some of the scenes shot were high-school level. What made this work (I think) is the bleak and dark outlook. The black and white cinematography adds a frightening despair. This is especially evident in the last third of the film when all hell literally breaks loose. This is not really scary - as in zombies popping up around the corner or out of the shadows. Director George A. Romero rather goes for the claustrophobia and despair. His photography of zombies moving in and out of light and darkness renders humans as monsters. It literally shakes the audience on a thinking level that will carry on for a day, week or month. This makes the movie more frightening. I am glad Romero learned from his novice experience. His vision and work only got better from here.",Night of the Living Dead
239,RomanJamesHoffman,"Hugely influential, genre-definingyet still powerful horror classic",9,6 August 2012,"Sure, there were Zombie movies before 'Night of the Living Dead': a few years earlier there had been the Zombie/Vampire apocalypse movie 'The Last Man on Earth' (based on Richard Matheson's short story 'I am Legend' which also served as an influence for Romero), in the fifties there was Cold-War paranoia classic 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers', back in the thirties there was the Bela Lugosi classic 'White Zombie'even going back, arguably, to 'The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari'. All of these movies carry certain elements present in 'Night' but the all-out assault and apocalyptic cannibal carnage of Romero's debut feature film meant that Zombie movies were NEVER the same afterwards.In the middle of Pennsylvania, Barbara (Judith O'Dea) and Johnny, a brother and sister visit a graveyard to visit their father's grave but unbeknownst to them the dead have begun to reawaken and, stripped of the accoutrements of civilised, conscious thought, are reduced to ravenous cannibals. Barbara escapes to a house and meets Ben (Duane Jones) and together with an assorted bunch of others try to withstand both being laid siege by zombies as well as the corrosive internal power dynamics and individual survival instincts rife within the group.One of the things which contributes to the lasting power of 'Night' is the creation of a believable atmosphere where we can feel the reeling minds of the characters swept up into an unprecedented situation, deprived of crucial information (the cause for the dead's unholy resurrection is speculated at within the film but never categorically confirmed) and thus fumbling in the dark as to the best solution. Another key factor is that, in a similar way to 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers', the monsters here are not figures of folklore like the Wolfman, or Draculaor even the similarly revenant Mummy, but instead are our friends, neighbours, and family members. Indeed, it is this nightmarish vision of a society's anger turned inward which has led some to see it as a critique of the family and the Vietnam war, in addition to the searing attack on racism we see in the shocking final sequence.Certainly these sociological dimensions add a fascinating layer of analysis to the film (something Romero would continue in the next instalment of the 'Dead' series 'Dawn of the Dead') but this should not detract from the visceral quality of the film which (despite the parodies and scores of lesser Zombie movies that followed) remains as bold and fresh today as it was when it was released on the unsuspecting public back in the day.**************************Public domain movie.

The movie starts right out with a funeral in a grave yard. A man and his sister are visiting their mother's grave and the woman is quite unnerved about being in the graveyard. The man starts to play on her uneasiness saying things like ""Barbara, they're coming to get you Barbara."" Suddenly up walks a kind of frightening man and her brother than says ""here comes one of them now."" We the audience still think nothing of it and the brother is still laughing and taunting his sister, when the strange man gets real close and then just starts attacking the brother. We experience real horror as we realize that it is not really a scarry looking man but a kind of zombie. After quickly dispatching her brother, the zombie starts to chase the already shaken Barbara. What follows is a very tense, well directed chase. Barbara somehow gets away from the man/zombie and makes it to a house. In the house she meets a few people that have taken refuge from the apparent army of zombies that are now walking around the area trying to kill anyone they see.We then meet the real star of the movie, a black man who serves as the ""sane"" leader of the refugees giving them direction on how to fortify the house against the attacking zombies.What follows are many tense moments inside the house as the people argue about what they need to do to survive.

That mistakes made by the character are the reason for their death more likely. Also Romero was ahead of his times with giving important characters to diverse actors/actresses. Here the film has a man of color with realistic attributes of real people. Not providing the actor a lower role and less intelligent but very smart.

244,vovazhd,"The original ""zombie apocalypse"" movie",8,2 February 2008,"Yes, I know there are zombie movies that were created before Night of the Living Dead. But none of them defined the genre until this one. This remains the epitome of low budget, B movie horror flicks. The reason became obvious to me as I watched through it. Newer updates or clones may have better special effects, a stronger plot, or even better acting; but they lack the complex messages and themes that flow through the 1968 version of Night of the Living Dead.Things start when a typical woman, Barbra, visits a cemetery with her brother. An unstable, groaning man walks up and attacks them. Barbra flees and takes refuge in a nearby house, which soon becomes a gathering place for other frightened humans. Unfortunately, they become surrounded by a mob of zombies. From that point, practically the whole story takes place inside or close to the building. There are also a few television news segments that describe the mysterious circumstances on a national scale, which is very effective for building up suspense.Technically, the film is a B movie, and it shows. The plot has its share of inconsistencies and holes, but these are overshadowed by the interesting situations. The acting is not particularly good, although this might stem from the fact that none of the characters are likable (with the slight exception of Tom, who unfortunately plays a small role). I felt that, to a degree, it was necessary for the characters to be flawed. They are supposed to reflect the average population that we could compare to; as much as we would like to imagine all movie characters to be heroes, it just would not work. It is important for building the film's message about society.I have heard complaints that Night of the Living Dead is too dated to be effective anymore, but I did not find that to be the case. The atmosphere it created was chilling and disturbing. I do not recall laughing a single time after the first five minutes, which is rare for these older low budget films.I recommend Night of the Living Dead for anyone with even a minute interest in horror films. It seems like a movie that can satisfy both the general audience and the people searching for a more complex message. It has its share of unavoidable problems; but in the end, you are left remembering the good things.",Night of the Living Dead

246,Phantasm01,"Sure the were zombie films before it, but no one can deny that this is THE zombie film",10,9 May 2006,"""Night of the Living Dead"" is the greatest horror film of all time, and probably the most important one of the last 50 years. Much of the time, groundbreaking films are not particularly remarkable artistically-- they simply get by on doing something that had never been done before. NotLD is a particularly glaring exception because it is so effortlessly and organically transgressive. A film like ""Last House on the Left"" seems to exist exclusively for the purpose of pushing the audience to the edge, but NotLD never announces that it is a new, darker sort of horror film. One gets the impression that Romero and Russo and all the others didn't even specifically intend to make a more graphic horror film when they started out. It appears almost normal, initially, but moves inexorably towards the horrific conclusion, at all points defying the expectations as to who ought to survive, or whether or not bravery or cowardice ought to be rewarded. It never feels self-conscious or scripted, and that's why it holds up so well even after it is no longer a particularly morbid or gruesome film. Despite the supernatural elements, NotLD is disturbingly authentic.Horror films tend not to be to big on plot, and ""Night of the Living Dead"" is no exception. It is your standard zombie apocalypse plot, though, of course, no such thing existed at the time. Most modern zombie films take the action-horror route along with an urban setting, but NotLD is pure horror, and takes place inside a desolate farmhouse out in the Pennsylvania countryside. As the film opens we are introduced to Barbara and Johnny, brother and sister. These are characters we've seen before: Barbara is snippety and uptight, and seems to be well on her way to becoming an old spinster. Johnny feels like the hero, and he'd probably feel at home in a 50's Sci-Fi or Horror flick, as he's whiny and jokey and teases his sister. Still, he seems to have a good, courageous heart, however, as he immediately comes to his sisters aid after she's assailed by a strange man in the graveyard. But Oops! Johnny gets his brains bashed in only a few minutes into the film. And though she's technically alive Barbara is more or less out for the count for the rest of the film, and mostly lounges about in a nearly catatonic stupor.Barbara flees to an apparently abandoned farm house, and we are shortly introduced to the films real hero, Ben, played by Duane Jones. The acting in the film isn't exactly terrific, but Jones is good as Ben, and helps create one of the most appealing protagonists in all film. He's smart and capable but certainly not a saint-- Notice how he decks the hysterical Barbara after she slaps him during her vain attempt to get them to search for the now very dead Johnny. Much has been made out of the fact that he's black. Romero will tell you that this means nothing, or nothing more than that Jones was the best actor they could find for the part, regardless of race. Again, the roots of NotLD's greatness are exposed-- They were neither conforming to nor defying tradition. They simply made it their way.The core of the film is not especially eventful: Ben works to barricade the house, and eventually argues with the unexpected tenants in the basement, two couples and one child. These scenes show that Romero really knew what he was doing from the very beginning, and that his experience in industrial films and commercials wasn't wasted. The film somehow maintains a slightly hypnotic intensity in the section as Ben seals of the house while the all to calm radio announcer drones on and on in a hopeless attempt to get a grip on the whole extraordinary situation. Romero keeps the camera moving and the editing sharp so that even after over 10 viewing my mind never wanders in this seemingly uneventful section of the film. (This is a good description of the visual style of the film in general, as it is far from flashy and very realistic, but still energetic enough that it never really feels flat.) And then there is, of course, Ben's dramatic monologue about his first encounter with the ""things"". This scene has been surpassed a few times in later films, like ""Jaws"" or ""28 Days Later"", but it still holds up very well.Eventually, the majority of the farmhouse's residents determine that it's best not to simply wait around for help, and plan a fairly reasonable escape. Suffice to say, things do not go well. I don't want to go into too many specific as it'll hurt the film, but this part is really quite brilliant. Their plan seems really quite reasonable on the face of it, but it proves disastrous. Fate and human error intervene, and we a treated to one of the earliest gore scenes you'll ever see outside of an H.G. Lewis film, as the ghouls feed on charred remains while ominous, amelodic electronic music drones on in the background. Again, this isn't remarkably gruesome by modern day standards, but it's probably the creepiest zombie-feast scene ever filmed.Shortly after this things spiral out of control between the survivors, and all hell break's loose, leading up to one of the greatest endings in all film. Again, I won't go into specifics, but it's just such a classic, senselessly tragic endings. It's been knocked off many times, but the ending here still has the sorta authenticity that you find in all the rest of the film. This isn't a morose, violent ending that a supposedly edgy director stuffed on to prove how far he'd push boundaries This is just they way it happened to turn out. Just a great film.",Night of the Living Dead

Night Of The Living Dead is not my favourite zombie movie, it's in black & white, it's not gory, the zombies don't look too much like zombies thanks to the black & white, the woman Barbra is annoying, the music is really bad and too loud in places BUT i like it. It has a story, it has a little suspense, it is a teeny weeny bit scary, good acting especially by Duane Jones who's character Ben is fantastic who is the exact opposite of the really irritating Barbra and makes the viewer feel safe watching this as he really is the kind of guy you would want to be around in such a crisis as this because this man knows how to take charge and keep his head in a very bad situation. I do actually prefer the 1990 remake and would love to hop over to the Night Of The Living Dead (1990) board and do a review there but i haven't seen that one in years and i want to do a really great review (which it deserves) while it's still fresh in my mind.

There's some interesting never seen before clips with Ben, Tom & Jody but the pointless newly shot sequences by John Russo are jarring and completely redundant (not to mention badly acted!), totally unnecessary and distracting from the film. I also missed some of the original music score, replaced in key scenes with a synthetic piece of ridiculous filler that even Albert Pyun would have scrapped on a bad day.

251,onnanob2,"A true horror movie. Worth repeat viewings, and full of memorable images.",7,13 October 2002,"1968's ""Night Of The Living Dead"" was harshly bashed by several film critics when it was released, but has over the years gained cult and classic status. The film was somewhat radical in its era of release with its gore, nudity (a naked female ghoul), and adult language. It was released in an era in which gore wasn't common in too many movies, nudity was mainly in nudie cutie films, and adult language was just starting to be spoken in mainstream films. This true horror movie has the recently dead becoming animate, and seeking the flesh of the living to feed on. Six people fight for their lives and fight among each other in an isolated farmhouse, which became their refuge from the flesh-eating ghouls. The characters must decide the best ways to prevent and survive attacks by the ghouls, and possible plans of escaping the farmhouse. The living dead become more aggressive as the night goes on, and an attack on the farmhouse seems imminent. ""Night Of The Living Dead"" has many grim and creepy moments from the beginning to the end of the film. The film is in black and white, which greatly helps create a dark and creepy mood. The black and white also greatly enhances the isolated mood of the countryside, cemetery, etc. The film does an excellent job creating an atmosphere of isolation, and many viewers have felt the film has a claustrophobic feel to it. The selected library music excellently helps with creating moods. The lighting helps cast shadows, and the sound effects of crickets make the film seem more realistic. ""Night Of The Living Dead"" contains many great sound effects, and the ghouls themselves make creepy vocal noises at times. The emergency broadcasts on radio and television give another realistic touch to the film. The photography contains interesting close-ups and angles, and the photograph ending is quite effective and unusual; especially when it switches from the photographs to a short scene of a bonfire. The acting is mostly realistic with Judith O'Dea, Duane Jones, and Marilyn Eastman turning in very good performances. Karl Hardman's character seems to have been written a bit off, and it is rare to see a non-villain this disagreeable in life or in a film. However, Karl plays his character well. Most of the dialogue seems to fit the film well. ""Night Of The Living Dead"" was released a bit before the MPAA's ratings went into effect, and would most likely receive the R rating for violence and gore. There are mild scenes of a nude female ghoul walking around the farmhouse with the other ghouls, and the adult language is also mild. It is a film that seems to have a balance of drama, terror, and exploitation. ""Night Of The Living Dead"" is not a perfect film, but I have found it to be a film worth repeat viewings. The film has effected me more with each viewing, and is full of memorable and haunting images.",Night of the Living Dead
252,McFrogg,Feels like it's directed by a zombie.,1,20 April 2017,"Casting a black man as the main character in a horror film during the 60s was a bold move. Too bad he had to star in Night of the Living Dead.Night of the Living Dead has some genuinely suspenseful parts, especially at the beginning, when Barbara is attacked by a zombie. The fact that we don't really know why the dead are rising from their graves is also frightening. Unfortunately, Romero decided to add unnecessary scenes of cannibalism, and a zombiefied child who stabs her own mother to death. We already know from the radio announcer that the zombies eat their victims, and the thought of it is disturbing enough, we don't have to see them play with intestines or sink their teeth into livers.Night of the Living Dead took a giant step forward by having a black lead character, but two giant steps backward with the unnecessary guts and gore. Suddenly, horror movies started to focus more on violent and disgusting scenes than meaningful stories. In a way, movies like NOTLD ruined the horror genre. It doesn't help that the movie becomes insanely boring after a short while.

255,jadedalex,Classic black and white horror!,9,4 December 2010,"I certainly do not want to go into a long dissertation about the 'message' in this movie. The casting of a black actor (Duane Jones) as the protagonist is to me, simply interesting casting. Let's face it. This is a horror movie. It's dead people coming back to life and wanting to eat you. In short, it's a whole lot of fun.Of course there is the irony that the black guy is the only one in the movie with any brains, as he endures a Jeff Foxworthy nightmare image of white hicks, whether it's the recently deceased type, the Living Dead, or the permanently confused Barbara, the cowardly Harry, and finally meeting his executioner, the fat dumb sheriff, who, when asked if the creatures are slow moving, utters this immortal dialogue: ""Yeah, they're dead. They're all messed up.""I could go the artsy-fartsy route and think even Hitchcock would enjoy the novel introduction of the first ghoul at the cemetery. There are scenes inside the house that remind me of Welles' ""Touch of Evil"" and the claustrophobic rooms that Janet Leigh endured in that film.The idea is so simple. Dead people come back to life. This idea reached the ultimate comic conclusion in ""Dawn of the Dead"", which featured a shopping mall that strangely looks like your neighborhood mega-center. Take a real good look next time you are there!In short, the film not only succeeds as compelling cinema, but is a fun horror romp. The black and white gives it the look of a classic. (There is much lost in the remakes...yes, the blood is red.) There are enough disgusting scenes that color would be gratuitous. The 'homeyness' of the scene with the television set propped up on two chairs is disturbing considering the crowd of ghouls that stand just outside.What happened to great horror films like this?",Night of the Living Dead

The effects are fantastic and very gory for the time period! It is a film best watched while taking it seriously as it is how it is intended the main female lead suffers from shock though most of the film which is understandable and instead of screaming all the time she goes quite introvert as would more probably be the case.

The character he plays in the new scenes offers to much plain comic relief which this film doesn't need. The new scenes just stick out like sore thumbs, they are executed in a much different fashion and while the original does seem quite timeless in it's setting the new footage is to obviously new footage. I mean, how many priests would you have seen in the 60s with a skin head and a goatee. So in conclusion, the extra scenes are a bit of fun to watch as an extra but add nothing to the film and perhaps take some of it away, but the music is perfect and it even brings it up to date while still keeping it's old style.

Russell Streiner, co-star and producer of the original helped produce these scenes that just don't add up. The score, however, is terrific by adding an even creepier vibe to the film. Unfortunately, the newly added scenes feel contrived and implicate that of a direct to video feel. One particular notice is a ridiculous subplot involving a ranting preacher whom you wish would end up getting devoured by the zombies. The scenes try to add a backstory to the illustrious first zombie that we see in the beginning, but it just doesn't seem to work. If you love the original, then don't see the 30th anniversary, because key scenes are eliminated from the film, and replaced by scenes that should've remained on the cutting room floor.The Original: A The 30th Anniversary Edition: D",Night of the Living Dead

On his first few attempts he told the owners that it was a film about zomboids munching human flysh and flesh- understandably most were horrified by this plot and spat in his face. Romeo, being an intelligent, bearded gentleman knew that he would have to lie in order for his film to be shown. He began to tell people it was about a group of dancers called the Living Dead who were from 'the streets' and had to fight prejudice and poverty just so they could dance together. A heartwarming story, it featured the tag line 'They're coming to get down, Barbara!' The main character is a shy girl who learns what it is to live, love, and dance and ends up having the time of her life, like she's never felt before. The Living Dead recruit her by repeatedly dancing on her lawn and banging on her doors and windows- she tries to keep them out, but you can't stop the groove, baby!. The beats get more intense, the clothes get more lesser, and soon she succumbs to the ancient art of waving your arms and legs about. The group scrape together enough money to enter the (arm)Pittsburgh dance contest and finally get a stage on which they can showcase their talents. After rough treatment from rich rival dance troupe, Kobra Kyle, they find a wizened old trainer called Mr Umaga. Through him getting them to paint his house, wax his carts, clean his many chimbleys etc they learn valuable life lessons which will ensure they can form important social relationships and gain self confidence when they eventually start employment. Suffice to say, the film has a wonderfully tender ending as the group, just as it looks like they have thrown away the final dance, manage to pull off the mythic 5 metre Qwop twirl dance move and get a 10 from Brucie. Paralleled with the Vietnam war which was entertaining America at the time, Romeo's impressive social commentary manages to convey the joyous spirit of the time- before there was mistrust, before there was paranoia, and when everyone loved each other regardless of the colour of their skin, or the ugly of their face.Best Scene: The naked zomboid ass.",Night of the Living Dead

I thought it was one of the most exciting films I had ever seen, and even today I still get a thrill out of watching it. But as a child, this film had me transfixed, mesmerized, and it now lives somewhere deep in my subconscious mind.While the film might come off as dated to some viewers nowadays, there is no way anyone could not see how unparalleled this work is. Even through some corny dialogue that was most likely improvised, and a few similarly corny supporting actors, mostly everyone in the film is exceptional, and Romero's techniques are admirable in so many different ways. The tension is continuously rising throughout the entire film until the epic climax. I must say that this is probably my favorite of all of Romero's films, and while I enjoyed his 1978 version of 'Dawn Of The Dead' also, I feel that in recent times he has just gone downhill.Honestly, I feel that the black and white aspect just makes the film even better and just helps to further solidify this film as a true classic, and one of the most wholly original horror films ever made.

It's still a nasty piece of business.""Night of the Living Dead"" is B-movie schlock on a low budget, nothing less, nothing more, and it pulls out the standard radiation-from-space explanation for the goings-on; however, it takes a giant leap beyond its genre limitations. It sets us up with a generic story and stock characters then pulls the rug out from underneath us. The hero is not only African-American but is clearly the smartest and most capable character in the picture. Remember, this is 1968 and there are few African-American role models in mainstream American films other than Sidney Poitier. There's a social sub-text in the movie leading to an ending that should not be revealed. Horror movie endings are a touchy subject. I don't need a happy ending, but I don't want a gratuitous, gimmicky twist at the end, either. I prefer an ending that's a logical extension of the story. It can be the ultimate horror, maybe the result of a fatal warp in the protagonist's character or some overwhelming desire that blinds that person, or the ironic twist of fate that the protagonist never saw coming.""Night of the Living Dead"" opens in a graveyard. There's a spat between siblings, a graveside visit, some bitching about the wreath, a tasteless joke, a gaunt old man lurching toward them - and wham! The movie's got you by the throat. Ten or so minutes into the movie and either you can't leave or you want to leave really badly - the option my friend chose. This time around I understood one crucial thing. This movie means business. It's lean, mean, grim and macabre. It's not particularly gory by today's standards, but many of the images are genuinely shocking, and the panic of the opening minutes never quite subsides. George Romero made this film with a great deal of care and skill, and the results are there on the screen. The musical score, in particular, gets under your skin. The actors are very convincing, particularly the actress who plays the woman in shock. I wonder if my friend ever watched this movie again.",Night of the Living Dead
272,eytand94,Night of the Living Dead: The Definitive Zombie Movie,10,4 July 2011,"George A. Romero is one of the most well-known and profitable directors of the genre, thanks to half of his films being the ""Dead"" movies. Other movies in his career, such as ""Martin"" and ""The Crazies,"" are notable, but it's Romero's first film, ""Night of the Living Dead,"" that gets all the attention. The 1968 zombie classic made his career, and influenced many follow-ups.Johnny and Barbara are brother and sister. They travel to a cemetery to visit their mother before her grave is moved. Barbara does not take too kindly to the cemetery, it disturbs her. Johnny playfully jokes with her, saying ""They're coming to get you, Barbara."" And once a slow-moving man approaches them and attacks, the nightmare begins. Johnny is killed and Barbara flees for her life. She finds shelter in a tiny, deserted farmhouse. Soon, she realizes that she's not the only one hiding out. Five other people have isolated themselves in, and the struggle to survive continues. Boarding up the house is only a temporary delay before more flesh-eating ghouls attack. Should they stay upstairs or hide out in the cellar? In a time when hilariously awful B-grade horror films were being produced, ""Night of the Living Dead"" was a shocking surprise, and still is. The MPAA rating system had a fit with Romero's film, and when it was released to the public, it scared the living daylights out of everyone, including little kids who thought they were seeing a normal Saturday matinée(Roger Ebert's rave review for the film also examines the reactions of the audience).The film definitely has an advantage in being shot in black and white. It gives off the feeling of an amateur documentary, that this could really happen.Next to the mood and atmosphere, why does ""Night of the Living Dead"" work so horrifyingly well? Well, in all of Romero's movies, not just the ""Dead"" films, there is social commentary littered throughout. And you'll definitely find that this film has a message or two. Some saw the film as an insight into racism. It was the first film to have an African-American hero, after all. But Romero chose Duane Jones for Ben simply because he fit the part. Also, many fans examine the film as an example of the Communist movement, that you couldn't trust anyone or anything. The zombies could be anybody. They could be your neighbor, your daughter, your husband or wife. It is truly a scary concept.The film also has undeniable claustrophobia. We are uncomfortably sealed in with the survivors, and once the zombies get in, we're not getting out. Not even the cellar can help our protagonists.In 1968 and today's generation, ""Night of the Living Dead"" rang and still does ring true to every viewer. Is this what our world will come to be? Will we be unable to trust the ones we know? Will they become emotionless, mindless murderers, and will our society crumble? Romero's film is not just a 60's horror film, and it never ages. Despite the difference in years, the dead are very much alive.",Night of the Living Dead
273,machrf,"The best zombie movie, better than Vincent Price's.",10,26 August 2020,"This movie vs the remake speaks volumes of the times of the common folk. Although, Judith O'dea was a bit too squeamish, she did a great job at the time. The movie speaks volumes of the times. Good, bad, and indifferent. You can take the ending as prejudice or as a simple mistake. Either way, it speaks volumes of the times. As a mistake it makes an assumption that is not out of character for what they are going through, but could they have been less quick to respond? The remake is more inline with the development between the original and the Dawn, but it is also very different due to the small changes in some of the scenes. Overall, they kept to the original plot very well.
Although, I certainly did not like the remake the first time I saw it, it has grown on me. It is a good remake with 2 great actors, Tony Todd and Patricia Tallman. Todd, followed the original very closely, while Tallman gave Barbara more strength. Although, I did not care for her acting at first, after Babylon 5 she makes it HOT. I wonder if today, she would go after a 61 yo fart?",Night of the Living Dead

So now I just watch the first 30 minutes and then change the channel. I know that it's ""influential"" and all that, but that still doesn't save it from being annoying. Maybe this just isn't my genre. So my review should probably be taken with a big grain of salt. I'm probably not the target audience etc. I don't really have much more to say.

276,FilmCreature,FilmCreature Reviews 'Night of the Living Dead' (1968),9,18 November 2007,"It might seem a bit unfair that I already knew what was going to happen in the movie. In movies like this, it shows what would really happen. It picks one group out of the whole. This is a rare thing-a movie truly deserving respect. For some strange reason, I found the movie really, really, weirdly disturbing. The films today, looking to exploit youthful audiences, are far more violent than this film. But for some reason, I found it even scarier than those movies. Maybe it's the black-and-white. Or the indiscriminatingly violent deaths. Or maybe seeing burned corpses picked apart and eaten just really turns my stomach...Yep, I'm pretty sure it's answer C. Though you might not realize it while you're watching, 'Night of the Living Dead' is truly frightening. Though it was made on a low-budget with unknowns, it has some terrific acting and directing. I don't think I'll watch it again. I found it fantastically well-made, but not ""enjoyable"" in the sense of the word. Though it was made in 1968, it's guaranteed to create nausea in everyone.9 charred corpses out of 10.",Night of the Living Dead

278,xiaoli7377,The Grandfather of Low-budget Horror Films,7,24 August 2020,"A group of strangers find themselves held up in an abandoned house during the outbreak of a zombie pandemic. They have to learn how to get along with themselves in order to survive what's out there. The plot is extremely basic, but it serves its purpose of setting up suspenseful moments and sending unnerving chills down your spine. The way that the story is told, piece by piece through radio and television news bulletins, and through anecdotal dialogue, helps give a tale that's primarily set within a few rooms of an abandoned farmhouse a much larger scope. Although dated in a technical sense, a lot of the concepts and clichés in modern zombie culture draw origins from this 1968 independent horror film. Zombies eat brains. If you are bitten by one, you will later become one. Blows to the head and burning are the only effective methods of stopping them.""Night of the Living Dead"" from George A. Romero is, in my opinion, the movie that marks the turning point in horror, away from the Hollywood studio produced campy B-movies of the 40s and 50s and into the low-budget cult classics of the 70s and 80s. Controversial for its time, the movie shifted the genre away from stories about goofy comic book mutants and little green men, and into a realm much darker. Aside from the fact that the plot revolves around flesh-eating zombies, the film is actually quite grounded in reality. The lead character, Ben (Duane Jones), scrambles to board up the windows in order to keep the zombies out of the house. Harry (Karl Hardman), is constantly bickering with Ben as to what the best plan of action is in the situation. The human struggle of cracking under pressure and stress drives the narrative.Although we are never given much information or background about our heroes, the performances from a bunch of unknowns are all pretty serviceable. There are no standout moments that I can think of where an actor really botched the delivery of a line, but I will say that some of the dialogue isn't all that great. The news bulletin where they interview government officials in Washington D.C. stuck out like a sore thumb to me.The editing is pretty rough in some places too, with some jarring cuts and continuity errors that really throw the viewer off and disconnect them from the movie. The sound effect that they chose for Ben's rifle also just sounds pathetically weak. The punches and smacks that are thrown in the movie are packed with more life and volume than the gun.""Night of the Living Dead"" is a flawed but highly influential piece of cinema. It spawned entire sub-genres of both zombie movies and low-budget monster flicks. It's nothing all that special in comparison with the sheer number of imitations that have come in the fifty years since it was released, but it's mark on movie history warrants a watch through for anyone who wants to know where many of their favorite tropes originated from.",Night of the Living Dead

282,JamesMovieGuy_117,"one of the most influential movies, not just to the zombie film but the horror genre itself",10,6 July 2018,"After a zombie outbreak, a group of people arrive at an old farmhouse where they must spend the night to survive. This is a personal favourite of mine and has to be one of the most influential movies, not just to the zombie film but the horror genre itself. Even though it wasn't the first zombie movie it did introduce some of the most iconic tropes of the genre like using the resources you have to survive, zombies being flesh eaters and zombies needing to be shot or severely injured in the head to die.Duane Jones delivers an excellent performance as Ben who's a strong black protagonist who stands out amongst the highly irrational fellow survivors. 
 
George A Romero excellently conveys that sense of claustrophobia with the house setting and his direction unflinchingly creates tension and suspense. It managed to be the most successful independent movie of the time, garnering 263 times its budget. The movie features a ballsy ending and I won't give it away unless you haven't seen it but let's just say it's a profound social statement that you won't forget after watching the movie.",Night of the Living Dead

284,guskeller,Foundational cinema,8,27 October 2021,"As the godfather of zombie movies, Night of the Living Dead established many of the tropes we have come to expect from the genre. The story might seem basic today, but it invented many staples that are still emulated (the flesh eating and infectious nature of the zombies, for example). The fact that its narrative is still so fundamental indicates the greatness of the writing. Meanwhile, despite being old-fashioned, the music is also a strength because it evokes precise emotions. Together, the score and plot set a bleak tone that was quite shocking for its time.Beyond that, Night of the Living Dead is a well-rounded movie. The cinematography has plenty of skewed angles, dramatic shadows, and claustrophobic compositions. The sound design gets abstract and unsettling during a climatic death. The special effects are sparse but substantial. Plus, the direction of the film is cohesive and optimized. The acting might be overdramatic by contemporary standards and the editing has its rough spots, but this is all forgivable and outweighed by their strengths. Overall, Night of the Living Dead holds up even today and is fascinating as a piece of foundational cinema.Writing: 9/10

Most people know and accept it's significance in post-60s Horror.  In fact while pre-60s horror was a little spooky, Horror itself actually began to live up to it's definition with this film. The opening is still one of the scariest and creepiest scenes ever.  The ending is still as thought provoking as it was during the time of the Civil Rights struggle.

289,pocca,Still disturbing,8,27 October 2005,"Nihilistic horror film that both looks back to the horror films of the fifties with their anxieties about radiation (which here have resurrected the dead) but even more strongly anticipates the extreme gore of those of the seventies. The horrors of ""Night of the Living Dead"" may have lost some of their punch owing to nearly forty years worth of even more gruesome films, but they're still deeply unsettlingfor me, one of the creepiest scenes is the one in which the female zombie walks into a tree and starts gnawing on the bark as mechanically and relentlessly as a relentless great white shark chomping on whatever chance refuse comes in its path.The film also anticipates the essential pessimism of many of the more memorable seventies horror films such as ""Last House on the Left"" and ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre."" In the fifties pictures, whatever havoc might have been caused by the mutant horrors there was always a clear return to normalcy, usually courtesy of a earnest, strong jawed hero. Heroics prove as futile as cowardice in ""The Night of the Living Dead""Ben's attempts to barricade the house are admirable, but in the end, before the onset of hundreds of ghouls prove just as ineffective as the obnoxious Harry said they would. Perhaps the bleakest and most cynical feature of this film is the suggestion at the end that only the actions of a brutal, trigger-happy militia may possibly end the zombie threat.(As for the slow versus fast moving ghoul debate: I prefer the slow onesas the sheriff says, they're dead and messed up after all!)",Night of the Living Dead

Low budget had a good style back then and Romero worked good with what he had.Night of the Living Dead is about survivors of a zombie epidemic trapped inside a house and fighting for their lives. The film is black and white, which gives it its creepy feel. This is probably the only horror film to ever scare me crap less.I think Romero made up one of the only good horror film sub genres. He created the zombie, being a crime-thriller lover and not a slasher fan (Scream was the only good slasher series), I enjoyed this to much surprise.This is back when horror films are good.

The budget was microscopic, the zombies mostly friends of George Romero on their lunch breaks, the set a house, actors whose names, if remembered at all, would be remembered by horror film completists for their participation in this film. Yet it all gels, and by the end of the movie, its nihilism is strongly unsettling.There's not much in the way of plot, or action really, but the slow-paced zombies whittle away the survivors one by one by one. #2 all-time on my list of horror films (after the Texas Chain Saw Massacre); Dawn of the Dead did not disappoint (#7), Day of the Dead very much did.",Night of the Living Dead
293,sublime501,A classic beginning...,8,31 May 2004,"NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD is the first chapter of George Romero's ""classic"" trilogy. Though I didn't like its two successors, this film sure was good.NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD is about several people locked into an abandoned house near a cemetery, hiding away from the zombies that are now rising from their graves to feast on human flesh. With the zombies massing outside, the hideaways think they are doomed. There are a couple of ways they could escape the monsters, but every plan they come up with seems to come crashing down in flames. How will they survive?Ignoring what a classic it is and everything, NotLD is still a great film. I think the use of black-and-white film adds a lot to the movie, and seems to add to the creepy atmosphere the film perpetuates as it moves along. Perhaps that's what the next two films were missing. I also like the fact that all of the violence is implied. You never really see blood spilling out or any of the monsters taking a bite out of any of the living humans, though you do see them feasting in one brilliant shot. I think the creepiest part of the movie was when we're introduced to the little zombie girl (the one shown on the movie's box cover)--I believe she adds a lot of atmospheric elements to the movie.Most of the characters and character development is great, with one exception. Judith O'Dea, in her role as Barbra, seemed rather useless and annoying in that right. I suppose someone has to play the traumatized victim, but it still annoyed me. On the other hand, the script is pretty good, the direction is excellent, and the ending is absolutely brilliant--pessimistic, sad, and extremely clever, all at the same time.I have to say, this is the only chapter of the Dead trilogy that I really liked... but I think it was also the most worthy. Certainly a classic, as I'm sure it will remain for another forty years. 8/10.",Night of the Living Dead

This blackman(Ben) knows about the threats not only of the zombies but of a society full of racial crimes, prejudices and  the white majority. Does this man sees this living dead as the ugly racists of that time? The final scene is so shocking as it's critical with resemblances of KKK rituals of fire(yeah the zombies are afraid of the fire too) This film also shows the influence of the media(radio or tv) in a time of crisis.

Barbara gets anxious and wishes to leave, Johnny sees an opportunity to put a good fright into his little sister by proclaiming that he's coming to get her, harmless fun, meanwhile turns gravely serious as the strangers in fact attacks Barbara and kills Johnny as he tries to intertwine.
With the stranger lumbering in pursuit, Barbara flees out over the desolated plains in desperate search for a place to hide, when she spots a secluded farmhouse in the distance, she immediately seeks shelter there and inturn finds that the house is seemingly abandoned.
As the stranger lurks outside Barbara tries to regain her composure, as she checks the house for its residences
But when she ventures upstairs she stumbles across a partially eaten body, which sends her panic stricken towards the front door, there she finds herself face to face with Ben, who grabs her and drags her back inside the house.
Ben tries to explain his situation, that he was attack by a group of strangers at the nearby ""Beckmann's Dinner"" and barely managed to escape the situation. He subsequently tries to probes Barbara for her story, but the stress and traumatic events of the day is starting to take there toll on the young women and when she lashes out at him in a fit of hysterics he inturn knocks her out.
As the night continues and an increasing number of strangers surround the house, Ben starts to barricade the doors and windows of the old farmhouse while listing to the increasingly alarming radio reports of violence perpetrated by people in a trancelike state all over America.
But just as things are claming down, a grope of survivors emerge from the cellar, to check out if the upstairs is safe, which inturn presents a whole new set of problems in the form of an escalating power struggle between Ben and the refugees supposed leader Harry Copper
As the night grows even darker so does the prospects of survival as difference of opinion and general latent hostility threatens to tear the group apart, more and more this place of sanctuary is ultimately starting to looks less like a safe haven and more like an tomb. As the remaining media outlet realise that these rabid attackers are in fact the living dead and militia groups consisting mostly of gun crazy rednecks, are forming all over the US to eradicate this unusual threat, self-preservation eventual consumes the group as the house's power supply shuts down triggers the zombie inevitable attack on the sheltering farmhouse.Night of the Living Dead was produced in a particular tumultuous time in American history. The Cold War, the Kennedy brothers' assassination, the comeback of Richard M. Nixon combined with the seemingly neverending war in South East Asia and escalating race riots all gave fuel to one of the most poignant slices of discouraging nihilistic cinema outputs ever, brilliantly masqueraded as crowd pleasing entertainment. On the surface a harmless fright flick about flesh munching zombies, upon closer inspection however, a heart rendering socio-political allegory with unlimited bite and brains. And furthermore one of the best films of the sixties...Hell, ever!Night of the Living dead is the patriarch of seminal horror films Sam Raimi, Tope Hooper and john Landis have all named the film as a primary influence on their subsequent works and its fair to say that this film created ""The Zombie"" (although that idiom is never utilized) as we have come to know and love it today, although Victor Halperin's White Zombie (1933) did get there first, and while it's an accomplished slave allegory and immensely important in its own right it is ultimately an entirely different beast altogether.
These Moderne day flesh munches are holistically the creation of George A. Romero and his insistence on incorporating social commentary while changing the rules of the game makes him stand out and worth commemorating .I remember my first encounter with the film vividly; it was during the summer vacation of 1993, the Danish television station TV-2 showed it late one night long past the witching hour and having waited all week to catch it I anxiously sat down to indulges on this horror classic... An hour and a half later I was a changed person.
Completely captivated by the stunning Back and white photography by Romero himself, the incredible effectiveness of an obvious minuscule budget and the overpowering sense of atmosphere that it projected, I was left breathless and in awe at the capability of ""low-budget"" filmmaking, so much so that I subsequently scattered the VHS marked to acquire the remaining parts of what I would eventually learn was an absolutely transcendent trilogy of films, namely the majestic and epic Dawn of The Dead (1978) and the utterly nihilistic Day of the Dead (1985).In the aftermath of the films initial release in 68 Night of the Living Dead gained notoriety for it's ne plus ultra depiction of gore and while it's still true that the graphic content is severe in its presentation and certainly very much ahead of its time, it's not very likely to churn stomach's in this day and age.
What remains undiminished however is the films ability to chill an audience with its cold visuals and haunting score, weaving a tapestry, unblemished in its portrayal of hell on earth.
In a world compromised by demagogic values and the promise of completion obtained through material grains, this film stands as a radiant beacon in the candid hopelessness that is the 21th century' inevitable decline, in that it tests you and asks ""do you want to just sit idly by and let the sense of apathy consume you ? Or do you want to get in touch with your humanity, however utopian that might seem.You'd do well to bypass the 30th anniversary edition that include dismal added footage and just go for the original classic. It has more releases the Sahara has grains of sand so the options are plentiful just make sure it the original !Reviewed here is the beautiful 3 disc Japanese edition from DEX Entertainment which houses three keep cases in a sturdy box.
Disc one house' the main feature presented in 4:3 remastered and completely scratch free. In the extras department you get two audio commentary tracks, the first one by George A.

It's a wonderful listening experience.

297,Anttell,Zombies!,7,11 November 2018,"The film that the recent zombie boom (Walking Dead, Max Brooks' books,...) owes a lot to - a black and white low-budget pioneer of the zombie-genre. I can't say I find it scary, but it's an interesting film, already from a historical standpoint, but it's also an interesting and a serious (despite all the campiness) take on society/human race under attack. I love the Orson Welles esque fake news bulletins, and the way the ending is shot is really something.This was part of my late-Halloween doubleheader together with Dawn of the Dead (1978).

298,Arlis,The night that real Horror was born,10,5 November 2006,"So I was a little boy of about 8 years old and I secretly watched this movie at my grandpa's house on video and it scared the living daylights out of me. I had only seen a couple of movies on TV and when I watched this one it really changed my life. I was in my grandparent's house and basically alone because my grandpa was asleep and my grandmother was sick in the other room and she was confined to a hospital bed.I watched the movie not holding my hands over my eyes or anything just sit there in a daze thinking how I couldn't move. I was afraid these dead people would be outside the walls and perhaps if they didn't hear me they couldn't bother me. It was scary as hell.Now I am a grown man and I am a horror freak with a collection of movies that hit just a tad over the 5500 mark and about 3000 of those are horrors, if not more. I absolutely love horror and I prefer the slashers from the 80's but I like all types I have watched the silents all the way to the universal monsters of the 30s and 40s all the way through to the sci-fi fifties and the hammer 60's and they all hold dear places in my heart but I will have to say that to me George Romero took a bit from the classics and held true to the suspense but he did one thing that all those other movies couldn't  he straight up scared us.Many of the older films were creepy and scary in there own way, but N.O.T.L.D. was the first one that wanted to flat out show us something scary and scare us and not just leave us to use our imagination, but show us what these monsters will do to us. The creepy soundtrack, the great actors and blood guts and WOW!! Almost 40 years old and still stands alone as being perfect and just as scary today as it was then. It's spawned many sequels, a remake and a zillion copies and still nothing compares to it. I think real horror was born with this movie and I don't know how any one could not love this movie. If you get a chance watch it, watch the sequels, the remake and you will see a bunch of great movies watch this in its original black and white presentation. The colorized version takes so much away and also the 30th anniversary version with the extra scenes should be avoided if you are watching it for the first time. If you have watched it about 50 times like I have then the extra scenes are cool to see.10 out of 10 stars",Night of the Living Dead

303,v_haritha_in,This Movie is the Reasons Why We Love and Fear Zombies,10,31 August 2014,"George A. Romero has secured a permanent spot in the hearts of cine- philes with his series of movies on the ""living dead"". The monsters he created did not rely size or weapons to induce fear. They were mere human bodies but without life or conscience and a voracious appetite for human flesh and they multiply by turning their victims into one of them. What can be more fearful than being slowly consumed alive or seeing your loved ones turned into one of them.Restricted to a low budget, Romero turns his disadvantage around. Most of the movie takes place in a farmhouse, where a small group of people seek refuge from the onslaught of the living dead. There is a great attention paid to the affect of the terror outside on the people holed- up inside; their fear, confusion, clash of ideas/egos, the consequent altercations and the tragedy of it all are well-depicted. At the same time we are informed of the wider extent of the terror through news bulletins. The actors are little known but deliver some good performances. The black-and-white prevents us from noticing a lot of blood and for the most part the movie plays on the psychological fear of the viewers. But there are some very disturbing scenes and images peppering the movie, and each time we see one of those, we start dreading the one to come next.This is horror at its best.",Night of the Living Dead
304,john_vance-20806,"""Good Shot"" Mr Romero",10,2 February 2017,"This film was reviled by mainstream critics for its unimaginable gore and violence.

Catholics perusing a copy of Our Sunday Visitor would find rated as a solid ""C"" (for condemned as objectionable for all). By no means it is for everybody, but for those who enjoy a good creepy movie it's simply superb.The settings: forlorn cemetery, empty roads, an isolated farmhouse, drab winter weather - all of these were undoubtedly chosen with the tiny budget in mind but came off as genius picks for location atmosphere.The actors: total unknowns who were probably paid a fee that wouldn't fill your gas tank today - all spot-on right for the roles.Special effects: not all that special, but that's what made them work so well. The entrails looked like the cast-off material from a boar hog castration and the extras grabbed them up and gobbled them down with relish.My favorite character: Sheriff McClelland. That guy deadpanned some of the best lines in movie history (they're all available here on IMDb).I admit to a weakness for B-movies so my standards are pretty low, but this is no B grade, it's a true cinematic gem.

305,KieranSaosila,Not Quite as Good In Retrospect,6,12 June 2021,"Does it hold up? Not entirely. George A. Romero's focus on social commentary as the sole driving force for the plot, is as significant to the genre as it was back in 1968. The flaws lie within the script, which helms a particularly irritating character and plenty of unnatural exposition. It's all very wordy and never feels like any of these characters are real, which completely breaks the suspension of belief (if there was any to be had in a zombie apocalypse.) Alongside the script follows the absence of threat from the so-called zombies who act more like daydreaming corpses.

307,Sonic_Ocean,"An ugly, but beautiful work of art",8,11 March 2013,"Zombies have become icons in the world of horror films thanks to this classic. 'Night of the Living Dead' is a classic not simply because it created new benchmarks for horror films at the time, which it did, but also because it manages to stimulate the viewer and it still does today.While it's more satirical sequel feels more grandiose in its approach, Night of the Dead feels more bare bones and simple in its approach, but with still some political undercurrents. It feels more claustrophopic and doomier and it really gives a strong sense of death near every corner. While the setting in Dawn of the Dead gave a little bit more of a sense of security for the characters, in every waking moment in Night of the Dead, there is a feeling of danger and anxiety. The great thing about this movie is that every character is in danger right from the start of the film and it builds up throughout the movie until it finally crescendoes into chaos. What really amplifies this feeling of inevitable danger is the atmosphere in the whole movie. Some hard to please movie goers may complain about its low budget feel, but having the movie in black and white is all you really need to give the film an ugly feeling of 'death in the air.' Lifeless just like the undead looking for its next meal.",Night of the Living Dead
308,Reef-Shark,Only Time the Living Dead were Actually Scary,10,31 October 2008,"In 1968 George A. Romero took the world by storm with an incredibly violent, low-budget, horror film that introduced what would grow to be the modern day interpretation of the living dead (referred to as zombies by most modern day moviegoers). These creatures are the reanimated corpses of the recently deceased, they shuffle, moan and eat the flesh of the living, and the only ways to kill them being incineration and a fatal blow to the head.How do these pitiful excuses for monsters bring in the scares within this low-budget exploitation film? I'd have to place my bet on the claustrophobic atmosphere Romero creates within the farmhouse, where ninety-five percent of the film takes place. In films such as Dawn, and Day of the Dead the characters had a lot more maneuverability. They could run, they could hide, and easily out maneuver these slow, clumsy creatures. Here, there is no room to move about, and you can feel that there truly is no way out, and no place to hide.The film starts as a brother and sister drive to apply the annual decoration to their father's grave. The two individuals are Barbra and Johnny, and as the two leave they are assaulted by a man. Barbra flees to a nearby farmhouse, and the story begins. Soon after she arrives she encounters a strong willed man by the name of Ben, who quickly establishes that Barbra is hysterical and must be taken care of. Taking responsibility for both their survival Ben soon boards up the doors and windows, preparing to sit the infestation out until help arrives.During the stay they discover some more survivors living in the house's cellar. There's the eager to help young man by the name of Tom, and his loyal girlfriend Judy, and then the paranoid Harry Cooper, his wife Helen, and their ill daughter Karen. Mister Cooper instantly protests against the command of Ben, saying that they all should retreat to the cellar, because there's only one way in and out of the cellar, as opposed to the house with its many doors and windows. Ben denies this, not wanting to be enclosed in a death trap without any means of escape if things were to go badly (which you know they will). In the end it seems only ironic as to how each character meets his or her fate.This film has rightfully earned its reputation as one of the best horror movies to date, and still beats out all of today's zombie films by a mile. Here the zombies really are scary, without resorting to being anything more than slow moving, clumsy beings (unlike the remake of Dawn of the Dead where they felt inclined to super power the creatures). Also, the setting is so normal it further increases the scare factor. How many people haven't been in houses like the one in this film? Imagine being trapped in one of these houses, surrounded by vicious flesh-eaters in the late hours of the night. This is where Night of the Living Dead succeeds where others of the genre have miserably fallen. If it wasn't for the original Night of the Living Dead, and Dawn of the Dead (both of which have been remade with a less positive response from critics and audiences alike) zombies would be some of the worst movie monsters ever conceived. This film innovated and created the concept of the living dead which have been embraced by mainstream audiences, and it is fitting that it is perhaps the ONLY film involving the creatures that has legitimately frightened me. Maybe it was watching it at night with the lights turned off, but I can say that few films have actually scared me when I watched it. With this film I was constantly holding my breath, and looking about the room nervously.The reason I was frightened (and surprised) by this film was due to its incredibly fast pacing, which is very similar to the way films are made today. This film just never has its dull moments (not to say I like all action, I was just surprised how quick it was). The plot is extraordinarily simple, and could have easily been covered in thirty minutes, but Romero was careful to grab the audience in the first attack scene, and keep their attention through means of suspense and violence.Now that brings us to the violence, and there is nothing that the undead are more associated with then excessive amounts of blood and gore. For the 1960s this film is incredibly violent, especially when it shows the undead feeding on the flesh of their victims. Being low-budget the victims are not seen being torn apart like they are in the sequels, but you still are given some disgusting shots of flesh from the bones, or fighting over intestines, which in some perverse way reminded me of people fighting over a chicken wing at a local KFC buffet. The images are just truly grotesque, maybe not to the avid, modern day gore lover, but to the common moviegoer it still holds up as being disturbing.This is the best film of the living dead sub-genre, followed closely by its sequel, Dawn of the Dead, and certainly holds up in all regards to the modern, brainless horror film. The film goes out to scare, and manages to pull it off, even to this day. With their decline as an actual icon of terror, at least we can still return to the gut wrenching human struggle, and terror of George A. Romero's definitive horror picture.5/5 stars; a classic that has endured the test of time with more strength, emotionally, and in the form of pure terror, than many films of the same era which possessed a larger budgets, certainly being on par with some of Hitchcock's greats.",Night of the Living Dead
309,Cicman69,Party line-still a classic,8,6 January 2002,"I notice that most of the comments for this film praise it as a classic. I must agree completely. Since the movie was filmed in PA, that knowledge gives it, for me anyway, an even greater sense of creepiness, because in PA it's possible to go from urban sprawl to rural isolation-like the farm house in the movie-in a matter of minutes and on many occasions I've seen farm houses similar to the one in the movie. My only problem with the film is minor:The female corpse upstairs. It seems to me it should have returned from the dead with the rest of the recently deceased. Granted she was badly multilated, but if you listen carefully during scenes with the newscaster, you'll hear of torsos and other body parts coming back to life. But that is my only real problem with the film. Other than that, this is a masterpiece. See it without delay.",Night of the Living Dead

311,bjhadse,"As Much a Classic as ""Casablanca"" or ""Gone with the Wind""",9,30 September 2011,"When Barbra (Judith O'Dea) and her brother Johnny (Russell Streiner) go to their father's grave in rural Pennsylvania to pay their respects, Barbra is attacked by a zombie. In the ensuing struggle, Johnny is killed (his head bashed against the corner of a tombstone) and Barbra is chased to a nearby farm house. There she takes refuge amongst other survivors: Ben (Duane Jones), Harry Cooper (Karl Hardman), his wife Hellen (Marilyn Eastman), their injured daughter Karen (Kyra Schon), Tom (Keith Wayne) and his girlfriend Judy (Judith Ridley). Deeply divided over the best course for survival, they must survive both the undead onslaught and their increasingly violent natures until a rescue party arrives.""Night of the Living Dead"" is a classic much in the same vein as ""Casablanca"" (1942): so often quoted and parodied that the film may at first seem like the cliché that its mimickers created. Romero completely revolutionized the horror genre with his radical re-imagining of the zombie. No longer the soulless victim-slave of a witch doctor (as in 1932's ""White Zombie"" or 1943's ""I Walked with a Zombie""), they are undead ghouls who without proper cause (later films will challenge the theory that radiation from Venus is the cause of the phenomenon) begin killing and consuming the living. Any recently dead person will become reanimated with murderous intent toward the living, regardless of the fact that they were once a family member or friend. Their slow, unrelenting gate gives them a sense of inevitability: you might kill or outrun one or two of them, but their swelling numbers will outlast and eventually overwhelm you.The film portrays the bleak realities of race relations in the late 1960's. Ben's plans are met by Harry's violent resistance, implicitly because he's black. Later, when Ben, as the sole survivor, finds the notably all-white rescue party, they kill him and burn him with the rest of the slain undead. It may have been an innocent mistake, but the image of an armed posse of white men killing an unarmed black man is nonetheless seared into the memory of the viewer, reminiscent of the South's violent resistance to the Civil Rights Movement's peaceful protests.Likewise, ""Night of the Living Dead"" also portrays the strained gender relations of the time. I won't say that the film is sexist (because I don't believe that to be the case); it does, however, portray a staunchly patriarchal world-view. Barbra, after viewing the death of her brother, essentially becomes a zombie herself. Clearly suffering from intense shock, she becomes practically comatose, incapable of assisting anybody in the slightest (and, more often than not, getting in the way). Harry presents himself as the tyrannical head of his family. He keeps his wife in the dark concerning the latest life-altering events (literally, she's kept in the basement while the best course of action is debated by the men upstairs) and even attempts to stretch his influence to the other women. Notably, he treats Barbra like a child that needs looking after and Judy like she's Tom's to order around.Like ""Nosferatu"" (1922), ""Night of the Living Dead"" is more unsettling and chilling than it is frightening (at least to the contemporary viewer). There are no ""jump out at you"" shocks or outright scares, but a slowly intensifying suspense that very much resembles the undead themselves. The scene in which the zombies get a hold of the incinerated Tom and Judy, savoring the chunks of their ripped-apart flesh, is easily the most unnerving of the film (and, perhaps, of the genre). Like Jacques Tourneur, Romero wields his films' dark atmosphere as a weapon, one infinitely more effective than simple shock-and-awe scare tactics.The only detriment to this film is the character of Barbra. I can understand wanting to show a ""shell-shocked"" victim in what is a clear parallel to the Vietnam War (essentially bringing the horrors of the war home to the American public), the end result is an absolute mess. Her every line infuriatingly fails at anything even closely resembling a realistic character. While the 1990 remake committed just as bad a mistake with their gross over-correction of her character (turning her into a caricature of Sarah Connor), Barbra is still sad excuse for a traumatized woman.This film is a must see for any of horror, especially fans of the zombie sub-genre. Likewise, those interested in the changing racial and family dynamics of the 1960's will find this an intensely symbolic film rich with coded power dynamics.",Night of the Living Dead

The chap that was killed at the beginning was left alone by the zombie that killed him. Why? Was the zombie not hungry? I fail to see why the zombies broke in and decided to attack at the last minute and why did they break off their attack too? It doesn't make sense. Instead of fooling around, why didn't Duane Jones pick off every single one with the gun instead of carrying it around like some sort of trophy. He could've killed every single one. of course as usual, it fails to explain how the dead could rise and live anyway. Why do they breathe? Why do their muscles work without the circulatory system providing them with oxygen. It never makes sense.

With excellent writing, a perfect atmosphere and beautiful black and white cinematography. Even now, despite the over-saturation of zombie films we have, nothing has been made which is quite like the progenitor (aside the 1990's remake). Its hopeless and desperate situation, its brief timespan (as the title suggests, only one night), and its shocking ending all remain mostly unique to this single film 46 years after its release. The film does show its age, and low budget at times. However this is only 2-3% of the time, the other 97-98% you are stuck wondering how so much timeless brilliance can be squeezed into a single (relatively short) horror film.

That being said, I must say I am a huge fan of this one. I first saw this movie upon its initial release and during a midnight Hallowe'en showing at our local theater. The place was packed full of teens just out of a football game, and in the first couple minutes they were all yelling and making fun of the opening. Then -- Wham! The first killing shocked the entire audience into silence, and kept them screaming in their seats throughout the remainder of the film. George Romero's lack of funds to make this a big budget film only served him well. It plays like a documentary, and that is what makes this film so wonderfully frightening. The dead come to life (never mind the explanation of how, as it doesn't really matter) and become ghouls preying upon the flesh of the living. Only a trauma to the head will stop their desire for human food. Commendable for allowing a black man to be the lead heroic character, and Duane Jones is perfect in his tragic role. A movie about survival, emotional bonding/dis-bonding, and human values. The gore is proper without being overdone. Tame by today's standards, and that's too bad.

316,callaway76,They're coming to get you Barbara,7,23 July 2003,"Horror movies are sworn to three principles: 1.) Our character(s) are constantly surrounded by imminent threat. 2.) Almost all characters (if not everyone) must die 3.) Explicit death sequences. This is what separates Horror from Suspense/Thriller/Mystery movies. In 1968, George Romero, through the endangered yet provocative element of black and white film making, managed to combine these three attributes brilliantly setting the standard for any future horror movie to follow. I still get chills every time I watch the opening sequence, in the cemetery, when the director himself repeats the lines, ""They're coming to get you Barbara!"" ""Look! Here comes one of them now!"" followed by S. William Hinzman's bone chilling performance revealing the capacity of the living dead. From there the movie rarely stops for breath as the day transcends to night. Our heroine finds her only salvation in a lone country house where she soon befriends a select congregation of survivors. Surrounded by these merciless savages they must find a way out together, if they don't kill each other first.This movie crosses many lines in a year where crossing lines was the 'IN' thing to do. The exceptional amount of violence and defamation of the dead still to this day would not receive less than an 'R' rating. Another bold move was casting an African-American for the lead role, for which Duane Jones delivers a powerful leader persona. This is the other truly virtuous quality of NOTLD, the acting. This quintisential ingredient is often diminished if not forgotten in today's horror flicks. The true terror arises in the audience when they begin to identify and place themselves in the characters' shoes. The acting in this movie is far above par considering its low budget. Within the struggle for safety from what lies outside a new threat arises from within the house allowing no safe territory. (Obvious inspirations for the situations in '28 Days Later'). The movie sub-plots a social commentary on survival and what measures man will take to maintain such.Bottom Line: One of the top three horror movies of all times. Eerie scenes of ill-determined zombies, well acted plots of desperation, and of course gore. You may never want to walk through a cemetery again.",Night of the Living Dead

Romero's debut film doesn't just kill off the sweet innocent teenagers (in the aforementioned most gruesome fashion) -- which would become a staple of horror, along with zombies themselves -- he kills off everyone. Even the film's brave hero, a black man with a shotgun (a subversive decision in itself for the 1960s) gets shot in the head by a pack of zombie-hunting white men and tossed on a bonfire to end the film (the ending is filmed in photographic stills, which creates a somehow more disturbing, documentary-like grisly realism conclusion to the events).What's truly scary about 'Night of the Living Dead' isn't the zombies, it is the behaviour of human beings: it doesn't matter what kind of monster or demon you survive a battle with, in the end it's the ugliness of human nature that is going to defeat you.

First and foremost, it's a horror movie that helped create the zombie sub genre. It shocked the entire nation when it was released in 1968. The movie was highly controversial, with it's direct references to the civil rights movement and, of course, the gore which led to it becoming the cult classic that it is today. When he is on, George Romero really knows how to deliver a great movie. This gets a very enthusiastic 9/10 and is worth owning even if you're not a fan of horror flicks. One of the best movies ever made.",Night of the Living Dead
321,retromaster2000,George A. Romero's Zombie Classic one of the best Horror Films ever made!,7,24 December 2006,"I saw this film on T.V. when I was little Sci-Fi Channel I believe it scared me. Zombies films have always scared me since that incident in the hospital. Now I am older I don't get scared anymore I grew out of it the last Horror Film that really scared the hell out of me was Lucio Fulci's ""The Gates Of Hell"" (1980) A.K.A. City Of The Living Dead. I saw that in 2004 or 2005. Night scared me it was a great film. I still really appreciate it now even though it doesn't scare me anymore. It is one of the genre that broke the gore barrier it is pretty gory even to today's standards. I think it's good that Duane Jones was the best at the part of the character Ben originally someone else was supposed to play Ben a white guy. Can't recall his name. I heard about it on The Audio Commentary of The Millennium Edition the second Audio Commentary with Russ Streiner & the rest. Duane is great in this. I just hate the ending. Why they shoot him it sucks. He should of yelled out to the Sheriff & the rest of the crew & they wouldn't have shot him. The movie is full of thrills & keeps u in suspense from beginning to end Harry Cooper played by Karl Hardman who also had a lot to do with the making of the film. His character was an idiot he got what he deserved when Ben fights him punching him in the face. Also when he eventually shoots him. I am all the way for Ben he was the best Character in the film. Bill Hinzman was the best Zombie too. The first scene in the cemetery was actually shot last & if u notice Bill's hair is long but then near the end when he gets into the house with the other zombies he has a crew cut. Something for fans to notice cool little thing. Anyway Monsterbash 2007 is coming up & Chilly Billy Cardille will be there also Bill Hinzman & Kyra Schon. I will be getting them to autograph my Night Of The Living Dead (1968) Millenniun Edition DVD Insert. 7 out of 10 this is a Classic!",Night of the Living Dead
322,beatnick49,The original and the best,9,14 February 2005,"This movie succeeds in many respects, that it is the prototype of modern zombies, and many movie situations. It's also good as to where the emphasis is (story and characters) and that it has substance.The emphasis isn't so much on the zombies but on the characters and how they deal with the zombies; the debate as to the best defence, the escape plan. The characters (aside from Harry Cooper) are sympathetic, Ben is just trying to keep the zombies out and figure an escape, Barbara is shocked and delirious, Tom and Judy want to stay together, Helen trusts the judgement of others and cares for Karen, and Karen is unwell. The movie is not boring either, it doesn't drag out, and long.Not only is it the beginning of the zombie genre as we know it, it's also appears to be the beginning of the concept of being besieged that make up many horrors and sci-fis. While there is a debate in the farmhouse, the zombies know what they want and they all want it. And while they aren't a team they do not fight amongst themselves. In modern movies where the protagonists are besieged, the enemy is intelligent, physically strong, fearless, stealthy (in some cases), unusual, works together, often has superior numbers, and has often never been fought before. A number of these factors are possessed by the zombies in this movie. The besieged protagonists in many movies have to deal with limited resources, frightened members, injured members, and an enemy from within. This concept has been passed on to numerous movies since (such as the other ""Dead"" movies, Aliens, Ghosts from Mars, and Dog Soldiers as well as many others), but none have really given the entertainment and substance that this has, with Aliens being the only exception. I cannot speak of the succeeding ""Dead"" movies as I have not yet seen them.This film also has substance (however even though most horror movies are predictable, plot less, and clichéd that is what quite often makes them my escapism; but this one is still superior); there is a plot, the story flows well, has structure, and there are no inconsistencies. It's also backed up with a social commentary, I am not saying a good movie needs to send a message, but it adds to the goodness of this film. It's a social comment on the late Vietnam War era; the establishment don't know what to do and humans are being made into killers (quite literally). And even if you disregard the social-commentary, it still makes good entertainment.The movie achieves everything above, without the use of stunts and over the top special effects.All in all, the result is a good movie, good characters, structure, and substance. One of the best horror movies ever. It has earned itself a 9/10. Romero and Russo do many proud, judging from the votes.",Night of the Living Dead
323,manisimmati,"The Perfect Zombie Flick: Bloody, Smart and Bold",10,29 July 2017,"Barbara and Johnny visit their father's grave somewhere in the American countryside. When they arrive at the spooky graveyard, Johnny teases his jumpy sister: ""They're coming to get you, Barbara."" But the joke is on him, because they are really coming to get Barbara. And Johnny, too. And the hole country for that matter. A mysterious epidemic causes the dead to rise from their graves and attack the living. One of those ghouls attacks Barbara. Johnny defends her, and Barbara flees in terror. She reaches a secluded farm house and meets other people who seek shelter. Can these strangers work together in order to survive? Or are they going to destroy each other, before the ghouls even reach them?""Night of the Living Dead"" is one of my favorite movies of all time. It certainly is the best horror movie I've ever seen. That being said, it's difficult to explain why I love it so much. It is a low budget flick. There are some glaring editing mistakes and the acting is subpar most of the time. But like no other movie out there, ""Night of the Living Dead"" is able to turn its trash atmosphere into pure art. It's such a gritty and dirty experience, you feel like you need a shower afterwards. There are two main reasons why this movie is so effective: the director George A. Romero and the subtext of the screenplay.Romero didn't have much to work with, but he made it count. The scene where Barbara explores the empty farm house is exquisite. The lighting is reminiscent of German Expressionism. The awry camera settings and the contrast between light and dark are great devices to elucidate Barbara's trauma. There is a scene where Romero pans over the barricaded interior of the farm house. The intersecting planks form an abstract pattern that is strangely unsettling. You'll soon realize that this movie might be cheap, but surprisingly artful as well.""Night of the Living Dead"" was a watershed for modern horror because it was insanely gruesome for the time: There are zombies hunting people and eating the flesh of their prey. But it's not the explicit gore that makes this movie so effective. The true horror stems from the way Romero depicts these acts of violence. They come across as surreal and deviant, like you're having a sick fever dream. The subtext of this movie is incredibly rich. The screenplay tackles many unwieldy political topics - war, racism and marriage are only a few of them. ""Night of the Living Dead"" is a relentless, apocalyptic nightmare that has nothing for the audience except unnerving pessimism. The ending of this movie might just be the best ending in movie history: It's poignant, courageous and subversive. ""Night of the Living Dead"" is an utterly unique, matchless horror movie. If you haven't seen it, watch it. Now. And if you already saw it, watch it again. Now.",Night of the Living Dead
324,AnDread_The_Blind,"Yeah, they're dead. They're all messed up.",10,3 August 2017,"This is my #1 favorite horror film of all time. It is the only movie to ever give me nightmares. I started getting them as a teenager, put into the same situation as the film – one among a small band of people trying to survive a zombie apocalypse, surrounded by an increasing number of the living dead.Aside from the nightmares, this is my #1 horror movie because it creates an atmosphere of absolute dread – something that I appreciate in a movie (thus my screen name AnDread). The protagonists face what seems to be a pretty much hopeless situation, surrounded by numerous antagonists who want to eat you, who can't be reasoned with, and who continue to grow in number. On top of that, they are faced with in-fighting and incompetence. Perhaps they could survive if they just learned to work together, rather than constantly argue with each other. But this is Romero's not-so-subtle point: compromise rather than dominance is the key to survival. He has said that he thought of the living dead as a revolution, a new (single- minded) generation cannibalizing the older, obsolete generation. Actually, I think of them more akin to a natural disaster – or Godzilla, a monster birthed from our own violent ways, a new creation bent on destroying everything old.The nihilistic ending still gives me chills – it's one of the bleakest movie endings ever. I don't want to spoil it. I'll just say that when I saw it for the first time as a teen, it hit me pretty hard. I had never seen any movie end like that.For such a low-budget film, Romero does a fantastic job using sound, lighting, practical effects, and performances to maximum advantage. The acting is excellent. Some may not be impressed with the way the characters are written, or the way they are portrayed. But while both are handled with a simplistic, at times seemingly melodramatic, approach, the writing is more layered than you might first think. And I think most people would agree that the performances are highly memorable. Duane Jones as Ben and Karl Hardman as Harry Cooper make this film work so well; seeing their increasing aggression and rivalry ratchets the tension to an almost unbearable degree. This dynamic is so complex that I see it a new way each time. While I've always identified with and rooted for Ben – quite a feat for an African American protagonist in 1968 – on recent viewings, I've come to realize that Ben isn't always that reasonable either. If he hadn't been so pushy and competitive with Cooper, maybe things could have turned out differently. Judith O'Dea as Barbara and Marilyn Eastman as Helen Cooper also deserve mention. Some people criticize O'Dea's performance as wooden or the way her character is written as sexist, because she's either hysterical or catatonic through much of the narrative. But I think plenty of people, men and women, would be like Barbara in a similarly horrifying situation. Although she has a minor role, Eastman as Helen is a great counterpoint to both Barbara and her husband, spitting sarcastic barbs at Harry and trying to become part of the larger group. I can't say that Keith Wayne as Tom and Judith Ridley as Judy add much, except as a counterpoint to the Coopers, a couple who tries to hang on to love during a crisis. Kyra Schon as Karen, the Coopers' daughter, George Kosana as Sheriff McClelland, and Russell Streiner as Johnny (who, according to IMDb, is uncredited for some reason), show just how memorable minor characters can be. Streiner and Kosana speak two of the most memorable lines in horror movie history – ""They're coming to get you, Barbara,"" and ""They're dead, they're all messed up."" And to many, Schon's big scene is one of the most disturbing scenes in all of horror cinema.The black and white cinematography also adds to the bleakness of the film; for me, the often washed-out look and dark lighting make the zombies more frightening than in any of the subsequent films, with skin tones of blues, greens, and grays, and bright red blood flowing. Something about watching the ghouls stumble around in the shadows, and blood pour out in dark swatches, adds a sinister air to them that doesn't quite translate to color, even in the more realistic and disgusting effects in later films.Many have already spoken eloquently about the film's social commentary and influence on later horror films, and culture generally. I'll just say that Romero and John Russo (who co-wrote the script) tapped into already existing horror elements and current social anxieties around civil unrest, clashes with authorities, and Vietnam, by creating a new genre, the flesh-eating zombie film (as opposed to the Voodoo zombie), and virtually helping to usher in a new horror aesthetic – bleaker, gorier, and more focused on gritty realism than stylized aesthetics.",Night of the Living Dead
325,bubbathom,OK. Pretty good for 1968,6,9 July 2008,"This movie was pretty good for a movie made 40 years ago. There were some unrealistic parts, but it was one of the first scary movies ever in my opinion. It was actually pretty scary...Not as scary as some later movies like The Shining, Halloween, Nightmare on Elm Street, so on.....I really only liked Duane Jones' acting as the main character. He was pretty believable, and kind of likable. I didn't really like the rest of the actors, but it didn't matter too much to me.I didn't really like the ending, it was kind of dumb and weird.

326,claptonisgod53,Influence; Atmospehre; Romero,9,16 September 2008,"Influence; Atmospehre; Romero. Three things required to make an amazing film. Night of the Living Dead is without a doubt the first stereotypical zombie film which would influence so many films to come after it. Night of the Living Dead was an extremely controversial film that was put down by critics, but looked at very fondly as a cult classic, and a fantastic piece of violent social commentary. The social commentary in this film is very present, and can be looked at differently by different people.Night Of The Living Dead is actually a basic 50s science fiction movie in the style of The Last Man On Earth (1963) Starring Vincent Price. Many look past the fact that Night of the Living Dead is based on the same novel as The Last Man On Earth; ""I Am Legend"", which was recently adapted again into another movie of the same name. Night of the Living Dead balanced the 50s sci-fi theme along with modern (for the time) violence. The violence may look cheesy or tame compared to movies to come out half a decade later, but is still disturbing looking at the way this film is shot. Night of the Living Dead uses the Black and White format better than any other film I have ever seen. The black and white format adds a dark, grainy look to the film which adds a good, unsettling feeling. In my view, Night of the Living Dead may not be the goriest zombie film ever made, but is still the scariest. The dark atmosphere done by director George A. Romero is excellent, and beats anything else done in the genre. The cast is also outstanding. The movie provides some very good performances all around. The character chemistry is outstanding. A large part of the movie is simply character arguments, yet that is the fun of this film. The fun in this film comes from the great directing, which makes the viewer feel like they are in the arguments themselves. The realism of this film is almost frightening in itself. I seen this movie before having any knowledge that it was a classic, and boy was I impressed.Night of the Living Dead has done many things. It lit the match and set the fire for the zombie genre, it set plenty of interesting ground rules, established Romero as a great director, and started off one of the great trilogys of all time. Night of the Living Dead will impress any horror fan looking for a fright fest, rather than a gorefest. Night of the Living Dead may be violently tame compared to the sequels, but contains some very dark and disturbing atmospehre. The down beat ending is also unforgettable.",Night of the Living Dead
327,Was-it-All-a-Dream,Night of the Living Dead (1968),6,30 April 2009,"Like everyone else reviewing this film, I'm a horror fan. Hopefully, they're all horror fans too. I think I have good taste and know a good horror movie when I see it. Night of the Living Dead is considered one of the greatest and most important horror films of all time. It's impossible to ignore that and the fact that the film's director, George A. Romero, gets a lot of attention because of it. With the current state of the genre, tastes and styles continuing to change so much and so fast, a lot of the attention on Romero is negative. Many young horror fans are going back to see his earlier films and wondering why they are, and he is, so famous. I consider Romero to be a horror director with a very inconsistent record of hits and misses. He's mostly known for his ""Dead"" series of zombie films, but it's also worth mentioning that he has a lot of military plots in his films. In Night, you don't really see the military, rather you see an army on TV, comprised of gun-carrying U.S. citizens.The 1960's were a decade where a great deal of Hollywood films went into color. While Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 hit Psycho was in black and white, 1961's Breakfast at Tiffany's was in color. And the trend went back and forth again, until into the 1970's, where almost no films at all were released in black and white (except for David Lynch's Eraserhead). For the purpose of mood, most 60's horror films remained in black and white (The Haunting, Repulsion, Village of the Damned, Black Sunday, Spider Baby, The Innocents, Carnival of Souls). About black and white itself, it's often a very boring way to watch films. But it's also quite gritty. And used by certain filmmakers to achieve a realistic tone to their films' subject matter. Especially in the 60's. Most of Night of the Living Dead certainly feels realistic. For its' time, at least. It seems to be a movie about a group of people trapped inside a fairly enclosed space, with tensions mounting, then things reach a boiling point and their shelter starts to feel like a tomb.Night of the Living Dead features zombies and raises the question of where they come from without doing much to answer it. That's because we follow the characters as they enter the farmhouse and they wait for news or for others to come to their rescue. So, realistically, were we in the same position as any one of the characters, we would know only what the TV and radio were telling us. There were zombie films made before Night- White Zombie and Plague of the Zombies, as well as potentially, any film featuring The Mummy. And Frankenstein, as well, is a re-animated corpse. But while those were relegated to being cult films and failed to break through into the American mainstream, Night did in fact make a big impact on American filmgoers. I believe it may have first cracked the drive-ins. And, if there were grindhouse theaters at that time, this probably played quite a few of those. With a film like this, you really have to consider and know its' history before passing judgment on it. Also, when you do pass judgment, you have to make it personally relevant.Night has - and I know I'm not alone in seeing it this way - not aged well. It remains what it was in the 60's and styles in the genre changed so fast, the film's approach as horror was near completely obsolete by the arrival of Wes Craven's shocking and much less restrained debut, The Last House on the Left, a mere 4 years later. Though 1974's The Texas Chainsaw Massacre was something of a return to Night's much less overt and in-your-face violence, Hollywood's approach to horror was also becoming more explicit, as early as 1973's The Exorcist, one of the bloodiest and most graphic horror films of its day. But even in the case of Chainsaw, the message was clear- black and white was being permanently retired by cutting edge, amateur film directors getting their start in the horror genre. Which is both a good thing and a bad thing for Night. The film became an instant classic. But it also, I think, failed to keep its' impact into the mid-1970's and the rapidly changing styles.My personal feeling on the film is that it is mostly boring. As its' focus is more on human-created tensions, I admire Romero and the fact that Night's been mostly successful (as the IMDb's rating can attest to) with film fans. But, this film is too realistic to be scary. I find films scarier when they are more like a nightmare, even surreal, but with elements of reality. Depending on the concept, horror films that concentrate more on characterization often lack a true sense of the chaotic and irrational quality of a person's worst nightmare. In a situation like this, where people are upsetting you and challenging everything you say and do, I feel more apt to be angry than scared. However, the film does have a few standout sequences that are an important signature to any good horror movie. One is a death scene involving a gardening spade. Another is a montage of zombies eating the internal organs of their victims. And the last is a scene of one of the main characters, Barbra, having a dissociative fugue while walking through the empty farmhouse (a moment that feels torn right out of Carnival of Souls, which Romero admits was an influence on Night).",Night of the Living Dead
328,sebbezw,"38 years, and still scaring the crap out of people!",10,12 September 2006,"Zombie movies is something I never quite understand. Some movies (like Zombie Flesh Eaters and House of the Dead) is terribly ridiculous and filled with (awkward, not charming) clichés, but then again we have movies like this one who is terrifying, thrilling, scary, intelligent and just great! This may not be timeless for everyone, since many people who see it today may think it's past crap, but if you switch on your brain (which you mostly often don't, when we come to horror) you'll just have to love it. It's obvious what a genius George A. Romero is.

It is more likely the fact of the of the suspense and the question ""What would you do if you were the victim in that situation?"" Most importantly it's about thanking old movies like The Night Of The Living Dead and their creators George Ramaria for bringing a new form of horror to life. The story of it is nothing special but it doesn't need to be. It had plenty of action and scary zombies to keep the person glued to watching it. A lot of the stuff in the movie was never seen before back in the 60's in the form it was given, and making a movie that people aren't familiar with is brilliant.

330,hypostylin,"Exceptional, visceral film-making.",10,22 January 2008,"Night of the Living Dead is an uncompromising, indelible masterpiece that pulls no punches despite its forty-year vintage. The film wins in all aspects of film-making, including writing, pacing, and cinematography -- not to mention assembling a terrifyingly ferocious cast of the undead.The film's biggest strength is its bleak, desperate atmosphere, which is heightened by stark black and white photography, high-contrast lighting, and mono sound. It suspends many moments of unmitigated terror within the same feeling of morbid isolation one can find in Tobe Hooper's original Texas Chain Saw Massacre (but, of course, earns extra kudos for doing it first).Romero approaches the story with a steady hand and gives taut direction. The proceedings are supported by an engaging cast, especially leads Duane Jones and Judith O'Dea. Jones -- the first African-American lead in a horror film -- is wonderful as the handsome, assured, and no-nonsense hero, while O'Dea gives a pensive and uniquely off-kilter performance. Captivating from its riveting beginning to its downbeat conclusion, Night of the Living Dead stands as a pivotal entry in the zombie subgenre.",Night of the Living Dead
331,enjoyuk,OK idea.. Poorly done,6,24 October 1999,"Wow, I thought when I read about how the producers were going to use actors from the original and make them up to look thirty years younger and add new material to this classic film. I just watched the finished product, and I must say it was shoddy to say the least.For Starters, Bill Hinzman looks nothing like he did thirty years ago, I couldnt believe how the producers on the DVD version were crowing on about how he looks exactly the same and the new footage blends seamlessly in.  Mr. Hinzman looks twice the man he was in '68 and his makeup was awful.  There were a few good points, the picture was excellent, the music was good, and some of the new zombie sequences were quite well done. 
I really thought that the new beginning and ending were really poor and did not look very authentic,  the Reverend was a dreadful character and added nothing whatsoever to the story or movie.  Im all for remastering classics, but cutting scenes out to be replaced with completely new ones is a absolute mistake every time.The one saving grace of this DVD was that the original, remastered version is also on the disc, and it has never looked better. Nice one Anchor Bay!",Night of the Living Dead
332,ashturner-79373,"A progressive, well-acted and landmark horror movie.",8,27 March 2019,"A fairly progressive movie for the 1960s in which the lead is a black man - not even by design, but simply because he was the best actor for the job. It shows, because Duane Jones is great in this film, as are most of the other cast, although Judith O'Dea is understandably limited by the hysterical and useless character she's playing. The dialogue is also well-written and snappy, and feels like real people talking.The zombies are the most obvious aspect of the film, but really they themselves are the weakest part of it. It's more interesting to see people actually confused about what's going on (in a world yet to be saturated by zombies in media), and it's eerie to hear people on the radio and TV call the zombies ""ghouls"", describe them as murdering people, and speculate that they were mutated by radiation from a NASA probe. Ultimately, the drama and tension between the humans trapped in the house is the strongest aspect of the film, where people's differing reactions are both showcased and put to the test.The score isn't great, but it does the job of providing a fairly spooky (though sometimes kind of melodramatic) atmosphere. I like the often simplistic photography, and good use is made of claustrophobic angles and lighting during some scenes in the gothic house. It also looks very nice in colour.Something George Romero would carry forward from this movie was the theme of an old society with outdated norms being replaced by something terrifying and new - in this case, a new breed of people who eat the old breed. Even some of the talk about traditions surrounding death (Johnny complaining about being obligated to visit his father's grave, an expert on TV insisting that people quickly burn the deceased and not dwell on funeral rites) serves as a cynical jab at people's old ways. Like ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" (1974) after it, it uses radio and TV-style reports to lampoon contemporary media, wars and politics.Of course it's outdated in ways of its own, but ""Night of the Living Dead"" is way ahead of its time, both unknowingly (in the implications of its sudden, shocking ending) and knowingly.8/10.",Night of the Living Dead

I watch it at least once or twice a year, and continue to enjoy it very much, year after year. Horror films so often disappoint me and so often fail to live up to their potential; Night of the Living Dead never does. I suppose what most makes this movie work as well as it does is the nightmarish atmosphere which George Romero and company managed to create. The tension inside the farm house feels so real that we, the viewers, are sucked right in. As the undead attacking the house multiply, and as the humans inside suffer various mishaps and are, ultimately, unable to pull together so as to survive, we come to share in their despair. As many times as I've seen this, the final scenes always manages to bring me down. And yet, the ending is so perfect, in that it brings the film's bleak tone to full circle.I was fortunate enough to have seen this great movie when it first came out, and on a drive-in movie screen, no less.

The hero in this movie is a black man and back in the 60s that is a rare thing. He is the most intelligent person and tries to save everyone else. Supposedly the makers of this film meant for a deeper plot than zombies. I think that is easy to see. I strongly recommend this film for everyone.

I refer to the little girl (Karen) who murders her mother with a trowel for some reason, and then eats her annoying father.Oh, and Barbara is so bloody irritating! I'd have killed her five minutes in to be honest.Overall it looks and feels like a student movie, which used the full $115,000 it cost to make. Sorry George.",Night of the Living Dead
340,fauxface,classic,5,16 December 2009,"its hard to feel afraid of classic horror films because of modern society where everyone is so desensitized, but i could watch a clip of zombies having a tea party and still be uncomfortable. Night of the Living Dead still provides that sense of discomfort, but i was too distracted by how weak Barbra was portrayed. her character annoyed me. i get it, she was in shock and i'd probably be really upset too if i saw a dead guy kill my brother (if i had one), but im under the impression that most people would fight to stay alive and be alert in a situation like this. she couldn't even handle simple instructions or questions. Harry also bothered me... i cant understand how people can be so selfish and cowardly. i would understand if he was thinking of his family, but he was only thinking of himself and his own safety. and really, the risk was minimal because clearly the living were more adept than the zombies. the nature of the characters, even though i disliked them, enhances the movie because throughout the film, there was always something that was less than optimal if one was under attack by zombies.",Night of the Living Dead

342,lucky_dice_mgt,Pure horror perfection,9,2 February 2007,"Scary, clever, innovative, strong acting, gore, great camera-work, moody atmosphere, crisp black and white photography and perhaps the most overlooked aspect of this film is the Incredible soundtrack. Many things are overlooked in this film because it has so much to offer. It was groundbreaking in many ways one of which it allowed a black man to be viewed as the hero and play the lead role. This was very cuting edge and rare back in the 60s. But there's a irony in the role he plays, at first glance he seems to be the hero but in reality , it is because of him that everyone dies in the house because he convinced everyone else that it was safer to stay out of the basement. Some of the camera-work and lighting in this film is nothing short of genius and it proves that often when a producer has a low budget, their originality and though process of filming a movie goes into overdrive. Night of the Living Dead and Curse of Frankenstein will always be my top 2 horror films of all time because they are : scary, intelligent, thought provoking and have meaningful dialog, conflict and characters that the viewer will either despise or love. I have found with both of the fore-mentioned films, they only get better with repeated viewings and the viewer learns more and more with those viewings as long as they play close attention and look for other aspects of the film which may be hidden on the 1st viewing.",Night of the Living Dead
343,Blitz-5,Easily the greatest horror flick of all time...,10,22 January 1999,I saw this movie when I was 8 years old. I had seen Dawn of the Dead earlier that week and couldn't wait to see the original NOLD. This movie stands as testimony that George A. Romero is one of the greatest directors and cinematographers of our times. Kudos to everyone who participated in creating this movie! a perfect 10! BUY IT!,Night of the Living Dead
344,tomjeffrey2001,The Standard By Which All Zombie Movies Must Be Measured,10,9 August 2009,"I first saw this movie in a drive-in theater the year it was first released and long before it became a well-known cult classic. As I recall, it was the third movie in a triple bill. I had no idea of what I had gotten myself into! There I was alone in my car and, ten minutes into the movie, scared sh--less! I had never seen a horror movie like this one before, and I had seen hundreds. Forty years later, ""Night of the Living Dead"" has not lost its power to chill.The plot by now is too familiar to need retelling. But for those who have been living on another planet, I'll briefly explain. A group of people are holed up in a farmhouse, with a growing army of the undead outside and trying to get in. Instead of joining together to fight the zombies, they fight among themselves about strategy. The obnoxious white guy wants everyone to go down into the cellar. The black guy who is the main protagonist (a rarity in those days) says that would be suicide and wants everyone to remain upstairs. ""United we stand, divided we fall"" as the saying goes. And partly because of the bickering, the zombies end up invading the house.Ironically, the obnoxious white guy turns out to have been right all along. Because the sole survivor, the black guy who wanted everyone to remain upstairs, ends up saving himself by locking himself in the cellar. The rescuers arrive the next day, mistake the survivor for a zombie, shoot him, and throw his body on the fire along with all the others.This is the movie that put George Romero on the map and set the standard by which all future zombie movies must be measured. Its influence on the genre cannot be overstated. Romero would go on to make a sequel, ""Dawn of the Dead"" that in my opinion is even better than the original, as well as several others not quite up to the caliber of the first two.This is one helluva scary movie and a must-see for any horror-movie fan.",Night of the Living Dead

Black & White adds that creepy feel to the film, and the plot is simple but yet you find yourself drawn into the film praying that some of them get out alive. Also the mood in the house between the characters is extremely interesting, cause let's face it none of us know how we would act if we were in the same situation. I do have to add one more thing, I think what makes this movie stand up above the rest is the fact that all the characters trapped in the house do not survive, which is not known in the world of horror movies. I will say one sad fact is that there is alot of people out there that have seen the remake before the original.",Night of the Living Dead

Why a religious angle?  Where did this come from?  Sounds to me like the producers felt they needed to address religion specifically and rather than coming up with something original, say another movie, they felt they should just take something easily marketable(I don't think any fan of the series and genre wasn't excited about new scenes) and insert their ""point"" there.  It's hard to totally destroy this film, so I could never say it's awful, but the new ending and angle just cheapen the whole experience.  So, next time I suggest just making another movie(which any Romero fan would LOVE to happen) if the producers wish to make a point instead of trying to pass it off on something already established as a great piece of film.",Night of the Living Dead

351,aaronlbacks,The Grandfather of Horror,6,27 December 2017,"Compared to most horror films these days, Night of the Living Dead is quite primeval. But that's not to say that it is bad - Primitive Technology on YouTube has shown me time and time again that early man was brilliant. And in a way it was refreshing to take a break from overdone gore and overacting. Well, overacting is still here. The plot is pretty simple by today's standards too. A couple of people, led by a Mr. Ben (Duane Jones) attempt to survive against a wave of zombies while trying hard not to attack each other first. And more than 90% of the movie takes place inside the same house which they barricade and raid for supplies. As far as the simple plot goes, I feel they do it justice, and it is supplemented by the interesting to watch power struggle between Ben and Mr. Cooper (Karl Hardman) and the racial undertones that the movie infers. But aside from the inherent fun this movie offers, about halfway through, the movie becomes a little repetitive. Even though new characters are introduced, the tone feels quite samey for the entire middle leg. It's not until the run where Tom (Keith Wayne), Judy (Judith Ridley), and Ben run out where things get moving again. Perhaps I am just accustomed to today's thrillers which keep up at a breakneck pace for the entire runtime, but it felt not too much was happening during that period. Overall, I think it a successful and worthy grandfather of modern horror.",Night of the Living Dead

A few people hold up in a farmhouse and try to fight off the incoming zombies.Review: This is the first real zombie movie made. It started off a new genre and inspired many follow-ups. The script and directing is good, so is the editing. One has to wonder how much Romero really contributed to this film, as all the movies he made after this were crap. Probably John Russo had more to do with it than Romero. Acting is decent enough, typical for the early 60s. The whole movie is great, seeing a zombie apocalypse in the America of the 60s really is fun. Special effects are good. A must-see for any zombie fan!

The movie which would have seemed terrifying for it's time with the mere mention of people eating flesh is not so much dated as just tame by today's standards. It's reliance on pace, characters and mood rather then effects is one of the movies strong points which makes it as entertaining and relevant today as the day it was released and the ending has yet to be matched in any of the sequels or remakes. featured on Emerald Reprobates pod-cast episode 61",Night of the Living Dead

355,eer85,The first masterpiece in a trilogy of masterpieces,10,16 November 2004,"What else can be said on the first example of modern horror movie (with PSYCHO)? The idea is simple but powerful: a group of people find themselves trapped in a farmhouse as prey for living dead that rise from the grave with no apparent reason. They should cooperate, but they don't and this will be their condemn. I don't know why I haven't read yet a review or an article on this movie where somebody talk about the three units of the tragedy by Aristotele, since they are well respected. The same, actually, can be said about THE EVIL DEAD and some others, since every low- budget genre movie revolves about the same place and time. I think this is a consideration that they can do only with totally respected auteur as Kubrick: no matter if SHINING is also a horror movie or that NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD is a work of art (yes: art). Romero's first movie, in some people's opinion, is still a dirty drive-in low budget flick which has become a classic only for dumbs. Instead is a great horror movie and even contains a germ (since Romero was young at that time) of social commentary and satire, which is not bad for a so - called drive-in flick. I don't actually need a social metaphor or similar to enjoy and love a movie, but if this element is present, I must mention it among the virtues of the flick. I could go on for ages, but it would be useless: the movie doesn't need to be defended. It can do everything on its own. You just have to watch it.",Night of the Living Dead

The story itself is fairly light, but remains the creepiest of the lot. Given, it's actors are mostly horrible, Ben being the noticeable exception, and one of the reasons the movie is so watchable... Also, due to it having such an ambiguous premise, many still wonder how and why the dead came to rise and feast upon the living - it poses many questions... Answers few.Indeed, every time I watch it, I come to a different conclusion as to what caused it...This movie ages very well, and holds its own to today's low budget horror movies. Sure, as the budgets have increased, and the technology has, it's been easier to create better movies... BUT, more than thirty years on, and this movie is still standing head and shoulders above most. I put it down to Johnny (""They're coming to get you Barbara!"") and the zombie from the cemetery - that guy is particularly creepy.I'm showing this to my kids on their fifth birthday. It's a good movie to use to keep them in line until they're ready to be kicked out of home - just threaten them with it - if they decide to wander the streets at night or disobey you, zombies might eat them or turn their car over and chase them for miles...10 out of 10. A classic. Get it, watch it, love it. If you don't, too bad. *** NOTE *** Don't watch the 25th anniversary edition, however, as it ruins the musical score and adds unnecessary and stupid scenes, and a dumb ending that ruins the movie.

I like this movie just for its simplicity. People are here, they are out there, they have to get there, how do you get there? Simple, classic.

The movie starts with a woman and her brother in a cemetery, visiting their dead mother, when they are attacked by a zombie right off the bat. No (explicit)ing around with useless plot points, just BOOM, zombies! So she runs off and is attacked by more zombies. She hides in a farmhouse, and kills a zombie, then a guy comes, and drives a crowbar through the skull of a zombie.

Romero made me feel like the zombies outside weren't the only monsters, but also the ongoing power struggle between Ben and Cooper. Romero expresses his distaste of black oppression through this film by making Ben the leader of the house, and showing that Cooper was wrong about Ben just like America was wrong about the African Americans.

The dialogue isn't gripping, the acting is no better than the zombies, and the plot is somewhat predictable, admittedly with the advantage of having seen films that are descendants of this one.But even so, the best part of this film is still the plot - the concept of a group of survivors fighting off an evil menace surrounding them. However that is better done in Aliens, Predator, or The Thing. In terms of zombie films, Dawn of the Dead and Braindead are much better. Maybe it's because they use satire - can you make a serious horror film where the enemy is a group of slow-moving retarded undead people? NB.

The ""new"" scenes do NOT really match the rest of the movie - they include new characters that no fan of this movie could possibly care about (including the bald priest with a 1990's goatee (even though it's supposed to still be 1968!) and a few people who are burying a corpse (I believe played by an actor who portrayed the first zombie or ""ghoul"" in the original film).

I could not wait to discover what would happen next, in an almost Hitchcockian fashion, and engrossed once the action got going.I usually expect influential films to be somewhat passe, with the themes, shots and ambience stolen by other directors.

A few months ago I was fortunate enough to see Peter Jackson's hilarious ""Braindead"", and nothing could be gorier than THAT! So I finally saw ""Night of the Living Dead.""  And it scared me half to death. Yes, I know it was made for a $1.95, the editing is choppy, at times they shoot night scenes during the day--but that doesn't MATTER.  It is obviously the touchstone for many modern (and far less frightening) films.  The scenes where the zombies were eating the burnt bodies of the couple in the truck was truly disgusting and scary.  And how great to have an intelligent African-American leading man, even with the downbeat ending.  A great, great film, and I'm just sorry I paid attention to ""Reader's Digest.""  But what the hell, it was in my grandmother's bathroom.",Night of the Living Dead
375,ww_sketcher,A True Horror Classic that changed all Horror films that followed it,10,14 February 2005,"Night of the Living Dead is a true classic and without a doubt Romero's best and most influential film.Of course, being simply influential alone would not simply allow this movie to get a full-fledged star rating if it didn't pull through with it some quality at all, which it does in spades. In Night of the Living Dead, there is good pacing, surprisingly good acting from a list of no-name actors, and the most important part that sticks with the film to this day, the sense of dread in the film. In this movie to this day you get that feeling of hopelessness, people get attacked for no reason and nothing can save them. Whether it's family-togetherness, love between a couple, or even the law-enforcers at the end, this was all tapping into the uncertainty level people were having at the time and still today it has meaning. Topping this off with Romero's (at the time) large use of gore adds to the overall uneasiness of the film. Finally at the film's current times, there is a great subtle final nail in the coffin attack with the sad fate of the character Ben. Being the only sole voice of reason is shot, which, at the time of filming brought harsh realities of such other African-American leaders who were brought down unfairly such as Malcolm X or Martin Luther King, even if this wasn't the original idea Romero had.Overall, no matter how cheesy some of this movie make look to modern eyes, Night of the Living Dead is a classic for offering horror without a shred of hope, forever influencing every horror movie in it's wake.",Night of the Living Dead
376,Our_Feature_Presentation,Night of the Living Dead is a true classic!,9,5 November 2013,"George A George A. Romero's Night of the Living Dead! This movie is what could be considered the bridge between the classic horror movies and the more blood soaked modern movies; for the reasons that it's in black and white and still keeps the classic tone but at the same time adds more violence, a focus on the humans and of course the horror craze that is: The Zombie. Yes that's right for those of you that don't know, Night of the Living Dead is considered to have created the modern zombie. This movie completely shocked audiences at the time, its was unlike anything they've ever seen! Now for the review, the movie starts in a graveyard, one of the main staples of horror films, your given very little set up and then BAM! Zombies attack. Its great because it catches you off guard much like the characters in the film. Then really quickly your projected into a lone house on the plains, this is were the movie turns from good to downright masterpiece. This is when more and more characters start to be revealed, the writing of these characters is just great, sounds very much like real people talking/arguing. The movie is also a good character study showing how people's true selves are shown in a time of complete chaos. My favorite of the characters being Ben mainly because he's the only person who looks at reason. The zombies (although never called zombies) are the monsters of this movie, now compared to today's zombie they're very very different, this also goes back to the movies violence at the time it was just unrelentingly gory, now though it's very tame. Many of the scenes in this movie are iconic, from zombies just moping around to ""They're coming to get you Barbra"". Two more things I'm going to talk about, first being the ending. Night of the Living Dead's ending is one of the greatest movie shockers of all time, I'm not going to spoil it but it's a brilliant twist. And the final thing I'll talk about is : the movie's impact. The movie was incredibly influential again with the violence but also that it dealt with a big issue at the time, Civil Rights. The main character of this movie was a black man back in 1968 that was unheard of, but George A. Romero went ahead and made it happen. In the end Night of the Living Dead is as of now the best movie I have reviewed for The Movie Guy's Halloween Horror Movie Spectacular 2013 with it being a excellent movie with great witting, good horror and shocks, Night of the Living Dead gets a 9.6 out of 10. Pretty good for a cheap little public domain movie, and actually because its public domain you can watch it right now for free legally.

377,triton_ogletree,"""Nothing is scarier than the neighbors."" - George A. Romero",9,28 July 2019,"Right off the bat, I am going to tell you that Night of the Living Dead is a ""B movie"" which gained fame and infamy from being released through grindhouse cinemas in Pittsburgh. It was an ambitious effort project from new film maker, George A. Romero. The film had virtually no budget. The investors of the film are actually the extras and the main actors are all friends of Romero's. It's that low budget. There's also a few editing issues but keep in mind how old and cheap this movie is. It wasn't supposed to be Citizen Kane.All that said...This movie is a masterpiece! There's a reason it is still talked about today and has spawned sequels, ripoffs, spinoffs, reboots, TV series, video games and an entire mythology revolving around the undead (which the United States military has reportedly developed a plan for.)The quality of the film is part of its charm. The film is in black and white, is highly contrast (in more ways than one) and visually gritty. Romero used these low budget downfalls to his advantage, adding to the intensity and disturbing nature of the film. He also capitalized on the trend of movie violence and sensationalism at the time. It makes the movie creepy to this day.The acting is mostly good. There's some over acting and a few bits of mediocre dialogue but again, this wasn't supposed to be a good movie. It was supposed to be trash! It failed in being the garbage film to scare up a few bucks for the ""real movie's"" funding...because it was incredibly successful. In fact, it was one of the (if not the) most successful films until The Blair Witch Project came along 30 years later. By the way, that's ""Chilly Willy"" Cardilly as the news anchor interviewing the local sheriff. Cardilly was a regional ""late night thriller movie"" TV personality.The three things that sell this film are the cinematography, the message and the story. The story revolves around a group of people who seek refuge in a farm house from the dead who are coming back to life and attacking the living. No spoilers here, it gets to the point quickly. It succeeds in giving off a feeling of isolation and impending doom. The true intensity of the film doesn't come from the struggle to ward off the dead but from the power struggle that occurs within the house. The film succeeds in rising tension and keeping you riveted to the screen despite, again, being a throw away film. The interactions between characters may not be the best acted but you can relate to the characters and feel for them, seeing all viewpoints. It will genuinely hook you.The message of the film is simply just human nature. What will you do when death approaches you and everyone you know? Will you eat each other, step up and be a hero or shrink into a corner and cry? This film also makes a statement about humanity in the 1960's and in the end, it will make you feel uncomfortable...which is the point.The last great thing about this movie is the cinematography. Romero used Dutch camera angles and harsh lighting to create a creepy nightmarish visual that will probably make you uneasy today in the era of desensitization. All of these amazing aspects of this film make for a ""crappy"" movie that is exciting, grotesque, thought provoking and at the bare minimum entertaining.I watched this movie when I was home alone and in the dark on Halloween night at the age of 9 and yes, it scared me to death! It changed my world for various reasons. I bought it the next day, watched repeatedly and cut my childhood short in favor of watching more adult films. It may no longer scare you but you won't be able to look away. Night of the Living Dead is an accidental masterpiece of horror cinema. Watch it in the dark and remember...""They're coming to get you Barbara.""",Night of the Living Dead

I highly recommend it. Unfortunately, as you might expect, the special effects and such are pretty bad, as the movie is so old. Nonetheless, I still say it is a must-see. Special effects aren't all there is to a good movie, after all. There are many great things about this movie, and many of the underlying concepts are great, and the movie came at an interesting point in history for these to be given to the public, in my opinion. Even if you don't like horror films, zombies, or any of the other things you'd expect to see in a movie like this, you should see it just for its more or less classic elements, such as the aforementioned underlying concepts.I can't wait to see the 90's remake.",Night of the Living Dead

They get up and kill the people they kill get up and kill! George Romero has managed to create the most horrific vision of the end of the world. And it all starts here, in a small house in the countryside, where seven people try to survive the night. One of the greatest things Romero has done is not only document the people inside the house, but also show radio and television broadcasts covering the phenomenon. The use of the media is a shocking testament to the true magnitude of these events.

It's not the very first zombie movie of course, but it probably is the first ""modern"" zombie movie. It's kind of the grand-daddy of the modern flesh eating zombie types. Some of the zombie movies that came after this one became a bit corny or comedic. This movie takes things very seriously. There are some obvious things that make this movie work so well for me. It's well acted, excellently paced, and scary. However it's the less obvious things that make this movie classic material. First, Night Of The Living Dead is about rampaging zombies but, it is also about human nature, human interaction, and ultimately human failing. The troubles that the main human characters get into is as much the result of there own failings as people as it is the fault of the zombies. The movie is disturbing to me because I have a almost constant feeling of hopelessness and dread. It's not a happy movie but, it's a great movie and very effective!!

I quickly scan the back of the case and see that it's the re-released edition, but, hey, I figure, it's probably just digitally remastered.  So, I buy it, and I take it home, and as I am about to watch it, I see a little box of text on the back of the video that I hadn't bothered to read before.  And, of course, this text is talking about how Russo et al have gone back and, uh oh, filmed and added ""over 15 minutes of NEW footage?!"".  WITHOUT THE HELP OF GEORGE ROMERO!!!??  I think I must have read that piece of text about 12 times, hoping that I was misreading it and they had just gone back and added deleted scenes from the original filming, or at least FOR THE LOVE OF GOD had Romero help out.  My heart dropped through the floor, and lower still when I saw that they had changed the opening scene! THE OPENING SCENE!  HAVE these people no souls!  Or perhaps no brains.  I suffered through the boring and unnecessary new footage and decided to give this new version a chance.  But I just couldn't, what with the glaring anachronisms (the goateed preacher, the not really very sixties sounding dialogue, etc.) and the fact that the preacher character bore an uncanny resemblance to Weird Al Yankovic.

389,nickmrkonja,There aren't enough stars in the sky to give this film.,10,3 December 2020,"Normal people remember their first kiss, first girlfriend, first job, first car... I remember my first horror movie.I was 6 years old and, most people over 30 in Pittsburgh where I live owned a copy of Night of the Living Dead on VHS. So naturally, my step father did as well. I watched it, and being so young that I wasn't able to appreciate things like story and direction, I didn't take it very seriously and laughed at the perceived ""lack of horror"" for most of the movie. I mean, the 80s were still fresh in everyone's minds, so the cornucopia of over the top horror flicks had become the gold standard of what to expect. And although I hadn't seen any at all, I knew in a general sense what comprised one. How? I don't know... I just knew the makeup of one in a general sense. And this definitely wasn't Jason slamming a camper in a sleeping bag into a tree, or Captain Rhodes getting disemboweled and ripped in half by a gaggle of ghouls.But that night, I had the most terrifying dreams ever, even to this day. And to this day, I remember them so vividly, like they'd been burned into my memory for all time. From that moment on, I was addicted to both the horror genre and this movie in particular.To me, this is THE most perfect horror film... not just MOVIE, a FILM... ever created. It has atmosphere, constant tension, totally new and unique camera work, characters with actual depth, an utterly terrifying and original premise and antagonist, and most importantly, an actual STORY (for all you millennials, movies back then, even horror movies, had what they called STORIES). And I really believe that Russo and Romero's bare-bones budget did them a huge favor... #1) the film is so much more effective in black and white. It adds a whole other dimension to the terror. And #2) the absence of fancy makeup and prosthetics did the audience such a massive favor, because THE GHOULS LOOKED JUST LIKE US. THAT is what made them so terrifying... they weren't blue like in Dawn and they weren't all skeletal with faces sunken in like in Day... they looked like actual people, except with blood here and there, and maybe some torn clothing. They're much more believable as the recently deceased returning to ""life"".I can never say enough about the absolute PERFECTION of this film. It was something so new and original and HORRIFYING. I mean, really think about it... it's 1968, when people hadn't yet become totally desensitized to movie horror and violence, and here comes this horror movie with the bodies of the recently deceased getting up and attacking the living. And not just attacking... halfway thru the movie, for the first time ever, you see these corpses EATING the people. Romero and Russo said when writing the movie, they were trying to think of the most terrifying and appalling act that these things could do... and in my opinion, devouring the living, us, is definitely terrifying and appalling, not to mention probably the worst and most painful way to die. But more than anything else, the scariest part of it all (and really driven home thanks to the lack of makeup effects and prosthetics), is that they really truly ARE, and LOOK like, US.100,000,000/10 stars. Perfection. Most original, creative, well written, perfectly shot, and most of all, SCARIEST horror FILM ever created.

Plus the acting isn't all that great either. Compared to the horror movies of today, it is not even a horror movie. For the time period this movie came out, I can imagine the controversy and backlash it got. I can appreciate that the director and producers decided to break racial barriers and cast a black man as one of the lead roles. And the fact that it opened many doors in the horror cinematic universe. But, otherwise, it is very lackluster. Especially at the end when I thought that Ben would manage to get help.

The beginning and end of the movie are very good. I think what I find unpleasant about this film are the nasty female stereotypes. OF COURSE the blond woman is a hysterical stupid dumb ass who deserves a slap from the macho lead, OF COURSE the girlfriend of the dumb chump white guy is just a supportive little sweetheart with nice hair. OF COURSE the wife of the nasty cowardly white guy is a characterless cipher. For me the movie lacked any sort of charisma or atmosphere. I think Romero's concern with social commentary blinded him to the potential of the rest of the characters and the movie's plot. This would be a brilliant film for those concerned with social justice, I suppose that just isn't my thing, I like horror to be creepy, psychological and underplayed, nothing like that in this film. I find it all a bit forced and didactic, for me, the sterile 'macho-ness' of the lead totally alienated me, and as a horror film, it wasn't at all frightening, just chumpy and flat footed.the zombies looked like middle class uni student extras. The young girl attacking her mother scene was not bad, but it was ultimately a film about racial issues, and while that was undoubtedly a horror story of the 60s, it gives the film a kind of shrill didacticism which completely dominated the atmosphere.

Its lost some of its power to shock, but has still stood the test of time perfectly.We start out with Johnny and his sister Barbara at a cemetery to place a wreath on their father's grave. This is just where the story starts but is one of the best scenes in film history. What follows is an adventure that's more than just a popcorn horror fare. It speaks to the audience, people, about our reactions to crisis scenarios. Its scary to this day, I myself prefer the slow moving zombies who lurch forward at an inch per hour.Of course the film centers around 7 people in the farmhouse, wading off the zombies hoping simply to get out and survive. They all have the same goals, but we can see the chaotic ways they set out to accomplish them. It was a perfect movie for the time it was released, even speaking on some levels about the racism in everyday situations in America. The effects may look cheesy but they are just a subplot, as are the zombies themselves. The zombies still are effective in how they are shown and portrayed, and the end is both disturbing and realistic, a harrowing touch of 60's reality to an otherwise 'fantasy' element type film.In summary its the perfect zombie film to start off a generation of zombie films. It speaks on a grand scale to audiences and still is just as good today as it always has been. See it at all costs even if you're not a fan of this type of stuff.

398,Becks_Hush,Its Influence Runs Deep,10,17 November 2017,"If ever the term ""classic"" seemed more appropriate then Night of the Living Dead is the perfect example of what classic really means. A film laced with fear, dread, social commentary and layered with atmosphere so thick it could smother the air.Night of the Living Dead follows Barbara as on a trip to her father's grave she and her brother are attacked by a listless person who seems to move awkwardly and destroys everything in its path. Eventually she holes up in a farmhouse with other survivors including Ben as they work together to survive the terrifying events surrounding them. Whether you like this film or not does not diminish the fact that this rightly deserves its place in history as one of the finest zombie (or ghoul depending on your preference) films there is.The pace is admirably quick: from the beginning with Barbra and Johnny at the graveyard, the ghoul/ zombie it sets a consistent pace that grips the audience and keeps you hooked. The acting is decent, though Judith O'Dea does, to a degree, let it down slightly with a character that's just too emotionally wrought to oftentimes care about. But where she lacks Duane Jones compensates entirely with a performance of outstanding brilliance. The quiet intelligence of his character; how he thinks through many of scenarios placed before them - Jones is a joy to watch time and again. The ghouls/ zombies look fantastic and act it too; the shambolic way in which they move, the slow pace that persists, they feel and come across as genuinely terrifying.And it must be said that the small trace of a score is beautiful. When it's not present we hear the smooth notes of birds whistling on high, the natural sounds proving as unnerving as the gentle strum of notes in the background that precipitate the altogether disturbing sequences especially that cellar scene!Maybe it's talked about too often but I can't mention NOTLD without discussing that end! Even to this day it leaves an hollow emptiness in the stomach at what happens to Ben and the impact it courts upon the viewer never quite fades - yet despite my desire for a semi happy ending I have to concede it needed this dark, bleak ending to leave that impression. If you love horror and haven't yet seen this, do so, it's one that I feel is mandatory viewing.

To end things you have the mother/daughter death by (well, I won't say) scene, and the cruel, cruel ending. But for an hour between it's just a lot of people standing in a house arguing about what they're going to do when the zombies come in.

402,minadog-1,Not really the classic people are lead to believe,10,4 January 2008,"I always enjoyed Night of The Living Dead. It is a fantastic horror movie that I would recommend to any Ghoul loving fan. But up until recently, I had thought that George Romero and John Russo were the originators of what some here have described as a Classic influential movie, but is it really? I think not! Prior to Night Of The Living Dead, William Leicester and Richard Matheson wrote The Last Man on Earth that in 1964 was turned into a movie, and directed by Ubaldo Ragona. This was the classic that influenced Night Of The Living Dead. It stars Vincent Price who is subjected to the very same terror as Duane Jones suffers as Ben in Night Of The Living Dead. The script for The Last Man On Earth was far superior and there is much more substance to that movie. I still rate Night Of The living Dead a Ten, but a classic it is not other than the dead come up from out of the ground and coffins, but Dracula had also done that!",Night of the Living Dead
403,aimforthehead,Excellent,10,8 February 2007,George Romero's first dead film about zombie's is a must see. This movie also is about racism if you pay attention.George Romero has a way of putting socially relevant matters into his films with out throwing them in your face. His movies really get you thinking. A must have for any horror movie buff. This movie leaves you wanting more. There is a bit of humor slipped in to the movie too. This was the first time a horror film made me laugh. I recommend watching this movie before Dawn or Day of the dead. From the first moment I saw Johnny and Barbara I could not stop watching. The diversity of the characters is also great. You will com out of this rooting for Ben and cursing Mr. Cooper. The ending is a great surprise that you won't expect.,Night of the Living Dead

405,ScarletSpider87,A true classic and Romero's best,9,23 September 2012,"This film is a must-see if you are a horror fan! In my opinion, there was not a single misstep in the entire movie. The story, the acting, the pacing, and the effects are all spot-on.To me, ""Night of the Living Dead"" feels like an extended version of a Twilight Zone episode. It has the same black and white, long-shot cinematography, and the setting is the same conservative 50-60s America. As in ""The Twilight Zone,"" there is an unexplained phenomenon, a small group of people who react to it, and a twist/shocking ending. I am actually surprised that Rod Serling had nothing to do with it.George Romero did his best work here. Although I am a fan of the whole series, I personally believe that the quality of his films has gradually gone down. Every film of the Dead series is fun in its own way, but each one is a little inferior to the one that preceded it.""Night of the Living Dead"" is a breakthrough, standard-setting film. It is best watched late at night with the lights turned down low. You will not be disappointed, unless you are one of those CGI-spoiled, every-scene-has-to-be-constant-frenetic-action kind of persons. Don't get me wrong, this film delivers the thrills, but it also has an actual story that makes you think. In other words, Michael Bay didn't direct it.Romero intends for his films not only to entertain, but also to cause us to think more deeply about the world we live in and the human kind that inhabits it.",Night of the Living Dead

Certain people I've watched it with find it a little slow moving in places but I think that this just adds to the film, building tension but also creating a feeling of realism.

Inside the farm house the people can't get along and that's all I will say about the story.This wasn't the first Romero film I watched.

409,groovygirl112006,Too much hype for groundbreaking nostalgia,5,24 August 2019,"I know I'm going to get backlash for this, but as a lifelong horror fan, I just plain don't care for NOTLD. I know it's a classic and it is definitely due it's certain amount of respect for being a pioneer film in its day for the horror genre. But in reality, the movie is slow, the acting is subpar for everyone but Duane, the soundtrack is out of place and overwhelming and the ending is well.... Dumb. A good movie is ruined by a bad ending. It's not because the movie doesn't have a happy ending, but mostly because it just happens. We spend an hour building up all that tension in the household, leading up to the climax: the final showdown with the overwhelming horde of the dead. And then BOOM. Our lone survivor is so unceremoniously shot in the head. Its Romero, so I know it's for shock value, but in my opinion, it cheapens the film. There's no reward in it for anyone. Even with a sad or unhappy ending either the good guys or the bad guys get a payoff, but in this case it's nothing. It's good for it's time period; edgy and gory (which comes across great despite being black and white), and holds strong with a concept that is still quite scary in itself.
I can't rate NOTLD lower than a 5 out of respect for one of the classics that launched so many wonderful successors, but could it have been better? Yes. Yes, it could have been better.",Night of the Living Dead
410,erichedlund1,a legend with only so little,10,14 October 2013,"This movie casted in 1968 was a movie like no other. Zombies just wandering around and attack. The budget was less than $200,000 to produce a movie. He did it and it became one of my favorite horror movies. With such a low budget this could've been a laughable cheesy comedy. The movie begins with Barbara and tom they are brother and sister. They came up to visit the graves and got there late because tom didn't wake up early enough. He messes with her saying they're coming to get you and points at a clumsy confused wanderer approaching them slowly. Barbara walks up to the man to apologize for toms immature behavior. He grabs her and cries for toms help. He fights the wanderer but tom is knocked out by hitting his head on a gravestone on the ground. Barbara runs away as fast as she can. She takes the car but couldn't find the keys and then realizes that they're in toms coat pocket. The wanderer pursues her nd Barbara hits the car into neutral rolling down a hill while steering. She crashes into a tree and runs to a house locking everything up still in fright of zombie and her brother. She meets Ben a black fellow who is very resourceful and boards up the house. He makes plans and discovers two couples and a child in the basement. One man wants to stay in the cellar with hid injured daughter and wife while the other couple choose to stay upstairs. Ben and the bald man have made many disputes about plans and stuff. The news tell people to stay indoors and the zombies will die from a gunshot to a head or fire. The zombies come from a radiated spacecraft that crashed into earth releasing radiation to bring the dead to life to feed of human flesh. The other man who looks like Matt Leblanc goes outside with Ben with his wife chasing along to fuel the car outside and get help for the others. The gas leaked onto the car and Ben's torch to avoid the zombies lights up the car with the man and wife in. They try to escape but the car explodes before they killing them. Ben retreats indoors wear the bald headed man locked behind him. The bald man stands at the cellar door staring at the door as Ben is begging to come in. Ben smashes open the door staring at the bald man in the eye and beats him up. The number of zombies increase by the hundreds. The lights go out and the zombies start to break down the barriers and Barbara and the bald mans wife to block the door while the bald man and Ben take the windows. The bald man takes the gun but aims at Ben because he feels Ben is dooming them all. The barricade at the door broke and the first zombie Barbara sees is tom and cries and stands still and dies. Ben sees the gun pointed and fights of the man and shoots him. He stumbles downstairs to his daughter and dies. The wife runs downstairs in fright to see her daughter eating her father's corpse. She cries and lets her daughter stab her to death. Ben is the only one left. The girl goes upstairs and Ben tosses her aside and travels to the cellar. He blocks the doors and is afraid. Just before the door js knocked down, daybreak hit and the zombies left. The mother zombie and father zombie were killed by Ben immediately. Ben wakes up and looks out the window and gets shot in the head mistakenly took for a zombie.

Obviously they are both slightly different at the directors are different and as they go i love Geaorge A Romero i think all of his dead films have been scarier than any other attempts of remakes of his films although i own all the dead films and their remakes and enjoy them all. the difference between them is that i believe the Romero films seem to be more built on atmosphere instead of straight scares. I thoroughly enjoyed this film even though it was in black and white but i think that added to the terror because it added to the unknown about the situation ""where have the zombies come from?"" I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys good horrors for their atmosphere people who like horrors for jumpy scene may not enjoy it as there are very few.

416,m-wain,Classic Romero,10,16 June 2010,"George A. Romero's 'Night Of The Living Dead' (1968) is undeniably a classic. To say that this film was made on a tight budget would be an understatement, it was literally made on a shoe string. Many people would argue that a low budget doesn't always mean a great film, and they would be right. I have seen countless examples of low budget films that were absolutely awful, 'Lesbian Vampire Killers' of last year is a great example. However, what a tight budget does is force the film maker to use all of their initiative and resourcefulness to try and make the film a success; if the film maker is good then the movie can be great without relying on a budget. Fortunately in George A. Romero we have the absolute master of the horror genre and a brilliant director, therefore the resulting film is one of the greatest horrors of all time and is still terrifying to this day.There are many important aspects to this film, none more important than the use of Duane Jones, an African American man in the role of the hero or leading man. It was made towards the end of the Civil Rights Movement and was one of the first horror films to have a black leading man. This is excellent as it challenged the audience of the time to not only except this man as their equal but as their hero.Another fantastic thing about 'Night of the Living Dead' is found in its simplicity. This is grass roots horror that pretty much rewrote the rulebook. Horror today in the main relies on special effects and before that relied on make up; an amazing example is Rick Baker's Oscar winning work on 'An American Werewolf in London'; however when watching 'Night of the Living Dead' you will notice that the 'zombies' do not generally have heavy make up on, and yet they still manage to remain scary. This is all to do with Romero's impeccable direction. Simple shots of hands grabbing people through boarded up windows have you screaming at the screen and guessing who is going to be ripped apart next.Overall, it is rare to say a film is a perfect example of how good a genre can be but Romero's classic certainly does show how good a horror film can be. Many would still consider it to be the greatest horror of all time, I am not of this opinion, but it will still always remain on a pedestal in my mind due to its influence upon character archetypes, horror settings and future low budget productions.",Night of the Living Dead
417,coolkycouple2004,Still ghoulish and terrifying after 3 decades,10,13 October 2004,"The first of director Romero's undead trilogy is his best. This is a film that brilliantly exudes fear, dread, and shock all at the same time. From the great performances, to the nightmarish premise, this is one of the greatest horror movies ever made.In 1968 when it was released, it was light years ahead of its time,and the casting of a black leading man, combined with flesh eating ghouls certainly added shock value to the film. And don't let anyone fool you...it's best viewed in its original black and white to get the full effect.

418,coughlinm,Still creeps me out!,10,21 August 2005,"I have always believed that atmosphere is far more effective than visual shock value in presenting a truly scary movie. In this respect NOTLD is the scariest, creepiest movie ever made. Even if the scenes of ghouls feasting on human flesh (shocking by 1968 movie standards but tame by todays)had been eliminated and simply implied, this would still be a frightening little gem. Like I said, this movie is fueled by 100% atmosphere. Everything Romero does in this movies direction adds to its sense of dread, be it the black and white filming , the gloomy rural Pennsylvania location or the stock music, all ad to the movies power. From start to finish the tension never lets up and there is nothing in the movie that allow for release. There is no romantic interlude no comic relief. NOTHING. The viewer is left feeling as hopeless as the doomed, trapped occupants of the farmhouse. Had Romero been a Hollywood director, working for a big studio, this film would have never seen the light of day in its current form. It just didn't fit the accepted formula for horror films at that time. This all the more makes the low budget and independent nature of the film so important. Had this been a Hollywood release, it would probably have been just another lame horror movie with a nice formulaic and comfortable ending. One of the few weak points in the script that should have been left out is the explanation for the undead phenomena. In fact Romero never tread that ground again in any of his follow up ""dead"" movies. The whole Venus probe thing just seemed too simplistic and easy an explanation. No explanation would be scarier. In all this is probably the greatest horror movie of all time. A timeless classic.",Night of the Living Dead
419,PlanNine,Didn't live up to my expectations,9,5 October 1999,"This new version of an old classic isn't horrible.  It's just not that good. We are given some new scenes in the classic horror film which are directed by John Russo, a stellar screenwriter, but an only semi-competent director.The prologue is fun for fans who have already seen the original film. Establishing an origin for the cemetary zombie is really really cool. However, for new viewers of the film, it ruins the first terrifying aspect of the original film.  The fact that Johnny says to Barbara ""They're coming to get you, Barbara"" and then the Hinzman zombie really is one of ""them"" is lost in this version, which is a shame.  That sequence was terrifying in the original NOTLD.The new scenes at Beakman's diner are the best new sequences in the film. They fit with the original and are a fun addition.  It is great to trace the path of a bunch of zombies from the diner that Ben encountered them in to the house in the woods.By far the worst and most blasphemous addition to the film is the epilogue. We are treated to a scene that is supposed to be ""1 year after"" NOTLD.  A terrifying aspect of the original version is that the authorities do not have this horrific plague under control, and that this night we have witnessed is the first night of the end of the world.  By setting this scene a year later, we feel cheated, and the entire murky resolution of the original film is cheapened and ruined.  Are horror fans also to belive that Dawn of the Dead and Day of the Dead, which should fit in after this movie's chronology, didn't happen?  I'm not ready to do that myself.As for the score, it is allright but would fit better if all of the other pieces of music were removed from the film.  Having some of the library music remain in the movie is too much of a contrast with the synthesizer heavy new score.On the whole some aspects of the new movie are fun, but Russo and co. could have done better.",Night of the Living Dead

421,zombizilla,A great film that deals with just ordinary people and nightmare horrors,10,11 August 2000,"George Romero's classic, `Night of the Living Dead', has been interpreted in so many ways that the original intent of the film has been lost: what happens when you put people from different walks of life together to fight for a common cause.Sure, Romero was trying to make a social statement.He was also trying to scare the Hell out of us.Romero was a promising film student from Pittsburgh who wanted to make a movie that made both of those statements above.  He wasn't trying to change the world.  He just wanted to make the best movie he could for the money available.  He went out and hired local actors for the film (including Tom Savini, who had to drop out when he was called to service in Vietnam.  Boy, would this experience pay off when he came back to the States and create his trademark effects!).The group of people in the farmhouse Romero created was eclectic; a common-sense hero, a hysterical young woman, a no-nonsense middle-aged man and his sympathetic wife along with their daughter, and a young couple experiencing puppy love.  The hero, played by Duane Jones, is not portrayed as black or white.  He just happens to be a man brought to the house by happenstance.  He has no political agenda, no idealistic dreams.  Just a man running from a diner that was taken over by ghouls.  As he describes what happened at the diner to a comatose Barbara, you imagine the horror those unfortunate people went through as they were being torn apart and eaten alive.  The fuel truck being overturned.  The driver being dragged out of the cab and being mangled and chewed on by things that look human but are not.  It makes you feel that you were actually there witnessing the carnage. This is a very descriptive scene that implies the horror that not only the ordeal others had but the fate that lies ahead for the others.The indoor scenes are dramatic and powerful.  Conflicts upon conflicts are piled on as decisions are made and then changed as to protect themselves from the ghouls.  Should they try to stand and fight the onslaught?  Should they try to flee to the next town deemed safe by TV anchors?  Or should they hide and barricade themselves in the cellar.  All three options are tried to some extent.  For those who haven't seen the film, I will give no details.The stark b & w footage only adds the to atmosphere of film, as when the ghouls are seen walking through the woods at night are scenes from your nightmares.  The close-ups of the ghouls eating the flesh of the living is vivid and mindnumbing.  There are some amateurish shots also, as when Ben is bent over the body of a ghoul he just killed.  You can see Romero's hand waving Jones to move on and out of the scene.  This is the only glaring mistake I can see through the film.You can tell that Romero was influenced by old horror comic books like `Tales from the Crypt', which had several stories of the walking dead.  The idea of taking this concept and turning the ghouls into flesh eaters was a stroke of genius.  He wanted to create a sense of doom and he succeeded.The only complaint I have with the film is the casting of Barbara.  Her cantonic and amateurish acting is the only guff I have to an otherwise excellent film.  If you are looking for some serious social commentary, watch the higher budgeted but just as entertaining `Dawn of the Dead' and `Day of the Dead', which drags at the beginning but concludes with a slam bang finish.",Night of the Living Dead

427,Giovanni_Corleone,Night of the Licing Dead- Remaking Horror,8,15 February 2006,"Armed with about $100,000 and a cheap camera, George A. Romero set out to make a movie that would redefine the horror genre. The plot is rather simple; due to a satellite crash from Venus spreading radiation, the dead rise and feast of the flesh of the living. A group of survivors hold up in a farmhouse and try to survive the night. As the movie goes on, people learn the rules: 1. Anyone who dies (with a brain still intact) will rise again. 2. If a zombie bites someone, they will die from the infection and then rise again. 3. A zombie can only be destroyed by brain damage, be it a gun shot or a tire iron. The acting and dialogue leave much to be desired, but hey, it's Romero's first and low budget. What's important about this movie is the effect it had on movies after it. Instead of the cheesy predictability of earlier horror movies, Night of the Living Dead brought in new ideas, broke all the old ""rules"" of horror. Instead of an easy to spot antagonist, this movie has everyone as the monster. Each and every person, regardless of merit, has a chance to become a zombie. Even those still alive pose some threat. Instead of the monster being destroyed at the end, they become stronger. The hero's story ends with a shock (no, it's not racist). Everything that has been established before this movie is shot down. Alright, I admit it, some parts do get boring. Many of the dialogue scenes inside the farmhouse and long and drawn-out, but this I attribute to the budget and actors. Every other part of the movie is relentless in pace, however. You can watch it for the importance or you can watch it for the entertainment, both ways work.",Night of the Living Dead
428,zambonilord,Finally Got to Watch This,8,6 November 2013,"I must say, I was expecting to be disappointed. I am by no means a fan of Zombie movies, Plus as much as this movie was hyped, how could it live up to expectations? Surprisingly, it has held up over time. The Ghouls as they are called (According to a recent interview Romero doesn't consider, Zombie to be an applicable term) are surprisingly creepy.The general plot is that for unknown reasons, The dead are walking and behaving like animals. While the movie puts forth the theory that the epidemic is being caused by an alien radiation, The actual cause of this horrific invasion are never determined. In the end, The dead are walking, Who cares why? What's most poignant about this movie is how the Ghouls compare to today's overly saturated zombie market. These Ghouls demonstrate basic problem solving skills, no emotion whatsoever, and, unprecedented for a Zombie movie, a sense of self preservation.This coupled with the notion that any and all dead will rise and attack the living, makes the Ghoulish hoard a credible threat for an unprepared populace.The weakest part is probably the human characters. While this movie is noteworthy for having a black man as the lead actor, The characters do little more than bicker over where to hide. It's the sort of problem that even for stressed people, should have been easy to fix as both points were valid. But hey, it gives us our controversy, however trivial.The ending is the part I really took issue with. And while I won't spoil it if you haven't seen it, It's one of those pointless and easily avoidable bad endings that not only does nothing for the drama, but trivializes the whole movie.Still, it's worth checking out this classic, and discovering what made the Zombie Genre what it is today.",Night of the Living Dead

Filming in black and white, while solely a budget decision, proved to be one of the most powerful attributes of the movie. I don't know if it would have worked as well as it did if it was in color. The 1990 color version was ok, but nothing compared to the original. An all consuming sense of fear, hopelessness and despair prevail throughout the film and as strong as the shock value is and as convincing as the ""living dead"" were, the atmosphere created by the black and white filming was what stamped this as a classic. I first saw this when I was 10 and to this day, cannot sit still for the opening credits because of the ominous theme music.

Russo's insertion of new footage has none of the visual style and editing sense of Romero's, and stands out in a most obvious manner, like scenes from the cheapest direct-to-video production. The re-scoring completely negates the 40s horror film feel the movie has always enjoyed, again making it seem like the recent DTV release that it's become. And the re-editing  of both scenes and audio is jarring and sloppy. Plus which, the DVD's sound is occasionally out of sinc! The added plot point concerning the preacher who survives getting bit was an interesting idea, if badly presented. And the new stereo sound effects are effective here and there. However, the notion that this version may one day replace the original in the view of the general public is by far the scariest thing about this release. I doubt it will, but look at what happened to Star Wars.",Night of the Living Dead

Nowadays acclaimed cult-director George A. Romero directed this masterpiece with only $114.000 available to him and made it into a black & white movie in stead of the upcoming color movies available with the new color TV...The story about a band of people being trapped in a farmhouse fencing off a horde of bloodthirsty zombies is in itself simple enough. Where the movie stands out is in it's dark atmosphere and mood set by the use of black and white footage and eerie music Romero got from an audio library! The element of the small group of people against what it seems the forces of nature (actually a UFO radiation accident!) has the viewer enthusiastically rally on the side of the group. Also, the interaction between the people themselves (from the start dividing them into 2 camps) is in itself a nice portrait of human society.Some of the stars of the movie (including Mr. Cooper) were investors providing Romero with his budget...this also donates to the overall feel of the movie...Night of the Living Dead is a true classic in its genre...watch it with lights out and the sound up....!!!",Night of the Living Dead
434,kaijueguy,A model for living!,9,25 August 2007,"First of all, I consider this movie to be one of the most important horror films in the entire history of horror films. It changed the way horror movies were made and while zombies had appeared in movies before, it would re-define the zombie sub-genre of horror forever.You take a group of people who are just regular everyday kind of people, people anybody can identify with and put them together in an abandoned farmhouse during a crisis. You provide them with every tool necessary to survive and then spend 90 minutes watching as adults demonstrate that William Golding was on target in this adult look at the Lord of the Flies.The stark contrasts of black and white only make this film better and you should avoid watching any colorized version of this film. It needs to be seen in black and white. In spite of it's low-budget origins, the movie shows a really talent with lighting effects and demonstrates what can happen when extremely creative people work within the limitations of low-budget film-making.While there might be flesh-eating zombies lurking on their doorstep, the real enemy facing the people trapped in this farmhouse are themselves. Their personal prejudices, cultures and attitudes become their greatest adversaries and instead of coming together to fight a common enemy, they get torn further apart as they struggle for their own power and identity.In Night of the Living Dead George Romero hold up a mirror for us to gaze into the reflection of our own dark souls and it's not a pretty sight.One final note. While I'm a big fan of MST3K, Mike Nelson's riff on the film is just a cheap shot and while funny at times, distracts from the beauty of this classic on the genre.",Night of the Living Dead

Don't let its lack of color fool you, this film still has the power to send a chill down your spine.  As with most of Romero's works, he casts a group of unknowns so you don't know who will survive and who won't.  For as low as the budget was, the makeup effects (by Tom Savini in his debut) are astoundingly good also.  Even the ending has a message.

It seemed like it could happen and I related to the people. I like the political views because I thought Romero was brave for having a black man in the film and as the star but somethings were wrong for me which is why I didn't give it a ten. First there was the small mistakes in the film like how it was light and five seconds later it was magically night. Romero should have done the Barbra and Johnny scenes at sunset so it made sense. Also I saw Dawn of the Dead before so maybe I was expecting more even though I had seen the film many years ago.

438,andrsbckly,30th Anniversary terrible.,10,30 September 2007,"While ""Night of the living dead"" is an unquestionable classic, the 30th anniversary commits the ultimate act of cannibalism ever- namely adding useless and nepotistic footage of the creators own family members as zombies added 30 years after; an extra scene attached to the very beginning in a feeble and pointless attempt to explain the origin of the cemetery zombie only adds to the feeling extra scenes were created for a selling point. Take my advice, simply see the original restored version which looks great...this movie doesn't need the extra stuff. The REAL threat in this movie plot comes not from zombies but from the constant conflict and inability to decide and compromise between the main individuals; being right and in charge becomes more important than escape, the supposed threat- zombies or vampires or earthquakes or whatever- is actually secondary. the true horror comes from the realization that humans do, in fact, behave selfishly when they should be working together. But shame on the creators for the extra and useless footage; it doesn't really detract from the film, but it's annoying to think they did it.

As the number of 'ghouls' grow and more of them appear around the house, the inhabitants decide something must be done to move their number to a safer location in the next town. This, of course, is where the trouble really starts.This low-budget horror/thriller is a fine example of how believable characters and buckets of suspense are much more effective than believable special effects and buckets of gore. A true landmark in horror film-making, many times emulated but rarely equalled, 'Night of the Living Dead' stands the test of time perfectly, remaining scarier and more chilling than most of whats on offer these days.

Even for someone who isn't a huge fan of the horror genre itself, I still found myself really enjoying this film.Beyond important for bringing zombies or ""ghouls"" as they're called in this film to the screen, the film does a great job creating tension, setting up great characters, and killing them off. Romero understood from the inception of zombie movies that the most important thing in the film are the characters.I've read that this film is important because of its depiction of violence and use of a black male lead which I think is awesome. There is also subtle messages embedded in this film about racism, which I love because it's done in such a subliminal way, unlike the films of today where it must be spelled out in a way that often times comes off as preachy. My one complaint about the film is that it comes off as almost kind of boring in how meticulous and realistic it is in the first act, where they are boarding up the windows, listening to the radio and discussing plans for how they are going to survive the night, but it's also what I love about this movie.This film is a strong 8 on the enjoyable and a 10 on its importance to film history and influence factor.

444,ckjabroni,Greatest Horror Film Of All-Time,9,23 October 2002,"George A. Romero in this, created a horror masterpiece. This film couldn't possibly be topped in the category of influence. Also this is a message to all the directors out there today. How could you not respect this man, and revere him as one of the best? He did everything in this film! He wrote it, directed it, did the cinematography, and edited it. You'd think with all of that work on your hands you'd have a piece that lacked quality, well think again. Barbra travels to the countryside with her brother to visit her mothers grave and pay their respects. Within a few minutes Barbra is fleeing into an abandoned farmhouse, being chased by zombies that killed her brother, and now want her! Barbra once in the farmhouse realizes that the house had already been cleaned out by the dead. Ben comes in to make the save, and with no vehicle, and a multitude of zombies approaching the house. They have no choice but to settle in and try to survive and hope to escape out of this predicament with their lives. As the movie advances we are introduced to more survivors that need shelter in the house, which sets the tone for the rest of the movie. Romero's ability to capture this feeling of utter and total despair and a loss of hope is breath taking. His cinematography captures eeriness, and throughout the entire film will creep you out. The complete anguish of dark, and even by the time the movie is over, will make you terrified of the light! All this with the guinness book of world records title of smallest budget for a film! Never in a film will you feel the total loss of hope that this film portrays as it progresses. Almost to a point where you feel like if this film were longer, you might fall into a depression! The ability this film has, to make the viewer(s) feel, what the film directs you to feel is outstanding, and is what all directors in the horror/suspense categories now try to duplicate. This film to me, is what every person that creates a film tries to duplicate, the ability to capture everyones emotion and MAKE them feel the film. Romero is a legend. Do yourself a favor if you're a fan of horror films or are inspiring to be a director. Watch this film, and learn from a legend! 9/10",Night of the Living Dead

As much as I love movies, I need to give more black and white movies a chance.In the beginning, I thought, ""Ooh I don't know if I can hang with this.""

446,shroudoftheimmortal,George A. Romero knew what he was doing.,9,13 October 2003,"Night Of The Living Dead is the story of, well, basically life on Earth as we know it coming to an end; the title says it all.  The dead are ""living"", or at least roaming about devouring any human (that isn't dead) that they come in to contact with.  We see this story through a group of random people gathered together in an empty farm house fighting for their lives.The opening scene of this movie is CLASSIC.  One of my favorite scene in the history of film.  You have a brother and sister visiting their fathers (I think) grave site.  The brother continually teases his sister who is obviously disturbed by this.  ""They're coming to get you Babara.  Look There is one now.""  He says this pointing to an elderly man walking in their direction.  Some of the last words he will ever speak.  The elderly man approaching them (of course they don't know he is a zombie) attacks the Barbara.  Her brother tries to fight him off, but is killed in the struggle. And so begins one of the greatest horror films ever made.The tension is gradually raised through out the film as peoples personalities, and ideas on how to combat the gathering mob of living dead outside of their temporary hideaway, begin to conflict with one another. The acting is not top notch I will admit.  There are so many other pluses that this matters little if at all, in fact it may add something for some viewers.  The story is original in it's telling, and one of the earliest movies of this type before ten low budget copies came out every year.This is not a gore fest, if you want that check out Dawn Of The Dead, instead more of a psychological thriller.  This is one of the smartest horror films I have ever seen, and reccomend that you see it as well.

Some call it the best zombie movie ever made, some call it the best horror movie ever made. There is nothing wrong with that, because Dawn is indeed a great movie. But I am definitely in another club. I beg to differ. In my opinion, Night of The Living Dead is the superior movie.Above all others, of course because of its influence of basically reinventing the whole zombie sub-genre. But it is also the fact that it was made with budget so little, Hollywood producers would probably have laughed at it. But most of all, it's because the movie achieved what so many horror movie actually did: being frightening.The making of great horror does not need millions of dollars or special effects or CGI, no. The quintessence of horror is to scare you with something you cannot see or have never seen before. That was what Romero achieved with this movie. He managed to put something ""unknown"" to many that terrorize your mind long after you see it or after you have seen it many many times.And since everyone & their mother probably know about the story of this movie, I won't even bother writing it down here. I just want to praise Romero for presenting a REAL feeling of isolation all throughout. This movie is Horror 101, a textbook of making a great horror with the effective scare (not the special effects).And among many of the zombie movies I've ever seen in my life, this one I take a great delight of watching over and over again.

Cannibalism, daughter killing mother, betrayal...those unfortunate souls go deep down in miserable decay. When the film finishes (and what a final sequence!), it's impossible not to think about all the metaphors. Men acting in a more disgusting way than zombies - that is!

Of course, those who prefer the original soundtrack will not be satisfied by this and should avoid this DVD at all costs.Both Editions have (per the booklet) the same soundtrack. This appears to be literally the case, and may be the primary reason why the 30th AE has so much footage missing -- so much that, if you do not know the original, you probably will not be able to follow the story!

That is displayed here in spades to the point where there is nowhere to turn to - either for the characters or the audience - no one is heroically going to save the day.

The dead people looks like alive humans, really, and it isn't scary, maybe only in the beginning. I would recommend someone that is into zombies to watch this, but don't expect to feel involved. I didn't feel for the characters and didn't get into the mood, like I easily do in many films. The only positive thing I can think of is that one of the characters is black, that's good for a film this old. Other than that, Zombiefilms have absolutely gotten much better with time.

Romero revolutionized the way that we look at movies. Night of the Living Dead, plain and simple, is a movie that is worth seeing. Even though the effects, sound and picture quality and dialogue is outdated (by today's standards); this movie is still one of the best ever made. I first saw Night of the Living Dead at a local theater, around Halloween. I actually live in Butler, which is mentioned multiple times throughout the movie. That viewing was my introduction horror films and I've been a big fan ever since. Recently I purchased a colorized version of the film from Legend Studios/Off Color Films and 20th Century FOX. Seeing it in color is a different experience, but makes it just as creepy.""You gonna let them get her too, huh?""The storyline of Night of the Living Dead is pretty simple: A woman and her brother are attacked by a zombie (even though they are never called zombies in the movie) the zombie attacks her brother and she runs to a nearby farmhouse for protection, leaving her brother behind to fight Mr. Zombie. (Oh, don't worry she'll see her brother again!). At the farmhouse the woman meets a group of people who are also seeking protection there as well. The rest of the movie tells the story of their attempt to keep their lives from being taken by their cannibalistic attackers. ""Are they slow-moving, chief?"" ""Yeah, they're dead. They're all messed up.""Since its initial release in 1968, Night of the Living Dead has been referenced and spoofed in countless films and has become a landmark in film making history. It has spawned the creation of three sequels (so far) and its own remake in 3-D. The special effects aren't exactly top notch, but even by today's standards would probably be a close call between PG-13 and an R rating.

The bleakness, the stark naturalism (in this movie offset by an absurd, illogical, event), the violence. One thing that Night of the Living Dead gets right is it pulls off the horror of a family disintegrating quite well. Actually thats kind of what this movie is about. It's about social disintegration in times of chaos. If the people in the house would have pulled together, then the zombies wouldn't have been as much of a problem.

458,write_the_wrong,Night of the Living Dead,9,20 September 2008,"George A. Romero's 1968 cult classic 'Night of the Living Dead' could arguably be one of the most revolutionary horror films of its time. It may not have been the first zombie film ever made but it's the first one that actually made an impact on popular culture. On the surface, 'Night of the Living Dead' seems to be a run of the mill horror movie about a group of people hiding out in a farmhouse from these flesh eating beings that have been reanimated from the dead. What's so interesting about this film is its many satirical comments on American culture during the the late 1960's - criticizing society for its racism, its involvement in the Vietnam war, and a general attitude towards women.George A. Romero chose Duane Jones to play the African- American hero of the film, which up until then was rarely heard of, only to have him gunned down in the very end of the film just as he thinks he is finally saved and everything will return to normal. It's supposed to remind the viewer of all the powerful black males in history that have stood up to their oppressors and revolted against the norms of society only to be assassinated by those who did not agree with their views and beliefs.The zombies in the film are playing the same role the Vietnamese played in the Vietnam war. They seem to be everywhere and stop at nothing to take over everything in their path. The few humans that are left and trying to survive are the soldiers who were over in Vietnam during the war: they're trapped, they have little resources and have nowhere to run because the enemy they are running from are covering the entire area.The women in this film are treated as fragile and useless in the situation they are facing. Barbra, portrayed brilliantly by Judith O'Dea begins the film terrified and running from the zombies, only to continue throughout the film helping out in no way possible. She sits on the couch in shock and rarely responds or has any input to the storyline. The only time she ever gets up and takes action is at the end - at which point she is absolutely no help, getting herself taken away (and presumably eaten). Portraying Barbra as silent and unable to help because of her mental state of shock only pointed out how America at the time (and to an extent still does) treat its women as helpless and powerless.What is so appealing about this film is its ability to have all of these powerful, underlying themes while simultaneously coming off as a meaningless Friday night ""Let's go to the drive-in!"" B-horror movies of the 1960's. It has the ability to let you just sit down and enjoy it without having to think too heavily about its themes and context. It's a film that can be enjoyed and appreciated by both the brainless teenagers of America and the most analytical of film critics.",Night of the Living Dead

Why do these filmmakers insist on tampering with classic films. This film aired on cinemax the other night and was listed as Night of the Living Dead which does a disservice to anyone expecting the horror masterpiece and watched this steaming pile of dog feces.

From a lousy script, bad acting, cornball dialogue, and cheesy affects, this film causes one to want the time back he wasted viewing it. Stupid moments litter the script, from the obvious to downright awkward. To add ultimate insult to the injury, the ending is what ultimately burns this dead horse. If scenes of the dead don't turn one's stomach, it'll be other elements of the production. Though horror films don't tend to have the best performances, this flick is an embarrassment to them all just the same. How gifted director/screenwriter M.

One of the beauties of his story is that the living dead do not march into film in some awesome display of unlocked evil; no, it is far more subtle. This understated tone towards the rising monsters creates an uncertain reality for the viewer, perhaps (one begins to wonder) this isn't as far-fetched as it appears. The undead linger constantly either in foreground or background of this film, even when they do not appear on screen we know they are silently waiting, watching from the outside. The viewer can't help but picture themselves in such a situation, trapped and abandoned with only limited tools to hand. After all...what could you do? As there actions play out Romero plays upon this selection of possible scenarios, would you lock yourself away in the easy-to-defend cellar? But what about escape? Could you take some chance of flight but sacrifice the chance to easily defend yourself? It is difficult not to admire the way we are pulled into this interesting play between characters, in a situation that when we step back is obviously absurd.

It was a horror film that failed to explain its monster, unlike cheesy aliens or products of toxic waste, they simply existed and had to be dealt with.Night of the living Dead succeeded because it never showed off with expensive sets or masks, the make up was made to look as realistic as ex Vietnam veteran Tom Savini could render. It played like a documentary based upon zombie survival than a contrived story, which adds to its bizare reality. There are no heroes or survivors in this tale, truly a tragic horror that so many tried yet failed to emulate.

The couple are attacked by what seems to be a drunk human being, untold to the couple the being that attacked them was a walking corpse. The sister runs from the beast leaving the brother for death, but the figure follows her. She stumbles upon a deserted barn house.

It turns out there are another 5 people who have been hiding in the basement. After much collaboration they join forces. After listening to the radio, they realised that the ghouls walking outside are in fact the dead which have returned and are seeking human flesh and that they have risen due to radiation from a satellite. In the cellar lies a young girl who has fallen ill due to an attack by one of the ghouls. There only hope of survival is to get to the gas pump outside and fill up the truck, and escort the girl to the nearest hospice.After there attempt to get the gas fails, the house is left open for the zombies to feast.

I watch it every Halloween, without fail, as well as several other of this type. We are talking about a 30 year span here and I still love it!As a MAJOR horror movie buff since the age of about 10, this is the ONLY one that ever terrified me. I saw it in an extremely cut version, as a Saturday afternoon TV movie, and it still left a big impression on me. Most of the ""gory"" scenes were cut but it still scared the heck out of me. Everything about this movie works: from the claustrophobic atmosphere to the black-and-white cinematography ... and everything in between. Director George Romero is, and always will be, the king of the flesh-eating zombie movies.This is the gold star of low budget horror flix. If you have not seen it, and are a horror movie fan, this is a MUST see. Do NOT hesitate, see it now, but remember this movie was made in 1968 and much of the shock value has faded as it has been done in 1000 movies since then. Keep in mind that THIS is the film the pushed the ""gore"" envelope and was the first modern zombie horror film and you can not help but be impressed. Once you see it you will also be compelled to see Romero's equally good sequels ... ""Dawn of the Dead"" (1978), ""Day of the Dead"" (1985) and ""Land of the Dead"" (2005). The other 2 (""Diary.."" and ""Survival .."") are not up to par, but still better than most of the other movies of this genre, no matter what the ""critics"" on IMDb say.In closing, I cannot recommend this film enough for the serious, and open minded, horror movie fan.",Night of the Living Dead

Before The Exorcist or The Omen,before Texas chainsaw massacre or Halloween,before Friday the 13th or A nightmare on Elm street there was this film. Night of the living dead is great. The cast is enjoyable. The zombies are creepy and the farm house itself is rather spooky too. It's just all around a very creepy film. My favorite parts of the movie are the beginning with Barbara and her annoying brother then later the daughter in the basement greeting her own mother as one of the walking dead. I think this the first film everyone should see when watching their very first horror film. You'll see many other ones made later in color with lots more blood and gore and special effects but you know what? Most of them won't stick with you like this film does.",Night of the Living Dead

The shadows and the texture the black and white brings sets this aside from other zombie movies. It has a low budget feel but has big budget chills. You can't help but be drawn in by this film. Right from the get go with the maniacal score and timely use of sound effects. Check out the scene where Barbara runs from the house and is blinded by the headlights of the truck. There is a great Synth sound that just hangs and reverberates until Ben slams the door and right on cue it stops and brings us into the next transition with ease.

It's was so incredibly original for its time. George Romero is a stunning director and in my opinion is one of the greatest scripts ever written.

It grabs you by the neck and slaps you around, preying upon your worst fears and most sacred values (family, respect for the dead, the afterlife, body as temple, politics). It is also a brilliant sociological study commenting upon human communication (or lack there of).  While most horror films have periods of complete safety when characters can rationalize and find a solution to their predicament, no such thing exists here.  There is always an underlying feeling of dread and doom, and nothing is ever explained.

The creators (Russo & George A. Romero) of the original 1968 version had been ripped off by distributors so often throughout the years that Russo and 2 of the original producers (Russ Streiner & Karl Hardman) decided to add new scenes and a new score to the original film.  The new score sounds like it was composed on a child's home synthesizer keyboard, and the new scenes are laughably bad and actually REPLACE some previous scenes from the classic 1968 film.

NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD changed how horror film were to be made for ever after. For the first time, without the help of a major motion picture studio a group of people made a horror film, and in doing so showed the rest of the world that it could be done.THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE and HALLOWEEN certainly could not have been made the same way had NOTLD not been made. Much has been written about the documentary feel of the film as well as the realism of the film in particular the fact that everybody dies at the end of the film. And it is all valid. This is one creepy feeling film. This is not a feel good film. It exposes the dark side of humanity with no holds barred. There are no real heroes in this film. Harry Cooper is always sited as a class A jerk. But Ben is only a little better. The constant arguing between the two is no little contribution to the demise of the whole group. NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD is must viewing for any serious horror movie fan. In it one can see the influence it had (and still has) horror films to follow.

479,TheSilverTongue,"Slightly overrated, but a brilliant milestone",7,10 February 2013,"I am almost embarrassed to admit that it has taken me this long to watch George A. Romero's directorial debut, often attributed with revolutionising horror and reinventing zombies in film. Better late than never, they say.If only the film's characters were afforded precious time. Ben, the struggling leader of seven survivors are thrown into the refuge of a farm house surrounded by a growing pack of zombies. Although the characters are completely flat and lack any development, the mix of stereotypes and qualities provides an entertaining mix.The viewer cannot help but pity the poor, helpless survivors. Frequent broadcasts reveal an ongoing national resistance, with the help of doctors, NASA and the police force. Conversely, our survivors are isolated with nothing more than a shotgun, a few slugs and an array of very hate-able useless individuals who slow down the overall progress of the group.Another welcomed theme throughout the movie was the gradual reclusion of Ben. Venturing from the country, he seeks refuge in the farm house and is eventually driven to a dim basement shared with a monster child. By this stage, sheer desperation is the only thing left to cling to.Entering this film, I knew that the previous viewing of countless zombie films would provide prejudice. Half of the fear of living dead in film has always been, at least for me, their visual awe. A man chasing another man is generally nothing special, but it is when he only has half a face. With that said, I was amazed at the genuine terror invoked through the almost cosmetic- free walkers in Night of the Living Dead. Accompanying great strides and power in numbers was a score that provided real shock-value.Put down your 28s and Walkin Dead discs and pull out the godfather of zombie films. It won't create nightmares and it can be safely watched at night on your own, but it is a decent film nonetheless. Considering the era and available technologies, Romero should be regarded as a genius.Read more of my reviews at http://silvertonguereviews.wordpress.com/",Night of the Living Dead

But there is nothing about the age of the camera mentioned anywhere so probably the thing was ancient and the guy using it was one of the living dead himself. The girl Barbara who is one of the lead characters looks dead before she died as well. Her acting is annoyingly bad and the way she shows us how women react in scary situations is a disgrace to her gender.

Add some guts here and there, an unimaginable amount of claustrophobic suppression and break the taboos of the time (eg. matricide and cannibalism, which were considered unacceptable at the time), and voilà, here we have ""Night of the Living Dead"".I understand that most critics were not exactly infatuated by the graphic special effects back in the day, but the real horror of the film lies deep between the lines. The surviving people, as in all Romero's movies, have trouble getting along with each other in a critical situation, once again proving that man's worst enemy is man himself.Although the movie was made in black-and-white due to the tight budget, it is actually a benefit, as it adds to the atmosphere even more. The music score is also very thrilling. The top advantages of the movie is the continuous feel of being trapped in a narrowing space and the growing tension between the characters, which sets the film apart from many of its contemporaries.All in all, a very touching horror film, not only due to its then-unmatched gore, but because of the criticism of society and human nature in it.

Soon the zombies claim their first victims and thus the horrific plaque begins to spread.Through some series of events the main characters Ben (Duane Jones) and Barbra (Judith O'Dea) end up into a semi-big wooden house with Harry Cooper (Karl Hardman), Tom (Keith Wayne) and Judy (Judith Ridley), where they try to survive from the hands of the zombie hordes.For being a black-and-white, low budget film, Night is surprisingly well filmed and full of horror feeling. Lack of colors has been replaced with awesome use of light and shadows. The use of the camera is as professional as in an average Hollywood film at that time.The music of the film is rather simple yet very effective. Night deserves an eight because of it's preservation through times. It can still give you the thrilling feeling of watching horror films. This old school horror classic should not be missed by any horror fan.Watch this one alone in an empty, dark house.",Night of the Living Dead
491,cmacabre,As terrible as the stench of rotting flesh...,10,26 February 2002,"In 1968 George A. Romero released what is arguably the greatest horror film of all time, Night of the Living Dead.  This movie also involved Bill Hinzman in a small role as the ""cemetery zombie"" and Tom A. Russo as co-writer of the original screenplay.Go forward in time 30 years, Tom A. Russo and a now overweight Bill Hinzman for devise a terrible idea--augmenting a 30-year-old film with newly shot footage and enitrely redoing the original music score.  Enter the Anton LaVey wannabe Scott Vladimir Licina for the soundtrack, which sounds like it was composed on a Casio keyboard by a 13-year-old.  Licina also pollutes the movie with a the most pathetic excuse for acting I have ever seen. Also, when does your average 1960's Pennsylvanian minister look like the leader of the Church of Satan?  Hinzman is reprised in the movie in the role of the ""cemetery zombie"", however, his classic visage is ruined by age and weight, the burning eyes and hollow cheeks have vanished over the years.
Russo and Hinzman justify tampering with the movie for the same reasons George Lucas gave for Star Wars--a lack of original resources and funding. However, no amount of money or personell can recreate a classic film to the level of its original.In summary, aside from the origninal footage (minus the new score), this film comes off like a high school video project.  Russo and Hinzman have done an injustice to NOTLD fans everywhere.  Avoid this at all costs, unless you're looking for chuckle from some horrible acting and music.",Night of the Living Dead
492,msburnett99,a cool classic,8,16 November 2008,"This movie used to be broadcast on TV every year on Halloween when I used to live in Pittsburgh. One year it was even broadcast in ""unliving color"". (That was how the colorized version was described.) Colorizing the original black and white movie was a huge mistake as the colors wound up looking fake. The ghouls were given green faces and the Molotov cocktails were colored bright orange.There was also another version I remember seeing on TV one year. Someone had done a parody of the movie by splicing together scenes from the movie and dubbing in their own dialog. In their version, the people in the farmhouse were hosting a party but everyone forgot to bring the groceries! So the problem became how to fight off angry and hungry party guests. In this case, just hand them whatever you can grab (wood, nails, etc). In the scene where Ben flips over the table, the dialog was: ""The first thing we got to do is get rid of the table! If they don't see a table, they won't expect to eat!""after he flips over the table: ""Hey Chlorine! This table has better legs than you do!"" ""Oh really? Can it dance?"", replies Chlorine.The movie then ends with the zombies dancing and saying, ""Let's dance!"".As far as I know however, I don't think this version has ever been released on VHS or DVD. But the original is a movie you can have fun with. Just mute the sound and make up your own dialog.",Night of the Living Dead

I remember being very scared about it at the time. As time went on I came across the film in an DVD sale at our local market, didn't pay a lot for it which I think at the time was only £2.99. As being a fan of zombie films I was so excited that I bought the movie and was looking forward to seeing it on that night. I remember watching it on my own with the lights watched off. An I couldn't believe how scary it was. Even though it is just over 40 years old almost. The story was simple, a few people trapped in a house while a zombie outbreak occurs. The music was slow but fitted the picture and slow suspense at that time. Not a lot of gore but for being 1968 you would expect that for a horror film. Without doubt even today with all the CGI affects and improved way of filming. Night of the living dead has to be the best if not one the best horror films ever made. So I'am giving it a rating of a nice 9/10",Night of the Living Dead

As such a boyfriend, I can honestly say I enjoyed being the protector as my woman squealed and hid her face from the screen.This movie was not only a great movie, but a great date movie. Some people today claim that the movie is dated and less than great. I strongly disagree for two reasons. The first is that -in my opinion- it was the first zombie film that was intelligent and fun to watch. The second is that the death of the hero Ben was then and is now unexpected. Heroes/heroines don't usually die then or now. Living Dead was,is and will always be a great fun movie.

496,ecarlson-2,Not a horror fan,4,11 November 2003,"Certainly a classic horror flick, but horror movies are terribly overrated as a film genre.  There's thrills and chills, but there's a good reason why most of these films - even the wildly successful ones - are low-budget: they're easy to make.  These should be graded on a sliding scale.

Romero's attention to detail and visual style are top notch.  He has perfected the art of story telling and gives us the lucky viewer our moneys worth and much more.  Definately one of my favorite three movies but not my favorite of the Dead trilogy.

498,marshalltheartist,Masterful Social Commentary on 1960's America,10,2 November 2020,"Firstly, Night of the Living Dead needs to be understood as a period piece, as it was made as a social commentary about 1960's America, so many of its qualities which modern viewers may view as campy are not merely appropriate, but also entirely necessary. Any modern retelling of this story would entirely miss the point, especially with ""better"" acting, since it wouldn't represent the mainstream culture of the time. The ""living dead"" is a metaphor for the mindless masses who complacently contribute to violence against minorities just by going with the flow, doing what everyone else is doing. One person corrupts others, who corrupts others, who corrupt others. It's aggression against the outgroup, often coercing them into joining, which is why the characters are all endangered not so much by the ghouls as they are by themselves and by each other. The final death of the movie isn't even a metaphor, nor does it involve the living dead. It's just a white law enforcer murdering am unarmed black man who he ostensibly mistook for the enemy.If you want a modern counterpart with ""good"" acting, then I recommend Shaun of the Dead, which is more about early 21st century England, and also tells some funny jokes!",Night of the Living Dead
499,revermed,Still carrying the scary,7,19 September 2012,"How do I even review this movie? I first saw it late at night when I was a child and is frightened the snot out of me. It's effect on me has gone beyond being a ""good"" or ""bad"" movie. (it didn't help that my older brother told me it was based on a true story)Outside of that, I think one of the reasons it holds up so well is that the filming approach is almost documentary in its style, so that even though the premise seems ridiculous, you still get the uneasy feeling that for the characters, this night of horror is very, very real. One other observation that probably is not very original is that the conflicts between the characters in the house ratchets up the tension; it's not just the monsters outside that will get them- they might very well end up destroying each other.",Night of the Living Dead

This Movie was the blue print for every ZOMBIE Movie made after it. The filming of it in B&W due to George A. Romero's lack of Funding of the movie actually makes in more effective to look at. Of Course, it isn't as gory as Dawn Of The Dead or Day Of The Dead(The sequels to this) but it looks A lot more in the CLASSIC style of B&W Vampire movies of the 1930's, 40's and 50's, IMO. George A.

The Antagonists are us only dead, they are all different, some rotting,some all busted up, some limbless, I could go on & on. They ""ALL have these things in common, They are dead, You can't reason with them, they can only be put down by destroying the brain so even if you were all armed to the teeth no matter how slow they are, if you made a break for it at night when you can't see more than 10 feet in front of you, you will eventually be caught & be eaten alive by corpses unless you turn your gun on yourself if possible. The worst thing to me would be just waiting for the inevitable along with the tension of the other individuals arguing amongst each other to make matters worse. Give me the fast zombies, at least it would be over quick. With fast zombies you wouldn't have time to get that scared, they'd be on you like that, with the slow ones, the anticipation of them finally trying to break in would be too much.",Night of the Living Dead
502,room217shining,Excellent zombie movie devised by George A. Romero,9,9 April 2005,"Ultra black and white. Nail-biting suspense. Ahead of its time(1968). Acceptable acting bymain characters in an unknown cast. Good music. Low budget effects. Right off the bat, the first character should havelistened to the radio... A radio announcer reports, ""...there is anepidemic of mass murder being committed by a virtual army ofunidentified assassins. The murders are taking place in villages, cities, rural homes, and suburbs with no apparent pattern or reason for the slaying. It seems to be a sudden general explosion of mass homicide...""The main character,Ben, an African American male, shows Romero's genius in film-making for the avant-garde approach. The army of zombies keeps advancing on the boundaries of the house that the ""innocent"" living have boarded up. The weapons are basic, with Ben brandishing a 30/30 rifle. Ben does however stirike a woman. Other survivors enter the house. The men vie for the pursuit of the alpha-male position. Zombies are creepy crawling outside the house while the living characters bicker and plan their fate. While the characters are watching television the possible reason for why zombies exist is given. Neat molotov cocktail scene. Fire and shooting the zombies in the head is their kryptonite. Some eating of human flesh. ""Psycho"" stabbing. Scenes of nature are disturbed by a ubiquitous helicopter that is in all three George A. Romero movies, ""Dawn of The Dead""(1978) and ""Day of The Dead""(1985). Still photographs depict a Hitchcockian twist.",Night of the Living Dead

Possibly...I mean seriously I have seen this movie and it's remake, and all of the sequels (unofficial and official), and their remakes, and all I can say is that this movie is not that great. Maybe back in 1968 it was an incredible film but it has not held up through the passage of time (though there is a nostalgia/cult that allows it to still be watchable). The remake was OK because the character of Barbra actually did something other than sit there like a comatose victim. And the ending was such a downer... (the all die, even the survivor of the night) I mean how can one feel for a character if they never even get to the end credits without getting a shot to the head.The reason this is getting a five is because as bad as this was...

504,jfreela,The original is the best,10,20 July 2005,"I first saw ""Night of the living dead"" on TV as a kid and it scared me. Since then I have viewed it many times and own it on DVD. It's a staple around Halloween time. It was a groundbreaking horror movie and was often imitated but never duplicated. Constant copycat movies may make it seem tame by today's standards, but it is still creepy. The humor, intentional or not, is priceless. This movie set the bar for what was to follow. It's low budget ambiance and black and white film set it apart from any other film. It's also maybe the first film to contain a black hero. Watching this movie late at night with the lights off would be recommended. Watch it to be scared, watch it as a goof, but if you're a horror film fan, definitely watch it.",Night of the Living Dead
505,du-lugter-1,Seven people in a house surrounded by zombies...,10,11 August 2005,"This might very well be the greatest horror movie ever made! Geaorge A. Romero has brewed together a rather effective suspense by combining the classical horror elements(flashing lightnings, screaming GIRLS - not men!!!) and the never-before-seen element of sheer massacre. The movie is simply put together of an almost perfect mix of calm sit-back-and-relax-for-a-while scenes and grotesque slaughtering of people. It might be that the plot seems a bit thin, compared to other horror movies, but this is after all a gore movie and not a thriller, and the context of the story fits well into the universe of George A. Romero's Living Dead Trilogy. This is a great capture of how people will react to an uncommon situation; a frustrating situation never before experienced: People screaming, not knowing what to do and therefore hiding in desert areas. And of course we have to complement IL' George for his constantly depressing the viewers, simply using the panic that erupts from the lack of experience. We must say that George A. Romero is the movie world's Master of the Macabre!",Night of the Living Dead

A film which has since become a modern classic and which can be argued to have influenced every horror film since. I like very much all the zombies films and this is really the mother of all. All the zombies we see in the films of today are based on the zombies that George Romero introduces here (rigor mortis movement, flesh eaters and the other things). Besides all the things the somber and horrifying environment is very well achieved. If we keep in mind the negligible budget of this movie, the truth is that itself could be consider a masterpiece. Was not a coincidence that ""Night of the Living Dead"" has been added to the United States National Film Registry in 1999. There is a remake of this movie (1990) and it is also good but i will always prefer the original version.

Nearly forty years later, I am still horrified at the thought of the zombies eating the intestines. That said, I am taping it now and watching it tonight!!The thing that made it most frightening was the way the movie was shot in black and white with great effect of the shadows cast over the characters and the movement of the zombies. Also the fact that the zombies were so unstoppable led to the suspense. The victims stuck in the farmhouse with no way out and trying to keep the zombies at bay lead to many, many nightmares for me.",Night of the Living Dead

By the way, I am 44 years old. I have seen many horror flicks but this one takes the cake. I refuse, even to this day will not watch this movie. In my mind, I feel that this movie should have won an Oscar, because it was so horrifying. I have yet to see another horror movie since then that scarred me so bad. If you stop and think about it, horror films to this day do not have the impact that Night of the Living Dead did. There have been so many movies trying to follow in the footsteps of Night of the Living Dead, but they did not even come close. This is the scariest movie that I have ever seen.

509,splatter96,Poor updates to a great scary film,3,11 October 1999,"I just purchased Russo's 30th anniversary Night on VHS as well as Romero's original (also on VHS). I was very impressed with Anchor Bay's remastering of the video quality on both versions. I liked the way they started showing Romero's version non-remastered, then stopped and re-started with the higher quality video for comparison. It was _well_ worth my 6.99, and I am quite impressed with the difference between it and the crappy EP-recorded tape I got about 5 years ago.Now on to Russo's ""updated"" pile. Although it was interesting to see that Bill Hinzman looks almost the same now as he did in '68 (he probably needs less make-up now LOL), the new introductory footage was useless, and detracted from the surprise beginning of the original Night. This is one instance where Hitchcock's definition of suspense is outweighed by the initial shock of our first encounter with one of the walking dead. The idea of a priest/minister in 1968 who looks like a 1999 gang-banger is a little too farfetched even for my overactive imagination, and Scott Licina's limited musical skills were at least better than his acting.This segues into the new musical soundtrack. I didn't think Licina's new music was horrible, but I did think that the poor engineering that was used to replace the old music helped to even further ruin what was once a wonderful, scary film. The stock music of Romero's original helped add to the eerie atmosphere, and it was obvious that the original soundtrack was not easy to change, and that the separate dialogue, effects, and music tracks of the original were not available. There are very audible level changes when the original soundtrack levels were reduced to mask the original music. You can also hear the difference in the sound effects at these same points. This is because the new audio editor (Russo himself?) could not separate the old music from the dialogue and effects.I don't think it was a waste of my time to view Mr. Russo's attempt at what he thought was making a great film even better, but I will not recommend that anyone else sit through it, especially not someone who has not seen the original masterpiece.Remember, the opinions are mine, although anyone else can see (and hear) the factual observations I have made.Dave / Splatter",Night of the Living Dead

Certainly, the notion of the threat against society coming from within a community rather than from outside is something Hitchcock helped pioneer.I think the reason I feel this movie is so good is because it's dated yet still manages to scare you.  I figure any movie that has had as much impact as this one, any film that has been so crucial do the development of a genre, yet remains scary and effective after 30 years deserves some credit.When I first saw the 'Dead' trilogy I thought they were just graphic horror movies.  Since then, I have delved into film theory and genre criticism and discovered layer upon layer of self-reflexivity and meaning.  Often I think films just possess these characteristics due to social influences, but in the case of the 'Dead' trilogy it seems Romero was deliberately playing on the fears and concerns of a nation - the US.",Night of the Living Dead

It was like watching a bad Japanese dubbed film. Did they even bother to watch this before it was released?Reading the notes included with the DVD you can tell how 'important' this movie was to Scott Licina anyway. His words were ""I didn't really care what the public thought about what we were doing."" Boy, was that obvious!!  The soundtrack does not fit, they should have left the original soundtrack at least on the ""98 version"" that way we would just have the movie remastered, no tampering.The new scenes didn't belong in either. It seemed they just wanted a chance to put their wives, daughters, etc.. into the film. ""Daddy, can I be in the reissue of Night of the Living Dead?"" ""Well... uh. sure! I'll find away to edit you in!!""I'll admit the picture is better, and I might have been easier on the film if the audio and video were synchronized. But with the re-issue of a classic I would have believed they would at least get that right! That really detracted from the film. I feel sorry for those watching it for the first time.It seemed strange Romero wasn't involved in the film. If he was busy, couldn't they have waited until he was available?

It has gone from Romero's Living Dead franchise, to the likes of The Walking Dead and Zombeavers. There have been few constants between the films as the zombie films evolved; the clueless blonde who lacks the basic concept of human preservation. It's a common trope of the blonde dying first. It was introduced with Barbra in Night of the Living Dead. She went into shock, and almost stopped caring what happened to her. She ignored everything else going on, because she saw her brother. She willingly walked into the arms of the largest threat of the film. She lacked any sense of self preservation.Overall, it was a watchable film. It leaves you curious if they will be able to survive the zombie apocalypse. It is a good jumping off point for the genera. It has things that became classics. Zombies are afraid of fire.

The deathly and left surroundings and the fact that the tale takes place mainly at night seem the hopeless increase situation of the group. .

520,UK_Student,The prequel to Dawn of the Dead,7,13 March 2008,"I know this is the one that gets the critical plaudits, but I suspect that I'm not alone in preferring its more gory and action-packed sequel, Dawn of the Dead. Perhaps it's the black and white snobbery that favours NOTLD, but the admittedly garish Dawn never seems to receive the respect it merits. It's safe for connoisseurs to admire this one, because it can be passed off as 'art', while its sequel is relegated to the splatter category, rubbing shoulders (or stumps of shoulders) with the Texas Chainsaw Massacre and such like.Night of the Living Dead is a great movie, but IMHO Dawn beats it hands down.",Night of the Living Dead

My only guess is that at the time it was released some 40 years ago it must have made such an impact. Young people then (now old people) must relate to it in such a way that reminds them of their youth and thus they give the movie such a great review. The truth however is this movie is absolutely HORRIBLE and further proof that you can't trust the ratings. Total waste of time. Not scary. Bad acting. Just ridiculous. If you are under the age of 40, skip this piece of garbage. Bad. Bad. Bad. Very bad. And what is with this review thing that makes you enter 10 lines??? IMDb, get with it.

523,flhamm808,"This is, the true seminal zombie movie.",9,23 May 2010,"In 1968 America found it's self-mired in the grip of social, political, and racial upheaval. The Vietnam War was exploding and the body count was broadcast every night into the dubious comforts of our households. Generations were clashing, seeing each other as the enemy. Battle lines were being drawn over the color of a person's skin, or the length of their hair. Heavy stuff huh? And your probably saying, ""BT! What does this have to do with the movie?"" well, you'll see as you read on. During these times, B movies rain supreme. Turning out of Hollywood faster than Japan can turn out Pokemon cards. One of those B movies in small, black and white venture from John Russo, and George Romero, would go on to become one of the most influential, and important horror films of all time. It would become legendary, as a film that not only started an entire sub-genre, but also accurately and without apology, mirrored all the strife that those times had to offer. That film was Night of the Living Dead.The movies plot is simple enough, a young woman named Barbara played by Judith O'Dea, and her brother, Johnnie played by Bill Moseley, visit their fathers grave at a cemetery in the rural backwoods Pennsylvania. The first hint of socio political commentary this film has to offer takes place in the first few minutes. As Barbara's brother mocks her beautiful prayer, scoffing at the notion of ""Church of God"". For 1968 this was pretty risqué stuff. Within minutes they are attacked by a zombie, which kills her brother. Soon several zombies, eager to consume her warm tasty flesh, pursue Barbara. She takes shelter in an old farmhouse and soon finds our heroine has company. The films hero Ben, played by Duane Jones, arrives on the scene also seeking refuge in the farmhouse. Ben was unlike anything ever seen in Hollywood at that point. He was African American, and standard convention advised against having an African American as your main hero. To compound things he wasn't a suburban African American. Nope, this brother was from the streets and he let the viewers know it.In their first twenty minutes with each other, Barbara is more scared of Ben then she is of the ghoulish army in camp outside the house. Again, Romero perfectly reflected the racial turmoil of the time. Soon five other refugees from the nightmare, including Harry Cooper, played by Karl Hardman, join them who typifies the average white, middle age, and xenophobic businessman of the era. His daughter Karen, played by Kyra Schon, and his wife Helen, played by Marilyn Eastman, who's beginning for the first time in her life to question her husband's judgments and motives. Again the movie speaks of deeper issues, touching on woman's liberation and the classic of all these problems, old money values.Later in the movie we deal with the issue of patricide. When the Cooper's daughter, Karen, who previously had been bitten by a zombie before they got to the farmhouse, dies. And then comes back as one of the walking dead, and kills, and eats, her mother and father. After barricading themselves in the house, cabin fever soon begins to pick up the groove, inflicting more damage than even the zombies can do, culminating in a desperate struggle against not only the cannibalistic hordes outside, but against each other as well.Perhaps the most memorable moment in Night of the Living Dead is the ending. Romero provides a conclusion, so shocking and so unexpected, that the critics of the era were unsure what to make of it. Audience reaction at the time was one of strong disbelief. Another interesting aspect of Romero's zombie methods is that no explanation of the dead rising and eating the living is ever given. In this film it is speculated that a recent space probe returned from Venus may have caused the change due to background radiation. It's important to remember that at the time, America was in the grip of a nuclear war fever, and the danger of radiation was on every bodies mind.Budgetary restraints and a lack of experience may have added some rough edges to Night but they don't really diminish the film; they actually add to its surreal atmosphere. For instance, the camera work is stationary, never changing position. Each shot is from the same, locked vantage point. Most of the shots are very tightly framed and from low and skewed angles. Sometimes you can see the ceiling. Sometimes the camera is unsteady and shaky. It all helps create the claustrophobia and unsteadiness that's so integral to the film's power and message. The walls are closing in; the wall of zombies outside, and the wall of mistrust and fear inside.The other rough edge I'll mention, if you can even call it that, is the acting. It ranges from quite good to ""I'm glad she didn't have more lines."" Again, this only makes the proceedings of the film more odd and maybe a little more unsettling. If you can suspend your disbelief for the dead rising chances are some stilted acting won't bother you.Night of the Living Dead truly deserves the praise and acclaim that has been showered upon it in the last few decades. There have been many sequels and remakes of the movie, and most of them are good. However, the 1990 remake, which was done in color, I considered to be an abomination. Sorry Tom Savini. If ever a horror movie were a masterpiece, this one is it. An important milestone in cinematic history, and proof of what independent filmmakers can do. Night of the Living Dead is the seminal zombie movie.",Night of the Living Dead

The darkness of the movie was improved being that this was a black and white film.  Romero came up with an original idea, which has been lacking in modern-day horror films.  Give me NOLD any day over these new films.  Plus, how can you go wrong when you have Savini doing to special effects?",Night of the Living Dead
526,bsandrew-2,Colorized Night of the Living Dead,10,30 October 2005,"While I'm obviously biased, the Legend Films colorized version is by far the best release of ""Night Of The Living Dead"". The commentary by Mike Nelson of Mystery Science Theater 3000 is well worth the price of the DVD but the restored black and white version and creatively colorized version (both on the same disk) makes this a must have release. The special Mike Nelson autographed version is available while supplies last but the special version can only be ordered on the Legend Films web site.Rosemary Horvath, Creative Director of Legend Films and Barry Sandrew, President of Legend Films were the color designers of the film. The attempt was to create an uneasy feel to the overall film with moonlight filling most dark rooms and greenish yellow zombies. The fire scenes look photo realistic and add to the film's tension.This film was originally shot in black and white for budgetary reasons and there is little in the way of cinematographic strategy that precludes a colorized version. The viewer has a choice on this Legend Films DVD release to view Night Of The Living Dead in restored black and white or in the new colorized version. The Legend Films colorization process used on this cult classic is the most sophisticated ever produced and has been used on such films as Scorcese's ""The Aviator"", Mark of Zorro, ""Heidi"" ""Miracle on 34th Street"", ""Reefer Madness"" ""House on Haunted Hill"", ""Carnival of Souls"" and many other classics.",Night of the Living Dead
527,theofficialleaderman,"An impressive, but nonetheless flawed classic.",8,16 June 2016,"First off, my hat is of to George A. Romero for pulling this movie off in the first place. It is an impressive feat of filmmaking and very inspiring to indie-filmmakers everywhere. This film is also notable for basically creating what we today know as the zombie- sub genre. There are some genuine scares in this film and the make-up is top notch in most cases. I also found myself caring a lot for most of the characters (not Barbara).That being said, this movie is far from perfect. I'm very much willing to forgive and look past almost all the technical flaws in the film considering both the shoe-string budget as well as the conditions and time during which it was made. My biggest gripe with this film doesn't have anything to do with any of that though. This films biggest issue, in my opinion, is the dialogue. It's clunky and repetitive, and the film suffers greatly because of it. Some of the acting and line-delivery is pretty bad also.Over all, this film is still a must watch for any horror fan, and don't worry about it feeling dated, because it holds up surprisingly well. One last thing I have to praise in this film is the ending. It is completely unexpected and hit me pretty hard. Props for that.Night of the Living Dead is a classic that holds up surprisingly well but suffers from bad dialogue and less than stellar acting by a few of the actors. Nevertheless, I recommend this film to any and all horror fans as well as someone just looking for a good film.7/10.",Night of the Living Dead
528,lynstephan,Better than I expected,7,19 April 2014,"WARNING: MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS. I've heard about this movie before, but I've never seen it until I got it on a collection of zombie movies I got from Walmart. When I first started watching it, I noticed it was in black and white. I thought it was going to be a silent film, but fortunately it wasn't. In the beginning, a brother and sister a driving a car. Then, a zombie shows up. The sister is separated from her brother and is safe inside a house with a man she never met before. He uses some wood and nails to block the door and windows. In the meantime, a bunch of zombies are very slowing walking towards the house. Later, the guy figures out that the zombies are scared of fire. He sets a sofa/couch on fire to slow them down. Well anyway, I think it was a pretty good movie. It has an interesting story and good acting. If you have any free time, you should check it out.",Night of the Living Dead
529,petpalsparade,"Night of the Living Dead latest re-release called ""SURVIVOR'S CUT",10,24 May 2005,"Wow, it's true, a new version of the 1968 Romero classic. And yes, it does do the original justice. It's called ""Night of the Living Dead SURVIVOR'S CUT.""Before you jump to conclusions...I realize that some folks just don't like sequels or remakes no matter how well done, and after a number of horrible re-releases thru the years (like the ""anniversary"" editions) I too wondered just how good this new version could be.The story has been rearranged a little with some new footage, and some very cool color and special-effects. You'll see new scenes like ""flashbacks"" and cool gory skulls. Those of you with a keen eye may like to take special notice in order to see the use of new camera angles and movement that creates perspective and a new dynamic throughout the film. This film moves much faster than the original, it runs about 72 minutes. So I give a very positive review, and I hope to get my hands on a high-resolution DVD some day.In the meantime, take my advice: open your mind, and check it out FREE.

530,glennrhoads,Low Budget Cult Film,1,27 May 2015,"This film has a small cult-like group of extremely devoted fans who can watch the movie umpteen times and act like the movie is some kind of masterpiece while the rest of us know the movie stinks. It's similar to the Rocky Horror Picture show in that regard.It's easily one of very worst films I've ever managed to sit through entirely and that only because I was an undergrad and there was absolutely nothing else to do that evening. The only nice thing I can say about the movie is that the decision to make it in black and white was the correct one. There are few scenes that would have been too gross in color. Also, grossness is not horror. If you watch a war picture for example and see a body get blown apart, that is not horror, that is just being gross.The ending was particularly bad. If the movie had actually been half-way decent, then ending would have ruined the movie. But there is nothing to ruin so the ending becomes the capstone to a thoroughly stupid, boring, unentertaining movie.",Night of the Living Dead

The social commentary is pretty weak too. And just how many recently unburied dead are there in the cities or anywhere in the US? Since only unburied recently dead were brought back to zombie status, there must have been a killing spree before the Venus probe blew up. Why do characters keep forgetting to aim for the head after hearing the news on how to kill the zombies and after their own experience? Why did it take so long for the parents to come back as zombies after they died when the report said it only takes minutes for the zombie to come back? How come the woman at the top of the stairs never came back? Why if the young couple are burned to death is their flesh and muscles, etc not cooked? Ben is shot well before he comes to window so George could have established better that the Cops knew he may not have been a zombie. Not the movie I remember, sad really.",Night of the Living Dead

It was made on a meager budget and still shone better than the 100+ million dollar movies made today. The entire movie has a very foreboding, melancholy feeling to it. Immediately, at the start of the movie, there's a mood and feeling to the movie that makes you think that something is just not right. Duane Jones in the lead at Ben is brilliant, brave, and still human (in a literal as well as metaphorical way).

The majority of the characters are pathetic in almost every sense, was I the only person who really just wanted to smack Barbara? The only good part was when the girl Killed her parents, I was rooting for her to dispose of the rest of them. Admitted the film was probably ahead of its time and was a first for many, but like the Exorcist and Blair Witch, why does it scare people? Why did people run from cinemas screaming their heads off, really do some people really have no life?, can't they make the distinction between film and reality?",Night of the Living Dead
537,dpastrovich-89940,"They're coming to get you, Barbara",8,7 May 2018,"Zombies have never been more popular than they are now and we have Night Of The Living Dead to thank for that. While not the first zombie movie, it is the first that defined zombies as living dead flesh eaters. Previous movies depicted zombies as people under voodoo spells.What I like about the story is that it's never revealed what causes the zombies to rise up. Sure, they mention a theory involving a space probe returning from Venus being deliberately exploded in the Earth's atmosphere when radiation was detected. However, they never reveal whether that is true or not. I think it's scarier not knowing the actual cause.One of the most charming aspects about this film is that it looks older than it actually happens to be. To put it in perspective, Night Of The Living Dead was released in 1968 - the same year as 2001: A Space Odyssey. If one were to view those films side-by-side, you would probably think they weren't made in the same decade; let alone the same year.It's not exactly a technical masterpiece in terms of editing. Often there are scenes that are supposed to take place at night but were clearly shot during daytime and vice versa. There's also a very noticeable jump cut during a conversation between Harry and Helen in the basement.The makeup effects are very subtle. Part of this is likely due to having a low budget, but also because they establish that these are the recently deceased. These are not rotting corpses that climbed out of their grave. Tom Savini had originally signed on to do the makeup effects, but had to pull out when he was called to duty by the US Army to serve as a combat photographer in Vietnam. On one hand, I can't help but wonder how Savini would have done the zombie makeup. On the other hand, perhaps being a witness to real horrors of The Vietnam War helped him become such an amazing horror makeup effects artist.Many people think there is a commentary about racism hidden in this movie. While I can see where people get that impression, it's my understanding that George A. Romero didn't intend that. When he and John A. Russo were writing the story, they didn't plan on making the character black. They simply hired the best actor for the part of Ben. Duane Jones (Ben) thought that the movie should promote that fact that it was one of the first movies with a black lead actor, but Romero thought it was better that they didn't (a decision he's apparently had some second thoughts about).One of the most beautiful things about this film is that it's in the public domain, so it's very easy to find and watch for free. This is due to a copyright error. Originally, the film was supposed to be called Night Of Anubis (the Egyptian god associated with the afterlife), but it was decided to change the title because not many people understood what it was referencing. The title was then changed to Night Of The Flesh Eaters. When it was discovered that there was already a film with ""Flesh Eaters"" in the title, the filmmakers decided to change the title again to avoid being confused with that movie. The title was finally changed to Night Of The Living Dead. However, when they made the new title frames for Night Of The Dead, the film distributor forgot to put the copyright notice on it.I don't want to spoil anything, but if you're looking for a film where the heroes walk off into the sunset after vanquishing the living dead, this is not the film for you. The tone of Night Of The Living Dead is very somber from the beginning to the very end. I saw this when I was younger and was upset with the way it ended. Now that I've watched it a few more times, I can appreciate just how gutsy the writers were.Without question, this is a classic. It has been selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Film Registry. It's a film that should be appreciated not only by horror fans, but film fans in general. It's a perfect demonstration that you don't need a large budget to make a great film - just some creativity and originality. It will continue to live on through new fans who will discover it's infectious storytelling...much like a zombie.",Night of the Living Dead
