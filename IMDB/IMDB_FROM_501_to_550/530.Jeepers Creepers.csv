0,Leofwine_draca,Childish shocks throughout,2,8 August 2016,"This teen horror flick looks like it might be a little different from others. In the first half hour, we're offered a brief but tense re-run of the truck attack in DUEL, and a superbly spine-tingling shot of a mysterious figure dumping a body into what looks like a pipe. From then on the film overdoes on atmosphere and brings to mind some of the same fear of the unknown as films like THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. Following the male lead's descent into the pit, there are one or two effective shock scenes and a nicely gruesome image involving a room covered in naked human bodies. And from then on, my friends, it all goes downhill pretty quickly, undoing any of the horror of the beginning.The scene in which the two teens discover that the ""Creeper"" has been rooting through and sniffing their used laundry is laughable rather than scary, and a gross miscalculation on the film-makers' part. From this point the film becomes a road movie which becomes more absurd with each mile. Our main characters stop off at a remote house and see a comic relief bad-mouthed old woman (someone evidently saw LAKE PLACID) get killed by the ""Creeper"", and then manage to run it over repeatedly in their car. Instead of driving off like a normal person would do, instead they sit and wait for the creature to regrow itself back together and come after them again. Scenes are stretched out with endless waiting, making the agony seem like an eternity, and then comes a finale which is one of the most ludicrous of all.Our protagonists hole up inside a police station in the middle of nowhere which just happens to be run by a night-shift skeleton staff of about thirty officers! Of course most of them are brutally dispatched by the ""Creeper"", which then proceeds to kidnap the male lead. Then, after a graphic shock sequence, the film just suddenly ends as though they had run out of film. Sure, the ending is downbeat and surprising, not to mention mean-spirited, but scary? Not a chance. Just plain dumb, abrupt and badly envisaged. Other contrived plot elements involve a female psychic who turns up to offer advice and scares, and the ""Jeepers Creepers"" song of the title which keeps recurring for no real reason.The basic plot bears resemblance to THE HITCHER, with innocent characters being pursued by unstoppable killers. Ironically the killer itself is this film's biggest weakness. Initially a genuinely spooky character in slouch hat and ragged clothes, the Creeper eventually reveals itself to be a reptile bird-man, complete with huge flapping wings and sharp, pointed teeth, with which it eats human flesh. Now I'm sorry, but the image of this creature is just ludicrous and suited more to a fantasy film, not a horror flick which is trying to be realistic and thus scary. I've heard this film being over-hyped as one of the scariest made in the last ten years, but this is just nonsense. JEEPERS CREEPERS follows the worrying trend of substituting alarming ""shock"" moments (periods of quiet leading up to a sudden, loud noise or burst of movie, in conjunction with something unexpected happening on screen - see WHAT LIES BENEATH for more of this) for real horror, which makes for one lame viewing experience.The acting from the two leads doesn't help much either. The actor and actress aren't awfully bad, it's just that the two characters are so unappealingly stupid and caught up in post-modern witticisms that you end up disliking them. There are no supporting characters either, aside from the ""Creeper"", and that isn't human. Everyone else gets killed. In the end the film resorts to blood-and-guts scares involving bouncing severed heads, tongues being pulled out, and people having their hearts torn out which is pretty disappointing. Director Victor Salva should never be allowed to make another film after blighting us with this and 1987's CLOWNHOUSE; here he shows that he hasn't progressed as a film-maker at all, still intent on bombarding us with childish shocks instead of real mind-numbing, adult horror. The saddest thing of all is that JEEPERS CREEPERS enjoyed a successful theatrical run, which means that a sequel can't be far off...",Jeepers Creepers
1,SnoopyStyle,well done horror,7,15 October 2013,"Bickering brother and sister, Darry (Justin Long) and sister Patricia Jenner (Gina Philips), are driving home cross country from college. Suddenly they are harassed by a rusty ugly truck. Later on they see the truck at an old church where the driver seems to be dumping bodies into a drainage pipe. The truck races out and runs them off the road. The truck continues on, and Darry convinces Patricia to go back to investigate the pipe. What they find there sets off a series of horrors and killings.This is a well done horror movie. Victor Salva has created a new evil in the movie universe. The first part is mostly just brother and sister interaction. Long and Philips have great sibling chemistry. They just feel like people who have known each other for all their lives.The major problem I have is the motivation behind going to look for bodies. It's way too crazy to go back to the house of horrors if you don't have to. The sister was completely right. They are better to try to find some cops. They got run off by the truck, so the cops would have to go to the church to investigate. There could have been others at the church. It's more than the usual 'Don't go down there!' complaint.I'm glad that they finally got the cops. Usually the cops never get call in these kinds of horror. It does lead to a well made series of kills by the monster. I wish the monster could look better, but it's pretty good for a B-movie horror. Both parts of the movie work on their own terms. The first is much more atmospheric. The second is more traditional run and hunt. If only they could set up better why the siblings went to investigate the church in the first place.",Jeepers Creepers
2,claudio_carvalho,A Great Beginning of a Horror Movie,8,3 July 2004,"While driving on a lonely road, Darry Jenner (Justin Long) and his sister ""Trish"" Jenner (Gina Phillips) are frightened by an old truck, which passes by their car in high speed. Later, they see the truck parked near a church, and the weird driver dropping a package in a piping digged on the ground. Darry decides to investigate and finds a hole with lots of corpuses. They inform their finding to the police and they meet an weird creature chasing them. They are advised by a clairvoyant to runaway from that being, which every twenty-third spring for twenty-three days would get to eat. Yesterday I saw this movie for the second time. Its first forty minutes is very scary and looks like `Duel' and `The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' together in one movie. However, in the moment that Trish goes to a strange house in the middle of nowhere to make a phone call to anybody specific, the story gets lost, becoming full of flaws and unexplained events. The strange powerful creature is not well resolved and the movie does not have an end. I bought `Jeepers Creepers II' on DVD expecting to find a good conclusion to many points that were not well explained in the first part. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil) : `Olhos Famintos' (`Famished Eyes')",Jeepers Creepers
3,kosmasp,Tense,8,15 September 2010,"When I watched this the first time quite a few years ago, it seemed like it would be a one-off. Now they plan the 3rd one, which is going to come out in 2011. Good or bad, the same director will be at helm, who claimed back then, that he wanted to make sure, that there wouldn't be any sequels. He had it all planned out (a story element would make this ""impossible"" to happen).But I'm not going into detail about that, because I thought the movie was genuinely scary and creepy. I have to admit, that I wasn't aware of an obvious reference, that the title might have suggested. If you know it, it won't hit you as hard as myself, when it gets revealed at the end. But still, if you can go through the beginning and bear with it, when it gets pretty action-y towards the end, then you will enjoy it. I know I did. But I can understand, that some people did expect different things from it. I can only speak for myself and say that I liked the fact, that this was made the way it was. It dares to be different and does not give you a bunch of teenagers being hunt down by one guy ... Not to mention, that all this has a very cool conclusion (the main idea if you wanna call it that) in the end.",Jeepers Creepers
4,gavin6942,A Solid Horror Film,6,30 December 2013,"A brother (Justin Long) and sister (Gina Phillips) driving home for spring break encounter a flesh-eating creature (Jonathan Breck) in the isolated countryside that is on the last day of its ritualistic eating spree.This is possibly the biggest horror film of the last 15 years that I had not yet seen, so it feels good to have it off my list. And, as it turns out, I actually rather liked it. Not that it is the greatest film, but surely worthy of its success.The Creeper is a good addition to the list of horror villains, and his persona is only improved by the level of mystery surrounding him. Is he a demon? A cursed man? Or something altogether unheard of? On the DVD's deleted scenes, he even speaks a little bit. I am glad this was cut -- although he may have a human shape, I do not like to think of him as being human. It ruins the mystery.While not a perfect film, it is a good addition to the horror genre, and Victor Salva (much maligned with good reason) may rightly be called a Master of Horror if someone wanted to go there...",Jeepers Creepers
5,lee_eisenberg,the theme song,10,24 July 2005,"A horror movie produced by Francis Ford Coppola?! Is that really possible? You betcha. And ""Jeepers Creepers"" is not all that bad. Gina Phillips and Justin Long play Trish and Darry Jenner, who come across The Creeper, a creature that comes alive every 23 years so that it can spend 23 days eating. By eating, I of course mean humans.Until I saw this movie, I didn't even know that there was a song ""Jeepers Creepers"". But apparently there was. It sounded like it came from the '30s or '40s. A little while after I saw this movie, I saw ""The Day of the Locust"", which had another version of the song. Anyway, this is sort of a gross movie, but worth seeing.",Jeepers Creepers
6,jboothmillard,Jeepers Creepers,6,20 June 2005,"If you have seen the first ever Steven Spielberg film, Duel, then you will see a similar sort of concept in this film. Two teenagers are driving around and get lost. They find an empty ranch (where they were trying for help), then they see a pipe in the ground. The boy goes inside and he sees a room of bodies on walls. When he gets out they drive away as fast as they can. Now they are being pursued by an unknown driver in a truck, like Duel. You do see the driver though, he is called The Creeper, a dried up monster with a cloak and hat. Whenever he is close they hear the song ""Jeepers Creepers"". The ending of the film is really spooky. Good!",Jeepers Creepers
7,ma-cortes,Interesting and stirring horror movie with an eerie and creepy monster,7,30 July 2008,"The Jenner brothers, named Patricia(Gina Philips) and Derry(Justin Long)are travelling across the rural South. They stop to investigate an old dark refuge what looks like a killing , but results to be a bizarre monster , Creeper(Jonathan Breck)which appears each new 23rd spring, after several years. He needs humans for a good barbecue and the teenagers brothers are menaced by the murderous maniac Creeper. The brothers flee and looking for to save their own skin , when the cannibal go after them.This exciting movie with original monster, displays terror, suspense,cannibalism, thrills, and lots of blood and gore. The genuinely scary monster packs an excellent make-up, is played by Jonathan Breck who performs a double role as a bald cop; furthermore appears the veteran Eileen Brennan as the cat lady who confronts against Creeper. The motion picture is professionally written and directed by Victor Salva , he tries for profundity at the end and blow it. Salva is an expert on suspense's creator of atmospheres, such as he proved in : 'The nature of the beast, Powder, Rites of passage and Clownhouse'.Followed by inferior sequel with Ray Wise and Justin Long appears briefly , realized by the same director, producer: Francis Ford Coppola, American Zoetrope, cameraman: Don E FauntLeroy and musician. Besides, the third part whose screenplay is written and preparing to enter preproduction . The script will have a prologue in the Old West which concerns how Creeper became from Native America folklore",Jeepers Creepers
8,BA_Harrison,Great start; so-so middle; disappointing ending.,5,28 December 2006,"Jeepers Creepers starts with an incredible first 15 minutes that easily misleads one into thinking they are witnessing a truly special horror movie in the Texas Chainsaw Massacre vein. In this tense and exciting opening, two teenagers travelling down a lonely back-road are almost run off the road by a menacing truck; they later see the truck parked by an old church, and witness its driver throwing what appear to be bodies down a rusty shaft.But from this point onwards, the film becomes a mess of clichés and bad plot decisions. Instead of driving to the nearest town to get help, the stupid teens decide to investigate the situation themselves. They discover an underground room decorated with the corpses of hundreds of missing people. Now they do what they should've done in the first placeget the hell out of there! But it's too late, and the killerwhich turns out to be a supernatural bat-winged creature(!)is intent on hunting them down.Salva proves that he is adept at creating suspenseful moments but less capable when putting together a credible script. He introduces some mumbo-jumbo about a psychic who may or may not be able to help the kids, some drivel about the creature feeding for 23 days every 23 years, and ends the film poorly.Jeepers Creepers definitely had potential, and Salva is obviously not without some talent behind the camera, but the end result is distinctly average.",Jeepers Creepers
9,moonspinner55,"""Do you think he's dead?"" ... ""They never are.""",5,7 January 2012,"Writer-director Victor Salva's cheeky thriller, with both supernatural overtones and a twisted-comic bend, is either a derivative slasher about teens in danger or a knowing collection of horror movie clichés (depending on your point of view). Thin story concerns squabbling siblings on a break from college driving through a rural town and running afoul of a cannibalistic, demonic bogeyman who cannot be killed. Exceptionally well-produced for the genre, with a clear, handsome look and a handful of stylish, arresting sequences; however, the outrageousness of Salva's plot escalates to the point where his characters fail to end up meaning much to us...and the mean-spiritedness of the whole concept is depressing rather than darkly amusing. Followed by ""Jeepers Creepers II"" in 2003. ** from ****",Jeepers Creepers
10,Quinoa1984,A film that brings cliches and originality,7,1 September 2001,"Jeepers Creepers is something that gives a sometimes original story, however it also mixes chiches and old movie flashbacks (think of X-Files, Duel and Texas Chain Saw Massacre in relation to this film).  A good thrillride for the second half, with great makeup and effects, even if it shows to have been passed around to make the audience prepared, outside of a creepy ending.  A pass the time type of horror movie; it will most likely please it's targeted audience, but some people might not fall for it. Co-Executive produced by Francis Ford Coppolla (does this film also echo his film The Terror I wonder?)  Grade: B",Jeepers Creepers
11,wes-connors,Eating at the Rose Tattoo,7,1 February 2010,"On their way home from college, bickering siblings Gina Philips and Justin Long (as Trish and Darry Jenner) are nearly run off the Florida highway by a menacing old truck. Catching their collective breaths, Ms. Philips and Mr. Long next see something really, really creepy. From the roadside, they observe, in the distance, a monstrous figure toss a sheet-wrapped body into a tunnel. Investigating the tunnel up close and personal puts brother Long in even greater danger. Older, wiser sister Philips calls it, ""the part in scary movies, where somebody does something really stupid."" This early sequence, featuring Long tunneling into the ""House of Pain"" church basement, certifies writer/director Victor Salva's ""Jeepers Creepers"" as shockingly good horror. And, it's great that Mr. Salva acknowledges characters in these movies are always doing the dumb things necessary for the movie to continue. Philips and Long are endearing siblings, with Salva adding credibility to his characters. The psychic angle is the weakest plot development; but, it does move the story along, and isn't too distracting. The monster (Jonathan Breck) is a grotesque, sexualized success.******* Jeepers Creepers (7/20/01) Victor Salva ~ Justin Long, Gina Philips, Jonathan Breck, Patricia Belcher",Jeepers Creepers
12,Coventry,*almost* very good,6,31 October 2004,"Okay, let's get one thing straight first. Despite of what you'll read in all the other reviews, Jeepers Creepers is NOT the worst movie ever made! I know the entire world holds a grudge against Victor Salva and I know that the ludicrous ending of this film disappointed almost every viewer. Heck, I agree the messy and stupid climax was a giant turnoff. But, due to this atrocious finale, people are actually forgetting that the first hour of this 'Jeepers Creepers' is darn creepy and sublimely photographed. The opening blends classic themes like 'Duel' and 'Texas chainsaw Massacre' as siblings Trish and Darry cruise home over remote highways, playing silly road games. They're menaced by an ugly truck and witness nasty crimes in the cellar of an old church. You're unaware of what all this means and it's an extra appeal that we discover everything at the same time as Trish and Darry. Atmospheric locations, terrific suspense sequences and unpretentious humor throughout the entire first hour really give you the idea that you might be watching the greatest horror effort since 'Scream' ruined the genre.Unfortunately (but understandable), Salva can't uphold his outstanding writing/directing work and Jeepers Creepers shifts from above average teen shocker into lame and redundant supernatural tosh. The creeper is yet another unimpressive new horror icon that looks far too idiotic to be scary and the rituals it follows are laughable. The only worthwhile aspects near the end are the gore and the catchy end-credits song. Too bad, but I think we shouldn't complain this much. The unknown young actors do a reasonably good job and there's a cool supportive role for Eileen Brennan as 'Crazy Cat Lady'. I'd say Jeepers Creepers is at least worth one viewing and don't simply bash it just because everybody else does.",Jeepers Creepers
13,michaelRokeefe,What kind of fiend is this?,6,15 September 2001,"Writer-director Victor Silva presents creepy gore well worth peeking at. A young woman(Gina Philips)and her brother(Justin Long)are on their way home for school break and are forced off the highway by a mysterious driver. The two are then stalked by this monstrous tongue sucking, flesh eating demon. Along the way, the two seek help briefly from an old woman(Eileen Brennan)who is more interested in protecting her numerous cats. Mysteriously, a fortune teller(Patricia Belcher)offers aid to the frightened siblings. The flesh craving fiend is played by Jonathan Breck.If you want something scary, creepy and hair raising...this is it. In places a little slow and disjointed, but JEEPERS CREEPERS is first rate screen terror. As for Miss Philips, ""Baby, where did you get those peepers""?",Jeepers Creepers
14,hitchcockthelegend,"Indeed, where did you get those eyes?",6,23 August 2008,"Siblings Darius and Trish are driving home from college through rural America. They have a brief run in on the road with the driver of a beat up van, later on, on the road side, they observe weird goings-on from the driver of said van, an observation that puts both of them in immense danger.Jeepers Creepers tips its hat off to the creepy horror movies that were all the rage in the 70s and early 80s, boasting genuine suspense and characters fully formed, Jeepers Creepers is something of a refreshing antidote to the ream of horror movies available that line up teenagers purely to be slasher fodder. Lifting it just above average is the fact that our two sibling protagonists have viable discussions before venturing into the realm of horror staple requirements, although the picture is ""B"" movie in substance, it does however attempt to be credible in its story telling.Sadly though, after a wonderfully edgy first half, the picture drops down in standard, the introduction of ""The Creeper"" may well be a necessity, but it shifts the film to such a degree, it rapidly loses its creepy momentum. Not that the second half of the film is a disaster, far from it, it's got a scary fun vibe to it, it's just that it promises so much, but ultimately runs out of steam. Jeepers Creepers was successful enough to spawn inferior sequels, with the ""Creeper"" of the piece firmly entering the horror hall of fame, thus an argument for the film having done its job seems totally viable, it's just sad that it didn't stay on the side of edgy and become a horror classic. 6/10",Jeepers Creepers
15,Theo Robertson,It`s Not Often I See A Film As Insulting As This,1,9 June 2003,"!!!!! SPOILERS !!!!! But after reading this review you won`t want to watch this crapI switched on the TV and was convinced I must be watching MARRIED WITH CHILDREN . Seriously I did , look at the character interaction between Trish and Darry , they`re supposed to be brother and sister but their dialogue seems to consist of slanging matches . In fact I was expecting the dialogue to degenerate into "" Hey big sister must be a novel experience being in someone`s car with your clothes on "" or "" Stop whispering ` I love you ` to your hand little brother "" . I don`t know if I`m reading too much into the script here but there`s something very sleazy about this sister/brother relationship , it almost has incestious overtones . Slightly disgusting and it`s not heped by the fact that Gina Philips and Justin Long play their roles in much he same manner as Christina Applegate and David Faustino played Kelly and BudHappily however this is all forgotten as the script descends into grade Z territory . Normally this would have ruined a potentially good story but if it keeps my mind away from the creepy relationship between Trish and Darry then this is possibly a good thing . Sorry I`m lying because this script insults its audience like no other movie I`ve ever seen . Let`s see now
1 ) A monster demon drives around in a truck . Think about that for a moment. A big bloody monster demon drives around in a truck and no one notices . Did the monster order it through the mail ? I thought perhaps a salesman would have noticed he`s sold a truck to a monster at the showroom . And wouldn`t someone with a truck - monster or otherwise -have to stop at a gas station to get it serviced and filled with gas ? And wouldn`t have the pump attendant have noticed the customer is a monster ?2 ) If the monster can fly while holding a body why does it need a truck in the first place ?3 ) If a monster appears for a few days to go on a killing spree every 20 odd years then how come no one in the locale seems to know about this legend except for a psychic ?4 ) Dozens of bodies lie piled up in a derelict building . How come the police haven`t had any reports of missing persons ?5 ) The monster is after Darry so come the monster waits until the end of the film to snatch him when he`s had plenty of opportunity to do so before ?So you see this is a really poor script ( The directing isn`t much better by the way ) lacking in internal continuity , logic and intelligence . There are one or two scenes with potential but they have been totally ripped off from DUEL , THE TERMINATOR and the works of Clive Barker . It`s absolutely ridiculous a film like this got funding without anyone noticing the massive plot holes , just about anyone reading this page could have written a better screenplay . Even worse someone in Hollywood thought this junk deserved a sequel . No I`m not making his up , there`s going to be a JEEPERS CREEPERS 2 coming out in late Summer . Seeing as the makers of this crap treated the audience with such contempt the least we can do is to give the sequel a wide berth . If you haven`t seen the original then take my advice and don`t bother to see it because you won`t be missing anything worthwhile",Jeepers Creepers
16,Hey_Sweden,Above average modern fright flick.,7,10 September 2012,"Writer / director Victor Salva did his part in keeping the monster movie alive with this respectable effort. It's got enough ambiance, suspense, and general all around creepiness going for it to make it worth a viewing for genre fans.A brother and sister named Darry and Trish (Justin Long and Gina Philips) are driving home during Spring Break and are taking the long, scenic route through the country. Unfortunately, they soon begin to be victimized - over and over and over again - by a mysterious entity that simply won't go away, and has been doing some nasty things to various human victims for a long time.Now, granted, some fans can - and do - take issue with the way some of the movie is scripted - but God knows horror movies have had plenty of instances of ""dumb characters doing dumb things"" over the years and what goes on in this movie is far from unique. Also, it's true enough that this movie works best in its first half, when Salva is stressing a mystery element, and we don't know just who or what is stalking these kids. Once the nature of the monster is revealed, it is hard for the movie to not start falling into the clichés of the genre. For one thing, this monster just keeps coming and coming no matter what is done to it.Still, one has to love some of the odder, WTF moments in ""Jeepers Creepers"" - including a tongue being pulled out of a severed head - and appreciate the horrific imagery of one of the movie's major set pieces, when Darry is investigating the monster's lair where it has been arranging dead bodies in what he describes as a ""psycho version of the Sistine Chapel"". The monster design by Brian Penikas is effective once we see it, even if it's not terribly imaginative. The rural location work is excellent, the atmosphere is strong, the music by Bennett Salvay is good, and there's a steadily building amount of tension throughout the whole thing. Salva does have this thing hit the ground running, as the first major scares & action scenes occur within the first five minutes.The acting is pretty good; Philips and Long are likable and make a pretty convincing pair of siblings, Jonathan Breck is suitably spooky as the monster (and also has a small secondary role as a cop in the police station), Eileen Brennan contributes a memorable turn as a stereotypically nutty cat lover, and Patricia Belcher is fine as our exposition provider, a psychic lady whose head just happens to be filled with details on how the monster operates. Some viewers take issue with the presence of the character, but she didn't really bother me, personally. One element that becomes a character in its own right is the ugly, demonic truck that the Creeper drives; that thing is pretty bad ass.All things being considered, this is a good if not great movie whose concept at least has shown some durability; one sequel came along two years later and fans are hoping that a proposed third movie sees the light of day.Seven out of 10.",Jeepers Creepers
17,Doylenf,Mindless horror flick has some scary moments...,6,19 August 2007,JUSTIN LONG and GINA PHILIPS are brother and sister returning home for spring break when they run into road rage and a monster who comes out of hiding after long hibernation to kill humans for body parts that keep him thriving.It's a fairly suspenseful horror flick with the leads making the usual mistakes so that they can come into contact with the flesh eating monster who clearly is after one of them for a purpose not revealed until the end.Long is amusing as the brother who has some good lines to say to his irritating sister as they squabble over how to approach the idea of hunting down a monster. His facial expression is mainly one of shock at finding dead bodies at the bottom of a barrel-shaped pipe and he keeps up the shocked look throughout most of the film.There are some genuinely scary moments and a lot of silliness in the plotting which is pretty par for the course in these kind of thrillers. At least there's one saving grace: the director doesn't use the shaky camera movement or fast cutting to get his effects. He doesn't have to. The tale is chilling enough.,Jeepers Creepers
18,preppy-3,Very good,8,4 September 2001,"An annoying brother and sister (Justin Long, Gina Philips) are driving home from college and run into a monster that takes various body parts from its victims--and has one of them targeted. Well-acted (even if the main characters are unlikable) and quick-moving. It's not exactly scary, but I was never bored and there are plenty of exciting sequences along the way. The main problems...what the heck does the song ""Jeepers Creepers"" got to do with anything (except for a sick/scary meaning at the end)? Also they throw in a very annoying psychic woman (Patricia Belcher) who keeps dropping hints about what the creature is and what it's trying to do...then totally drop it. Why bring it up then? It's scarier that you don't know what it is. Still, a good movie that doesn't shy away from blood and gore. A must for horror fans.",Jeepers Creepers
19,poolandrews,Enjoyable enough horror film.,7,13 October 2005,"Jeepers Creepers starts as Brother & Sister Darry (Justin Long) & Trish Jenner (Gina Philips) drive their way across the long desolate, isolated & remote American country highways hoping to spend the summer holiday with their parents. As they mind their own business a large dirty truck speeds up behind them & behaves aggressively until it eventually drives past. Later that day Darry & Trish pass an abandoned Church where they see the truck & seemingly witness the driver (Jonathan Breck) throw what appears to be a body down a pipe nearby. Worried Darry & Trish decide to go back & take a look, Darry discovers that the pipe leads directly into the Church's basement where he finds literally 100's of mutilated bodies all stitched together & arranged like some macabre jigsaw puzzle. They manage to inform the local police but the driver of the truck goes after Darry & Trish who soon realise that what they are dealing with is not human...This German American co-production was written & directed by Victor Salva who also has a small uncredited cameo as one of the victims in the Church basement, I personally thought Jeepers Creepers was a very entertaining modern horror film although it's far from perfect. The script begins brilliantly, it really grabbed me & engaged me as the first half is set up as a mystery but the second half of Jeepers Creepers slides into standard stalk 'n' slash horror clichés with a indestructible killer chasing teenagers all over the place & a silly psychic who can foresee the future. During the first half director Salva manages to create & maintain tension & excitement but it doesn't last unfortunately. Thinking about it it's strange because half of Jeepers Creepers is fantastic while the other half is extremely disappointing, having said that overall I still liked Jeepers Creepers as a whole. The creeper itself was far more effective when he wasn't shown fully, when it is revealed it's obviously a man in a rubber monster suit & doesn't look all that great. The film never really tries to explain what the creeper is or where it came from. With a budget of about $10,000,000 I'd have liked a better monster, the film as a whole is generally well made with nice cinematography, music & production values. There is virtually no blood or gore with a decapitated head, a guy with a hole through his body, some mutilated corpses & someone without any eyes all we get. The acting is OK by most of the cast with Philips & Long making likable stars, Patricia Belcher as the psychic Jezelle is absolutely awful & highly irritating. Jeepers Creepers is a pretty good modern horror that has a nice pace & feel to it & will probably appeal to a young teen audience. I liked it & I think it's definitely worth a watch for those interested in horror.",Jeepers Creepers
20,zardoz-13,"""Jeepers Creepers"" will scare the Peepers out of you!",8,7 February 2008,"""Jeepers Creepers"" will scare the peepers out of you! This crude but effective creature-feature, shot on a modest $10 million budget, relies chiefly on suspense and shocks rather than blood and gore. Although he sacrifices momentum inevitably in the middle because of expository dialogue requirements, writer & director Victor Salva of ""Powder"" has conjured up the scariest spine-tingler since ""The Blair Witch Project."" The big difference between ""Jeepers Creepers"" and ""Blair Witch"" is one features a mysterious monster while the other remains monstrously mysterious. A popular complaint about horror movies is they reveal the monster too soon, and the creature lacks the malignant evil we as moviegoers anticipate based on our anxieties. Although ""Jeepers Creepers"" antes up a long shot of the bogeyman in the first quarter-hour, Salva wisely delays a revealing close-up of it until about half-way through the action. Produced under the aegis of Francis Ford Coppola's Zoetrope Studio, ""Jeepers Creepers"" sends shivers down your spine thanks not only to Salva's Spartan storytelling but also freshman lenser Don E. FauntLeroy's haunting cinematography that evokes an aura of unease. Basically, the Creeper--as the end credits refer to it--consists of a guy in a latex suit that can perform back flips as nimbly as a ninja. Of course, Salva and FauntLeroy hide its features for the most part, but the webbed claws erupting like plumage from its reptilian skull and canvas-like whooping of its bat wings enhance its diabolical appearance. Brian Penikas's full costume and makeup synthesizes elements of a gargoyle with bat wings, ""Swamp Thing,"" and Todd MacFarlane's ""Spawn."" Unlike most horror chillers, ""Jeepers Creepers"" doesn't rupture your eardrums with an industrial-strength orchestral soundtrack. Instead, composer Bennett Salvay's incidental music quickens your pulse without deafening you. Audiences that crave happy endings are advised to shun this shocker as should the squeamish.Victor Salva's provocative but formulaic script unfolds in three acts. Initially, we follow Trish Jenner (Gina Philips of ""Living Out Loud"") and her younger brother Darry (Justin Long of ""Galaxy Quest"") as they cruise home from college for spring break in her '59 Chevrolet Impala. They are taking Florida's lonesome, two-lane blacktop, back roads. Evidently, Trish prefers the ""long way"" home to fighting traffic on the four-lanes. Although filmed in Florida, ""Jeepers Creepers"" looks as if it could have occurred anywhere in the South. Trish cannot find anything on the radio but twangy country music and shrieking religious zealots. Consequently, our leads indulge in idle sibling banter. They pick at each other and compete to see who can decode the most vanity license tags. Suddenly, out of nowhere, an ominous-looking, rust-coated, delivery truck with an outrageously souped-up engine tailgates them. FauntLeroy's low-angled camera setup makes this creepy truck loom over us, emphasizing its intimidating character, especially as its unseen driver bears down on them with his horn blaring like a banshee. This road rage scene generates the pedal-to-the-medal adrenaline-laced flavor of the ""Mad Max"" movies. Later, after the truck has swerved past them, they spot the maniac's vehicle parked in the woods near an abandoned church. Our heroes catch a glimpse of him. Draped in a long black coat, he sports a broad-brimmed hat, and resembles The Undertaker of WWF notoriety. They watch this wicked figure from afar as he dumps bodies bundled up in bloodstained sheets lashed with ropes into a sewer pipe. This villainous fiend spots them staring at him. Moments later, the menacing truck barrels onto the road and careens off in pursuit. Darry manages to lose the lunatic this time by plowing off into an open field. Fortunately, their assailant races down the highway into the distance.""Jeepers Creepers"" takes two sympathetic characters and corners them in a white-knuckled nightmare of a predicament. Gina Philips and Justin Long appear splendidly cast as yummy, babe-chick, bigger sister, while Long resembles a young, grungy Keanu Reeves. The way they overlap their dialogue makes them seem like a real-life brother and sister act. Coincidentally, they encounter this murderous gargoyle-like predator (Jonathan Breek) with the ability to rejuvenate its own dead tissue. Basically, all we learn about this monster is he devours only victims that appeal to his olfactory senses. In the second act, after Trisha and Darry describe their encounter to authorities, we meet a creepy old lady (Eileen Brennan of ""Private Benjamin"") with cats as well as a local psychic Jezelle Gay Hartman (Patricia Belcher of ""Message in a Bottle"") who furnishes the facts about this fiend. According to Jezelle, this monster strikes every 23rd spring to feast on human flesh. Trish and Darry contact the police, tell their story, and are sitting patiently in the local police station when the Creeper attacks them again. The final act of ""Jeepers Creepers"" is reminiscent of the scene from ""The Terminator"" (1984) when Arnold rampaged into a police station.Salva creates genuinely suspenseful situations without resorting to cheap obvious gimmicks. He seamlessly entwines humor with horror, too. Salva treats us to an interior shot of the delivery truck crowded with bundled up corpses. Pitching another body inside, the Creeper slams the door shut. A moment elapses as we sit in darkness, then he opens the door and lobs in a severed head. Dyed-in-the-wool horror fans will spot Salva's homages to ""Night of the Living Dead"" in the opening scene and later ""Alien"" in the drainage pipe sequence. Like ""Night of the Living Dead,"" ""Jeepers Creepers"" starts with a couple bickering as they drive through a rural setting. A zombie doesn't attack our heroes; instead, a psycho in a hell-bent-for-leather delivery truck like ""Duel"" tries to run them down. Gore hounds more than the squeamish will appreciate this atmospheric supernatural saga with its off-beat, surprise ending. If you really enjoy this kind of grisly opus, hang around after the end credits for the short clip that has sequel written all over it.",Jeepers Creepers
21,Boba_Fett1138,Just OK.,6,24 March 2010,"I really wasn't too impressed by this horror movie, though it was still likable enough, for not taking any of the obvious directions with its story.It all begins as a normal horror movie, with teenagers in the main lead. It really doesn't have much originality to it and the movie 'borrows' its elements heavily from other genre movies. Yet the movie manages to not become the standard average horror movie that we've seen so often this modern day and time. The movie is less exploitation like than normal horror flicks and it doesn't feed on its scare or gory moments. The approach works rather original but of course it also makes the movie less exciting and takes away lot of the tension of it all. So its strongest point also becomes a weak point for this movie.Guess that most horror fans will still be disappointed with this movie overall. The movie just doesn't handle its horror elements very well and the movie made me think about how director Victor Salva just doesn't seem suitable enough for the genre. It had a rather good and potential scary premise and it does have a good killer in it but it just doesn't know how to handle it right. The killer, or monster as you will, gets featured quite a lot and is shown fully on screen, which just makes him less scary after a while. Also its story doesn't help much to make him a real good scary horror character. It's pretty silly how he lets the two main characters live throughout the movie, despite his obvious superior physical skills. He could had killed them at basically every given moment throughout the movie, without them ever knowing what hit them.It's atmosphere is also constantly too dark, at least during its second halve. I'm sure I would had liked the movie much better if it was more like its first halve, that was still mostly mysterious and you didn't knew what was going on or who was the person behind all of this and why. Besides the movie was light as well back then, so I could see better what was going on all as well.Can't really say that I can recommend it to the lovers of the genre but it's still being original and likable enough in parts to still consider this a watchable movie.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Jeepers Creepers

I guess it is good that it only comes out to feast once every so often. I never really heard, or didn't understand the explanation as to why the creature was hunting the boy specifically, but I'm sure it had something to do with it needing his eyes. Creature features not only need to be scary, but they should have good explanations as well. I mean, we know why Frankenstein's monster exists, we know the history of Dracula and the Werewolf, and it is their history that adds to their mysticism and scariness. The Jeepers Creepers, had no history of origin, therefore when no one was able to kill it, it became a guessing game.",Jeepers Creepers

26,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Highly enjoyable slasher effort,9,31 October 2014,"Inadvertently witnessing a savage killer's actions, a brother and sister are forced into a terrifying battle with the being and anyone else who comes into contact with as they try to escape the madman.This is probably one of the better horror films made from the last ten years. One of the better elements for it is that it has one of the better plot lines and played out a favorite theme in get a story that supports ninety minutes worth of action for a film that really shouldn't be that long and play it out with continuous attacks. As long as something is simple and can get that much screen-time, then it's done its purpose as just because the story might not be plausible doesn't really affect the movie that much as long as the film moves along fast enough to get that time in. that really allows this one to get in plenty of high-quality action scenes including the many chases down the highway. That was a real highpoint in the film, where the truck driver is trying to get them of the road and actually ramming into them on several occasions, the tactics of them trying to get away and the driver continually coming after them makes for a great action moment while also adding some effective suspense scenes as the camera is right up in there, and the close angles used to show them together with the truck allows for some nifty scenes of terror. A third chase scene also includes two police officers escorting the kids back to the scene of the crime as one of them hears a tapping on the roof, gets out to look, and is dragged out of the car kicking and screaming. Suddenly, the second one is pulled out, and now without a driver, the police car steers around wildly out of control and forces them to stop their car as getting out they see a figure in the driver's seat who opens the door and a decapitated head falls out, sending them screaming and they drive off. Another impressive element here is The Creeper, who is one of the better monsters from recent times. It has one of the best-looking designs, with a Gillman influence shining through very clearly in that the reptilian-like appearance in its face, while not being distinctly human is a great quality in a horror movie creature. The Creeper is also one of the smartest villains, making sure to terrify without killing so as to heighten the senses that he wanted to exploit. That carries on nicely with the storyline for this one, being far more original and inventive towards itself by making the usual twists and turns far more original than expected and come off as a really unexpected twist that adds a lot to like here. The fact that this does feel like an action movie rather than a horror effort might make for some rather troubling viewing at times since it seems to pack in scene-after-scene of relentless action to add to a scary conclusion, so something like the police-station assault or the chases could come off as overkill in such a movie, but overall this one is still a highly enjoyable effort.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language and Brief Nudity.",Jeepers Creepers
27,FlashCallahan,When was the last time you changed your socks?,6,23 July 2013,"Darry and Trish are on their way home from their freshman year at college. But the trip turns dangerous as they see a man in a trench coat and a hat that dumping something down a pipe. They recognise him as the man who tried to run them off the road earlier and investigate to see what he dumped. What they discover terrifies Darry. They try to get help from a crazy woman and a psychic before they realise what's been chasing them is an ancient demon known as the Creeper who eats people to regenerate his body parts....The film starts out fabulously, like Spielbergs Duel, an unknown entity trying to kill two siblings for being too nosey, and the fact that no one helps them only adds to the tension. And this works to such an extent.But right when the old cat woman shoots and makes the Creeper blow up, it falters, turning something that could have been a taut, realistic thriller, into another generic horror movie. The cast are great, the two leads have great chemistry as siblings, really getting on each others nerves, and this at least makes you believe they care for each other.The redeeming factor is that it doesn't go for the powder puff Hollywood ending, if you wanted a lightweight horror, its as nearly as grim as Se7en, not as good or as shocking, but the film finishes on such a low note, which is very rare for a generic horror.There are tense moments, the final third is filmed well, but after the fact you realise the Creeper is a demon, it all goes to pot a little.",Jeepers Creepers
28,zetes,"Jesus, can't anyone make a decent horror film anymore?",5,13 January 2002,"Jeepers Creepers has a lot going for it. It has a decent premise (nothing extraordinary, but it's workable), several excellent scenes, and a great baddy - one that, if the film itself had been better, would have haunted the popular imagination as much as Freddy Krueger. Instead, the dialogue is terrible, the characters often make frustratingly awful and difficult to swallow decisions, and several annoying horror movie cliches that, for Christ's sake, should never be included in a movie again, yet somehow always end up there. How rare is it that a director can direct his own script? Really, Jeepers Creepers required two, maybe only one rewrite or script doctoring and it could have been a B movie masterpiece. The changes wouldn't have been difficult. I actually suggest that people see this film. Wait for it to move off the new release shelves and then snatch it up. It's only 90 minutes long. Expect your knee to jerk, but I implore you to find the seeds of good ideas in it. And, let me add, they are apparently making a sequel (the film really didn't make that much money, but, as I remember, it topped the B.O. for a week or two). I will definitely rent it when it comes out on video, just to see if Victor Salva has improved himself at all. 5/10.",Jeepers Creepers

This style is better than what the majority of horror films do, where gore and shock is the catalyst for fear.  They say anticipation of death is worse than death itself, which is what this film is all about.  When they stumble upon Jeeper Creeper, we do not know if it is a man or beast.  It methodically stalks its victims, and when night falls, the fear worsen. The conclusion ties up all loose ends, along with a shocking memorable ending.",Jeepers Creepers
30,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: (DVD) Jeepers Creepers (2001),5,25 December 2005,"I've heard much hype about this horror film, and decided to take a look into it. It delivered some thrills, but nothing fantastic to rave about.Starring Justin Long and Gina Philips as siblings on a road trip home, perhaps it is the relationship between the two which is refreshing, yet tinged with a sense of familiarity. Instead of the usual boy-girl romantic relationships which are staples of horror movies, sibling rivalry gets the nod, which to an audience, is something easier to identify with.The main baddie is the unexplained - a mysterious man riding in a beat up armoured truck whom the siblings see dumping wrapped bodies in a church. Against his sister's advice, Darry decides to investigate, and hence they become the latest prey of the creature. We do not know anything more about it, only that it rises every 23 years, for 23 days to feed, to take something from his prey, and doing so by inflicting fear, and smelling.The creature makeup is interesting, like a cross between a mer-man and a vampire bat, but you don't get to see it in its full glory until the end. And the end to some, might be a disappointment, as it still left things unexplained. Maybe that's the appeal, that you're free to interpret. There should be a lot of gore in this movie, but I suspect the Code 3 edition has pared it down quite a bit.In short, this movie is one extended country road trip, with some mysterious elements and motivations added. Nothing too fancy, nothing too horrific. And yes, it did spawn a sequel.Code 3 Extras: Trailers, Cast and Crew Interviews.",Jeepers Creepers

32,StevePulaski,Brings in a new player to the game of slashers,8,15 June 2011,"Besides being full of depressing, heartbreaking, and possibly life changing events, the year 2001 was a great year for films. Mostly horror films. Donnie Darko, Joy Ride, and Jeepers Creepers all surfaced and held a cult following years later. All three are incomplete trilogies with one sequel branching off of them. And all are full of life and scares the first time around. With repeated viewings the scare factor gradually decreases, but the enjoyment and the memories are still there.Jeepers Creepers was a film that I remember from my childhood very well. The first and the second films etched themselves inside my head and brought years of haunting memories. Watching them years later, they aren't as scary, but they still have a tiny nostalgic twinkle when I catch them on TV.Focusing on a brother and sister (Long and Phillips) returning home for spring break, Jeepers Creepers introduces an inhumane figure into the world of horror. He comes equipped with bat wings, a Freddy Krueger like face, razor sharp teeth, and a cloak and hat to top it all off. They call him The Creeper (Breck). The mysterious figure tries to run the two off the road on their journey home blaring its horn and swerving intensely.Later, they see him dump a body down a pipeline and, with the help of a dream haunted old woman, they begin to piece together the creature's habit and purpose on the planet. I won't spoil it because it's something that is uncovered towards the end of the film.The first half an hour is very intense, leaving so much to be accomplished. It comes off very uneasy and has a setting that can leave someone truly helpless. They are driving through the countryside. We all have. There isn't a damn thing for miles. Cell phones, in 2001, weren't as powerful as they were now leaving the characters in more of a quandary. So much happens in the eventful beginning. We get a big scare, and character development. Two things horror movies in present day lack.Compared to recent films like remakes and some mildly entertaining new pieces of modern day horror, all we get are pointless names of a character. What good is a name if nothing else is provided. Usually all we know is that the group of idiot, lame-brain teens who love to go out in the woods in the dead of night to smoke, drink, and have sex. Whatever. We don't care about them, and sometimes, in a wonderfully sadistic way, we'd like to see them die just because we are sick of them. Jeepers Creepers at least gives us a reason to be concerned for its leads.By the end of the film, it went a little downhill with the goofy backstory on The Creeper and it became more of somebody else's movie. It takes the cleverness and charm that made the two leads likable and makes them a little less heroic and daring. But because the beginning, the music, the characters and the villain are all so greatly constructed, it's a tad bit acceptable that the ending isn't on par with the beginning. Regardless, for a little horror film, it goes a long way with some events and scares.Starring: Justin Long, Gina Phillips, and Johnathan Breck. Directed by: Victor Salva.",Jeepers Creepers
33,Smells_Like_Cheese,Where didja get those eyes?,8,2 September 2001,"How rare is it that we get a good monster movie? The 1950's were filled with monster movies that as cheesy as they were, they were also a ton of fun. Victor Salva was a fan of those movies and it shows when he wrote Jeepers Creepers, a fun horror film with a great new movie villain. Not to mention it was a nice break from all the crazy CGI films of late, this was an old fashioned make up horror movie. With two good lead actors and their silly clichés that are guilty pleasures, this was a fun road trip movie with the great creeps.Trish and her brother Darry are coming home from college. As they drive through the countryside, a mysterious driver in a rusty old delivery truck tries to run them off the road. After letting the vehicle pass them, they later see the same truck, in the distance off the side of the road, with a hulking man sliding what looks to be bodies covered with blood stained sheets, into a large pipe sticking out of the ground next to an old, abandoned church. Darry insists they go back and investigate. At the bottom of the pipe, he finds hundreds of bodies sewn together, covering the walls of a massive cavern beneath the church. They go to a restaurant and call the cops, they are phoned by a local psychic, Jezelle, who warns them that they are in terrible danger. She plays the song ""Jeepers Creepers"" on the phone, and tells them that when they hear that song, they will be in extreme danger.There may be cliché moments with why these two ""smart"" adults go back to find the dead bodies, the psychic lady who everyone think is a psycho and never listens to her, and the chase scenes are a bit predictable. But I absolutely loved this movie and the risks it took. The creeper is one of the best horror movies I have seen in a long time. His make up effects and the way he hunted down his pray was just terrifying and gross at the same time. He sniffs his victims, their items and when they have something that he wants, he won't stop until he has it.Justin Long and Gina Philips did a good job and had great chemistry. One of the things I loved about the film that instead of a cliché boyfriend/girlfriend story, they're brother and sister. Their relationship seemed genuine, the way they played off each other was perfect. My only complaint is that sometimes Gina did play the role a little dead, though I can get past it since her character seems to have a tougher edge probably from a tough break up before we meet them on the road trip. I also like that the film reminded me a little bit of Steve Spielberg's first film Duel and I wouldn't doubt that Victor got some inspiration from that film. The cars are also play a major role as a villain and what a haunting honk the creeper's truck made. I really liked Jeepers Creepers, it's scary, funny and clever and people need to lighten up because this is one of the better horror movies to come out in years.8/10",Jeepers Creepers
34,Rainey-Dawn,See The Creeper With Your Own Peepers.,8,3 July 2014,"Jeepers Creepers is not a bad monster slasher movie. It is quite entertaining and does have a scare factor there to make it fun. The movie does actually have a good story. It is mainly the relationship between the brother and sister (Darry and Trish) that keeps the movie and story good and not The Creeper himself (who only adds the scare factor to the film).To me, Jeepers Creepers is one of the better horror films in the sub-genre slasher. There are many slasher films on the market but only a few that have a good story to go along with all the slash-them-up action - Jeepers Creepers is one of them.And kudos to the idea of bringing the old song ""Jeepers Creepers"" back on the airwaves and creating a horror movie that befits the song.

And by the smell of it's victims fear it chooses who it wants. It rises every twenty-third spring for twenty-three days to feast on human body parts in order for it to regenerate and form part of its own body by consuming it's victims. The monster that is stalking the 2 annoying siblings started out actually kinda spooky, but after it reveals it's full appearance it got less spooky and sort of goofy at times. The mystery behind the monster made it suspenseful but after it reveals itself, the suspense just isn't there anymore. And while the movie shows the full appearance of the monster some stuff just isn't revealed, which isn't a positive thing. Since it leaves questions unanswered. It's obvious the director got the title of the movie from the popular 1938 jazz song titled ""Jeepers Creepers"", but when the song starts playing in the movie, it means danger but this isn't clearly explained. It also doesn't explain what is special about the psychic lady that allows her to see into what is to come for the victims and other stuff isn't explained. There is a lot of potholes as well, especially when it came to the monster, a lot of it just didn't make any sense. This film has a strong start though, the teens witnessing the bodies getting dumped in the sewers of a abandoned church added mystery but was also eerie at the same time. The third act was pretty bad though and what starts off as the male sibling being the annoying one switches and the female sibling starts to get really annoying, despite the fact that she looks like a cheap hooker. And although this isn't really a teen horror, the 2 lead characters is really annoying. And you don't feel sorry for them since it feels like they just brought the whole mess onto themselves with there stupidity, especially Darry(Justin Long). If you seen annoying siblings that act like 10 yr old's, there you have it. The director had few lead characters in this film for a better character developments, but that is a big flaw since the audience is stuck with 2 annoying characters. That is why I was satisfied with the ending to ""Jeepers Creepers"".4.6/10",Jeepers Creepers
37,lost-in-limbo,Curiosity killed more than just a cat,7,6 October 2009,"Writer/director Victor Salva's modern horror 'Jeepers Creepers' is a very modest throwback to the token 80's monster gruel. Rather being gritty, it's a slick and stylish production propelled by it bombastic suspense over the very alienating road trip through the isolated, barren Florida back-roads. Along for the ride are two bickering siblings (splendidly performed with sincerity and naturally cracking chemistry by Justin Long and Gina Philips) on their way home, but on their journey they pass by a building which has an ominous figure that looks like is dumping bodies in to a large pipe in the ground. After the figure tears off in their old truck and runs them off the road, they decide to go back to investigate. This would become a very bad decision, for what they eventually uncover.From the get-go, once it grabs hold, never does it let go making it such a thrilling ride instilling a stench of fear and dread with some sine-tingling visuals. It's the usual ingredients to the formula, but there's a tasty mixture spinning its own unique touch to this somewhat cautionary tale. As for 'creeper' himself, it's a creepily strange monster creation that gladly doesn't talk, but still leaves an imprint of personality from its looming ambiance thanks to Jonathan Breck's performance. Still it doesn't feel as menacing when fully revealed, compared to the early stages when its wearing a coat and wide brim hat. The gruesome make-up effects are well done and so are the special effects. Salva's material offers up a surprise or two, inserting some stimulating exchanges between the two main characters and amusing self-knowing quips of humour. However while I liked it as a whole, I found the opening half to much stronger and inspired with its creative juices with it getting rather silly in the latter half. The ambiguous nature of it all, is handled with care, where you begin less to question why and become involved with the escalating, unspeakable terror. There's a real mean-spirited vibe to the deaths inflicting pain. Salva's direction is brimming with constant energy, control and verve to gives an enduring kick. Bennett Salvay's score is an unsettling hum-dinger and Don E. Fauntleroy's transcendent photography work is smoothly adapted to the surroundings/actions. Also there are acceptable turns by Patricia Belcher and Brandon Smith.A brightly good, fun genre romp (I just don't get hate that seems to surround it.) with a sequel that's just as enticing.",Jeepers Creepers

These guys pretty much set the bar for what happens when a functional sibling relationship becomes dysfunctional after messing with the wrong ghoul. The visit to the psychic 3/4 the way through is a nice touch also. PS -- the sequels are wretched and awful, but you already knew that, didn't you?",Jeepers Creepers
40,CuriosityKilledShawn,Heebie Jeebies,6,11 November 2012,"By 2001 the resurgence of slasher movies had fortunately died down and audiences were in the mood for something new. Jeepers Creepers is a return to the old-fashioned monster movies in the style of classic Universal. Those were movies built on suspense and atmosphere rather than gore and multiple kills.Justin Long and Gina Philips play Darry and Trish, a pair of argumentative siblings who are traveling home through the Florida backwaters for spring break. Along the way they are terrorized by an unseen figure driving a ugly truck. Darry sees the figure dumping what appears to be dead bodies into a pipe by an abandoned church. In a moment of agonizing plot contrivance Darry turns around and heads back to find out what's really going on, unawares that he'll give the villain a taste of his fear, thus making him a marked man.Victor Salva layers the movie with homosexual and incestuous subtext, while keeping the monster in the dark for the most part, building fear and mystery about him. The Creeper is a great villain and Salva builds an intriguing mythology about him.The swift running time (the credits roll at the 85 minute mark) prevents things from getting deep or expansive but the sequel builds upon this world and is actually a better movie despite the hate. On its own Jeepers Creepers is an effective but superficial. Plenty of points for being original however.",Jeepers Creepers
41,jacobjohntaylor1,Now come on kids there is nothing to be scared of.,4,16 October 2015,There are some many horror movies out there better then this one. I don't know why people like it so much. There better horror movies that are not hyped about as mush. Jeepers Creepers 2 is so mush better. Anaconda is very scary and so much better. Plan 9 from outer space is better. I could keep naming movie that are better but let's get to point. The ending was edited out hello people get over the special effects and look at the story line. It get you in but ending is gone. This a very badly edited film and I am very disappointed. Since I herd this was going be better Jaws 2 and Halloween II and The Godzilla remake 1998. The original Godzilla was not ever so good has the 1998 remake. The original Halloween was ever has good as Halloween II. The original Jaws was not even as good as Jaws 2. And these are good movies . This one just sucks.,Jeepers Creepers
42,paulclaassen,The birth of a classic!,6,8 February 2021,"'Jeepers Creepers' is a terrifying and creepy tale about being in the wrong place at the wrong time, and getting involved way over your head.The film kept getting more and more intense as it progressed, and completely unpredictable. This little film was just full of surprises! Regarding the acting, I thought Justin Long was good as Darry. (The film also propelled Long to stardom). I must be honest I didn't find Gina Phillips believable enough as his sister, Trish. She over-acted quite a bit and I didn't feel anything from her performance. (I must be wrong here, because she won the Best Actress Award - oops!)The scene in the Diner was a bit annoying; when Derry and Trish were frantically asking for help, and everyone just stared at them in silence - as if complete idiots. It just isn't normal behavior. I also didn't understand the reference to the song 'Jeepers Creepers'. Why would they feel threatened every time they hear the song? Why would the Creeper even relate or respond to a song? Did I miss something here?Speaking of the Creeper. He truly is a frightening, well designed creature. Sure enough to give you nightmares! The film also effectively utilizes background images for creating suspense, so be sure to watch the background! This is a scary tale and definitely a horror classic - love it or hate it. I love it!",Jeepers Creepers

The actors portrayed a sibling rivalry, we get a good personal backstory and there is some mystery when they encounter the dodgy fellow on the side of the road. However, the film goes downhill and all the mystery is negated when we see the creature very directly and end up knowing everything.

45,cruise01,"Scary, creepy, and interesting concept approach.",8,11 October 2020,4 out of 5 stars.Jeepers Creepers is a scary horror film that starts out like a regular serial killer chasing regular travellers on the highway. Only to be something more sinister and demonic.Right when the two characters are almost run off the road with an old trucker. Which was intense. It doesnt stop there with the thrills. There are a few jump scares. As the two characters are chased by this creeper. Good cast. The script and direction build up with the suspense works. The ending is also very unsettling and haunting.,Jeepers Creepers
46,BaronBl00d,"Eye, There's the Rub!",5,20 August 2006,"While I will wholeheartedly agree that this movie doesn't make any real sense out of anything. It has one major thing going for it: it has a disturbing, creepy, eerie quality that held me on the edge of my seat through the first third of the movie. The second two-thirds definitely falter in terms of losing the tension of the first part and having to ""try"" and explain some of the proceedings in less than convincing fashion - but overall this film rises above(slightly) the other films of its ilk with a bit more something. Part of it is the better-than-usual teen leads. I thought Gina Phillips and Justin Long were both decent actors. There was a genuine bond between the two that transcended to the screen. The other actors were all adequate with Patricia Belcher giving a weird performance of a woman hearing the song ""Jeepers Creepers"" in her home and trying to help the two young protagonists. Watch for Eileen Brennan as the ""cat lady"" in a small but memorable role. The story is - to be real honest - ridiculous. It has to do with some creature that feeds on fear and uses...well, can't go into too much detail without giving away some major information about the end. The creature is real creepy, especially in the early scenes as he pushes his truck, for apparently no reason, into the back end of the car of the two young kids. Later, the ""kids"" see him throwing what looks like bodies in body bags down a drain pipe in an old country churchyard. They see him leave and do what nobody in his/her right mind would do - investigate. What they find is a cavernous room filled with bloodied bodies adorning the walls and floor like some chapel of evil. Things then get dicey when the creepy man comes back. This part of the film is the major strength of this film. It has style, a meteoric pace of tension and surprise and is ever so chilling. Little explanation is needed. As the film builds and explanation IS needed, the film falters and begins to tumult to a lack of credibility. But it does manage to retain some of the style and pace earlier exhibited. This is a teen horror film to be sure, but it is a little different than the others out there - a cut(knoth) above the rest so to speak.",Jeepers Creepers
47,Fella_shibby,Awesome creature/horror flick.,10,27 November 2016,"I first saw this on a rented DVD in 2002. Without watching any trailers or reading bah it. I was pleasantly surprised. It is one of ma fav horror movi. Best part was that most of the movie was shot in daylight capturing some good cinematography. The place where the demon/creature throws the body was creepy. Even his truck was kinda creepy. I was not able to make out what exactly it was. First i thot it might b some psycho trying to scare people on the highway, then I thot might b a serial killer dumping bodies. But I was taken for a jolly good surprise. What excellent suspense the director was able to create. Victor Salva did a terrific job. It was full of tension. The movi doesn't lose momentum when the creature is revealed. To me it looked like the demon from Wishmaster. The size n the power (flying, growing body parts again) really added to the scare factor. There is body count after the creature is revealed n good amount of suspense n tension before it is revealed. The acting was good too. Gina Philips n Justin long did a good job. Horror fans will not be disappointed. Saw the second part in a theatre in a suburban Mumbai theater. The sequel was good too.",Jeepers Creepers
48,GOWBTW,Not your typical horror movie,7,19 January 2005,"This horror movie is anything but ordinary in my book. Though it's different from the other horror characters like Freddy Krueger, Jason Voorhes, or Michael Myers. It's very intriguing, and very entertaining at the same time. The two sibling who get home from college really had the biggest scare of their lives. The good parts are when they went to a field to alleviate their bladders, everyone seem to like the sisters' black panties. I DID!Then you got the infamous Creeper, the thing who drives a beat-up old truck, and there was a little bit of humor when he killed those police officers he forgot the hear of one of them!The Creeper really was persistent on getting the brother, and the strange Afro-American woman who knew about the creature was instantly spared by it.This movie was intense enough, it didn't need to be any longer as it is.

50,Captain_Couth,A bad attempt to create another franchise movie monster.,1,14 August 2005,"Jeepers Creepers (2001) was a bad movie with severe homo erotic overtones and too much borrowing from better films. This movie made convicted child molester turned Hollywood wunderkind Victor Salva into one of the studio's darlings. The success of this film gave him the opportunity to try and franchise the film and create a new movie monster (The Creeper).The movie has a lot of flaws. First one is that you can't force an lame and uncool character become another Freddy Krueger. Second, the storyline was weak and so were the actors. Third and final reason, trying too hard can ruin a movie. This is a major reason why horror movies these days blow chunks. I can't factor in how many times film makers take a good concept and destroy the film by trying to hard.I have to not recommend this movie. So what if it only cost a few million dollars to make. You can go to your local video chain rental store and find even cheaper productions with more entertainment value. Followed by a slightly more entertaining bigger budgeted sequel .",Jeepers Creepers
51,bsmith5552,This One Just Misses,6,31 March 2002,"I went into this movie expecting another teenage slasher movie in the Friday the 13th vein. What I got was at first, a very suspenseful and imaginative film, that is until the ""Creeper"" comes onto the scene. The first half of the film was very good. It had a few imaginative scares and kept the viewer guessing as to what would happen next. Gina Philips and Justine Long play brother/sister Trish and Darry (both are excellent) returning home from college. Along the way, they are harassed by an armored truck that rams their car from behind and then speeds away. Later they see the driver of the truck unloading a suspicious cargo at a deserted church and dumping it down a sewer pipe. After another encounter with the truck they return to the church to investigate. What they find leads to their meeting with the ""Creeper"" (Jonathon Breck). I know from the DVD commentary that writer/director Victor Salva purposely kept the ""Creeper"" shrouded in mystery. But I felt cheated by not knowing who he was, where he came from and what his purpose was. Besides, when you see him (he looks like a cross between the Creature From the Black Lagoon and the creature from ""Alien""), his very appearance begs these questions. A lot of mysteries remained unsolved. Could it be that Mr. Salva is planning a Jeepers Creepers 2? To his credit, Salva keeps the blood and guts to a minimum, choosing instead to let the viewer's imagination do the thinking. Too bad he got carried away with his monster. A more conventional and explainable monster would have made for a better picture in my estimation.",Jeepers Creepers
52,dfranzen70,Final 20 minutes nearly makes up for other 70,6,16 January 2002,"Remember back in 1974, when the now-famous Texas Chainsaw Massacre made its debut? Okay, neither do I. But I did see it later, on video, and it still scares the bejeezus out of me today. What made that film work was that it was low budget (and therefore more realistic) and that the gore was so... well, so disgusting, for 1974. But the best part of the movie was that it was a popcorn movie - the kind where you'd warn the people in the movie not to go downstairs, and so on. It's pure escapism. Jeepers Creepers fits into this mold. It's an escape movie. You don't watch it to learn things; you watch it for plain old mind-numbing entertainment. The movie is about two siblings driving along a long, quiet country road on their way home from college. A madman in a big, souped-up, customized truck tailgates them, then runs them off the road. Later, they see him dumping something down a huge pipe. And sure, they stop to investigate. I mean, wouldn't you? As in many escapism movies, the characters consistently do profoundly stupid things, like climb down the pipe, don't go for help, don't get the heck out there like right now, and so on. It's the old Scooby Doo mentality; let's solve this puzzle, huh gang?For much of the movie, I laughed heartily. But hey! you say. It's not a comedy, is it? Right on, it's not a comedy. It's a horror film. And I wasn't laughing at stuff that was supposed to be funny. I was laughing at stuff that was supposed to be scary. That's not a good quality to have in a horror movie, folks.So I had a good idea of how I was going to rate this movie. ""Pretty cheesy,"" I thought to myself. ""Effects aren't bad, acting is, kind of forgettable.""
But then the final 20 minutes or so came. And man, let me tell you - this is some serious fear. The final few scenes are better than anything else in the movie put together. There's dramatic tension AND good effects. That hardly ever happens in modern horror films. And the final shot? Absolutely memorable. This movie went up a few points on the basis of those final scenes.",Jeepers Creepers
53,kevin_robbins,I love this movie,10,1 October 2021,"Jeepers Creepers (2001) is a movie in my DVD collection and is also available on Tubi. The storyline follows a brother and sister driving home for the holidays when a random truck terrorizes them before eventually passing them. When they see the driver again they see him doing some suspicious things and do a little investigating...it may be the worst decision of their life. The movie is directed by Victor Salva (Powder) and stars Justin Long (Galaxy Quest), Gina Philips (Doom: Annihilation), Eileen Brennan (Clue) and Patricia Belcher (Flatliners). I love this movie I don't care what anyone says. This movie makes a conscious effort to establish the sibling relationship and they keep that tone throughout the movie till the very final scene, which contains a fantastic twist. I saw this twice in theatres I liked it so much. The kill scenes and depiction of the Creeper are excellent. The film has a nice blend of subtle and intense horror elements and I love the gore. The settings down the pipe was so well created. The police station scenes are also pretty good and I love both the psychic and cat lady.

54,GiraffeDoor,Kinda stupid,5,10 February 2019,"I thought this began auspiciously. I liked the dialogue and characterisations of the two main characters and the rapport they had. It was stylised but it made me want to root for them and didn't feel like the generic filler so many movies make us wade through before the movie actually begins.But sadly it really goes downhill when the horror tries to horror. I thought the faceless car at the beginning was pretty terrifying but actually seeing the Creeper as a made up man just makes it campy.The movie struggles to give me some believable motivation to why the brother want to go looking for trouble. He actually says ""I'm thinking beyond my own selfish existence"". The sister even invokes other horror movies to stress how dumb he's being. That makes it worse; horror fiction should never acknowledge the existence of horror fiction.I think this is a cult classic or something, but for people who just want a scary movie this is not the place to find it.",Jeepers Creepers
55,drownnnsoda,"Great Opening Scene, Goes A Little Downhill, But Overall Very Good.",7,1 June 2006,"""Jeepers Creepers"" starts off with a brother and a sister, Derry and Trish (played by Gina Philips and Justin Long) who are driving through the countryside together. As they pass an old abandoned church in a wooded area, they notice a cloaked man, throwing something wrapped in white sheets with blood stains down a storm drain. This obviously scares them, and as they try and speed up to get out of there as fast as possible, the guy pulls up in his giant truck, running them off the road. They decide to go back to the church to make sure that one of the people being thrown down the drain wasn't alive (dumb, dumb, dumb), and Derry falls down the drain. From there, he discovers a mass graveyard beneath the church, and the cloaked figure, which is actually a creature who feeds on human body parts, hunts them down.The beginning of this film was truly chilling. The image of the cloaked figure throwing bloody bodies down the storm drain was just plain creepy. After seeing that, I was thinking, ""Okay, this is going to be really scary"". But from that point on, things went down hill a little, and the story became less and less believable. The thing about movies of this type is, once you fully show the audience the creature, the movie loses it's mystique. We've seen the creature now, and it's not nearly as scary as it would have been if they showed it later on in the film (or perhaps not at all). It's scarier when you don't know exactly what it is. But besides the fact, it's a pretty good horror film involving a monster, considering most creature flicks are corny and cheap, and the makeup effects were really good. Standard clichés abound (especially during the ""What if it was you back there?"" scene, which kind of had me rolling my eyes), but I wasn't expecting it to be cliché-free. Another interesting and creepy scene was the cat lady sequence, it felt like something from a Stephen King book in my opinion. It was mysterious and kind of random, but I thought it was a nice addition to the story. The acting in the movie was all pretty good. Gina Philips is an excellent actress, I think she's pretty underrated, actually. Justin Long is her quirky but funny brother Derry, and is also good. As for the ending of the film - it wasn't great, but it was creepy and a little disturbing.All in all, ""Jeepers Creepers"" had a great opening scene that set up for a good horror movie, and while it did go downhill a bit, it had some excellent moments and a refreshing story. Don't expect a slasher movie though, it's more of a creature-feature, with some slasher elements mixed in. It has it's problems, but it's entertaining and definitely worth seeing. 7/10.",Jeepers Creepers
56,kluseba,The first thirty minutes are extremely creepy and atmospheric but then...,8,12 January 2011,"This horror b movie is one of the best films of its kind in my opinion and this especially because of the first thirty minutes or so of the movie. The movie begins with a very dark and disturbing atmosphere when two innocent teenagers see a strange person in an old and ugly truck that seems to throw dead bodies in garbage bags in a row underneath a creepy old church next to a lost highway where only some ravens live. In the first half an hour you really get into this movie because you don't know what is coming next, what the two students will discover next or what they might do in a strange combination of naive curiosity and foolish ignorance. Those scenes send shivers down my spine and were a really intense and captivating beginning for a horror movie. The acting is more than appropriate and the scenery is filled with clichés but works perfectly.But then comes a little down and this great atmosphere is broken when the two students come back into civilization and as the true identity of the creeper is soon uncovered. It is true that the creeper is a really ugly, strange and frightening creature but I found it even more creepy and uneasy as I didn't know what or who this creature was in the beginning of the movie and I think that the identity of the monster should not have been revealed that fast but only in the very end. The movie becomes then less frightening and concentrates less on the atmosphere but on some gore and action scenes. The acting is also less intense than in the very realistic and shocking beginning.The gore and action parts are still well done for example when the creeper meets the strange old cat lady or when he is entering a local police department but the movie is only entertaining and not quite frightening anymore a part of the very last scene that finishes the movie in such an uneasy way as it began. That's why this movie only gets a really solid rating but not the two highest notes. The second part of the series is really less interesting because you know from the beginning on what the creeper is and what he does and the acting is also less convincing. But I'm still looking forward to the third part because I highly appreciated the first movie.That's why I can really recommend this first movie to any fan of atmospheric psycho thrillers for the first thirty minutes and to any fan of the typical horror, gore and splatter movies because of what is following afterwards. From that point of view the movie rejoins two different styles and fans and the rupture after the amazing beginning has at least one positive point.",Jeepers Creepers

There are some good elements to this movie that should not be overlooked. One is Justin Long and Gina Philips. They have great chemistry together and because of that great chemistry, you buy their sibling relationship, it works. Another good smart element, is the cloaked figure, the look and the mystery behind him is well executed in the film. Eileen Brennan is good here too, she's creepy and is good in her old cat lady role, even though she doesn't have a lot of screen time. The action/terror sequences are well made, and entertaining. It's not all scares, it slows down occasionally, but it's overall pretty good. Overall Jeepers Creepers gets a 7/10. Not great, but pretty entertaining.",Jeepers Creepers

Of course these jackasses decide to check it out, and find some things that they probably didn't want to find - and up to this point the film works pretty well. Once you start getting some background on the ""Creeper"" the whole thing just goes to hell.

61,s3276169,Instant classic.....,10,27 March 2016,"A simple definition of the horror film is one that elicits negative emotions by playing on an audiences basic primal fears. Jeepers Creepers manages to both elicit emotions not only of fear but also something more. This film is, on a certain level, distressing. There's something icily primal about the manner in which a brother and sister, are stalked by a predatory creature who, quite literally, picks up the scent of the vulnerable and remorselessly pursues them. The creature mimics humanity yet, as its intentions and actions reveal, it a monster, possessed of an utterly unspeakable, inhuman nature. An uncomfortable fact, driven home in hauntingly distressing fashion, in the films chilling, final scenes. Jeepers Creepers works because, in one sense, its familiar. The Creeper might be a nightmarish fantasy but its a metaphorical man monster. One that is not too far removed from human monsters, who, in a sense, mimic ordinary people, whilst secretly stalking the vulnerable, with unspeakable, inhuman intentions. In summary, Jeepers Creepers might be a low budget film but don't let that fool you. This is an intelligent film, that taps into real, primal anxieties and cleverly manipulates them, crafting a disturbingly outlandish but at the same time, familiar, nightmare experience. Ten out of ten from me.",Jeepers Creepers
62,Jonny_Numb,"starts off effectively, but spirals into silliness...",5,13 December 2005,"For the first hour of ""Jeepers Creepers,"" I was in relative agreement with Clive Barker's box-art blurb: maybe not ""the most scary, stylish horror film in years,"" but an effective effort nonetheless. As the plot follows a brother and sister traveling home for spring break, only to be menaced by a long-coated figure in a menacing, loud truck, writer-director Victor Salva creates brooding suspense and mystery, while keeping his villain obscured. With a decent pace and often unbearable tension, ""Jeepers Creepers"" has a lot going for it, and is quite reminiscent of a 1950s horror film...until about minute 60, when 'The Creeper' makes his grand appearance, and a motive is attached to his madness. Turns out this dark, towering menace likes to swallow up body parts that proceed to give him the capability of said parts. To paraphrase Crow T. Robot: ""Backstory by Mrs. Johnson's kindergarten class!"" By the time the effects-laden second half begins, the film has succumbed to shock, stupidity, and outright silliness--an unforgivable betrayal of what started off so promisingly. Though, considering Salva's unbalanced filmography (including the Albino-outcast tale ""Powder"" and the tepid psychothriller ""Nature of the Beast""), it shouldn't come as too big of a surprise that the premise of ""Jeepers Creepers"" slips out from underneath him. Too bad.",Jeepers Creepers
63,aidanratesmovies,"Jeepers, Creepers. Where'd you get those Peepers?",9,8 June 2021,"Although some may criticize me for saying it's better than films like Texas Chainsaw Massacre and House of 1000 Corpses- Jeepers Creepers takes its rather disgusting and trashy subject matter and makes something incredibly unique and fun in the process. The film is not perfect, we see small dialogue lines here and there that truly only exist to give these characters some sort of backstory/and or purpose. It can also be a bit predictable at times, following certain horror scenarios that we have all certainly seen before. Where Jeepers Creepers differs from the average slasher film though is the intense imagery and worldbuilding regarding the creeper itself. We see horrifying images of mutilated bodies nearly painted along the walls it inhabits,which looks like (as Long's character says)- ""a messed up version of the sistine chapel"" (censored). The makeup involving the creeper is also incredibly well done, and you can't help but feel excited as you watch the screen to see what may happen next. The performances are nothing special but Long and Phillips certainly add to the film's enjoyment- and the choice to make them brother and sister to avoid needless sexual stuff is by far the most brilliant choice from director Victor Salva. The cinematography can be standard, but the sound is well done, and the music is fun and creepy- as you would want it to be. It's an incredibly bizarre and unique little nightmare- and though it has flaws- I truly did enjoy the hell out of it, and I wouldn't mind watching it again.My Rating: 9/10.",Jeepers Creepers
64,a_chinn,Unique and scary rural supernatural horror tale,9,19 March 2018,"Wonderfully creepy, get-under-your-skin horror movie! Writer/director Victor Salva frames the film with a fairly basic unstoppable monster movie set-up, with a brother and sister traveling across the country and finding themselves stalked by The Creeper, but Salva tells his story with so much flavor and texture that ""Jeepers Creepers"" stands apart from most horror films. The film's timeless setting, which is clearly contemporary but feels as if it could also have been in an earlier time, such as the1920s dust bowl or a post war 1950s, give the film mythical feel. The film's use of sound design is exceedingly good, from the Creeper's truck horn, to the ambient sounds of the Creeper's lair, to the echoey record playing of Paul Whiteman's version of Jeepers Creepers, all burns into your memory. Director Salva also fills the film with eerie visuals that equally burn themselves into your brain, such as the the long drainpipe leading to the Creeper's lair, or The Creeper's frightening silhouetted axe, or the film's final image, which I won't spoil here. In addition to eerie imagery and sound design, Salva fills his film with a wonderful amount of suspense and dread. As a writer, Salva does a nice job of slowly revealing the lore behind this mysterious Creeper figure. (SPOILER ALERT!) There's one moment late in the film after The Creeper has been run over by a car and a large single wing suddenly appears from the prone figure and is a wonderful oh-my-gosh-what-is-going-on-here moment! Overall, ""Jeepers Creepers"" is a must see for horror film fans and is a rather unique rural supernatural horror tale, but I don't believe ""Jeepers Creepers"" is a film that will appeal to a wider audience.",Jeepers Creepers
65,EdgarST,More than eyes meet,5,1 January 2004,"(Contains spoilers) What an incongruous mess... It reaches the zenith of nonsense when Patricia Belcher enters the scene as Jezelle, the town's channeler, singing the Warren-Mercer classic (title) song, and not even knowing why. But I still found the movie fascinating in an ""underground"" way, due to Victor Salva's infamous past relations with young actors. It is not obvious but suggested in one or two occasions that The Creature is after something more than Justin Long's eyes. Eileen Brennan shoots The Creature a couple of times, but then... those incredible wings flap for the first time. If you don't watch it now, don't miss it on next Halloween.",Jeepers Creepers
66,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,"Had a number of good parts, but its flaws are in the most essential areas of necessity",6,13 June 2015,"Every horror franchise has its issues, whether it be a lack of attention to detail or clichéd writing there's usually something a horror fan will expect to happen at least once during the running time. Unfortunately like a lot of other genres, these tropes end up making these films too generic in most respects resulting them in either being a one-time watch or possibly not even finished. For director Victor Salva, although this is not his most critically acclaimed piece, it is probably the one that sticks with him the most. For what is given, it's actually not a bad film at all. Regrettably though, it has writing issues that if addressed, could have made it more entertaining than it already is. The story is about a brother and sister heading home from spring vacation through a rural community when they witness a man dropping what appears to be a body down a giant shoot. Curiosity gets the better of them and soon enough, what they go looking for ends up following them.What distinguishes this cautionary tale of minding your own business from other horror films is that its writing contains very little, if none at all of the usual horror tropes. As stated before the main characters are brother and sister. That already is a big difference from other films. Most plots rely either on a group of people (as fodder for the killer) or focus on only one person. Also the people who are killed are not the same either. Even the jump scares aren't as obligatorily noticeable. This is a game changer because a lot of generic horror films are still produced this way and these kinds of antics get old really fast. Now if only Salva was able to fix the rest of his script, then this would've been some horror film. For one thing, the brother, Darry (Justin Long) and Trish (Gina Philips) are not exactly what you would call the most likable of protagonists. It's not that the audience would despise them but they don't exactly cooperate well nor do they have the best of attitudes. I mean yeah, siblings bicker sure, but there's no scene that shows their softer side so it's hard for its audience to fall behind the main characters. And personally, Justin Long has the doofiest shock face.The other parts of the writing Salva forgets to elaborate on is the exposition to the antagonist and clearing up other reasons. Along their travels, the brother sister duo meet a psychic named Jezelle (Patricia Belcher) who has the ability to see visions into the future. Mind you she's been having these trances for several years and she has no clue why she has them. Ummm,...okay. As for the antagonist known as ""the creeper"" (Jonathan Breck), which kind of honestly he is, the reasons why he kills is explained but why he doesn't, goes unexplained. Plus, he has a grotesque side hobby that involves something along the lines of preservation. What exactly is it for? No idea. Since Jezelle is the only one who even knows about the creeper (and for so long) how come she knows so little? She's literally the creeper's creeper. Writer/director Salva could've went into more detail on this but didn't so this doesn't exactly help with fleshing out the villain's backstory.Aside from this however, the rest of the film will manage to keep its audience's attention. The most effective part to this film's credit is in fact, its creep factor. The idea of knowing that someone is always following you and wants something from you (and you don't know what it is) is beyond unnerving. Plus after seeing what he does with his victims, who would want to stick around? As for the gore aspect of this horror feature, it exists but it's not abundant like one would expect it to be. The good thing is that Victor Salva ensures that certain in scenes when the creeper attacks is not what a viewer would normally predict. The director of photography belonged to Don E. FauntLeRoy who handled each scene nicely by giving it a grainy feel like that of Daniel Pearls' work from Tobe Hooper's The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974). I am curious as to why it's always in the middle of nowhere that crazy people exist. Why is that? Why is it always the rural communities? Can people really go mad out there that easily?Bennett Salvay brought the film score forth. Although much his tracks are anonymous sounding with no real signature, there are a couple that demonstrate Salvay is a competent composer. This mostly belongs to the themes surrounding the brother sister duo or other family related subplots. However, his other tracks are just drudging brass instruments, which emphasize the dread headed their way. But even with this, the tracks do help elevate the tension to an intense level because as said before, director Salva doesn't have a script with your everyday horror clichés. There is also one more piece of music that is creepy and that is the actual ""jeepers creepers"" song from the early 1900s. This is used as a motif for the creeper himself. Because the song sounds so jolly, the fact that its being played with a dark character is, well,....creepy.Sadly, most of its writing doesn't explain much about its antagonist and the main two protagonists aren't exactly the most enjoyable. However, everything else from its special effects, violence, creep factor, music and cinematography work well together. Its screenplay even contains a number of original ideas that don't follow your regular horror films.",Jeepers Creepers
67,raulfaust,Hungry Eyes,1,7 May 2012,"Considering that the main television channel in Brazil used to show this movie frequently, and considering I was so scared to watch this back there, I decided to watch it to see what I was missing-- or not. The film begins with two main characters talking, arguing and making childish competitions, which irritated the beep out of me. After that, everything goes downhill. The monster's mask is ridiculous; the scares are predictable (especially the car window's); characters, situations and city are bizarre. Sometimes it feels we're watching an 80's comedy horror, but we can see that director wants to make it serious. I really don't know why I got so scared of this flick when I was young, neither why Brazilian's main television channel exhibited this movie every week. I believe it's one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen-- and that's quite meaningful. Get out!",Jeepers Creepers
68,Rob_Taylor,"Jeepers Creepers, I've seen it with my peepers....",7,2 November 2003,"And it ain't too bad, really. <spoilers ahead>The monster is different from your run of the mill beastie. Knowing nothing about the film when I went into it, I had no idea what the beast was. First thought was it was some crazed inbred yokel. Then it became apparent that it was something more than that. But even at the end, with all of the information to hand, I still can't really say what it was meant to be, if anything in particular at all. A pleasant change from the run of the mill vampire/werewolf/alien monster, though. And it was nice not knowing what it was capable of, unlike the typical vampire movie.The film is reasonably good at keeping your attention, though there is a surprising amount of empty dialogue at the start designed to draw you into liking the two lead characters. Once things kick off, though, the action and sense of menace is well maintained and such unimportant dialogue fades away.What does detract from an otherwise good movie, however, is the way the two lead actors play ""hysterical teen, calm-under-pressure teen"", swapping roles with each new horrifying experience. Also annoying is the way the female lead is totally useless at getting the car to do anything in an emergency. After she ground the gears for the tenth time trying to get first in one of several such sequences I wanted to slap her sooooo hard! I guess the clutch was meant to be giving out or something, but ye gods! Overdone plot device, or what!There are also sundry other ""typical horror staples"" to contend with, such as the psychic woman who ""sees"" things, the dodgy car which won't start, the ""don't go in there alone"" scenes and so on. But, apart from the cat lady (I have no idea what that was about other than to further the psychic's claims of legitimacy), mostly the film works pretty well.Other than these points, the movie is a reasonable horror movie. I won't say it's particularly scary. But it does keep the tension going nicely. Worth a look in for fans of the genre. But don't expect edge of the seat terror.",Jeepers Creepers

The opening scenes are in fact genuinely creepy, but after this promising intro, there really isn't any reason to watch the movie anymore. You've seen all the interesting stuff there was to see, only you don't know that yet. The ""mythical"" villain is then shown and explained way too soon, and his special effects just get really old really fast. It's not that they're bad, well maybe it is that they're bad, I don't know, I just get sick of them almost instantly. So it can fly really fast, I get it. The plot is really going everywhere, but nowhere good, and you just feel the director get lazier as this movie progresses.

70,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,"Yeah, ... and ?",5,10 April 2003,"Actually started out well, with a verbose college-aged brother and sister driving through the middle of nowhere to get home for Spring Break, and stumbling onto what they think is a killer on the loose, who begins stalking them in his old brown van. A good scare as the van races up behind them, scares the hell out of them by blasting its horn repeatedly, and trying to drive them off the road. When they see him dumping the body down the pipe, the camera angle panning along as the killer turns and watches them drive by him is well done. The bodies being dumped next to a creepy looking, bird infested church in the middle of nowhere was also a good touch, as was the photography of it. Those scenes gave me a lot of hope for this one, at least in its first half hour. Occasional flairs, such as the killer leaving a palm print of ""long dead skin"" are very effective, as the killer continues to stalk them throughout the course of the evening.Unfortunately, the more we learn of the killer, the more silly and inane the film gets, as we learn he is not a serial killer, but some type of winged demon creature from hell, who enjoys sniffing people's drawers (I'm not making that up) to find out what part of them it wants to eat.Film is far too self-aware, as it tries desperately hard to be a cult-classic, for example, by showing the creature eating someone's tongue directly in front of a billboard reading ""Tastes so good!"" The psychic character is a complete waste; clichéd and unfunny.The song, Jeepers Creepers, is chosen completely at random; are we supposed to believe that this creature somehow arranges for its future victims to hear a song referencing a body part that he wishes to eat? The threat of a killer on the loose in the countryside was good, but writer/ director Victor Salva felt the need to turn the killer into some ridiculous creature out to eat people, ruining all suspense built up in the first act.It begins a suspense/ thriller, but ends up a juvenile (and somewhat pedophilic, with homosexual undertones) monster movie, with an anticlimactic ending. Salva tried to go for an ironic twist at the end, and failed miserably. No wonder it sat unreleased for a year after its completion.",Jeepers Creepers

Especially the first half hour has some scary moments. What I didn't like too much about the movie was the fact that they were screaming and yelling all the time, it really started to annoy me. The same for the car and its gearbox. Come on, when they are just driving along, nothing is wrong with it, only when they have to be fast the thing is squealing harder than a pig that is being butchered. The makers have to choose: or the thing never works well, or it always works well. Now it lost all its credibility.But so far for the things that I didn't like. What I did like was the story: A young woman and her brother are on their way home for school break, but a mysterious driver forces them off the road. Later on they see the driver again, dumping a body at an abandoned church. The driver sees they have spotted him and he goes after them. But the driver isn't just an ordinary psycho or a madman, it's a demon that has to feed on humans every 23 years during 23 days... If you want something scary and creepy, this movie is the thing you are looking for. People who don't like blood, dead bodies, heads being chopped off... better choose something else to watch. I liked it and I would have given it a very high score if it hadn't annoyed me a little too often. Now I give it a 6/10, which is still not bad.",Jeepers Creepers
72,screenman,Could Easily Have Been Much Better,6,12 September 2009,"I'm giving this 7 stars because the bits that are good, are very good.The movie begins with a couple of teenage siblings. Brother and sister, they are so much alike they might be twins. They're off the beaten track, like all the young schmucks in teen-horror trips, and heading for a grisly experience.The argumentative angst that they engage in whilst driving is not very interesting but - to me - highly believable. They grumble and bitch alternately, scoring cheap points off each other as adolescents do.With more than a hint of 'Duel' about it, a grimy, beat-up old truck sneaks up behind them, blasting its horn. It's silly, but spooky fun. They let it pass, and much later, see it parked at an abandoned church as its creepily-dressed driver drops something down a big pipe. They argue about going back to see what it is. And - yes - it's a body.Interestingly, our hero himself falls down this pipe (it's at an angle), he lands at the bottom, as you would expect. The body, on the other hand, has mysteriously rolled several metres to one side - in the dark. He, and we, find that this crypt has been lined floor to ceiling with Dante-esquire corpse sculptures that have more than a passing resemblance to 'Aliens'. The ghoul has been very busy.Up to that point, the movie has the makings of quite a plausible scare-fest. Unfortunately, the plot becomes increasingly daft. This ain't an ordinary murdering-psycho-ghoul-nutcase. It's some kind of demon. It's got huge bat-like wings and it can fly. So what's it doing driving a van then? Don't ask. Who taught it to drive? don't ask. Whizzing about at high speed, how come it's never been stopped? Don't ask? I have no problem with a movie that asks me to suspend belief. But I have a big issue with one that asks me to suspend common sense. In order for a real horror movie to work its spell, there has to be a believable integration between the weirdness and the plausible. This one fails. And when it does; it fails big-time.But like I say; the bits it does well, it does very well. The bickering is entirely believable. The initial scares and shocks make you jump. There are some excellent set-pieces and special effects. But the plot ultimately becomes as lost and confused as the kids.Worth a watch, but not collectible. My DVD cost £3 from the cheap shelf.

On their way, they've found something disturbing: On a basement of a church, there are bodies everywhere that the Creeper, a creature who eats for 23 days on every 23rd Spring, killed. Now, the siblings are being chased by the Creeper, who wants something from one of them. The problem about these movies, yes there are already two, is that there could be hundreds of sequels. No matter how much you try to kill the Creeper, it will still get up and continue eating. Yes, you're safe for 23 years but it'll still come back after the 23 years. Another problem, in this film, is that people are kinda dumb. Not that dumb, but kinda dumb. This film is not scary nor thrilling but it's a good film that I actually recommend it for those who wants to see this film. There is little gore in this film, so don't get excited to see blood here and there and everywhere. The plot in this film is interesting, though.

The Creeper is more terrifying than even Freddy Krueger or Jason Vorhees. The best scene is where the creeper chews the tounge out of a decapitated head!   I read that the creeper (the man who plays him) has a cameo as a cop.  I can't see which cop though. I watched the directors commentary.  It was very good.  He comments on how the male lead was able to act scared better than anybody else that auditioned.  He also mentioned that there were many budget constraints.  It's obvious how Hitchcock influenced Salva in this picture.  The suspense was great.  Again, watch the directors commentary and much more will be clear to you in this movie.

78,oneguyrambling,Maybe for your next slumber party... to trigger the slumber!,6,30 October 2010,"Most profitable horror movie franchises revolve around a primary threat, either a killer psycho, monster or other variety of nastiness. So you would assume that most writers attempting to create a scary movie spend most of their initial effort in coming up with an original and effective bad guy.That seems to be the case here, without too much in the way of spoilers the killer is an amalgam of everything that it has devoured over the years, including man, animal and seemingly plantlife. Whatever aspects that victim had appear to be inherited by the ""Creeper"", including it would seem the ability to fly, drive and regenerate health (maybe he killed a video game character).I have ignored this at the video shop for some time and only grabbed it after I saw it on a couple of ""all time best of horror"" lists, now that I've seen it I know that I don't have to pick it up next time.The 30 second plot: Every 23 years for 23 days the creature appears to feed. 2 kids are going home for the holidays and basically they come across the creature and for the remainder of the film he hunts them down.The kids are Justin Long and Gina Philips as Patricia and Darry, brother and sister, up until when they are run off the road by some maniac in an old truck they act like typical siblings, verbally sparring and trying to one up each other by putting the other down.After the creature appears everything falls into lockstep with other typical horror fare, mobile phones get no service, gears stick so cars won't go, torches don't work, crazy ladies show up for little reason and cops yell ""stop"" instead of shooting what is obviously not human. One crazy lady in particular is almost solely responsible for informing the viewer of what has happened (and also what will happen).I could go through other basic plot points but in essence it's ""Bad thing chases teens"".There is a surprisingly low head count in this film, in fact the first kill is half way in, and I didn't count while watching but it must be 5 or less on screen, and there really isn't a great deal of gore apart from one scene, where the violence is cartoonish anyway. I am baffled as to why this is in any Top anything lists, suspense is low, nothing original happens and the creature isn't especially menacing or scary. The creature even has his own theme song that is supposed to forebode his appearance!The film obviously wanted to be a horror version of ""Predator"": creature appears to feed and takes victims as trophies or in this case food. It is almost indestructible, can regenerate itself and can travel quickly and easily, I think the director wanted to set the Creeper up as a Jason/Freddie style anti-hero but I just don't see it.Look, if you're under 20 and think Freddie or Jason are what horror is all about you might like this, similar to ""Mimic"" (a better film than this, still not great though,) I just wonder why nobody thought to try Black Flag on a buggy creature to get him to run back under the fridge.One thing I might note is that at least through the movie the director shows he has some neat tricks which at least look cool, even if they add nothing to the plot. A scene where they show the interiors of two cars following each other without a cut is pretty nifty. Final Rating – 6.0 / 10.

The movie did surprisingly well at the box office, and critics and audiences have been raving about it, so I was wondering what all the fuss was about.  This is definitely not your standard teen slasher.  First of all, I admire the choice of focusing on two characters.  As the two characters are developed, we became quite attached to them, and when we finally see them in peril--we care!!  Often in these types of movies, we're faced with an ensemble of characters, who are each one-dimensional.  So instead of clenching onto the edge of our seats, hoping they don't die, we're actually waiting to see how they get killed.  But in this case, the characters are well-developed and they're brother and sister.  This way there's no cheap, gushy romantic moments.  The two of them love and care for each other, but not in a romantic way.  The acting is good.  Yes, I'm discussing a horror movie and admiring the acting.  This is no misprint.  The two lead actors each express great emotion, and we really feel their terror.  The movie has a unique approach, because it's intelligent and clever, yet it doesn't go for camp.  This campy horror approach sometimes works, but there's so many of these types of films that the line between horror and comedy is beginning to get blurred.  There are self-referential moments, like when Darry goes into the pipe and his sister says, ""You know, this is one of those moments that they show in scary movies where the character does something stupid and everyone hates him for it!"" and when she runs over the killer and Darry asks, ""Is he dead?""  She replies, ""They never are,"" and continues to run him over a couple more times.  For all this time, I've been waiting for characters to really give it to the villain, completely making sure he or she is dead, and that moment has finally come.  So I thank Victor Salva for that.  But these moments aren't done with a heavy hand.  The film has spurts of comic relief, but all in all it treats the horror genre with seriousness and respect.""Jeepers Creepers"" isn't perfect.  There is some annoying dialogue and I wanted to know more about the killer's motives, but other than that this is a solid horror-thriller.  And I admire the ending, which also isn't standard in the horror genre.  Salva, who directed the poignant drama ""Powder,"" is truly a talented director and hopefully he'll be recognized for his talent and not for his past as a sex offender.

The plot is consistent and will keep audiences excited as Justin Long stars alongside Gina Phillips who play the brother and sister who are being chased on a road-trip by a mad creature who wants to catch them.Long and Phillips are brilliant in their roles as stereotypical teenagers who are scared and freighted and are brilliantly portrayed by the two young actors.The film is often set at night which makes it even scarier and I was very scared when the tension starts to build for the characters as the film moves along at a ferocious pace.If you like horror films then this is definitely a must watch. It has made me more interested in the genre and I can't wait to watch the sequel, Jeepers Creepers II.8/10",Jeepers Creepers
87,CharltonBoy,Didnt live up to it's initial potential.,6,23 July 2002,"Jeepers Creepers is not the worst scary movie i have seen , in fact the first hour is good and does have that fear factor that so many modern day horror movies lack. The problem with the movie for me is that what makes a scary movie is not what you see but what you dont see. A good horror should let the viewers mind play tricks with itself and let the fright come within their own imagination. A perfect example is the Blare Witch Project. So the reason this film is a let down is the fact that in the last half hour we see the creature responsible for all the killings and all of a sudden it is not so scary. The other reason this film does not live up to its potential is the rubbish ending. Without giving the ending away it just looks like they had no proper ending ,so what they did was leave the film hanging so they can make a sequel. I'm not sure i will be watching Jeepers Creepers 2 . 6 out of 10.",Jeepers Creepers
88,jluis1984,Better than average...,7,15 November 2005,"There have been very few good horror movies in the last years, and Jeepers Creepers (2001) can be counted as one of them. At it's core(and as the Tagline suggest) is a slasher with supernatural elements set in rural areas of the U.S.The plot, in a few words, tells the story of two siblings who during their trip home on a break from college, find a suspicious man dumping what seems to be bodies down a pipe. Curiosity strikes and they return to investigate.The movie seems as two movies in one; the first half is a very good horror movie where the suspense is built with subtle atmospheres in a style very reminiscent to the ""Texas Chain Saw Massacre"". The comparison is not for free since the movie indeed captures that long lost feeling of what scary movies used to be. Acting is good most of the time and the reactions of the characters are more realistic than in most scary movies.Sadly, this loses steam after the killer is revealed, and hoping to not spoil a thing, I would say that here is where ""the other"" movie begins: a generic slasher and follows the style and tone of these days trend in horror.Even when this big flaw, the movie is quite entertaining and keeps you interested. Victor Salva's direction is solid and keeps a certain style that even when it makes clear who his influences in the genre are, it is still a Salva's movie. It's kind of sad that due to his past criminal actions his career has been stigmatized, because his art is, if not rewarding, at least entertaining, and certainly better than average directors.An oasis in the desert of mediocrity, this movie is worth a look: 7/10",Jeepers Creepers
89,stamper,"There is a jeep and a creep, the rest is subjective",5,25 September 2004,"This isn't what I'd call a good horror film or a great thriller. Maybe that is because I like my horror films to be a bit more realistic (as in NO monsters) like Scream and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974). The main reasons for me not liking this too much though, is that there isn't much of a story there and the fact that the film is at times somewhat ridiculous. Come on Mr.Salva, how about a decent background for the Creeper. Where is he from, how did he get this way, why does he come every 23 years for 23 days? Nothing is explained here (guess I'll have to watch part 2! HELL NO!!!!). However there is some gore, some originality, some thrills and one big old freak. Do not except a reality based slasher a-la Scream, but rather something demonic that first appears to be a geriatric hippie and turns out to be Darth Maul's ugly step-brother (after his mother had an affair with the Wishmaster and Dracula). All in all this is not a bad film, it just isn't good either. If you turn off your brain like I did and just take it as it comes you might still 'like' it as much as I did.5 out of 10",Jeepers Creepers
90,ivo-cobra8,Underrated solid monster horror slasher flick the only best one!,10,20 June 2016,"Jeepers Creepers (2001) is underrated very solid, decent horror flick and the best one of the two. This horror flick is a sheer terror, spooky and joyless fun flick to watch. I always love both of the movies, 4. years ago I reviewed the second one claiming it Is the best one of the two. There was a lot of stuff I liked in the second one, mainly because it has a happy ending and the creature is captured. That was than, watching today this flick from Victor Salva my opinion changed a lot, the original is the only best one of the two. It has a great twist, great plot and someone had to die on the end, otherwise this film would not be interesting horror film. Victor Salva knew exactly what he was doing, so this film is very scary, creepy, slasher horror film. Gina Philips and Justin Long where outstanding and great as the lead cast and where very likable characters. It is my favorite horror slasher film of the part 2 sequels and it is the best one. I love this film to death, I love it. Actually I am convinced that now, it is MILES way better film than the part 2 is + it is short at only one hour and thirty minutes long, while the second film is longer running than the first one. Jeepers Creepers kicks ass!""Sheer terror...spooky and jolting!"" Plot: A brother and sister driving home through isolated countryside for spring break encounter a flesh-eating creature which is on the last day of its ritualistic eating spree.On a desolate country highway, two homeward-bound teens siblings a brother and sister Gina Philips and Justin Long are nearly run off the road by a maniac in a beat-up truck...and later they spot the driver showing what appears to be a body down a sewer pipe. But when they stop to investigate, they discover that the grisly reality at the bottom of the pipe is far worse than they could ever have suspected...and that they are now the targets of an evil far more unspeakable -unstoppable-than they could ever have imagined! I still don't get why anyone hates this movie? What is wrong with you? It is not a classic or the best film in the horror slasher genre. But watch A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) and you will see a real monster. Here you have a creature who hunts people for feed and eats them. You see down the pipe a lots of body's, you have raid on a police station. I love have creeper cut's the state trooper's head on a police car with an ax, that is my favorite scene in the film. You have likable cast, everyone does a great job and the movie isn't too long. You have an interesting story and a terrifying plot. I really like Gina Philips as a hot sex babe, I love her. She retired now from acting. Justin Long is awesome, I still love him in a solid role in Live Free or Die Hard (2007). I really had no idea Francis Ford Coppola also executive produced this film, I really had no idea he liked to produced a scary movie. 4.years ago my favorite horror film of the two part films was part 2, but now my opinion changed, the original is my favorite film now that I love to death. I am still waiting for years on a part 3 but the movie is still not happening. I do not think Gina Phillips will return in part 3 because this film is 15 years old now and she's retired from acting. Jonathan Breck as The Creeper a demon creature who eats human flash, every 23 year spring break resurface to feed on humans was awesome and outstanding as the creature monster villain. I still like the second one, but now I love the first one more. I only hope, that they don't bring back Trish Jenner in the third movie. The rating I am giving is a 10 out of 10. A very entertaining, fun joy ride flick to watch, don't listen to the haters, they have no idea about good movies at all. I still miss the year 2001 I was in high school than, first year. Jeepers Creepers is a 2001 American horror film written and directed by Victor Salva. The film takes its name from the 1938 song ""Jeepers Creepers"", which is featured in the film.

Jeepers Creepers has a look near to ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", ""The House Of 1000 Corpses"", and that kind of deep-America-terror-movies, with an strange evil creature which kills anything that moves (and, of course, the main characters are his next victims); but it gets to nowhere. I can't understand the success of this film (they made a sequel!!) 'cause it doesn't even scare you, and it has one of the worst endings ever in terror genre.

92,swilliky,Freaky and scary with a great new villain,7,26 September 2017,"The vicious monster debuts in this indie horror classic hunting a brother and sister on a terrifying road trip. Trish (Gina Philips) and Darry (Justin Long) are driving back from college when they are nearly run off the road by a creepy looking truck. The siblings see the strange man later dumping wrapped bodies down a hole near a church. They drive by but the man nearly runs them off the road again. Darry decides that they should go back and find out if anyone needs their help down in the hole despite Trish's misgiving. Darry crawls down thinking he hears voices and sees movement but slips out of Trish's grip when rats come out. Darry finds a house of horror below with dead bodies sewn together in an awful mosaic.The brother and sister speed out of there as fast as they can and make it to a diner where they ask for help. Everyone thinks they're crazy except the payphone suddenly rings. On the other line is Jezelle (Patricia Belcher) who has seen a vision of Darry or Trish suffering under the torture of the Creeper (Jonathan Breck). She warns them that they will hear the 50's song Jeepers Creepers before it attacks. The police show up and they try to explain what they saw to the skeptical officers. The patrons see a strange man sniffing Darry's close in the back of the car but when the cops try to get fingerprints, they only find dead skin. The cops also investigate the strange church near the horror hole but find it on fire.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",Jeepers Creepers
93,FilmOtaku,What idiot told me this was a slick and stylish film?,2,20 October 2003,"While films of this genre tend not to interest me enough to actively seek them out, I had a renewed interest in seeing Jeepers Creepers based on the hype given to its recently released sequel.  *Possible Spoiler Alert*A mistake, to put it mildly.  Whoever said this film was a stylish and fairly intelligent film needs to suffer the same fate as the cop halfway through this movie.  The story itself, about `The Creeper' who resurfaces every couple of decades to feast on and stockpile human organs to keep himself alive is not inherently bad.  The irritating behavior and complete stupidity of the main actors however, is reprehensible.  The actors who portrayed the brother and sister (our `protagonists' ladies and gentlemen) are just begging to be devoured.  Or maybe that was just my wish throughout the film.  Eileen Brennan (Is it possible to age 90 years in a 30 year period?  What *happened* to this woman?) is wheeled out for a pointless five minute scene as a `crazy cat lady' which only served as further proof that this movie is asinine tripe.  Since I try to find at least one thing that is positive about any given film, the best I can come up with after a marathon brainstorm is that the last five minutes of the film was actually satisfying.  It is how the film *should* have ended and admittedly, it is a rarity when films end in a logical manner.Unless you are a die hard `horror' film fan, don't even bother with this one.  I'm irritated with myself for having invested both the time considering whether I wanted to see this film and the viewing of the film itself.  One helpful hint though: If you are watching this film with friends, and you should if you like to give the Mystery Science Theater 3000 treatment to horrible films, a symphony of fart sounds performed in a three part harmony makes for a good underlying soundtrack as an accompaniment to this film that stinks more than the real thing.--Shelly",Jeepers Creepers
94,Libretio,Dynamic horror film with intriguing premise,9,18 April 2005,"JEEPERS CREEPERS Aspect ratio: 1.85:1Sound formats: Dolby Digital / DTS / SDDSWhilst driving home from college through open country, teenage siblings (Justin Long and Gina Philips) are stalked by a demonic creature which requires fresh body parts for its own gruesome purposes...Adding its own particular twist to the teen-horror cycle, JEEPERS CREEPERS - the sleeper hit of 2001, co-produced by Francis Ford Coppola's Zoetrope Studios - demonstrates how a fairly conventional narrative can be enhanced by the loving care exhibited here by writer-director Victor Salva. From the dark-hearted drama of NATURE OF THE BEAST (1994) and RITES OF PASSAGE (1998) to the spiritual uplift of POWDER (1995), Salva has always demonstrated a willingness to challenge the conventions of mainstream cinema by thwarting audience expectations at every turn, and ""Jeepers"" is no exception. An avowed fan of old-time monster movies, the director has marshalled his considerable creative resources to produce an equally old-fashioned creature feature, updated for modern sensibilities and characterized by jump-out-of-your-seat thrills, a well-developed sense of irony, and plenty of heart and soul. To top it all off, there's also a pretty impressive monster - a combination of clever makeup, CGI effects, and a truly menacing performance by Jonathan Breck, buried beneath masses of latex and foam rubber.Fabulous, evocative production design by Steven Legler (and equally moody cinematography by frequent Salva collaborator Don E. FauntLeRoy) transforms the central Florida locations into a Gothic, brooding 21st century dreamscape. With nods to an assortment of genre outings - especially DUEL (1971) - the film culminates in a final showdown which capitalizes on the strong emotional undertow established during the opening sequences. Thankfully, there's just enough humor to offset the ultra-convincing trauma suffered by the principal characters as they pit their wits against a merciless force of supernatural horror. Attractive newcomers Long and Philips give exceptional, sincere performances as the terrorized protagonists, while Patricia Belcher makes an impression as the creepy psychic who realizes the creature has a special fondness for one of the teens and will never let them go... ever. Also featuring Eileen Brennan (PRIVATE BENJAMIN) in a brief cameo as 'The Cat Lady'.However, Salva's normally impeccable judgment is compromised by an unwarranted, needlessly cruel postscript: Having staged a predictably lavish, crowd-pleasing finale that scales the heights of operatic tragedy, the director chooses to close proceedings with a downbeat coda that's actually more depressing than horrific, and completely out of sync with the Big Fun Monster Movie preceding it. It's the only significant flaw in an otherwise perfectly realized miniature.",Jeepers Creepers
95,ghostfiendghost,Wished it was better but...,4,20 January 2019,"I can understand why people like this film but I'm simply one that thought it was dumb
It plays into the slasher genre well but it's characters and story really ruin the film with me. Both the teenagers are dumb and sometimes aren't acting like they should in such a situation (sometimes they get it). The creeper getting run over was really stupid to me and dragged the film on, cause honestly it had no problem dodging it before but the 3rd time it just ultimately gets hit
The car breaks down far too often and feels like an excuse
If the boys heart was gone at the beginning then how was he still breathing

The first 30 minutes really suck you in even though there could be some more shocks. Then as soon as the two get to the 7-11 it all gets dumb. The phonecall, the typical unbelieving policemen and of course the ridiculous Creeper himself. Why did they have to show us this cheaply made puppet? it would have been so much cooler if we'd never actually gotten to see him. Well, however, they aren't the first to make this mistake. The movie continues  and never really gets thrilling or frightening anymore and holes in the plot (that suddenly explodes with new facts about the monster) get obvious. Some of the stuff the Gypsy says doesn't make any sense. Like: Why does this Creepers only ""eat"" every 23 years? Is there any reason why exactly it only returns every 23 years? No! Who cares?

97,gigan-92,FinallyA Satisfying Horror Flick,8,10 November 2010,"B- Finally, an horror movie that doesn't fail like the usual ones. It's not exactly a slasher flick, and I assume more of a return to creature feature type flicks. Good, frankly, I needed a break from the masked, kitchen-knife wielding, stalker psycho. Now that's not to say it's the best horror film, far from it, but an entertaining one. There's still that horror-movie logic from time to time, like actually trying to sneak into a possible serial killer's body dumping site. You would think they would've of kept going and never come back, like I know sure as hell I would have. But overall the film is a breath of fresh air to me, considering the terrors of ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" and so on.Victor Salva brings a different feel to this film then what we normally see, which is a teenage blond or brunette screaming at the top of her lungs while running at a moderate speed. The atmosphere of dread he sets up is great. Most of the cast is rather secondary, if important at all, but that's just fine with me, because Gina Phillips and Justin Long portray genuine terror and it just really shows that is an above average horror movie. The first few times I saw it I was pretty damn scared, so the film accomplished what it set out to do.",Jeepers Creepers

Not because the movie the looked bad, (It looked great.) but because of some of the horrific things I've heard about the director/writer Victor Salva. I tried to put that aside and went to see Jeepers Creepers and I did in fact enjoy the movie very much.Jeepers Creepers is about Trish and Darry, two young college students who are brother and sister going home to visit there parents. On the way though they across a 'man' all covered up in strange clothes and a big hat who tries run them over. After they manage to get away from this strange man, they see him dumping, what looks like bodies, down a drain pipe. After he leaves they decide to investigate and see what the man really put down there. But, the things they discover are more terrible, then they could ever of imagined. Not knowing what to do, they end up calling the police who don't really believe them at first. They them get help from a strange physic woman who lives in the town they're in. She seems to know what's been happening and what will happen next. This leaves Trish and Darry realising that the thing that's after them is not human, but a demon who's known as the 'Creeper' who likes to eat people to keep him alive and he wants one of either Trish or Darry as one of them ""has something it likes"". I couldn't believe what happened in the finale. Very strange and very creepy.Gina Philips and Justin Long play the lead roles here of Trish and Darry and even though they don't give the most amazing performances they do a good job anyway and you get used to them along the way.Jeepers Creepers is one of the most different and exciting horror movies to come out in a long time. It's a proper horror movie, not a thriller or drama or serial killer type movie but a HORROR movie and I love that genre. The directing was a little dodgy here and you can see it's low budget but hey not every film has to have millions of pounds spent on it.

This really isn't scary-it's more suspenseful. The only kind of terrifying parts are when they first drive by the church and see the Creeper dumping bodies in that rusted opening. Think about that - IRL if you were driving by an abandoned church out in the middle of nowhere and saw a larger than average human wearing that outfit and dumping what you could only assume looks like a body - that would be terrifying. Also the scene where they were at the old lady's house with all the cats - if you were looking out in a field and saw a scarecrow and the person who lives there said ""that's not my scarecrow"" - just think about how terrifying that would be. I'm looking at these characters and thinking ""Run! Idiots!"" But you could see how if that was happening IRL how you would be paralyzed as your mind would be trying to comprehend if you're really seeing what you think you're seeing.Other than that I found myself mostly being annoyed at the sister. I get that they're brother & sister but they are in a unusual situation and she's clearly losing her grip, but she's taking it out on her younger brother when they should be banding together. This is no time for sibling rivalry. She needed to tone it down a bit. She was also very aggressive towards the pyschic. In real life if you encountered someone like that and they had a whole lotta details about you that they couldn't possibly know any other way I don't know if my reaction would be to yell and scream at the person. I think I would either just kind of listen with amused curiosity or just politely asked to be excused from the situation instead of just sitting with the person. The sister is just so angry and aggressive about everything. It just got annoying after a while. The whole psychic storyline was just something you have to suspend disbelief over. That would never happen. How convenient - she calls them at the diner, she comes to the police station...That was all to fill in some of the storyline. They coulda done that in a different way to get the details in. And speaking of the diner - what town anywhere would just sit there and stare at two people coming in yelling for help?! Somebody anywhere in the world would've gotten up and said ""What's wrong?! How can we help you?!"" I mean clearly these people were in distress, but those diners just stared at them like they were just some person that came in dressed as a clown and not actually yelling for help and in distress. That they just stared at them and did nothing is so unrealistic.The other thing I thought was funny was in regards to the couple that disappeared all those years ago that Justin Long's character found in the church basement. If it had been that long ago there's no way they would've been that preserved (even with formaldehyde) and it was so fake looking. It looked like something that a prop department for a high school production would've made. The guy looked like a mannequin and they both looked so shiny it was like someone had been buffing & polishing them for the last several years. It was just so fake and it really took away from how effective the scene coulda been.The one thing I did like is that they decided to spare at least one of the only two characters of color in the film. This was made awhile back before Hollywood came to their senses and realized that we don't always need to see the lone black person get killed first in every film so it's to their credit that at least they had two people that were of color in this film AND that they spared one instead of killing all of them. The film company shouldn't be patting themselves on the back for this (I mean my God was this film ""White""!) but at least it was a start in the right direction.Overall it was suspenseful and not the worst way to spend approximately 2 hours.",Jeepers Creepers

I'll give a rundown on my thoughts during this film...First 10 minutes: Interesting start, I'm sold.
Up until 45 minutes: absolutely nothing has happened, starting to lose faith
Up until the end: it had me interested in parts, but the plot felt flat and far too predictable
End: AWFUL. What's the point in that ending??!So as you can tell my main issue is the ending. Now I am not going to spoil anything so I won't go into details, but when it ends nothing gets solved. It's as open ended as you like. I just don't see how you can end a film this way!? Like what's the point...Other than that though the plot was just so flat and it struggled to keep me hooked in. The classic teenagers making bizarre decisions that shockingly lead to something worse cliche used to full effect, which was annoying. They also weren't exactly likeable characters either, I just wasn't that fussed if anything were to happen to them.
The main villain, this demon thing, was just never really explained. For such a large part he had 0 depth to his name.I could go on but I'll stop. Listen, for its time I can see why people would enjoy it. But it's just not a good film to be honest. It's not scary and the plot is poor. If you haven't seen and you are debating it. Don't...",Jeepers Creepers

The quality of the film looks fantastic, especially the remastered version, and the camera moves are well planned out. The cast is great, the sister can get a bit annoying (as sisters tend to do), and the way they've brought The Creeper to life is so good.",Jeepers Creepers
109,FilmFanInTheHouse,One of the few horror films that i feel freaked out by.,7,16 March 2008,"Jeepers Creepers (2001, Dir. Victor Salva) On their way back home during the spring break, Darry and Patricia Jenner witness a mysterious person dumping something down a tunnel. Deciding to discover what was dumped down there, Darry discovers a huge disturbing hideout full of modified bodies. Darry and Patricia set off to get help, unaware that the individual is now aware of who has been down the tunnel. Darry and Patricia soon realises that their pursuer is not just a mysterious person, but something even more horrifying, who has more in store than they could possibly imagine.'Jeepers Creepers' is one of my favourite horror films. It's not because it's got a well designed looking monster, or because Justin Long's and Gina Philips' characters are developed so well. The film does contain these aspects, but the big reason why i love this film, is because it is one film which does contain scenes which i feel freaked out about. Horror films rarely affect me, but this film just provided well filmed scenes, whilst keeping the Creeper hidden for the first half of the film. The shot of the Creeper just standing and watching the car drive past, really makes you think what you would do in the same situation. Although, the quality of the film decreases a bit at the end, i had a wonderful time watching this film.""Every 23rd Spring, for 23 days, it gets to...eat."" - Jezelle Gay Hartman (Patricia Belcher)",Jeepers Creepers
110,baileycrawly,"Great Movie, Controversies Aside",7,16 December 2019,"Jeepers Creepers was a fresh and unique movie when it came out. It was creepy, had some good jump scares and enough gorey horror content to satisfy the youthful audience at the time who demanded to see it.
Jeepers Creepers has stood the test of time and gone on to become one of horror's greatest franchises. The movies are often talked about (for the good and the bad) and debated (mostly about the director) but, at the end of the day, this franchise's first entry will be remembered for many years to come.Every 23 years for 23 days, the creeper gets to feast. It's an interesting concept, and a double-edged sword: it creates an urgency for the creeper as it stalks its prey, but it also causes extreme limitations in terms of sequel planning because the creeper is only around for that limited period of time (it's like Disney with their moratorium program; get it before it's gone for years to come!).
The acting in this movie is about what you would expect from a slasher. It's campy, but nobody approaches one of those movies expecting a Shakespearean production.
Where Salva's first horror effort, Clownhouse, was boring and fell flat, when Salva approached Jeepers Creepers, he really had his finger on the pulse of America. He knew that people wanted to see, what they were scared of, and what would make for a good movie.
A lot of elements in this movie are dated (particularly the effects), but on the whole this movie is still fun to watch and stood up relatively well. I prefer the second one to the original, but this will always be one of the true greats of horror.",Jeepers Creepers
111,bsinc,Some creepy film,8,19 November 2004,"This movie did exactly what it was meant to do - redefine the rules of horror movies by being so unpredictable it almost gets predictable by doing so. Sounds weird huh:), basically it just means that you take nothing in the movie for granted, everything is a surprise and I enjoyed it immensely. I sadly can't say the same for my friends/flat mates because they said it was one of the worst movies they ever saw and have been kind of teasing me about it ever since (approximately for one month now) I have nothing but praise to say about the lead actor and the attractive actress. They give immense believability to everything because they act incredibly convincing, the only right way to go in a good scary movie. And please, take note, there is a difference between a scary movie and a horror movie. The first one's occasionally scare you but are mostly the entertaining type, the second ones are the ones that give you the willies.This one is entertainment at its best, every minute the movie has a new thing to offer the hungry viewer. I guess I just got it and have to say I will definitely check out the sequel. For my friends all I can say is - look beyond the world of bad scary movies that have plagued Hollywood and try to see ""Jeepers Creepers"" for what it is, salvation from all this. A pioneer movie almost I just thought the ending was kind of rushed and unexplained, still can't wait for the second partRecommend - to people who are able to look beyond what they see and are able to think and get the subtle messages and hints.8/10",Jeepers Creepers
112,nitzanhavoc,Surprisingly impressive!!!,7,9 December 2012,"Well I've always considered myself to be a devout Horror fan, so lately I've decided to catch up to some of the classics that I've never had the chance to watch. I've heard much about Jeepers Creepers, but have never seen it, even though it's been aired on Israeli TV stations many times, especially as part of Halloween specials.I must say, I've been much more impressed than I thought I'd be with a Supernatural/Slasher sub-genre flick. The characters are as original as you'll ever see in this sub-genre (you must have seen dozens of films with a group of friends going on vacation, how many have you seen where the protagonists are a brother and a sister?) The script is also great, perfectly portraying the sibling rivalry while still caring for each other. The other characters are less impressive (i.e the police officers), except for Patricia Belcher whom I personally really liked here. As for the acting, other than Justin Long's occasional ""facial expression glitch"", it is more than adequate.The idea behind the monster is also great and very original! But the monster itself... I don't know if it's the budget, the early years or lack of creativity in the makeup dept. but the monster simply isn't scary. Besides, the moment the monster is ""revealed"", the film changes from being a delicate The Hitcher/Joyride combination to a failed attempt to combine Freddie and Jason. I know I probably use the phrases ""unfulfilled potential"" and ""anticlimactic"" way too often in my reviews of Horror films, maybe I'm being too harsh... but that's exactly how I feel in regards to Jeepers Creepers.The ending, however, is another very pleasant surprise. No surprising twists (always a let down for me, I love twists) but nothing corny or overdone, just a strong scene to end a strong film. And less I forget - what a great soundtrack! Not often do you see such an ironic use of 60's classics.All in all - I'm very pleasantly surprised and would recommend this film to any Horror fan",Jeepers Creepers

Too bad the rest (2) of this franchise was just horrible, especially after waiting 16 long-ass years for 3rd movie and it was just a suck-fest! :( But this 1st movie is a fun and scary pop-corn movie I will always love! ;D",Jeepers Creepers
114,skybrick736,Jeepers Creepers (7/10),7,7 January 2016,"Although Jeepers Creepers feels like an odd combination of horror films, especially Texas Chainsaw, it's still a unique horror film for its time in the early 2000's. Director Victor Salva, who also wrote the film, did the right thing by making the central focus about the two main characters. These two characters were played by known talent Gina Philips and Justin Long, if they were the right choice of casting is a different and difficult question, but the leads certainly could have been much worse. Supporting cast wasn't all that great and neither was the dialogue throughout the entire film.The place where Salva truly made a fascinating and horrifying addition to the film is the concept and look of the Jeepers Creepers' monster. The monster seems to be half man, half bug and appears to be designed off of a dark scarecrow figure. Besides the monster itself there is a total lack of originality with the film's premise and had an ending that seemed a little abrupt and unfinished. Definitely something to check out though strictly for entertainment, the film goes by pretty fast without much thought.",Jeepers Creepers
115,PoisonKeyblade,Amazing Horror Film,10,17 August 2007,"One of my favorite horror films. Jeepers Creepers had everything you expect from a good horror movie. The plot and the characters were very realistic and engaging. It was so terrifying because it felt like this could really happen most of the time. The Creeper was kept in the shadows for the majority of the film, which made this one work so well as opposed to the lesser sequel. Justin Long and Gina Phillips deliver powerful acting performances, and the end is just disturbing and perfect. The directing is surreal, and fits perfectly with the tone of the movie. While the movie does have a couple faults and some genre stereotypes that it gives in to, it is mostly a true horror classic in the vein of the old Universal monster movies that is superior in not just effects, but also quality.",Jeepers Creepers

In fact is quite similar to a Cliver Barker ""Book of Blood"" story. Those wonderfully cynic masterpieces of prose writing. This movie is dark, intelligent, surprising, carthartic - on the level of Japanese horror like The Ring and Audition, although in a different way. I guess the movie´s real strength is the eerie, ""Texas Chainsaw-like"" surrounding´s. The scene where the monster throws stuff down a pipe is just incredible matching the excitement of a movie like ""Se7en"".",Jeepers Creepers
117,benoit-3,An American Masterpiece,10,3 August 2002,"I heard many good things about this film. But after three attempts at renting it from different outfits on DVD, I had to accept the sad fact hat this MGM disc is, for some mysterious, unfathomable reason, incompatible with my Toshiba SD-2109 DVD player. It wasn't until I upgraded my DVD player that I finally got to appreciate what a fine piece of work this is: great believable characters, great actors, supremely masterful cinematography that captures every moment of the end of a dying day in Florida and the coming of night without any of that bluish taint that infects all contemporary movies. Suspense in the middle of the daytime and in the middle of the night. A truly great filmscore that the director actually supervised. Truly great editing and sound. All in all, the production values of this film which could otherwise be mistaken for a teenage summer slasher flick are absolutely staggering and on a par with the finest of modern Japanese cinema. This director is, on the strength of this film alone, one of the finest story-tellers in America. I am not a fan of this genre at all but I will always be willing to make an exception for this brilliant director.",Jeepers Creepers
118,loomis78-815-989034,This one has it all! Top notch Horror film will become a classic.,9,8 June 2013,". Darry (Long) and his sister Trish (Phillips) are driving Trish's car through an isolated stretch of roads through Florida to go back home. At one point a huge industrial truck runs right up on their car from behind and blows its extra loud horn scaring the two siblings off the road. After gaining their composure they continue on until they spot the same truck at an abandoned church where they spot a large fellow in a hat dump what appears to be a body wrapped in a sheet down a large drain pipe. After discussing right and wrong, Darry convinces Trish to go back and let him have a look. While Trish keeps her eye open for the demonic truck Darry accidentally slides down the pipe and finds an underground lair of horrors. Nude and dead bodies are woven in the ceiling like a sick tapestry. Darry escapes but is badly shaken. Trish gets him to a rest stop where he receives a bizarre phone call from a psychic named Jezelle (Belcher) who warns him to run if he hears the song jeeper's creepers. What happens next is an intense and scary showdown on the road with Darry and Trish and a creature that is known as the Creeper (Breckman) in pursuit. The Creeper comes around every 23 years and has 23 days to take body parts that he needs to survive. Darry & Trish know he wants something from one of them but they don't know who. They end up at a police station with Jezelle until the Creeper comes to take what he is after. A chilling end scene is one that is horrific and memorable. Writer/Director Victor Salva proves his early film ""Clownhouse"" was no fluke. This highly original story provides horror audiences with a new villain in the form of the creature known as the Creeper. We get to know the creeper and his background as the course of the film unfolds. Salva makes this character mysterious and downright scary early in the film. You are certain to get chills when Darry and Trish drive by the church and the creeper is standing there starring at them. More layers are revealed later as the Creeper toys with the siblings doubling as a scarecrow in a yard and pursuing them on the road. Until you realize in a shocking scene that the Creeper has wings and can also fly! Salva just keeps making the character scarier as the film progresses and the brother and sister team and the audience watching the film sink deeper in their seats as more is revealed. Another stroke of genius was making the two main characters brother and sister instead of the time worn couple. The dialog between the siblings is completely believable and as an audience we immediately like them. Since the story is told through their eyes we go along with them for the thrilling ride of terror and scares. Salva layers the film with mystery, great suspense and is smart enough to add some gruesome gore at times but doesn't over do it. The only flaw is when the siblings get to the Police station towards the end. The excellent momentum the film had up to this point is stopped momentarily with the addition of the psychic in the film which slows the pace for a little bit. It's also obvious that the bumbling police are there to be killed off quickly which actually makes the Creeper less scary in a way as he easily slaughters the cops. The final scene is a true chiller and this movie is an excellent horror film!",Jeepers Creepers
119,the amorphousmachine,"Justin Long and Gina Philips make this movie bearable! Plot, like this comment however, seems a little trite!",5,29 December 2011,"The first time I noticed Justin Long was in 'Die Hard 4' (Live Free or Die Hard); as I never watched ""Ed"", and barely remember him from 'Galaxy Quest'. Since then, I've seen him in several films. Some good and some bad! I had no idea he was in 'Jeepers Creepers' so I was pleasantly surprised to see him in an early role as the lead. The film I had avoided for various reasons- particularly because it looked like a cheesy horror movie.Well, it is pretty cheesy. A brother and sister are chased by this Creeper creature for their body parts which are unknown to them which one he is exactly after. Then the plot is slightly propelled by a psychic who feebly attempts to steer them out of harm's way. Plus the duo must run every time they hear the song ""Jeepers Creepers"". Yep, it's fairly cheesy. The Creeper itself looked menacingly enough, but its' motivations seemed a little trite to me.Justin Long is a star for a reason, and it's the acting that he brings that makes this film endurable. Gina Philips (Ally McBeal) and Justin work well together and have some decent banter at the beginning! The overall dialogue was pretty good, but the plot was very flimsy! For instance, Long convincing Gina to return to the potential body-dumping ground was just unrealistic, and simply a plot-device! As well as the use of a psychic from out-of-nowhere, and the legend behind the Creeper's cycle. It just didn't work for me.Some of the cinematography is good! And Victor Salva directs this film reasonably well, displaying the landscape and isolation of the American countryside! I waited for rental 10 years after the film was released; just out of curiosity, and besides seeing Justin Long in an earlier movie, it really wasn't worth the wait! **½ out of *****!",Jeepers Creepers

But nonetheless, Jeepers Creepers will enthrall you, scare you and sometimes make you laugh (whether or not that's the intention).At times Jeepers Creepers feels like the masterpiece of the century, but unfortunately at other times it feels like a standard horror.

127,theinaniloquent,"""Fear takes a road trip""",3,28 April 2012,"So, in my humble opinion, the film didn't have potential at all. When I first took a peek at it, the first film that came to mind was just about every other clichéd horror film produced nowadays. In fact, the description ""terrible"" came to mind, almost setting up a review by itself. Nevertheless, I saw the film lurking around Netflix's instant streams and gave in, expecting nothing but another movie...Well, there's not much more for say, the movie was just as I had expected beforehand. The acting was just horrible. I actually find Justin Long as a decent actor. He's not great, but he's not bad either. He just walks through the movie, seamlessly doing so with nothing but the intention to move on to another movie. The plot was contrived, as expected. The film has no tension throughout and I swear I liked the talking scenes more than the 'terror' scenes. It was just another gimmick for something new and original, but did what every film has done before. And surely I've heard of a masked killer before? It's been done before, why even try to brand it as something new and original? It's not anything new or exciting and everything was just so low-key your going to cheering for the ending rather than more of it.So there's not much more to say. I recommend if there's nothing else to do. The only thing that'll make this movie good is if you either play the drinking game or if you want to just have some fun with friends but having no idea what's going on in the screen.

They are played by Gina Phillips and Justin Long. Now, both of them are really bad. Clumsy line delivery and often bordering on overacting. I'm not a big fan of Justin Long in general. But the dialogue between them is very good and makes me laugh! Some examples:""What the hell was that guy's problem?"" ""My first guess? INBREEDING!""""You know the part in scary movies when somebody does something really stupid and everybody hates them for it? This is it.""""Hey, bum-f'uck police, I'm being chased by a guy who likes to pull tongues out of severed heads with his teeth. Is there a special extension for that?""So yeah, in a way this is sort of a horror comedy, even though it isn't advertised that way. Even when things get the most ridiculous, you are entertaining by both the brilliant and the stupid one-liners. It's hard to not be critical of this film though. For example, the creature itself, once fully revealed... isn't that scary. It looks pretty dumb, to be frank. Especially when it flashes its damn wings! I just laughed at that part. I really tried to be creeped out, but I laughed my ass off. Jezelle is also annoying. I mean, the actor playing her is just too damn over-the-top, almost bordering on camp. So yeah, that's a weak link. The song ""Jeepers Creepers"" playing in a few scenes is hilariously cheesy, but it was at least used effectively in one scene when two cops are shocked out of their seats when the creature appears. The worst part of the movie is the last twenty or so minutes. From starting out as genuinely creepy and then just is entertaining... it becomes stupid. The last scene with Darry's head chopped off had me dying with laughter, even though it was supposed to be scary and not funny. Thankfully, the characters are never too unlikable. Yes they are sorta irritating, but they are still good enough people that you want them to survive.Jeepers Creepers is an all right watch.

JEEPERS CREEPERS crosses that line more than a few times, to its own detriment.There are some genuinely very tense moments, where the scare factor is great. This film does deliver there, but everything else runs typical of a movie of this genre. The character development is barely past the ""Hi, good to know ya"" stage. Why on earth the killer does what he does, was about as satisfactorily explained as it's relationship to the old, popular song from where this movie gets its title. Basically nada, zip, zilch...but it is a cool title, nonetheless. If you like your scares on the gross side, and aren't too picky on details or motivations, then this movie might hit your mark.

132,lthseldy1,starts off creepy but I don't know what happened after that,3,11 January 2002,"This movie was supposed to be good.  I heard from several people that it gave them nightmares and that it was the scariest movie they had ever seen. I had to see it.  During the beginning it was scary with the two teenagers rideing in a car in the middle of nowhere and all the sudden they are being hurassed by a big truck that tries to run them off the road.  After the truck leaves, the two teens continue to drive and discover the driver of the truck dumping dead bodies out of his truck into a pipe.  And the look of this guy is creepy.  I wish he would have stayed that way instead of becomming nothing but another ""big scary monster"".  The brother of the teens wants to investigate the pipe and ends up in the bottom of something that looks like it may have been a well or an underground tunnel of some sort. he discovers bodies that are sewn together that look like cheep crappy plastic dummies and give no sense of realism here.  As he discovers what is happening he and his sister go out to call the police and the film drops from there.  It becomes nothing more than a short story or a story seen on the series ""Monsters"" or ""Tales from the darkside"" other than a movie. The rst of the movie is about the demon going out killing people, sniffing clothes and playing ""Jeepers Creepers"" which is the cheeziest part of the film adding that song to the dialoge.

This movie is great at building tension and keeping you interested from start to finish dosent quite to it as well as Halloween (78) but it's really done and really fun to watch.The movie also has some wicked visuals especially when we see down the pipe and we see all these dead bodies all stitched together in the Creepers lair it's really well shot especially when the camera moves revealing the wall covered in bodies it's just a wicked shot and all works well to build the tension and keep interested on who this Creeper really is.Now I don't think this film is perfect it's is a little slow at the beginning and does drag on a little but I understand it's building tension and keeping you guessing but it's a bit of inpatient watch for me I think maybe if there where more characters at the beginning it may not be because Halloween and Nightmare on Elm Street start of kinda slow and build tension but there's a few characters to keep you interested and keep the plot going.However once the creeper shows up and they go down the pipe this movie grips you and never lets you go and it's just a thrilling ride all the way to the end. The use of the song Jeepers Creepers is just genius it's very clever used and makes that song really creepy love it.My favourite shot from the film is definitely the end you see Justin longs character with his eyes out and then the creeper looks at you with his eyes it's just genius and definitely adds to the plot element of the Creeper taking parts from people he eats. Also I love the fact that it dosent have a happy ending it's not often that happens in horror movies and it works so much for this one.Verdict 8.5/10 very good horror movie with one of the coolest monsters just a little slow at the beginning and dosent grab me straight away like other horror movies (Halloween and Nightmare on Elms Street)",Jeepers Creepers
134,RockPortReview,Great Creature Effects and Story!,8,30 March 2010,"This 2001 horror movie starring Justin Long, in one of his first roles, is a real gem that deserves some attention. ""Jeepers"" was directed by Victor Salva, who also directed the 2003 sequel, shows a good eye for tension and horror. This film got financial backing from famed ""Godfather"" director Francis Ford Coppola's company American Zoetrope.Darry (Long) and Trish (Gina Phillips) are brother and sister driving home from college on spring break. They have great chemistry and work really well off each other. Driving a classic car though the heartland of America they argue like any brother and sister would. After a bathroom break, an older rusted out truck drives up on them like a bat out of hell, blasting its horn and tailgating. After getting passed they wind up seeing the truck further down the road. There is man dumping something that looks like a body wrapped in a sheet down a sewer pipe. They are spotted by the man and are eventually run off the road.Darry and Trish go back to the pipe to investigate and make sure that nobody is still alive. At times this movie can be self referential, in that the characters know they are in a horror movie and try to outsmart the basic stereotypes of the genre. ""Scream"" from 1996 was the movie that set the standard for this. After hearing voices, Darry fall down the pipe to find the grotesque lair of ""The Creeper."" The lair is the basement of an old abandon church. Darry emerges from the lair and they drive off to get help at a local café. They don't find much help except from a psychic that mysteriously calls them on a pay phone. The whole plot of the movie is kind of cheesy and unbelievable, but the characters really save this movie and make it into a surprise hit.As explained by the psychic, every 23rd spring for 23 days the Creeper feeds. It sniffs out certain people and eats particular organs that its body absorbs and becomes apart of him. The Creeper reveals that he has bat like wings, and upon close inspection he looks a bit like a meaner version of the ""Creature from the Black Lagoon"". As I mentioned in the last review cops are really not much help when it comes to these kinds of movies. There is a big final battle at the police station where the Creeper takes over. I won't reveal the ending but it is a little different that what I expected.",Jeepers Creepers
135,Aussie Stud,Unimpressive 'by-the-numbers' horror flick that totally misses its mark.,1,16 January 2002,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** I really wanted to like ""JEEPERS CREEPERS"", but there was not one single moment in the film that made me jump. A lot of reviewers applauded the film during its theatrical run, mainly on the guise that this movie was truly terrifying and that it was a welcome entry into the genre that most film-makers these days simply have no idea about. On that premise alone, I thought this movie would be something different... that it would have things that movies like ""I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER"", ""URBAN LEGEND"", ""SCREAM"" and yes, even ""WISHMASTER"", didn't have. Strangely enough, I could not find a scrap of difference that ""JEEPERS CREEPERS"" had to offer that would supposedly make it different from the hundreds of other horror films out there that get released 'straight-to-video'.The problem with this film is that the two lead characters, brother and sister (played by Gina Phillips and Justin Long) are so darn annoying that you will find yourself rooting for the 'monster' half the time because their endless squabbling and inexcusable stupidity starts to dig into your nerves.The two are on a road trip returning home from College to see their mother in an unknown State. The landscape consists of mostly farmland and cornfields and it won't be two minutes into the film until you're already thinking of ""CHILDREN OF THE CORN"" and ""TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE"". Of course this spells trouble for the two as they become victims of a mysterious 'road rager' who rams their car from behind in some sort of 'Munsters'-like contraption that is pieced together by rusted metal and juiced up with some cool acceleration fluid that allows the said vehicle to speed around them at an unexplainable speed.Fortunately at this point, the terrorizing vehicle is about the ONLY thing in this movie that seems 'creepy'. Further trouble is spelled out for the siblings as they pass an old boarded-up church and recognize the same vehicle that rammed their car earlier, parked out the front. A man clad in a leather slicker (yep, start thinking ""I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER"") is dumping a body wrapped in a white sheet down a corrugated-iron pipe and before you know it, the two meddling siblings are playing detective and investigating the situation after the stranger drives off in his vehicle.Naturally, in a film like ""JEEPERS CREEPERS"", you can't for a second take anything that happens in this movie seriously. So when the brother ends up inside the tunnel to discover a horrific finding that involves a corpse with his bodily organs recently extracted and countless petrified bodies glued to the walls and ceiling in some sort of underground cavern, it will only be a natural reaction that you will find yourself shaking your head in disgust at how cliche'd this is turning out to be.With the siblings now on the run to report this monstrosity to the local 'hick' authorities, they have the 'monster' closely on their pursuit and naturally put everyone else in danger who they happen to come into contact with. That would also include Eileen Brennan who makes an inexcusable cameo in this movie as a half-crazy shotgun-wielding cat lover who makes the most of her four minutes on screen battling the 'monster' inside her house before suffering a very nasty demise.Another major problem with ""JEEPERS CREEPERS"" is that the 'monster' featured in this movie is not exactly scary or creepy. He looks like a regular character that could be featured on an episode of ""BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER"" and the things he does aren't exactly 'horrific'. The body count is very low for a horror movie. Most horror buffs won't find much pleasure here seeking out a high gore count as most of the killings usually involve a quick death by way of organ extraction or decapitation.Understanding that this movie was made on a relatively small budget, you can excuse the bad make-up effects where the corpses resemble department store mannequins. The monster itself has very weak motives. His reasons for killing are not explained very well. A psychic advises the sister that he kills his victims and removes a certain body part so it will become a part of him in its place (think of ""THE MUMMY"" and the bodies it consumed to make it a 'whole' being). The bad news for the siblings is that it is after one of them in particular because he or she has something that it wants (most likely a body part or two).Some ridiculous scenes would include a police station and the obligatory 'bumbling' cops who, even in a pack of 10, could not manage to hold a monster at bay with their whole firearms arsenal. With that being said, the ending is about the only satisfying thing that I felt that I got out of this movie. What happens, I cannot say. But let's just say that the 'monster' got what he wanted.The only bad thing about the ending is that it leaves the door open for an eventual and probable sequel that no one was really asking for. ""JEEPERS CREEPERS"" wants to be a good horror film, but in a week from now, I'll have already forgotten it.My Rating: 3 out of 10",Jeepers Creepers
136,jcholguin,Jeepers Weepers More Like It,2,21 December 2003,"Since a sequel was made to this film, I believed that the first must have been a good movie, I was wrong! There is a creeper, but what he is or who he is are kept secret. All we know is that something comes out every 23 years and that he sucks up parts of people for use in his own body. Eyes, tongues, feet or whatever part is needed. Why he needs this, I don't know. Does he want to look human? Maybe, it would be an improvement. There is one scene as the Jenner siblings continue to run over the body of the creeper. Parts of his body turn to dust. The best line or really the only good part of dialog occurs with this scene as the brother Darius tells his sister Patricia to stop running over the body because he is dead, her reply ""they always get up."" I guess that is why there is a sequel, bad things tend to get up and made again. The creeper likes to smell his prey which is different way of choosing victims but the whole idea pretty much smells in the execution. Skip this one.",Jeepers Creepers
137,aramo1,Good stormy night stuff.,6,20 January 2002,"Based on R1 DVD 90 minHaving recently watched 'From Dusk till Dawn' I wasn't overly impressed by the gore in Jeepers Creepers. Five minutes of character development is allowed before the baddie makes his debue, which at least creates some link with the brother and sister dynamic duo. The acting is above average even if Darry (the brother) hops a little too smoothly between terror (which he does well) and normality.Over all the horror is OK, a little more detail and time would have been welcomed.6/10 worth watching, if you like horror, gore and satanic beasts.",Jeepers Creepers
138,RhapsodyReviews,Creepy Monster Movie.,8,26 September 2019,"Review:
'Jeepers Creepers' is an American-German horror film written and directed by Victor Salva. This movie is one of the guilty pleasures that are high on my list. I watch it about five times a year just because it's so damn entertaining. When I was young, too young perhaps, I watched this movie when it first came out on VHS and it scared the piss out of me. Watching it again today after so many times I wouldn't say it's scary, but it will keep you on the edge of your seat.
The movie follows Darry and Trish Jenner, a brother and sister (Justin Long and Gina Philips) who are on a road trip to see their parents while on a break from school. Who are now being stalked by some monster after they see it throughout what appears to be bodies wrapped in a sheet down a sewer pipe.
I got to say props to Justin Long for not being the worst actor in a movie. Don't get me wrong, I do like him when he is in comedic roles (Accepted, Dodgeball: An Underdog Story or anything Kevin Smith related) he just isn't the strongest dramatic actor in my opinion. I could not stand Gina Philips in this movie at all, none of her facial expressions match her tone of voice and the dialogue she spoke had to structure behind it. It did make it so the movie was less impactful than it could have been at times. The same thing goes to Patricia Belcher who plays a psychic that warns Darry and Trish about the 'Creeper'.
That being said about the acting, I still can enjoy the shit out of this movie. It does rip off the premise of Stephen King's 'IT' a little bit in the way that The Creeper only comes around every 23 years, while Pennywise comes around ever 27 years, and The Creeper smells what he likes about you in your fear while Pennywise likes the taste of your fear. I love what they did with how the creature looks and walks like a human, but when you see it up close you wish you hadn't. It creepy as hell. But even with the similarities with 'IT' the movie is still one of the most original monster flicks I've seen in quite some time, in more ways than one. The biggest being the ay it deals with tension building.
Overall, this is a monster movie that will entertain you for days and you won't be forgetting for a long time.

First time we watched this, October 2002, and up until he throws that body down the pipe its perfect. Dad always said he'd get me a Creeper Truck, sadly he did not before he died.

140,BHorrorWriter,They must have hoped the audience wouldn't ask questions.,7,4 September 2001,"It has been a long time since Horror movies have offered this type of movie. Over the past 5-6 years, we have been beaten over the head with the ""masked Killer"".  I don't even consider movies like Scream, Valentine, I know what you did... and others of those kinds to be horror movies...Maybe suspense, but not horror.  It was refreshing to see Horror reverting back to the monster movie.With the hearing the disappointing news that Halloween 8 would not be coming out this year, I was delighted to see another Horror movie coming out: Jeepers Creepers.  Kinda weird, spooky title.  The trailers looked really good.  A dark, mysterious creatures is stalking and killing people, for a reason we can only attribute to cannibalism.  Setting its sites on two teens coming home from college.Well, the movie starts rather slow.  Then picks up with the appearance of a strange, rusted, decaying truck, taunting the teens, trying to run them off the road...ok, so we see this happen twice withing the first 20 mins of the movie.  The kids going back to the old church were they saw somemone throwing something down the pipe...and the boy falling down the hole to discover the frightening truth.  After we are taken on a rather timid ride through this would-be horror movie.Though it had a decent set-up, Jeepers Creepers fall dead.  Letting itself become predictable, silly, and above all: Not Scary.  The entrance of the ""Psychic"" was lame and seemed just tacked on.  I don't feel that character was in the first draft of the script.  The CGI was almost amateurish at some times, and really didn't seem needed.  The creature looked like one of the gargoyles from the made for tv movie (back in the 70's) called Gargoyles. I did, however like the costume.Unfortunatley, this movie really does fall on its face.  The ending is so obvious, if you don't catch on very early in the movie, you apparently just have been watching the same movie as the rest of us.  This also sets us up for a sleuth of sequels.  I mean, if this things can't be killed, or at least we are hinted towards that, then that means sequel, sequel, sequel...And the questions we can ask:  Where did this things come from?  Why does it only ""hunt"" every 23 years for only 23 days?  What is up with the song? and why is it relevant to the ritualistic way the creature hungs?  Who the hell is the psychic, and why is she important?  Why did the creature gut the kids whole head, and not just take his ""peepers""?  Well, there are too many to go on...This wasn't a bad horror movie, but it wasn't a good one either.  I don't feel I wasted by 5 bucks.  If there is a sequel, I hope some questions are answered.On the other hand, not knowing alot, did make the atmosphere and the suspense and scare factor a little higher, because we didn't know why this thing did what it does, or where or who or why or what.  This movie it want to be a real horror/monster movie, but just became another casualty in a long line of recent horror ""efforts"".7 out of 10",Jeepers Creepers
141,bayardhiler,A Great Highway Horror Movie,9,5 March 2012,"There are times when I look at good movies on IMDb and then shocked when I see such low scores. This is one of those films. I feel this movie should at least have a 7.0. The film opens with a brother and sister driving home from college for spring break and like any brother and sister, quarrel over license plates and life. Peaceful enough, right? Then out of the blue, an old beat up truck with a loud horn comes up behind them and starts playing chicken with them. After a few terrifying seconds, the truck passes them and leaves them in the wind. Then, when they are driving past an old beat up church they see the truck and a strange ""man"" dumping what appears to be bodies down a pipe and while they look at him he looks back at them. We later learn that the ""man"" is no man at all, but a horrible monster that feasts on the flesh of others every 23 years for 23 days. This is one of those films that reminds me of ""Duel"" in the sense that someone is being chased by an evil and powerful force on an isolated highway and no one is around to help them. Sure, the film takes some liberties, but it's a movie people. The trick is to make the film entertaining so that no one will care. This film certainly does this. All in all, if you're looking for a good highway horror film, check out Jeepers Creepers.",Jeepers Creepers

I would love to hear someone name an actual horror movie that has Oscar award acting. No I would actually pay them to hear them actually say one movie of the horror genre.Just hearing people actually say the acting is bad, is annoying as heck. All horror movies are bad acting, and if they actually had one that had good acting, would it be considered a horror movie or drama? Some people are nuts, just by catching what they think. Or do they think before saying or talking? Then there are people that like the boring and drawn long nothing happening until the end horror movie, and say they are the best. That is annoying too. The build up should be there. Hello, that is called fall asleep boring horror movies. If you just see people talking and scenes going no where to explain anything is not a good horror movie.Most of these people that I am talking about above are people I would never ever would want to be in the same room as the movie is playing. Bickering about a movie, because they have no brains to even like something that is actually better than themselves, do not need to be even in the same atmosphere as me.I talking about stupid people all the time, but hearing all this crap about acting in a horror movie tops the cake of stupidity.

To me horror films are much more frightening when the audience gets to use its own imagination and not be subjected to sloppy b-movie effects. The scene early in the film when the brother and sister drive past a figure seemingly dumping bodies down a pipe was very eerie but then the film just gets dafter and dafter.

This time around, the old Tony Bennet song (named ""Jeepers Creepers"") gets a chilling re-interpretation in the hands of Victor Slava. This convicted child molester must know a thing or two about twisted minds, because he created a horror classic about a winged creature that cuts people's flesh and goes out on a killing rampage every 25 years or so. Does it take a sick soul to understand one? Probably.What starts as your basic ""brother and sister get lost on the highway to hell"" story soon rubs off the clichés and starts shoving pure action and horrific twists in your face. While predictable to some, and without a doubt cheesy to others, it's a really enjoyable gem for fans of the genre.

This film didn't present much else than a new type of horror beast for the audience, but it still got 7/10 stars from me for this reason: it wasn't presented like every other horror film.For some, the best thing about horror films is the evident laughter that one has for most b-movie horrors. This wasn't a b-movie horror (nor an overly serious one) and it did a great job at giving the horror fans a new monster in their world. The Creeper has got the goods to survive in many memories. Some say that this film is a bit slow after the halfway point, but it isn't.If anything it reveals more as it goes. The problem with most horror movies, too, is the filler scenes which are usually thrown-in scenes with nudity and pointless crap to fill the void while the monster does damage. This movie has filler, but it was more suspenseful and you feel that the Creeper is close-by always in the film.Everything but the remake of Siouxsie's ""Peekaboo"" and the everlasting bumper on the back of these siblings' car (from the beginning, when they get hit a million times, but in the next shots the bumper is fine) get props from me.

In it, a brother and sister (well-played by Justin Long and Gina Phillips) are driving home from college to visit the folks for the summer. The brother spots what he thinks is a serial killer, but it turns out to be something even worse. Then the killer discovers them and they must run for their lives, while trying to find someone who believes them. At times, it's like a cross between ""Alien"" and ""Duel."" The film created a truly terrifying villain with frightening killing methods, and the small-town southern locations are very well-used, creating the ideal atmosphere. Then the story sputters and stalls. The killer turns out to have super-human strength and might be some kind of animal or alien, but its nature is never explained. And the story, as a result, becomes less and less believable. The final act is truly a disappointment, with a ""surprise"" ending that's downbeat without being all that scary.

150,rcavellero,READ BETWEEN THE LINES!,8,3 August 2003,"Okay so it's completely obvious that this film is not meant to be taken at face value and any person that thinks that it should. Couldn't grasp the concept of the very original fear that it exploits.  I'm not saying it's the greatest film ever but it is a very good one.  The basic premise goes something like this. Two siblings traveling cross country back home find themselves stalked by a monster after witnessing him or it dispossing bodies down a large pipe into a cavern.  They're relentlessly pursued through the entire film and run into some down home cliches and some silly ones to lighten the mood but all in all the film is very atmospheric and only when the creature shows it's true face does the film lose a little edge. However, let's talk what this film is really about. I hate to bring this up because Victor Salva is indeed a very talented guy but back in the 80's he made a film called clownhouse.  He was caught molesting a young boy, the film's star. Because he recorded it on film. Now these are truly the actions of a disturbed individual. However through the yrs. he's been through counselinhg and has been dealt justice by the system.  Now so many years later it still haunts him. Now they say that people express them selves through there artwork.  Now let's take a look at this This film. It's about a brother and sister the brother of course who is underlyingly gay(a rose tattoo above his belly button and tainted dialogue) whom is stalked and chosen by what it seems to be an older man in a long dirty trench coat. The film builds to a climax where (SPOILER AHEAD) the creeper must choose between the both of them and moves off with the boy.  And than the disturbing ending an abandoned warehouse where a young boy screams grotesquely and the creeper taking something from him, his eyes and the creeprs eye replacing his. Examine this. Now thats pretty scary wheather he did it intentionally or subconciously there's some very intense psychological issues about this film that need to be obtained to truly enjoyed it.

I want to make it clear that I do not condone anything he has done. However, that has nothing to do with the film itself. That being said...Salva was clearly not inspired by 80's slashers, but by the monster movies of old, particularly ""Creature From the Black Lagoon."" The similarity is to obvious to be ignored. It is not a gorefest, but a legitimate attempt to give the audience a good scare. Unfortunately, it falls short of the mark.The first half of the film is the strongest. It effectively builds suspense, as two college kids encounter an evil force in a deceptively ordinary setting. The banter between Philips and Long could have been annoying, but in this case it's actually refreshing at times, making the characters more believable.Sadly, ""Jeepers Creepers"" runs aground in the final act. The scenes in the police station are far too routine and predictable. At the very least a little firepower would have livened things up.

This is very shocking and surprising, because you can't predict what the creature will do, especially when he was driving his truck. I believe this was an original concept, but am I the only one who thinks the creeper is the Bogey Man? I mean the song at the end, was kind of a hint. The scenes that were very disturbing was the scene when Darry checks out the old church to discover bodies and bodies of people who fell victim to the creeper. And another is the one with the phone call when the woman warns them about what's gonna happen to them. And the song she's trying to show them to warn them about it. There were a lot of disturbing scenes and gruesome murders here, stuff that will freak you out. This ain't no slasher flick or Texas Cahinsaw rip, and that's what's good about it. Especially the concept of the monster in the movie, it gets to eat after 23 years and for 23 days. But I wonder how they plan to make another sequel, if it's to take place in the future, if they do, I hope it won't be another 'space theme' crap like they did with Jason X.

161,GroovyDoom,"Flawed, but fun",7,4 September 2001,"While it's not perfect, 'Jeepers Creepers' is one of the best horror movies to come along in recent years. Even more importantly, it suggests a shift away from gratuitous use of computer-generated villains and special effects, making limited use of CGI and relying more heavily on good old-fashioned prosthetics and makeup.To give away the plot really would spoil most of the fun, so I will be as vague as possible. The story begins much like 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre', introducing a brother and sister traveling through a rural area in their car. While the opening of the film is bright and daylit, Victor Salva still creates an ominous atmosphere through his visualization of wide open spaces and the understated use of dialogue between Darius and Trish. Before too long, they meet with weirdness when a strange truck tries to run them off the road. It takes off down the highway in front of them at an alarming speed, but they come across the truck again moments later, pulled off the side of the road by an old rundown church. The driver is a tall, oddly-dressed man who seems to be dumping two sheeted bodies into a drainpipe near the church, and after another chase, Trish and Darius make the classic horror movie mistake and decide to go back to the drain pipe and investigate. Trish and Darius soon discover that they have made a very unwelcome enemy. I will say no more!First for the bad. After a promising beginning, Salva relies too heavily on the horror movie clichés that have been alternately mocked and overused since 'Scream' grossed millions of dollars at the box office. Cars that won't start when you need them to, characters who ignore the obvious inclination to run and keep on running, outside individuals who fail to acknowledge that something strange is going on until it is too late, those kinds of things. The movie suffers from a gratuitous lack of plotting, although this is not necessarily a bad thing at all times, and Salva does manage to build a strong atmosphere of dread. But in the total equation of 'Jeepers Creepers,' it adds up to a glaring Achilles Heel: the unsatisfying conclusion. I found myself unaffected by the ending because I was not aware that it was happening. I felt for sure there was one final act where Trish and Darius would have to face the Creeper themselves, but instead the movie was just over. Finally, the grisly denouement seemed to suggest that Salva didn't think the audience was smart enough to figure out what the creature was after all along.OK, now for the things that lift this movie above its shortcomings. Salva makes the pacing work, and he also manages to build some real interest in what could have been two vapid college-age protagonists that were more idiotic than sympathetic. Despite their tendency to fall into the obvious traps of these kinds of fictional situations, Trish and Darius remain likable, much like Jamie Lee Curtis's character in 'Halloween.' In fact, this movie references a great deal of classic, visceral horror films: 'The Hitcher,' 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre,' 'Duel,' 'The Birds,' 'Gargoyles,' and all four 'Alien' films, just to name a few.The cinematography is way above average. Even the scenes that are filmed at night and in pitch black locations are seething with tangible shadows and blue-black points of reference. I was spooked by the sight of the Creeper landing on the roof of a moving car, defying laws of physics; even though it's been done before, it looks damn good in this film.Finally, despite its reliance on the aforementioned tricks of the trade, the central idea of 'Jeepers Creepers' remains original and fresh. This same film would have been a tremendous bore if it had been about a typical Jason or Freddy villain, but Salva gives us something that we haven't quite seen before (even if its face does look a little like Krueger...). Furthermore, he is not afraid to give us clear views of his monster, but he cleverly disguises his fiend early on, beginning with a figure cloaked by a long coat, glasses and a cowboy hat, and gradually peeling these layers away scene by scene.The movie is good, even if it doesn't quite come off as an exhilarating experience upon leaving the theater. I have an admitted weakness for horror films with style over substance, and Salva's bizarre sets and odd plotting suggest the finer moments of Argento, Fulci, Craven, and many of the aforementioned films from which he draws inspiration. 'Jeepers Creepers' is frustrating in its faults, but ultimately its imagination wins out.",Jeepers Creepers

Which brings me, once again, to the so annoying fact that a zillion movies like this could be pretty fine if the scripts just had people reacting as people would. Horror requires more than monsters; it needs a foundation of reasonable action. That said, the best thing about JC is the marvelous Eileen Brennan as the Cat Lady. But those plot factors eclipse this shining scene, as in: the Creeper drives a truck? Why? And, even on absurdly abandoned highways, no one notices a monster at the wheel, or getting gas? Also, why is it trying to ram the kids with its truck in the first place, since it lets them get away? Worse than this is Darry's insistence they return to the pipe, to check out what had to be dumped bodies. The script tries to play a moral card, but it's insane. He says, hey, someone could be alive, and there's no phones for miles to call for help, which is all the MORE reason not to return to so clearly dangerous a place. NO ONE would have gone back. Even the dumbest kid would've driven like crazy to get to a gas station and phone. Which reminds me: did they even have cells? I forget. But we all know there'd be the obligatory, 'damn, no signal!' moment anyway. PS The abandoned church/Creeper crib. I'd think that, if every 23 years tons of people vanished right around there, somebody would've checked out that odd place right off the road.",Jeepers Creepers

The second half was horrible and laughable, with the right ingredients for a comedy film. This movie is called horror, when actually it made me laugh in hysterics. If you're seeking a quality horror film, I suggest you go watch Nosferatu, A Nightmare On Elm Street and Nh10.

I've heard and read a lot of rave reviews from many people. Some saw it as a new ""Duel"". Honestly, I was not impressed. It starts spooky enough, quite slow but still atmospheric and there is some suspense. It is when we actually get to see this killer that things start to fall apart. Frankly, it looks like ""Creature from the black lagoon"". If director Salva had left his features hidden in the shadows, it might have worked all the way. The scenes at the police station are anti-climatic and sometimes downright stupid. But the ending is a kicker! Gina Phillips is quite good in her part, but Justin Long is over-acting for much of the time. And they are frankly not portraying very nice characters, constantly bickering and complaining and whining. Maybe Victor Salva wanted them to be a little unsympathetic because of the ending he has in store for one of them. Just speculating! And why waste a good actress like Eileen Brennan in such a minor part?! Maybe I am being to harsh. The plot is unusual, it has some nice effects and very good build-up.

173,ryanpersaud-59415,Another Underrated 2000s Gem,7,24 May 2021,"The Good: Horror fans are hard to please and critics generally hate horror. If you're wondering why so many poorly reviewed horror films end up being cult classics, that's why. This is a legitimately good movie. It manages to be creepy, disturbing, funny and exhilarating; it's popcorn horror mastered. The choice to make the protagonists siblings was such a great idea, as was the twist on the typical ""road rage"" movie. This movie, for me, stands with Final Destination as a film whose concept is so good, it sorta entertains on its own.The Bad: this movie is full of clichés and some very poor writing choices. I hate when poor communication is the primary driver of the plot and unfortunately, this happens quite a bit here. There are a lot of scenes that create fake conflict for no reason (you know, there is an immortal gargoyle monster chasing them, that's basically conflict enough) and scenes where people seem to forget the urgency of the situation out of the blue.The Ugly: the Creeper is great; I've seen him described as ""Batman meets a blowfish,"" (which was supposed to be a bad thing) and that's kind of spot on.

All too often even the most original and potent ideas seem to meet their doom at the slaughterhouse when Hollywood insists on adding talentless actors attempting two dimensional characters. Two thirds into the film you tell the bad guy out loud, ""Either you kill 'em, or I'm gonna'!"" Jeepers Creepers, however, has two believable and sympathetic characters played by Gina Philips and Justin Long. The film starts off running and keeps a fairly decent pace all the way to the end. The director does a better than average job at evoking creepy loneliness about the back country roads. Several times in the film I actually shared feelings of isolated dread with our two protagonists.The villain in the film is mysterious and actually frightening. The director keeps the audience in the dark as to the true nature of his deeds until the final stretch. When we do fully learn what drives him, its grotesque enough, but not over the top.What I found was how the film deflated at the end.

THen others are upset about how the movie ended. Most, though, fail to recognize why this movie is one of the most brilliant horror films of all time.Jeepers Creepers leads you down the wrong path. IN the beginning, they play it off as if the killer was human. He is just a scary, Candyman looking guy. For about the first 45 minutes, the creep factor is at a high. And then, we see the Creeper do some supernatural things; IE, riding on the roof of a car, jumping high et al. This is where most viewers stopped enjoying the film. Then, our heroes are stalked by an unkillable beast, which defies any explanation. All we know is that it can't be stopped and that it eats humans.I won't say anything about the ending, but I know that was the major reason the movie is not liked. Even I walked out of the theater, rather upset and hating the movie. I didn't watch it again until a year later, and it was mainly because I loved the cinematography.It was upon the second viewing that I realized what a brilliant film this is. It does everything that a horror movie is supposed to do. It takes twists that you don't expect. You have no idea how it's going to end. It leads you down certain paths, and then makes you realize you've walked down the wrong path.If you have only seen the film once and you hate it, I encourage you to see it again.

This movie, as one reviewer already put it, has the sister and her brother, do things that most of us would never do. Even in the annuls of horror moviedom we know what they should not do but yet they do it. This movie was too stupid in that sense. You want to care about someone so that the anxiety of them stayin alive provides tension while watching the movie. In this movie the two p**s you off so much, by doing the obviously stupid things, that you want them to die.  This is not a movie that will stay with you longer than your drive back home.

180,darkjosh,"Great First Half, Trips Second",7,7 November 2001,"For its first half, Victor Salva does a bang-up job of creating dread and suspense in Jeepers Creepers, the latest entry into the teen-horror genre, the director eschewing the normal genre cliches and gives us a truly uncomfortable and disturbing premise:  As two college students (brother and sister, and not boyfriend/girlfriend, for a change) drive home through a rural highway, they encounter a ghastly sight: a cloaked person heaving what appears to be dead bodies down a sewer drain.  They investigate, make a truly ghastly discovery and are pursued by a road-raged trucker in sequences that echo ""The Duel.""From the uncovering of the villain, however, Jeepers Creepers becomes quite standard in its course, and thought it offers quite an unseen ending, the rest of the film doesnt measure up to the nail-biting tension of the first half.After establishing a nightmarish premise, introducing smart rather than gullible and dumb main characters, and invoking a gim, menacing killer, the film degenerates into the usual cliches: cops who don't believe the main characters, a CGI killer, and a bad screenplay crutch: a psychic who knows some mumbo-jumbo lore about the killer.Still, Salva does deliver a disturbing start, Justin Long and Geena Phillips are fun and watchable as the siblings, and though it does fail to deliver an equally effective follow up, it's certainly above the likes of the horror tripe that's infested the horror genre (see Valentine) and recommendable.7 out of 10",Jeepers Creepers

The main characters were both pretty awesome and had a great relationship that felt real. The road rage scenes were gripping. Also some good special effects, though some shots do look dated. It got annoying how the main girl lead still didn't trust the person warning them even though it was obvious she knew what they were going through.I very much enjoyed the meta self awareness obviously inspired by Scream. This was also obviously inspired by It. Honestly The Creeper could be an offspring of Pennywise that ventured out from Maine long ago. Also slightly by Freddie with the song and some of the ways he moves.I like the Texas Chainsaw/Hills Have Eyes/Deliverance/Just Before Dawn/F13/Evil Dead feel. Seems like this sparked a trend with backwoods horror because Texas Chainsaw and Hills Have Eyes both received remakes after this along with F13 a few years later. Also the Wrong Turn and Hatchet franchises were created shortly after, along with a handful of other backwoods and cabin in the woods type of movies.The action movie music didn't always fit, felt extremely '90s but it was kinda charming. Wish they used mirror horroresque music.Also the creature design in this movie no doubt had an influence on Midnight Mass.This movie is a monster/creature movie while having characteristics of a slasher and action movies.

Did they really expect me to buy any of this?I know this is a monster movie. I'm willing to overlook the obvious suspension of disbelief issues. The filmmakers even get points for a good-looking monster and breaking from the traditional 'kids tell the cops but cops don't believe them' monster movie cliche.They lose it all with the characters and a few inexplicable gaffes. They completely failed to make Jezelle Hartman the creepy, somehow-knowing seer who gives vague warnings to the protagonists. She comes across as a bug-eyed caricature who hardly knows what day it is. Patricia Jenner is completely stereotypical as the post-Buffy horror heroine who starts out shocked and then decides to go kick butt. Darius Jenner is a good character, though, and I give the Creeper credit for taste: Justin Long has beautiful eyes. Why couldn't he have killed Patricia and let the cute boy go?The biggest mistake this movie makes is in how it handles the Creeper himself. All suspense is lost, early on, due to the over-use of the monster in full view. Horror movies shouldn't let the audience get used to seeing the monster. Once its appearance ceases to be a shock or surprise, you lose the real terror, and that's when most low-grade horror flicks fall back on gore, which is exactly what Jeepers Creepers does. If it wasn't for the blood and the torturous killings, the film would be laughable, instead of just insipid.My biggest pet peeve: how does a horrific supernatural creature manage to keep his vehicle registration up-to-date, let alone acquire a freaking VANITY LICENSE PLATE?

Lol awesome!Plot in a Nutshell: Two siblings car-pooling home from college are terrorized by an aggressive driver, then see something suspicious on the side of the road, and make a fateful decision...The premise sounds good, right? Two kids stop to investigate something shady and all hell breaks loose. But then when you discover that an ancient demon is the one who has been fixing up the jalopy that terrorized them, it does beg a few questions. Where did the demon get the parts to fix that truck? Even better, where did it get the knowledge? Or did it just happen to find this really old truck that performs like it's on steroids? How does the demon get the necessary gas, oil, transmission fluid, etc., to keep the jalopy in tip-top shape? And how did the demon get a personalized license plate? Is this beginning to sound stupid? You bet it is.But wait it gets better! Eventually it's explained that this demon appears only once every 23 years, for 23 days. (Don't ask me what's so special about the number 23.) In that time the demon needs to gorge itself on as many tasty humans as it can. However, it seems it spent some of that limited time working on the jalopy so that it can out-perform any car on the road. That's kinda silly isn't it? If it only has 23 days, wouldn't it want to get busy feasting on humans? ""Nah"" the demon says to itself. ""I think I'll fix up this old truck first, and cruise around town."" LOL OK.Oh yeah now the best part. Eventually we see that the demon actually has wings and can fly, and can attack people and cars without needing that souped-up jalopy in the first place. Which pretty much renders the entire first part of the film - the best and most suspenseful part, by far - utterly nonsensical. Why drive around in a jalopy when you can just fly and pick people off from the sky? Yeah I can't answer that either.""Jeepers Creepers"" has an intense and gripping start. Had me on the edge of my seat for a while. But the longer it went, the more you learn, the less intense it gets, and it switches to being silly. In sum, mixed results, which is why I can't rate it higher than 6/10.Times watched: 2. Would I watch again (Y/N)?: Only the first half.",Jeepers Creepers
189,Caz1964,Fairly good horror,8,17 September 2006,"I watched this film last night.I wasn't expecting much as i didn't know it was on until the last minute, so i decided to give it a go.It turned out to be fairly good,as it definitely lived up to its title.The film is a little weird and very creepy it does have lots of suspense and it does at times have you on the edge of your seat.It frightened my son anyway.The film starts off with two teenagers a brother and sister returning from college.They drive past an old church and see a person putting a body down a well.They then do the unthinkable which is driving back to investigate,which you know they shouldn't do.But as you know this is a horror film and everyone in horror films always seem to do the most unlikely things.Anyway the horror starts from here.The acting is a little weird and a bit all over the place but it definitely suits the mood of the film.So the acting between the two teenagers comes across as very good as the film is rather freaky anyway.The film is entertaining all the way through and the ending is a bit disturbing.But its well worth watching if your a fan of the teen slasher type films.",Jeepers Creepers

What I particularly hate is that the male protagonist acts like a girl, and his girlfriend acts like a man. It's one of those irritating role reversals, in order to push the idea that sexes are interchangeable. Also, the film introduces some unnecessary gore, rather than focusing on suspense and horror. It even tries to go into comedy territory at times, which is totally misguided and fails miserably.",Jeepers Creepers

194,FilmFan777,"Hey, a scary movie thats actually scary..and good too!",7,4 September 2001,"Writer/Director Victor Salva does an all around better then average job with this film. Far better then your homogenized spittle like Scream and What you did Last summer. This is actually well shot with good character development, not to mention actually scares you, even while including humorous dialogue. The only weak part would be the 'lady with dreams' character. I found her irritating and unbelievable. Yet this film is interesting and very entertaining from beginning to end with a story that keeps flowing, plenty of suprises as well as goosebumps. A great film to bring that lil sweety of yours too.  =o) As far as Mr. Salva, he did a film I thought was so underrated with such a beautiful touch, Powder. These two films may be worlds apart in content yet the talent of this man's writing and directing show clearly through both.As a side note...I'm so sick and tired of people harping on this mans background with the law. When Powder came out, some boycott the film due his crime. Hello?? What does film making have to do with his past history or personal life? The man did his time as prescribed by our laws, yet some still want to convict him. What happened to Justice for all? I believe this hurt 'Powder' as a film and the many that didnt see the touching work Mr. Salva created. I'm interested in the talent this man brings to the screen. I can separate his worth as a film maker and judge him solely on that because I'm going to see his movies which have no bearing on his past. If I were dealing with him in a personal sense, then possibly I would proceed with some caution in a specific area. Other then that, let him do what he does and does so well. And dont stifle someone for their past especially since they paid their dues. I look forward with anticipation to more of Victor Salva's work.",Jeepers Creepers
195,moonmonday,Insufferable,1,6 March 2014,"How exactly did this even spawn a sequel, much less an attempt at a franchise? There are some creepy moments, but overall it's not creepy, scary, suspenseful, or least of all amusing or entertaining. None of the characters are likable, the story is incoherent and incomplete, and there's no sense of fulfillment -- in any way -- by the ending. The sister character is completely insufferable and obnoxious, more than any other character in the whole film. Why exactly was she set up as if she were some sort of heroine? Oh, it's because these by-the-numbers 'horror' films always have to have a 'final girl', even if they serve no other purpose and do nothing to further the plot; there always has to be some bit of totty to reach the end of the film, for some reason.The whole thing is really regrettable, and above all it fails because, most inexcusably, it's stupid. It's not clever, stylish, witty, or any other such quality that a slasher (or more accurately a monster movie) should be. It's disappointingly asinine and, without any characters to evoke sympathy, there's not the slightest concern for their welfare which would cause tension and fright. In fact, the only real emotion cultivated is that of disappointment, both by the idiotic ending and the hideous journey to reach it.This is a disappointment, not just as a horror film, but as a film period.",Jeepers Creepers

Jeepers Creepers 2003 - horrible

The 1st one I really liked, but to me I think the character has more power in being a scarier movie. So I was hoping it was going to get better as it went along......
NOPE!Part 1: I really have no complaints about this one its an older movie I wasn't expecting it to be better in rendering than part 2 & 3, but it was BY FAR.Part 2: NOW this is where u have to keep saying to urself ""its just a movie; its just a movie; ect"" .... Them kids wanted off that bus once that thing landed on top & was passed out for a while after he blew nearly all the windows out! WTF was stopping them from breaking the front windows & crawling out since they couldn't open the door!Part 3: The graphics of the action was HORRIBLE!!!! WAY WAY WAY WORSE than part 1. This character has so much potention, but these releases just put a bad taste in my mouth over this movie....Part 4: Soon to come which is going to have part 1's the girl who didn't die.

197,BibChr,"For once, believe the jacket: fresh, unique, SCARY",8,20 January 2002,"I had forgotten anything I'd heard about Jeepers Creepers.  But I rented it on the strength of the jacket's quotations from the LA Times and Clive Barker, to the effect that the beginning is terrifying, and the overall effect is unique and stylish.  That is usually a very risky practice.  Turns out those comments were dead-on on this case.The movie is anchored on a believable brother-sister pair, starts off at its own pacing, and then with a firm wrench starts cranking up the Terror-O-Meter.  You'll know when you get there, and just know that it keeps getting more, and more, and more intense.I hate folks who drop spoilers, and I won't be one of them.  I'll just say that I've seen quite a few horror movies (more's the pity), and don't scare easily.  But if someone in my dark house had spoken from behind me at numerous points, they'd've had to peel me off the ceiling.One major plot resolution is not at all as I'd wish, and maybe itself accounts for my 8 (rather than 9) rating.  But it is within the realm of horror; if you get a horror movie, you know you can't count on everything working out as you'd like.Fresh, well-handled, avoiding cliches and providing genuine surprises- if you like scary movies, I very much recommend Jeepers Creepers.",Jeepers Creepers

What follows next is a story so full of holes it makes you wonder whether anything resembling common sense was used to write it. There's too much happens in total darkness and what possessed anybody to connect this nonsense to a clapped out 30s song which should have been strangled at birth God knows. The film seems to have borrowed freely from existing movies like Dennis Weaver's Duel or Terminator so it becomes a mish- mash in the end.

202,EdYerkeRobins,So Much Wasted Potential...,1,6 March 2002,"I had read many reviews of ""Jeepers Creepers"", calling it a modern horror masterpiece and a tragically overlooked film.  This, and the fact that the TV trailers left such a big secret as to what the monster was, left very high expectations for this film.  It's too bad that the film lives up to none of them, especially after it has such a promising beginning.	There are several things about the film's first half hour that makes it so interesting.  The first is the relationship between our hero and heroine; instead of being lovers or even best friends, Trish and Darry are brother and sister.  The two constantly bicker, with Trish in particular being extremely critical of her brother's actions in the situation (there are even a few sly ""things you shouldn't to in a horror movie"" comments), but when terror strikes, all is instantly forgiven as safety becomes the prime concern.  This development of realistic characters is always appreciated in a horror movie, since the audience can safely empathize with them without feeling cheated, sarcastic, or stupid.  The other great accomplishment of the first half of the film is the pace, slow and dark until a sudden attack by a phantom truck, an appearance by the eerie phantom figure or the infamous revelation at the other end of the tube.  This, along with the score (commercially unavailable, its quite excellent, and perhaps the only part of the film that is actually underrated), creates a little bit of genuine suspense.	What happened to such potential? The second half of the movie comes and takes it all to hell.  The eerie phantom figure is revealed as The Creeper, a laughable ""Buffy"" or ""Special Unit 2"" reject (the only way he could have been even sillier, as a thankfully-deleted scene on the DVD showed, was if he had lines).  The Creeper's background, related by useless and annoying psychic/crazy old lady Jazz, is just as frustratingly laughable (in the kind consideration of those who actually want to see the film, I won't spoil it here - but try and keep a straight face when the details get more and more absurd, I couldn't!) and rife with plot holes.  The most annoying aspect of all is that the ""mystery"" about the title is never cleared up beyond the probable case that writer/director Victor Salva had a bet with someone that he could make a film with an old swing song for a gimmick that would not only get green-lighted by the studio, but actually turn a profit.  The careful pace is chucked away, as the creature ""goes on a rampage"", with killings of random characters that are neither suspenseful, scary, or even really gory.  The ending is hardly unexpected, but can still be perceived as shocking thanks to the earlier character development, mentioned earlier as one of the few things the film did right.	""Jeepers Creepers"" started out as a great film that I really wanted to like, but degrades so bad its almost like two different movies by two different teams.  The second half is really more boring than anything else - though it has the potential to become a campy midnight favorite.  As a ""serious"" horror film, however, I haven't seen something this overrated that failed to deliver since ""The Blair Witch Project"".",Jeepers Creepers
203,PaulLondon,What spoilt Night of the Demon?,5,18 November 2001,"Well, seeing the demon! Half a century later and filmmakers have still not learnt this basic lesson.  The first half of Jeepers Creepers is great a spine tinglingly dark piece of modern gothic which nods towards the grisly pleasures of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. So how disappointing it is when the mysterious night stalker is revealed as a very cliched demon and the film degenerates in to a run of the mill chase and hole up in the police station. A good attempt but ultimately deeply flawed",Jeepers Creepers
204,mfnmbvp,'Jeepers Creepers' (2001),7,4 April 2012,"Regardless of what others, or everyone, might think of director Victor Salva, setting him aside (because I could care less about his personal life) to strictly deal with the film, there are many unconventional moments in the beginning of 'Jeepers Creepers' to let you know that you are in for something tasty. The dialogue is standard fare and as the story progresses, you can see where it might be able to come off as a little predictable, but our cast mainly consists of Gina Phillips and Justin Long for the majority of the film, and of course Jonathan Breck as our villain. This is probably the first and foremost convention in the film that sets 'Jeepers Creepers' apart from the rest. It comes off as sort of cliché to try and make our characters self-aware nowadays, but when 'Jeepers Creepers' was first released in 2001, I think it probably worked better than it does now, eleven years later, when the whole idea of having self-aware characters has been done to death a hundred times.So now, regardless of our cliché self-aware dialogue, and ignoring some of the more prominently stupid actions of our protagonists, the script definitely gets points for originality, the back-story is pretty well-developed, and the opening half hour is definitely one of the strongest openings in any recent horror film to date. I know a lot of people don't enjoy it, perhaps because it is too unconventional and the story seems like it drags towards the end, but I suppose if you've never seen the film before, you should do so immediately. The lackluster sequel that followed gets trampled into the ground by a barrage of main characters and an even more intense horde of trying-to-be-self-aware dialogue, but I am definitely a fan of the series and I personally can't wait for Salva to release the third film. The third film will probably suck, but that is only because I have high expectations as of this writing. Personally, I would be hoping for a prequel, that could discuss the origins of the Creeper further, but that's just me.JEEPERS CREEPERS -----7/10.",Jeepers Creepers

The explanation of the killer is pretty far-fetched and the last third of the film becomes a little too silly to really go with the first hour or so of the movie, but this is one of my favorite films this year.
The acting was good, if not a little over the top by some of the actors (like the psychic lady) and the story, for the most part was very good. The mood of the movie is really creepy and effective and there are a few jump out of your seat moments. There's also a few gory parts, that may make some of the audience cringe just a little bit. I won't mention the ending, but let's just say, the last few minutes leave a moderate possibility of a sequel. I hope so, because I'd like a little more info. on the killers origin and reasons for killing, which is only other fault in the film.I thought it was rather effective and well done, it's been a while since there's been a good old fashioned horror film and this does the genre justice. ***1/2 out of 4 stars.",Jeepers Creepers

208,DJ_Shilo,Fear the Creeper,7,20 October 2017,"Have you ever met the Boogeyman before? Well, he knows who you are and he is coming for you. Get ready for 90 mins of pure terror as ""Jeepers Creepers"" scares the hell out of you and lingers in your head afterward. I have never sat through a horror movie that truly scared me to death like this one did and had me shaking in my seat.It's about two siblings, Trish (Gina Phillips) and Darry (Justin Long) who are driving home from college on a desolate road when they are almost run off the road by someone driving a beat-up truck. Further down the road, they see the driver parked outside a church dumping what looks like bodies down a pipe. Darkness falls and the siblings discover they are now the targets of an evil creature that makes them drive for their lives. I actually sat in my seat shaking in fear for most of this picture. That's because the first and second act is the effective build up that descends into your typical road movie where the villain is chasing the characters and the third act is where everything ramps up and doesn't stop. We have seen this setup before, however, this time it's different. Usually, we know everything by the second act and then a monster appears and we walk out of the theater saying ""we've seen that before."" Well, they keep the villain hidden and in the shadows for most of this picture, which is effective because when you do see his face in the third act, he is terrifying to look at it.There is a lot that makes this film effective but there is some stupidity that will get this film thrown in the can. It opens well enough with the siblings bickering before they're almost run off the road by the old- looking truck. Seriously, if you saw this beat- up truck on the road, you would tramp on the gas and drive. They later spot the driver shoving the bodies down the pipe and the driver sees them and succeeds in running them off the road. Here's where the film takes a stupid turn.They go back and investigate...Now I get why the screenplay did this but anyone in their right mind would drive off and find the cops. One of the kids falls down the pipe and makes a chilly and shocking discovery that really makes you wonder who or what was driving the truck. It also makes you wonder in fear about what you're looking at and it's quite shocking. Because of what we see down in the basement, it adds a mysterious and scary element so I was willing to suspend disbelief to see what happens next.What kept me thrilled about this picture was how menacing the villain is and how relentless he is chasing these two terrified kids and you get the sense that nothing can stop him. They drive off from the church, one of them terrified beyond rational through because of what he has seen. As darkness approaches, the film becomes a spooky joyride and we get closer to seeing what is after them. Not because he knows someone saw his house but because he wants something from one of the kids and we find out later what that is.At the end of the second act, two cops attempt to escort the kids to safety. What's most interesting is how the scene is set up. One of the teens hears a rock version of the ""Jeepers Creepers"" song on the radio and apparently whenever that song plays, they are in danger. Yeah...okay. The villain lands on top of the cop car and is shown rising from the dashboard pov of the sibling's car out the back window, as they unsuspectingly argue and drive along until a severed head derails their plan for safety. Soon after, someone gets out of the cop car and we see him bite and pull the tongue out of a severed head. Creeped out yet? Wait, how did the villain land on top of the cop car?Justin Long and Gina Phillips work really well together as the terrified siblings and they pull off the characters almost flawless. Where the film hits the guardrail is that we don't find out much about the villain. He is a terror to look at and we want to know what he is but you don't learn anything. We are given a backstory on what he does and why, which is interesting and scary to hear and will have you running for the door, and why he is chasing after the kids, which will have you hiding under your bed but that revelation is used as a set up for a possible ""Jeepers Creepers 2."" In the third act, the creature storms a police station to get to the teens and even they can't stop him so we have to assume what he is and that is a waste.It's well made for the most part and very effective with thrills and chills but the third act proves to be fatal and somewhat of a let down when evil wins. When you see the creature in all it's glory, as the stupid cops take aim, I was left feeling like the teens as I should be, scared out of my mind. But with the nature of a creature this menacing and not knowing what he is, is a serious let down in the end. We learn and see what he wanted and that he is unspeakably evil but it's not enough when we are given clues and not a proper explanation to an effective and scary thriller that derails in the third act.",Jeepers Creepers

HERE COMES A SPOILER: the villain metamorphosizes into some kind of fantasy devil with sharp teeth and bat-like wings--how predictably Hollywood!  As the demonic threatening image in long cloak and wide-brimmed hat with disheveled hair, the monster is truly scary.  He is menacing, threatening, and downright scarey.  After the change, however, the movie quickly careens downhill and becomes laughable. During the first part, all is suggestion: that which makes the slasher/horror films like ""Friday, the 13th"" and ""Halloween"" great.  The villain is also in the dark or silhouetted, a danger ready to pounce. That's how The Creeper is in the first part of the movie.

Original baddy, not some hokey supernatural whatever but a real methodical creature/monster which I thought was very interesting. Brother and sister duo played their parts like total pros and the rest of the supporting characters really filled the air with anxiety and fear, which the ""Creeper"" feeds on. The best part was that the extra characters witness the happenings and there wasn't much of that ""No one saw anything and the heroes are crazy"" type stuff. I hate that.

They're all there - The Birds, Psycho, Alien, Silence of the Lambs, Halloween - but this film has none of the polish of any of those classics.Why does every contemporary horror movie have to have ""teenage attitude""? There's an evil monster on the loose (and hundreds of dead bodies around) but our sassy heroine (Trish) still smart-mouths the locals. I finished up praying that the monster would catch Trish and suck her brains out - in slow motion.This movie is not a bad way to pass a Saturday night with your partner (it has a few scary moments).

The good stuff though is that this is original horror movie (well, coming from me might not mean much as I don't usually watch them).  What I found most interesting was the believability of how the characters got drawn into this, even though they truly tried to get away and to get help.  On top of that was the chemistry between the siblings Darius (played by Justin Long - which is memorable as computer geek in Galaxy Quest) and Patricia great. **SPOILER** But I felt some holes in the story put the film down.  We have this evil ""thing"" easily killing cops and other unfortunate people that he comes across, even though it takes him the whole film to get to unarmed teenagers. Furthermore, the story behind the bird-like monster is never revealed.  How did he operate before without anyone taking notice, and how long had he been doing this?  Where did he come from?  And in the end the film just fades away.  He got what he wanted, and even though he killed several people in the police station, live is back to normal the next morning (one might think that the FBI or similar would be swarming the place - Fox Mulder anyone?).

215,Brian B-2,A horrid horror,1,19 October 2002,"This movie is awful. After 15 minutes, I wanted it to end. The only good thing was Gina Phillips , who resembles a young, thin, buff Laura San Giacomo. Gina is extremely camera friendly, and has enough acting talent to deliver corny dialogue credibly. The plot is predictable. Almost every detail is telegraphed . It is also unrealistic, even for a ""creature feature"". The story would fill a bad episode of Twilight Zone ( 30 minutes). It is padded with tedious irrelevant dialogue, and long dramatic pauses, which fail to add tension. It lacks humour, so isn't campy.
Wait for Gina in a better movie.",Jeepers Creepers

The Creeper is a cool and intense creature, the way his appearance can change based off lighting and wardrobe is cool. The effects are also really good. Sticking to being practical rather then CGI.There are some good disturbing scenes many of which are enhanced by the films great score.The actors are solid, never feeling unrealistic.My only gripe is the main two characters. They're typical bickering annoying siblings, not to mention they make some dumb decisions. But that seem the norm now in modern horror movies.It's still a lot of fun. Highly recommended!",Jeepers Creepers
217,Zod-2,Very Very Disappointing,4,29 January 2002,"May contain SPOILERS!!!I have never watched a film go from being so good to being so bad so quickly.  The opening portions of Jeepers Creepers are very creepy indeed. The introduction of the Creeper is excellent and the journey into his lair is suspenseful.  Unfortunately the movie goes downhill from there.  There are a lot of plot holes in the movie and many questions which go unanswered, this is usually the fault of poor writing and not intelligence on the writers part.  I believe that the writer of the film didn't really know what his creation was.Jeepers Creepers starts off attempting to be different from most horror movies.  Without really seeing the killer, tension and suspense and a fear of the killer are created with the wonderful camera work and suspenseful pacing.  Sadly any good this movie had going for it disappears once it becomes obvious that the killer in the film is supernatural and therefore can be anywhere he wants at anytime.  The terror of the killer is transfered from being generated from his unseen actions to his popping into the frame every chance he gets.  Apparently there is a sequel to this movie coming out in 2002.  Maybe it will answer some of the questions I have about this first film (a true understanding of the killers actions is never clearly presented) but most likely it will be more of the same boring retread of horror movie cliches that fans have come to expect.Jeepers Creepers starts off really strong, it has a good cast and good acting, what it doesn't have is a satisfying story.  While I applaud the chance the film makers make with the ending it just raises another questions that never gets answered.  Jeepers Creepers was on it way to a strong 8 out of 10 but quickly lost it's way and fell all the way down to a 4.",Jeepers Creepers
218,HORROR_FAN_1,Jeepers Sweepers,7,10 April 2002,"My first reaction and thoughts when I heard about this film were that it was going to be seriously overhyped. However, it turned out to be quite a good movie which I thoroughly enjoyed watching. The start of the film with 'The Creeper' chasing the brother and sister in the car is definatly inspired by Steven Spielberg's excellent film 'Duel'. The camera shots particulary remind me of that film.A thouroughly enjoyable film and up there with the best horror I have seen to date.Rating 7/10, and that's being harsh.",Jeepers Creepers
219,tylerrosin,A super fun action packed thriller.,8,31 August 2021,This was one of the better horror movies i have seen in awhile. It started off a little slow but did a excellent job building up tension and making you start to question what the villain will be. The chemistry between the siblings was also very good and it made you root for them. Once the movie takes off it's a blast to watch and full of jump scares and a very scary and unique monster. While it wasnt super gory what violence it did have was very well done and worked for this type of movie perfectly. Worth a watch.,Jeepers Creepers

222,the_moody_youngest,"Jeepers Creepers, one hell of a movie",10,20 January 2007,"Flash back to the old horror movies for a second; blood, guts everywhere, and stuff that would make you wanna grab your popcorn container and puke in it. Now look at Jeepers Creepers, you've got a ugly looking creature, a freaky church, a very creepy truck, and 2 collage students in the countryside, what more do you need? Please tell me.Patricia 'Trish' Jenner and her younger brother, Darius 'Darry' Jenner are on their way home from collage for Spring Break. When all of a sudden a creepy truck with the license plate ""BEATINGU"" tries to ram them of the road. Creeped out, they have no idea what the hell the guy was trying to do. While driving again, they drive past an old Church and see a man in a trench coat and hat, the one who almost ran them off the road, dumping stuff down a pipe. To them it looks like bodies so Darry convinces Trish to go back and check it out. After Trish accidentally drops Darry down the pipe, he inspects the lair, only to find hundreds and hundreds of bodies everywhere, on the ground, most of them covering the walls. Scared, he doesn't talk for some time. So they head down to a diner to use a phone. When all of a sudden they get a phone call from psychic. I am not spoiling to rest.This would have to be the best horror I have seen in about forever. It is more of a psychological thriller than a horror. It is a great action too. It won't have you scared out of your seat, but you will be creeped out by the creeper, the truck, the church, and everything else. The suspense was there and so was everything. With two good looking actors leading the film, where can you go wrong?!",Jeepers Creepers

The 2 lead characters are probably the single most annoying actors in the entire world. Darry! The things they do and say you just never would do in real life and this situation. Darry!Darry! So first of all they get run off the road. Then it happens again and guess what? They decide to go back and see if the dead bodies thrown in the sewer are still alive...wouldn't happen. Then he climbs in the chute. All this time the girl is still over reacting. Darry! She then waits on highway? How does that help?Then Darry (think that was his name- I mean I would never know), goes into shock and doesn't talk (of course) and the girl still screaming at him. They go into the diner and most ppl would just make a call to police then stay with people. But no, they cause a scene forcing them to not be welcome (of course). Darry! Some lady phones to try and help them on the phone then they insult her...Darry then comes clean about what he saw and the girl doesn't believe him. I mean why would she? She just see a creature throw dead bodies down a chute - he must be lying. Darry! Then they all leave a perfectly safe diner at night. Obviously cops get killed but wait, they still need to find a phone (whilst most police will be sending backup if no officers will answer their radio) Darry!After all of this people still think the psychic lady is weird after everything that has just happened...Darry!Oh and the guys name is Darry it must have been screamed like 50million times.",Jeepers Creepers

MINI SPOILERS    First of all, if someone is trying to chase me off the road, the last thing I am going to do is hang around and go back to look down a spooky pipe that I saw them dump a body down.    Secondly, only the sister character plays to be anywhere near believeable.  The brother turns from a macho, wanna explore and do the right thing type, to a whining wuss who has less balls than a body-builder on steroids.    And the ending is a pseudo-ripoff of the blair witch project.  If you arent a die-hard horror fan, you'll do yourself justice to miss this one.  4.5/10",Jeepers Creepers

The movie went from being an intense ride to a cheap sci-fi alien flick.  Exposing the creatures true identity really ruined all that the movie had going for it, and what's worse they turned it into a slasher flick for the last half hour.The ending is not what you would expect, but you are not disturbed by it.While I was disappointed in the movie as a whole, it did entertain me for a while.As such I give this film a 5/10!",Jeepers Creepers
227,mbworm,Where'd you get those peepers? Really scary,9,30 November 2005,"ONE of the best openings in horror and general film history sets up the thrill ride that is ""Jeepers Creepers"". With excellent performances from Gina Phillips and Justin Long as a bickering couple of siblings on their way home for Spring break, terror settles in barely five minutes into the movie.After being run off the road by a scary, beat up old truck, Trish and Darry investigate an abandoned church in the middle of an isolated farmland to discover a deep underground terror. Making a run for it, they find themselves relentlessly pursued by a cloaked madman who may not even be a man at all... but something from your worst nightmares.Unpredictable and masterfully paced, Jeepers Creepers has a very rich, dark atmosphere and lots of frightful twists and turns. With barely any comic relief to be seen, the tension is endless and director Victor Salva keeps ""The Creeper"" hidden well until the perfect moment arises to get a good scary look at him. Truly something out of hell, the Creeper is a nightmarish creature that will stay with you long after this creepy little low budget flick ends.With a gory and sad conclusion, the film falters off slightly, but it's so much above usual crappy horror fare that you'll love every twisted minute of it. Beautifully photographed and truly entertaining and frightening, you're in for one tense ride. Jeepers Creepers, where'd you get those peepers?

228,ivony,Absolutely Disappointing,7,26 May 2003,"There is no doubt that I like movies of all kinds.  From Oscar nominees/winners to action, cult classics, and the occasional ""chick flick""...my tastes vary.  But, I'm a sucker for a good scary/horror movie. That being said, I don't mind the inevitable ""cheese"" that is bound to accompany most, if not all, of the horror genre.  Jeepers Creepers was seemingly a step away from the Scream clones and back to a more simpler time when horror movies were appreciated for what they were...cheese included. The movie starts out great, building up suspense, dragging the viewer along for the ride and carelessly pulling us every which direction.Unfortunately, like far too many films, it then suddenly crumbled.  Rather than keeping this a ""thrill-for-all"", it did the worst you can try to do in the horror genre:  create some type of plot and/or explanation.  I don't know when the directors/filmmakers are going to realize that in so many horror movies, the absence of reason and logic makes it all the more appealing...not to mention scary.  Around 30 minutes into the movie, my attention was lost and discovered I had more fun shoving toothpicks in my gums than watching this movie.  The entertainment value had become nil.For the first 25 minutes or so of the movie, it earns a remarkable 4 of 5 stars.  But due to it's poor climax and ending, I can't give this movie, overall, anything more than 1 1/2 stars.  Yes, it was *that* bad.",Jeepers Creepers
229,ivony,Amending my first review...,7,4 September 2003,"When I go see a movie, particularly a *horror* movie, I usually go in with little to no expectations.  More often than not, expectations can seriously ruin a movie.  In Jeepers Creepers, well, I went in thinking one thing...and got something entirely different.  Because of that (and anyone who read my first review knows this), I absolutely hated..and I mean HATED Jeepers Creepers. But, in seeing the commercials for the upcoming sequel, I decided to give this one a second chance.  So, being the good horror moviegoer that I am, I emptied my brain of all expectations and delusions of grandeur and gave it a go.  I'm glad I did.  Sorta.Ok, granted this time around I no longer had the desire to shove toothpicks in my gums.  This is a good thing.I found myself still enjoying the hell outta the first 25-30 minutes or so. Fantastic buildup with tension and fear.  I was a happy camper.  Midway into the movie, however, I again noticed it slipping.  But not so much as I did last time.  This time I was able to stay focused and enjoy the ride.I was still bored at times.  And of course had to laugh at some of the ridiculous errors in continuity (but who goes to see a horror film for continuity???), but overall, I rather enjoyed the experience this time around.  The creeper was cool lookin and the acting was good...it even had the sense to poke a bit of fun at itself.  So, I was still a happy camper.But then the ending came.  Well, not the end ending, but the sorta-ending (being vague I know, but don't want to ruin anything for anybody).  And, well...I was still a bit disappointed.  Honestly, I can't really say why. Something just rubbed me the wrong way.  Maybe it was the psychic, or the fact that a small town suddenly had 30+ police officers on duty.  I dunno. What I do know is, Jeepers went from being a tension-filled thrill to somewhat  of a dud.Don't get me wrong.  The first half hour of the movie is DEFINITELY worth seeing and the last bit is certainly watchable.Just take my advice, please...go in with your mind clear and ready for some good old horror fun.",Jeepers Creepers
230,kimnil80,Above average horror movie...,6,22 June 2002,"""Jeepers Creepers"" was a refreshing horror movie.It`s of course just another rip-off of 80`s horror movies,especially ""Halloween"",but it`s refreshing and entertaining just the same. The movie started very good as a horror road movie.But it`s the two main characters(Justin Long,Gina Philips) curiosity which draws us to the craziness.I must admit that I thought the Creeper was in fact pretty scary-in the beginning,but not in the end.The character is most scary when you see him dump bodies in that graveyard and that`s not even a close-up.You just see a very dark,tall creepy guy...I got some creeps then. Of course there are those typical things with EVERY horror movies.Due to the crazy situations there in,they can`t let go of just investigate further.Why just not get the hell out of there? They MUST see if the Creeper`s dead,instead of just drive away from the whole thing.Typical horror movies and it irritates me a lot! But as a whole;I was entertained,it WAS scary(at least the first 45 minutes),the Creeper WAS scary(the first 45 minutes),story was exciting at least for an hour-but it got unintentionally funny in the end. Never mind;it`s worth the money(though some of the effects was poor). So,to the thing I loved the most;the ENDING.Yeah! There will NOT be a sequel to this,like ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"". One of the movie`s main characters DIED.Great! That was fresh....Rating 7/10",Jeepers Creepers
231,DasBobsWorld,Duel...The Monster Movie,6,24 January 2019,"Having seen this a long time before in my younger days, I figured I'd crack out the dual pack with it and its sequel and give them a whirl before I remember how terrible a person the director is.Jeepers Creepers has some solid Ideas, and great shots that are kind of dragged down by whiny characters, and jumbled plot of running around between three locations. Said plot sees a brother-sister duo heading home for some reason or another, getting stalked by a weird giant truck, Dual style. After a few encounters, the siblings see the driver dump a body into a pipe and go investigate only to make a gruesome discovery. Honestly, I am not a huge fan of the beginning of this movie. Listening to the two actors bicker for a while, then enter the movie Dual, then leave it and bicker again was grating on my nerves. I do appreciate the sibling dynamic over using a couple or group of teens though. Once the gruesome discovery is made, the movie goes into overdrive, entering a lite weirdness that I enjoyed for the most part. I just can't rate a movie a lot higher when it didn't matter to me who the killer killed. They felt like interchangeable and unlikable people.Still, Jeeps Creeps is fun for what it is. Doesn't wear out is welcome either in run time. Which makes dealing with the two main characters I don't like a lot easier. I'd recommend it for a nice view into earlier 2000's horror.",Jeepers Creepers
232,bicgus1,One of the worst and most unreal acted films I've ever seen,1,1 July 2003,"The problem with this film is acting. I don't even know the names of the two main characters, but believe me, the worst thing they could have possible done for their carreer as actors is Jeepers Creepers. Acting in this film is SO, SO UNREAL, that maybe it should qualify as comedy rather than horror. It's a pity, however, because the script is not that bad and, had had the director a minimum sense of reality it could have been a good movie.",Jeepers Creepers
233,HandsomeBen,"One of the best horror movies ever made, hands down!",9,25 March 2011,"This first came out when I was about 11 years old, so I wasn't able to see this in theaters. Got to finally see it on DVD 2 years later, and boy did I have nightmares for days. Even 10 years later I'm watching it on TV now, and it still scares the crap out of me. Justin Long, the guy who plays Darry, is a phenomenal actor. At the beginning he's just a regular college guy, that you could hang out with in real life, and have a great time. Not the college frat boy type, who parties at night and drinks til he pukes. So on that level I related to him! Justin and Gina had a lot of chemistry through out, and you got the feeling they were really brother and sister. Now back to the movie plot itself. It's freaking scary! When the movie starts to show the killer, you automatically think it's a creepy human guy, but within an hour later you you don't know what kind of creature it is. I was thinking it was the devil himself. What could be worse? Had me on the edge of my seat the whole time. Kept my interest and never got boring. The storyline when watching it on the big screen is refreshing and unpredictable. The characters aren't annoying, and ones who you actually feel sorry for. You're hoping they make it til the end!

Otherwise it just was a collection of standard horror cliches with the odd little twist here and there.And what was that subplot with the psychic (Mrs Exposition, I presume) all about? What did that add to the movie, other than providing an excuse for the phone call, and a sadder excuse for the title?Seriously, maybe I'm missing something here, but what was so great about this movie? What was in there that I hadn't already seen done better in Duel, Alien, Hellraiser, and numerous other past horror movies? I don't get it.",Jeepers Creepers
237,FunnyMann,Falls apart,5,5 March 2002,"Several reviews here say that ""Jeepers Creepers"" starts out well but eventually goes south. I'd say, it starts out very well and eventually goes waaay south.Everything clicks for the first 40 minutes. The set-up incorporates the standard horror movie elements quite impressively. The dialogue hums along nicely. The two leads deliver a believable brother and sister shtick. You're interested to know what happens next. But when you find out, well, that's where it gets ugly.Without revealing any plot points, let's just say that the writer-director made some unfortunate choices that produce more unintentional laughs than chills. Also, some things just don't make sense. (Anyone else wonder why a police station in the middle of nowhere has like 20-some cops?)
Basically, ""Jeepers Creepers"" falls prey to the laws of entropy. What begins as an surprisingly entertaining film devolves into silly camp. My advice: watch it until the first time your roll your eyes, then turn it off. Because after that point, it only gets worse.",Jeepers Creepers

243,DylansFearFiles,Where did u get those peepers,7,1 October 2006,"The movie Jeepers Creepers is an ode to classic horror. Not much blood and guts like your average slasher film. But a great method of suspense that will scare you when you are at home alone.The movie tells the story of two siblings, Trisha (Gina Phillipls) and Darry (Justin Long) Jenner. The two are on their way home from college when they pass by an old church, only to see a man (Jonathan Breck) dumping something (appearing to be a body wrapped in sheets) down an old drain-pipe. Darry, looking for a little adventure, persuades Trish to turn around to see what was going on. The two soon discover the apparent victims of a serial killer in the basement of the church. Thousands of bodies, all missing at least one part of their bodies. The killer starts stalking them, but he isn't what they think he is, he is a demonic creature who feeds on human body parts.This movie was highly entertaining. Vastly superior to its ""okay"" sequel.

244,kidwltm,Not What It Appears To Be,4,19 August 2003,"Trust me, don't listen to all the people rambling on about how the film has deeper psychological meanings and breaks all these horror cliches.  It doesn't.  Most people are probably fooled by this because they've been jaded by a horror climate made up of mostly cheap teen stalker films.  ""Jeepers Creepers"" is a throw back to the old 80's horror films.  A little fresh in these times, but FAR from original.  Fact is, the film sets up a good film and fails to deliver.  The first half is a slower, more Hitchcockian thriller.  We don't see the Creeper, we don't see people needlessly killed. It works the ""Duel"" angle greatly for awhile.  Then it goes down hill.  The creeper is introduced in a more frontal matter, and we begin to realize he isn't all that scary or threatening.  This is conveyed by a bunch of by the books sequences where the main characters fight back and win all too easily. Then of course there is the psychic lady.  She seems to have absolutely no place in the story.  Salva just threw her in to try and give the film a mystical element, which a). doesn't work, and b). makes every scene with this character painful to watch.  Then of course comes the Creepers big attack scene at the jail, which is cheap in the aspect that it isn't exciting in this least, and shies away from any blood/gore shots, which at the very least would have spiced this dull movie up a bit.   The two main characters are flat.  A bickering brother and sister team that are always at each other's throat until something bad happens, then they couldn't love each other more.  And of course the girl is this typical modern horror star (not blonde with big tits, likes to point fun at horror films, i.e., an exact rip off of the girl from Scream).  The actors possessed some chemistry together, but it never works due to bad writing.The film is solid for the first part, and then slowly slides into the darkness of bland horror conventions.  On the outside it would appear as a nice love letter to the old monster films, but it is really just another late 90's teen horror film.  3.5/10* ½  / * * * *",Jeepers Creepers
245,pulikd,The last scream,9,9 October 2021,"It isn't hard to understand why movies like ""Insidious"" are scary. They rely heavily on loud music and the so-called ""jump scares"", and these work well enough. It isn't hard to understand why war movies tend to be scary, because war is scary, and you can't go around that, horror genre or not. The same goes for the so-called ""slashers"". It cannot be pleasant to see human beings sustaining dreadful body damage. But some movies are more difficult for the mind to absorb and ""get"", at least, in part.Some of the visuals weren't as good as one should wish, plus there is a little scene in the movie that raises a question or two with me. Apart from these two things, there isn't anything much I would like to sink my critic's teeth into. I first saw ""Jeepers Creepers"" as a kid. Almost two decades have passed. This still is the only movie that would give me several nightmares closely related to the plot, the locations and the characters. But what's the story here? Why is it so strong?Some would easily put it on one shelf with ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" or ""Friday The 13th"", or ""Scream"", but a more interesting comparison would be James Cameron's ""The Terminator"". There is even a police station situation here. And the movie deals with a villain you cannot stop, cannot run from, cannot hide from, or so it seems. That is very important. What seems to be happening isn't always what truly is happening. To avoid excessive detail and spoilers, let me ask a safe question here. To those readers that have seen the movie and remember it pretty well, that is. Why does the creature not take what it wants in the very first encounter with our heroes, the two kids going home? The obvious answer is, of course, because the rest of the movie has to happen. Right, that is how it may appear. But there is a different reason. There is meaning here, in this movie, that you do not see, even though it may be right in front of you, loud and clear. Another such question may be spoiler-free. Remember the lady who ""likes to think she is a psychic""? She desperately wants to help the two kids, right? Is it the sole purpose for her to be doing all she's doing? Think about that.""Jeepers Creepers"" is a teenage horror that is deeper and smarter than it may appear. And it is truly terrifying, the more you get it. The better you understand the story, the more interesting it is. As for the shape the plot has, the cinematography was very good, the actors were good, the music was phenomenal.",Jeepers Creepers
246,thirteenthfloorelevator,Exceeded my expectations! It should exceed yours as well!,8,21 February 2006,"I was initially hesitant about viewing this movie, as it looked like another dull teen horror flick, along the same lines as ""Urban Legend"" and the endless supply of mundane Halloween movies. I was pleasantly surprised as Jeepers Creepers is nothing like those films at all and manages to both thrill and entertain. First things first, I was so relieved to find out in scene one that the two leads were playing brother and sister, as opposed to boyfriend and girlfriend. This immediately ruled out any possibility of the dull sexual tension and excruciating sex scenes that dominate the majority of teen slashers. The Creeper is really scary and is made scarier by the fact that you only ever catch glimpses of him, and never really see a good clear shot of him. The acting is actually decent, and the characters behave how real people would, not just like dumb jocks who want to save the world! A great movie and a welcome addition to the world of horror!",Jeepers Creepers
247,Kevin_Maness,More like a pilot episode,5,23 February 2002,"***This review contains vague SPOILERS--it's not giving awaydetails but does suggest broad plot outcomes. ***I don't think this movie was BAD.  It's certainly not fresh or original,or whatever the quotes on the box at the video store said it was,but it was essentially entertaining.  The problem with Jeepers Creepers is that it is so obviously thefirst installment of what American Zoetrope so obviously hopeswill be a new blockbuster horror franchise (can you say, ""JeepersCreepers 6: You Can't Kill This Dude, So Of Course He's Back""). The movie sets up a good bit of the background--who the villain isand what he does, the fact that he's got at least one creepy secrethideout, etc.--and it provides us with a surviving star andsupporting star (I won't say more for fear of giving too much away)and the basis of a revenge motif for future sequels.  It felt like apilot episode for a new TV series.  The problem is, the first movieof other horror series felt more like self-contained films.  I'm not abig horror enthusiast, but I know that Nightmare on Elm Street,say, or even Scream could have (maybe should have) ended withthe first installments and felt satisfying.  Not so Jeepers Creepers. Its completeness depends on sequels.  That's fine for a movie likeFellowship of the Ring or Phantom Menace because everyoneunderstands that there are two more movies to come in thosefranchises.

This was a very impressive horror flick. It had everything in it; plenty of horror, gore, darkness and uniqueness. I was wasn't very satisfied at the beginning because it had such a slow start but as the film progressed in to 10 minutes or so it definitely got better and started looping in to the terrifying action. Unlike any other horror films I watched this has got to the most unique. I mean this film had sort of more depth to it than the 2nd movie but I'm not saying its better its just a good start to JEEPERS CREEPERS. And the ""thing"" feeding on humans. Very scary. And the scene in the abandoned church where all the dead bodies were was just gruesome. The music...the music! Whenever you here the 60's Jeepers Creepers song, it's coming after you! How scary is that?! Like in the radio it played that song and that ""monster"" was right behind them! That was just classic. Very funny yet brutally scary! The ending was surprising also. I was even more surprised to hear the ""Boogeyman"" song in the credits. I think the producers should have stuck to the Jeepers Creepers song because come on it's not Boogeyman! Is it? See thats the things, what is that villains name? Because I keep on calling him ""thing"" or ""monster"" and the credits presume hes called ""Boogeyman"" (even though we already have a Boogeyman!) I have no idea... But overall I love this horror flick. Unique like I said and scary and surprising. Looking at some of the comments I don't understand why people hate it.

The main characters (brother and sister) have nothing special about them, but they actually speak with each other like actual people would do, not like made up cardboard stuff made to move the script further (a problem with too many American blockbuster movies out there). Both have somewhat self-aware lines like ""This is where somebody does something really stupid and everybody hates them for it"" or ""They never are"", which are subtle and make me like the movie even more. I also like that they don't just do anything without debating or explaining to each other why they should do it. They're a team, a family and they're sticking with each other no matter what.The villain is impressive and his makeup is excellent. It's funny how they use a psychic woman in both original and the sequel to tell more about the ""Jeepers"", because he never speaks.

They continue on only to come pass an old church and find a suspicious figure throwing bloodied sheets down a huge rusty pipe.The first 45 minutes of this movie is very obsorbing and the director obviously was very keen to produce background to the 2 main characters in full detail.  The scene where the 2 decide to investigate the pipe was excellent and very disturbing.  I'm glad this film didnt turn into a typical teen slasher horror and become predictable.  Instead it was a much needed horror movie to rival any other in its genre.  This was achieved through its incredibly dark atmosphere, nearly the whole film was done in the dark, this made the movie so much more tense and sucked in the audience to its next chapter.Theres a lot of mixed opinions about the ending, I for one am still a bit cheated by it, but it doesnt take anything away from the film itself.

All this changes though when they witness a dodgy looking geezer throwing corpses wrapped in bloody sheets down a pipe by an old abandoned church.  After almost being rammed off the road by the dodgy geezer's grotesquely fearsome Citroen van, the siblings decide to return to the pipe and discover whether or not the sheets really did contain any corpses and - more pertinently - whether any of the corpses are actually not dead(!).  Perhaps not the best idea siblings in a horror movie have ever had...  but almost certainly the only one!Well.  Copolla is involved.  And the reviews waxed superlative.  But is it a good film?  No.  It is however very nearly two very good films...  ???
The first is a bog-standard, taut, well filmed chiller with a handful of 'out of your seat moments' and a welcome angle of the locals actually believing and supporting the scared kids which opens out the potential for the baddie's evil to grow.  And it does.  Unfortunately, the two siblings are actually so irritating that you cannot help but root for the monster. Surely not the intention.  Anyway, shortly after the best bit (and indeed - the end) of the 'horror' movie, when we see the monster in all it's glory, the film suddenly and totally becomes a sci-fi fantasy (and totally different) flick in which we are drowned beneath embarrasingly awful dialogue, almost all of it spouted by the flawed 'see-er' Jezelle (the atrocious Patricia Belcher) and in which the monster develops a personality and - towards the finale - emotions!!!...  Not that such a movie wouldn't have been worthwhile (on the contrary: A decent film about an evil beast trying to relate to it's warped interpretation of beauty is always welcome); but such a movie we did not begin with and, in it's own context, such a movie makes no sense without the necessary involvement of intelligence and plot...That said.  It's watchable.  It delivers on several occasions and it isn't without potential.  But you can't help thinking that, two thirds of the way in, the writer/director ran out of ideas for one movie and ham-fistedly tried to revive another.  And by God it shows!...",Jeepers Creepers

But back when I first saw it in theaters its sad to say some of the scenes were cut out, because they aren't on the DVD version. From what I saw in theaters doesn't take away any of the wow factor from this movie or what it has to offer. This is miles way better then the second jeepers creepers which I urge you not to see, It is a abomination to the Creepers story line. That rest my case as to why it ended after 2. But Jeepers Creepers had it all, With the shock factor of the Creeper being a unknown entity unleashed after 2 unexpecting long road country traveling brother & sister.

262,stevenleadbetter,Boo!!!,6,7 November 2001,"Attention Spoiler AlertThis caught my eye on America's Top Ten Chart only the other day. It was appearing at number three in the chart this week, scaring audiences all over the good ol' USA. First thing that struck me was it's length. It is a short film. Opening with a long shot of the two main characters in their car on the way home from College for the holidays. Now I would never call this film original as it borrows from many movies. I was only two minutes into the first scene before Kurt Russell's troubles with a gang of kidnappers drifted into my mind. I was immediately drawn, however, to the lead characters, both with some snappy, well-written dialogue. Falling down a hole near an abandoned church in an effort to save a dying man would seem to be enough to tip many over the edge. On discovering a cellar full of corpses in various states of dismemberment, our players are then on the run from our bad guy, who has been sniffing around after them, literally. The killer beheads a police officer and then promptly rips his tongue out with his teeth in front of our terrified brother and sister, who are quickly on their way again, knowing that they will be for the high jump, should our killer catch up with them, which inevitably he (or should I say it) does. Finding out that the killer is not human is something of a let-down, not re-inforcing the fear factor of reality. Still, there is a twist in tale. As with Blair Witch, all is not well in the end. A finale that used to spell damnation for a movie in the US is now being viewed as de rigeur. All does not end happily for our male lead, who ends up on a slab, whilst having his eyes removed. The long continued shot of the house in which his screams emanate is mesmeric, as you wait to see his fate. In summary, a far better piece of cinema than I was expecting and one I would have been upset to miss. A uncomfortable blend of the Scream Trilogy and the aforementioned Blair Witch Project. Good, nasty fun.",Jeepers Creepers
263,Samualt,"Fun, Frightening, and Well Produced!",10,21 April 2002,"This movie is a surprising treat for horror fans. It has just the right amount of decent dialog, gimmicks, and gore. The cast Gina Philips, Justin Long, and Jonathan Breck as the creature couldn't have been picked better. And, the writer/director Victor Salva has an impressive list of credits and experience which really shows through on this film.
The show starts with a brother and sister on their way home during college break when they witness what could be an attempted murder/serial killing in a rural setting. Things spiral out of control from there as the couple encounter demons, psychics, and a host of other horror movie related situations (I don't want to give too much away!)It is done with just the right amount of suspension-of-disbelief, which means that although the story takes a supernatural turn the cast and dialog make it somewhat believable if not at least palatable. This is rare in todays 8-year old Hollywood mentality where all bad guys/monsters have to have childish retorts, comebacks, and digs. Thank God the monster doesn't even talk in this movie. I'm so tired of seeing Freddy Krueger reborn in different guises elsewhere!The special effects are pretty good if not a tad bit gory, but that is a big plus to this genre movie. You can't have a good horror movie unless you are made to cringe once or twice, right? I like that little of the FX ,if any, is computer generated. So, the picture has a nice look and feel that most newer horror movies lack.Suspense is key to this movie. Just when you think things couldn't get worse they do. It keeps you on the edge of your seat as you watch to see how our protagonists will survive the next scene. Although this movie has a harder edge due to it's genre it is almost Hitchcockian in its use of suspense. This alone is worth the price of admission folks.The dialog strains a bit here and there but the great cast seems to make it work anyway. This movie at least ""tries"" to have natural dialog. Most Hollywood flicks have become so plastic with their stereotyped characters and dialog it is refreshing to see a genre film, which by its very nature is stereotyped, that tries to break that mold. I'm not saying they pulled it off completely, just that it is a valiant try by the writers and cast to portray real people in extreme situations. Kudos!Horror buffs will love this film! But make no mistake. This movie is an R rated horror genre film. Non-horror fans will probably not care for it. This movie is fun, frightening, and well produced.

266,claptonisgod53,Surprisingly Good Film!,7,21 October 2008,"Jeepers Creepers is a somewhat well known horror movie released in the 21st century. This movie was released a little while into the 21st century. This movie is definitely one of the better horror offerings given to us from the new era of film. One reason is simply because it manages to be somewhat different. The idea is nothing new, but I like the way it was executed. It introduced us to a very cool horror villain without having a pointless back story on it. The acting is also solid, the creepy tone is there, and the amazing feeling of terror is there throughout the entire film.The movie starts off with a regular looking brother and sister on a trip. This starts adding depth into the characters, but before long, the siblings' car gets attacked by an oversided truck. This leads to a very good opening car chase. This car chase uses plenty of Hitchcock style shots, which I thought was great. It is also followed by a very creepy scene where we see the villain dumping some dead bodies down into an abandoned church. This movie relies on this type of creepy atmosphere rather than gore or gross out scenes, although there are quite a few of those, too.This development in plot would lead to a chain of duologue scenes, which are actually pretty well done.As the movie movies on, the characters get even more developed, and it becomes easy to get involved with the movie this way. The viewer will continue to have that uncertain atmosphere along with the duologue, but that is the magic of Jeepers Creepers. Then; just when the viewer can't take it any more, we get introduced to a very fun action scene involving a decapitation. This scene marks as the halfway mark of the movie, which is where the frightening element ends and the fun begins.In my opinion, the first half of the movie worked better because it felt somewhat real. We've all had arguments with our siblings, we've all been lost on a country road; and the way the story is developed, the idea of a maniac chasing you down seemed somewhat believable. Well, after the movie begins with its second half, we learn more about this maniac. The story then begins to drag on a little to far, but since the movie turned into a fun action movie, I'll let this slide. I had fun as the movie progressed, and I began to feel more and more for the characters. This is VERY rare for any horror movie to come out after the year 1995, so I was highly impressed and amazed at this. The entire movie is very well set up, very well shot, and very well acted. Definitely a recommended movie.This movie DOES contain several problems, though. First off, I thought that the movie ended way too abruptly. I haven't heard a lot of people say this, but I simply think that the ending of this movie was rushed, and could have been executed better, but ever film has its flaws. I also thought that the CGI effects where downright terrible, but hey, what do you expect.Overall, I liked this movie, it's definitely worth a rent, if not a buy.FOR IN DEPTH HORROR REVIEWS CHECK OUT MY YOUTUBE CHANNEL HORRORREVIEWS123",Jeepers Creepers

This...this is what the real horror fans have been waiting for.Forget your beautiful people lining up on the movie poster. Forget people having sex and getting killed. Forget your newfound horror conventions and think back to something pure, raw, and simple: two people see something they aren't supposed to see, and now they have to pay for it.This movie is genuinely disturbing for the first half hour and even offers some good scares up until the unsettling climax. A lot of the comments here are complaining about what a horrid ending this movie has, and I really have to disagree. They hate it because the ending is NOT neat and tidy, it is NOT what they expected, but it is DEFINITELY clean cut and leaves no margin of error. You KNOW what happened. I walked out of the theatre stunned.It's better you know as little as possible about this movie when you see it. Don't have the highest expectations, but if you have an open mind and a keen love of horror, this will definitely slake your thirst for a good horror movie, signaling the end of Hollywood's drought of ideas. No more Valentine, no more Soul Survivors, no more Final Destination, no more Scream, no more I Know Who You Shagged Last Summer...this is how horror movies are done.An excellent cry to the halcyon days of horror.

It dispenses with the fluffy garbage that ""horror"" films of the 90's such as Scream popularized and goes back to basics.  It proves that all you need is a couple of really dumb (and boy are they dumb in this movie) but strangely endearing main characters, a country back-road, and a force of evil to be reckoned with.  It worked in the 70's and it still works today.  This is a good date film - all of the couples were huddled closely together, seeking shelter from the relentless creepiness the movie had to offer.  But there was no shelter to be had - this film really delivers the scares, and will leave you feeling, well, creeped out.  See it!",Jeepers Creepers

270,bjt55,What horror movies are all about,10,12 October 2008,"This movie has it all. Good dialog, acting, humor, suspense, atmosphere. Sure the ""monster"" isn't the most creepy looking thing in the world, but that doesn' ruin anything. That shows how good the movie is! How many times do you watch a movie and dislike it because ""the monster"" looks so stupid, or you are annoyed that they never showed it. As I have said that makes little difference to this movie. This movie will also not change your life, but it is a great way to spend an hour and a half any night. There are a lot of good horror movies that are good once, and thats it, but not this one. I could easily watch this several times! BTW I was skeptical watching this because I saw the sequel, which was rather pathetic first. Now I regret saying that, Thank you IFC for proving me wrong!",Jeepers Creepers
271,enjoyuk,Entertaining Cheapie!,8,30 October 2001,"Im not ashamed to admit it, I was completely entertained for the whole 90 or so minutes of this film.  Yes, it was very cheap looking in parts and the story got a shade this side of silly in the latter half, but it was a damn sight more fun than most ""horror"" movies Ive seen in the past decade or so. Hopefully the success of 'Jeepers Creepers' will hammer the final nail in the coffin of all the 'Scream' style ""Post-Modern""(!) horror flicks that get thrust upon us every year!",Jeepers Creepers

For about 30/45 minutes, I couldn't move - I was paralyzed with pure fear. The mood was thick, the threat was frightening, the characters were pretty well drawn, the acting was good - everything was going swell.And then the creature feature silliness starts.It's a shame that Jeepers Creepers can't keep its energy up to a satisfying finale. Maybe people's mileage will vary. Personally, I'm not too scared by a creature that sprouts wings and flies off with people. It's just too goofy for me. It's a lot scarier to think that this creature might be something even spookier. Maybe if they'd kept the creature in the shadows more, it would have been scarier to me.Still, the first act is one of the most terrifying things I've ever seen in my life and that's got to count for something.",Jeepers Creepers

Was this quote intended for another film, but somehow slipped onto this one? Or perhaps, somehow, the word 'worst' was mistyped 'best'? Ten minutes in I was wondering if, perhaps, this was actually going to be a scary film, but then the plot took a series of unexpected turns that were only unexpected because we all thought directors tried to be a little bit original in horror films these days. Forget the post modern self parody of Scream, in fact, forget any horror movie you have ever seen because that is the only way you will be able to see this film as anything other than a ham-fisted attempt at making a run-of-the-mill teen horror flick. Most episodes of the X-Files (which this film blatantly rips-off) are scarier. So, in conclusion, this film was rubbish, absolute rubbish, in fact I promise you all now that I am never going to watch another film with the name Victor Salva associated with it in any way ever again.",Jeepers Creepers
274,Omne,Interesting idea- bad execution,2,19 January 2002,"In light of the 350+ previous comments I'm not going to bother going over the plot and I'll simply make a couple of observations.Potential spoilers.
The film started out OK but went downhill fairly quickly. I could forgive the stupid kids. I could forgive the stupid police. I could even forgive the obligatory old cat lady getting it. What I can't forgive is the silly ass monster they came up with.The idea of a creature that only becomes active every 23 years for a period of 23 days and that incorporates the parts of it's victims that it eats could have resulted in a pretty good flick. Alas it was not to be. The film makers felt obligated to use a guy in a cheesy rubber mask and suit, complete with wings for God's sake. Obviously they never read anything by H.P. Lovecraft and they never learned that the horror you DON'T SEE is infinitely more horrifying than anything that can be conjured up by the author/film maker.If they had resisted the impulse to play with their special effects and had simply left the monster/creature cloaked and hidden in the dark they would have produced a film that was genuinely scary and not something that reminded me of a script that was rejected by the X-Files. Make the creature an alien and swap Sculley and Mulder for the stupid kids and it would might have been an interesting episode. As it was it was a lousy movie instead.Wait a minute it *was* an X-Files episode in Season One starring Victor Eugene Toombs. I knew it looked familiar...... :-)I'd give it a pass unless you really like silly rubber monsters and stupid victims.",Jeepers Creepers
275,jupiter2-6,A Decent Little Horror Package,8,8 December 2005,"This is a very tight little shocker that knows how to pull a ton of scare out of most of its scenes. It never goes over the top and the dialog is quite natural. Except for some scenes where the main female character seemed to act on a 2 note level, the entire cast seemed genuinely into what they were doing and fleshed-out their roles well. Even, Eileen Brennan's cameo was never too long to seem out of sync. She was simply a character along the way that gets offed and her scenes are quite scary and effective. Even the photography is top-notch. There was always a sense that something ugly was just off camera. The budget was used well and there weren't too many ideas crammed into the story. Obviously, this was made without too many ""opinions by committee."" Oddly, this film contains the hunkiest police force this side of Central Casting. A lot of fun packed into a little story.",Jeepers Creepers
276,haudit,Where'd ya get those peepers?,8,27 October 2001,"I was exceeding bored one Friday night, so I decided that a trip to the cinema might be in order.  When my friends and I tried to decide what to go see, we all thought that Jeepers Creepers might be a fairly good choice. So we went to see it - and we were not disappointed.From the opening, the tension of this film never lets up.  The demon is quite scary, but what is scarier is his truck, and the noise that horn makes, it's the sort of noise that can make your blood run cold.  Justin Long (Galaxy Quest) and Gina Phillips (Ally McBeal, Boston Public) do a good job of conveying the terror of the two college sibling driving home for spring break being hunted by a psycho for no apparent reason, although the reason becomes clear later on in the movie.While the film started off very well, I thought that the second half quickly became ludicrous, although the explanation of the demon's motivations does actually make sense, i quote 'once every 23 years, for 23 days it can feed'.Definitely go and see this if you are tired of run of the mill slasher flicks, and (sometimes) want the crap scared out of you, and trust me, it'll be the truck that scares you most.",Jeepers Creepers

It was as though every bad decision made during any horror movie was made by the two main characters as they try desperately to escape the evil clutches of.... Batman? Well, that's all I can say for the make-up. The acting was atrocious, (so, how many people have you seen run into a crowded diner, scream for someone to call the police, and have everyone in there look at them like they're disturbing their meal?) The plot was so poorly written that the viewer feels totally confused by the half-way point. And it don't get much better from there. In fact, it manages to leave the story with holes big enough to shove your fist through. And the ending?.... Well, I'm not going to spoil it for those of you that still feel like wasting $5, but it left something to be desired.... awww shucks.... I'll just come out and say it.... This ending must be the WORST ending to any movie I've ever seen. It's not like you didn't see it coming, though.

279,jwalzer5,"Get a grip, people",10,1 March 2002,"The way some citizen reviewers are taking on over ""Jeepers Creepers"", you'd think its makers had set out to supplant ""Citizen Kane"".  Get a grip, people.  This was a modest little fright film - a very good one.  It turned most of the conventions on their heads - specifically, resisting the urge to tack on a ""happy ending"", a fault common to many of these genre films, even when doing so necessitates twisting the screenplay into a pretzel; also noteworthy: making the guy the vulnerable character, hoping his SISTER would rescue him, instead of the usual, breast-heaving, libidinous female bimbo, beloved of horror movies, waiting for the big, strong man to rescue her. More to the point, I assumed, several times during this film, that I knew what would happen; the authors of the screenplay anticipated my reaction, and pulled the rug out from under me.  For that, I applaud them.  Novelty is in short supply in SequelWorld.  ""Jeepers Creepers"" took risks; and I salute them for it.",Jeepers Creepers

281,SteveRaccoon,Oh dear.,1,12 April 2004,"If a film strikes me as being terrible, I ignore it and don't dwell it. Onto the next thing.However, this particular movie is the single one that stuck as being just plain wrong. I apologise if this review seems unfairly biased against the movie, but this is one case where I wish I'd rented another film. Any other film. The two main characters don't 'gel', with each other or the other characters - It's almost like every other character in the film was an afterthought. The pesky kids were the almost complete focus of the film, yet they say nothing interesting, don't really seem any more brother and sister than 'two young actors in a car' and wouldn't justify a 20-minute short, let alone a feature-length picture. The scares were silly, the entire film feels like a shell which should have had some life breathed into it. Even the vaunted 'veering truck' near the beginning was played out in a way which jarred. Seriously, that's entertaining? Well, wait till you discover watching dry paint.. The creature itself.. I'm sorry, it seemed like a basic outline of a few factors which someone had drawn a character design for, then it was chucked into the film. It was on some drawing board rather than a living, breathing part of the film.Even in the most weird horror setting, you should be able to at least put yourself in the victims' shoes. I couldn't. I had no empathy for the characters at all, I wished to god the monster had run them through and had done with it.The monster's apparent invulnerability was extremely irritating. As was its apparent ability to be everywhere at once. If you can't destroy it, then you have to outrun it. If you can't outrun it, you're dead. The dull duo obviously couldn't defeat or outrun it, so why did the rest of the movie happen? Please, for the love of all things holy, take their heads off! I forced myself to sit through the entirety, but I already had that nagging ""Do something else"" feeling half way through. The ending was both an annoyance and a welcome release.To me this lacked any kind of balance, had no single good component to hang the rest on. It fell flat. I felt ridiculous for wasting my time on it. Renting both this tripe and the atrocious Dominator at the same time put me off watching new movies for a while, unless Scream and other teenie-bopper wannabe horrors are films you really enjoyed, stay WELL clear of this gobbler.",Jeepers Creepers
282,Raydio,Not a work of art... but entertaining,8,13 July 2002,"I had no expectations prior to seeing ""Jeepers Creepers"", as no one I knew had seen it before. I watched it with my brother, and at the conclusion we both agreed, this was not a great movie - but it was quite entertaining with one major proviso...don't take the plot too seriously. Let's face it, in most of these sort of horror films, the main characters seem to be so incredibly stupid, it should come as no surprise to anyone that they react to situations in completely illogical and often suicidal ways. Ok, so no rational person would allow themselves to be dangled down a seriously dark and deep drainpipe because someone ""might need our help"". A rational person would just find a nearby farm with a phone and call the cops. The makeup in this movie was a mixed bag. The Creep I thought was pretty well done - he looked downright nasty. The corpses we see close up looked more like wax dummies - not good! All in all though, the main factor in rating a movie for me is entertainment value, and I enjoyed the film, despite the plot holes. I recommend giving ""Jeepers Creepers"" a try. 7/10",Jeepers Creepers

Let's start off with the good stuff.  The first half hour of the film is undoubtedly the most promising setup that I have seen in a horror flick in quite a long time.  There are some wicked-awesome shots employed and the tension is crafted perfectly.  There is some nice yack-yack between the bro and sis, to boot (even if it is a bit runny at times).  And what the brother and sister discover is truly disturbing. Unfortunately, this is where everything falls.  With all of the directions that the movie could have taken at this point, the writer/director chose to go for the freaky/crazy, rather than the more subtle, psychological build up that the first hour both executes and promises.  I felt blue balled.  By the last half hour, I felt like shutting the film off, but decided that I should stick with it only because the first half was so gnarly. You decide for youself.  7/10 ONLY because the intro is some of the strongest horror I've seen since Texas Chainsaw Massacre.",Jeepers Creepers

The Creeper is a monster that will become just as popular as Ghostface(Scream) Freddie Krueger and Pinhead. it doesnt rely on over-the-top gore for its scares. It builds up its tension slowly, before releasing it with sudden loud music and an appearence by The creeper.

I was, at first, expecting another entertaining yet stupid slasher movie with a monster as the slasher, but this was able to capture in the form of the villainous and carnivorous Creeper what most horror movies can never quite catch now: true horror.All the film needed was a simple plot, a few no-name actors with a bit of talent (even though the two lead characters can get VERY annoying at times), and a very scary villain to join the ranks of some of the other horror classics, such as Halloween, Carrie, A Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th, and The Exorcist. All I know is that this is a real good film and I can't wait for the upcoming sequel.Also, on director Victor Salva, I know about his past and, while what he did was absolutely horrific, he's admitted he did a bad thing and promised that he'll never do it again and I can forgive him for it.",Jeepers Creepers
288,mmintz,"Clive Barker, I want my six bucks back (or at least three of them)",6,2 September 2001,"BEWARE, SPOILERS HEREIN!Not horrible but not good.  ""Jeepers Creepers"" is significantly better than the other Generation Y teen horror movies (""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" and the like) but that doesn't make it good.  It was OK.  It basically was one of the lesser X-Files episodes stretched to an hour and a half instead of 45 minutes (that includes ads).  What I didn't like: the use of the theme song.  There are much better uses of ironically upbeat oldies to induce fear and trembling.  (Little Red Riding Hood in ""Striking Distance""...)  Especially when you find out that the underly-clever ending is tied in too closely with the song.  I thought the ending was pretty worthless and I don't think it's because I have to have happy endings.  By naming the movie after the disappointing last scene you sense that without the dumb ending there would've been no movie.  It was clearly written backwards. ""Okay, I want to do a movie where the last scene is this kid with his eyes ripped out and the song playing...""  Kind of a slim premise.  Also, the psychic (very similar to the old black lady in ""The Stand"") was pretty unnecessary.  Basically an even more annoying version of Tess from ""Touched by an Angel"".  What I did like:  the two main actors (especially the kid from ""Ed""). Though not incredible, they had a little depth and were chosen for more than just their pretty faces.  I also appreciated he lack of CGI.  I think that some of the special effects that looked fake looked that way because the corpses were supposed to have been petrified in some way.  The Karate-like flips that our antagonist manages when avoiding getting run over were cool. Finally, the show-down in the police station was pretty intense.

298,BlackMonk,Jeepers almost Creepers,4,1 September 2001,"A movie with much potential, good acting, a horrific villain, but ruined by a mediocre script and some unnecessary--and missing--plot elements.The first 30 minutes of the movie bordered on outstanding, but after that it started a descent and never made a full recovery. The old rusty truck barreling down the road, the slide down the sewer, the discovery of what was there, those irritating squawking crows--good build-up. But after that, it was as if the script writers didn't quite know how to do the rest, didn't quite know how to integrate the story. By inserting a handful of unnecessary elements into the plot, the script undermined the intensity it had built. The psychic lady, for example, was the first such unneeded element. She added nothing that couldn't have been introduced by some other plot device. The viewer just wants to stuff one of the teens' smelly socks into her big fat yapper. She was worthless.The villain was scary, but one never learns much about him, other than what the psychic lady sputtered, about ""23 years for 23 days"" Oh, the horror of the number 23! Whatever. The 23-year thing was one of those unneeded plot elements that was left dangling.The creature's penchant for using a particular sense perception in order to determine what to grab from his next victim, was dumb, as was the reason WHY. The writers could have dreamed up something better than THAT. Yeah, I know--that's how they made the 'where'd you get those peepers' line significant, but come on; they could have done better. By the time the character makes his full-fledged appearance, it's anti-climactic. He's just another horror villain able to show up anywhere and engage in disgusting acts. Yawn. But what wasn't a yawner was when the 2 teens have the opportunity to run him over. The car-walking scene, his daring them by pacing in the middle of the road, was superb. What WAS that thing? Why did it do what it did? Are there more like it? Where did it come from? Why every 23 years for 23 days--why not a nice round number like, say, 25? Why not every 10?

299,superjxiv,I guess I liked it,7,4 May 2002,"Let me try to explain why I liked this B-style creature feature.Our resident baddie is the Creeper, and I'm not sure what it is exactly, but thats okay because neither does writer/director Victor Salva. At least he claims ambiguity toward the Creepers' true identity on the Special Edition DVD, but that simply means he doesn't know.The Creepers drives around in a truck and runs folks off the road when he feels frisky. He carries around some kind of battle axe and at a certain moment, he lops off some guy's head.Now here's my favorite part of the movie. He drags the body over to his truck and heaves it in the back with all his other bodies, slamming the door. Two or three seconds of darkness . . . then one door cracks open, and the Creeper just tosses the severed head in, like it was his backpack.There's a kooky humor, dark and grizzly, but catchy and hilarious if it catches you in the right mood. This film isn't a great movie, and most of the time it tries pretty damn hard to be a good movie. But right when you get tired of the running and screaming, there comes along a moment of bizarre comedy thats unexpected, and those moments are worth the trip for me.I like horror movies, and I love bad horror movies, and its nice that Hollywood hasn't forgotten the fun of a good creature feature after all the slasher movies ran their course in the late 90's. I guess if I could change anything, I'd want a creature who's design didn't so closely parallel a monster of the week from Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but then I feel I'm asking too much from the creative team that brought us the crap-tacular Powder.Jeepers Creepers ranks a 7 out of 10, but as a warning, you should know I'm somewhat biased to this genre.",Jeepers Creepers

306,sweensa,2 part review.,5,25 November 2019,The first 15-20 mins of this film are quality horror done so well. Dropping the body down the pipe the menacing figure and mystery driver all tip top stuff. Then it gets ridiculous they pull it off well with a crazy story . If they just had some mad man stalking them for seeing his secret and it panned out the same ending. Then it would have been excellent. Unfortunately like some other films it went a direction of .....really . Is it over yet I'm bored now. 5/10 . 5 for the first 20 mins. 0 for the rest.,Jeepers Creepers
307,Kazetnik,If only it were more than half a good movie....,6,16 October 2006,"The first half is genuinely frightening, in an adrenalin-inducing, jump-in-your-seat kind of way, not least because all the stereotypical gestures of this movie type are both stripped away and mocked. Brother and sister, likable, smart, flawed. A genuinely realistic premise for the uncovering of the bodies. No stock set of characters. No 'let's go explore that scary mansion'. And the lack of predictability continues to the hiatus in the diner with the phone call. Disorienting and requiring close attention, this film uses the standard tricks of its sub-genre, subverts and remakes them.And then it all goes wonky. Psychics and the nature of the killer, the running and screaming and driving, all reduce it to the level of same old, same old. And that's a shame. The sound throughout is highly skilled (particularly the use of silence and the Henry Hall song over the closing credits); the ending is suitably horrible; and sympathy for central characters in this genre is rare, but the fright factor just isn't sustained in the second half.I'd give this 8 for the first half and 4 for the second, so I've averaged it.",Jeepers Creepers
308,Matt-162,A lot of potential falls flat,5,14 January 2002,"**WARNING - POTENTIAL SPOILERS**As in all artistic endeavors, there are very few ideas that haven't been played out. In the horror genre, nearly everything has become cliche. Despite this, for a while this movie is legitimately creepy. The remoteness of the surroundings and feeling of helpless solitude amplify the tension early on. Neither of the lead roles were familiar faces to me, so you aren't comforted with any certainty of their ultimate safety at any time. That the beast drove around in broad daylight in a rusty, hulking truck was a nice touch.When the monster is revealed, the movie loses a lot of its impact. I found the beast much more threatening as an unknown, rather than the winged costume store goon it eventually turns out to be. While the absorbing qualities from its victims is a nice twist reminiscent of Lovecraft, there are numerous messy spots. The demon is crippled after being run down by the car, yet police bullets at near point-blank range bounce off of him. Despite this, the demon seems apprehensive at the presence of police guns near the end during his abduction of Darry. The addition of the psychic woman seems a nice idea at first, but beyond her initial introduction she is hardly memorable. She claims she sees future events in her dreams, yet also claims to know what the demon calls his lair and then tosses out some mumbo-jumbo about a 23 day time period the demon is allowed to kill. (23rd spring)If she only sees what will be, how does she know all the details about the monster? Her continual foreshadowing on the ending also completely deflates what might otherwise have been a creepy conclusion.  All in all what starts strong ultimately falls flat, and Jeepers Creepers joins the ranks of other average wait-for-rent fare. It will undoubtably have multiple tiresome sequels before withering away...as I write this review, I notice a sequel is already underway. That's unfortunate.",Jeepers Creepers
309,BENARES-2,"At least it was better than ""Steel""...",1,18 January 2002,"... and that's the only good thing I can say about this film.  Are you really supposed to root for the monster in a ""scary"" movie?  I was desperately hoping he'd put those two idiot teenagers out of my misery sooner than he did, I'm very disappointed in the Creeper. See, when I see something happening, like, say, a monster that is immortal hunting me down or walking towards me or eating a decapitated cop, I like to run for my life.  The wonder-twins here like to stare at the impending horror with their mouths and eyes agape and then proceed to argue about stupid brother-sister things, instead. I wish these teens in horror movies would stop buying their cars from ""Gear Shifts Don't Work 'R Us"" or ""Car Won't Start 'R Us"", it may be a little more pricey from other dealers but I guarantee it'll help in the long run. Look, this movie stank.  That's all that really needs to be said.  If you think this movie was innovative, clever, or surprising, then you REALLY need to get out of the house more or watch some other movies or open your eyes and expose yourself to the world around you.  The ending wasn't clever or surprising, the monster wasn't scary, and every time there was a level of silence I wasn't jumping out of my chair when something/someone ""unexpectedly"" jumped onto the scene. Oh, and I love the fact that after the horror is complete at the end the police station the whole fiasco took place in was back up and running like nothing happened even though every cop there saw another cop get his heart torn out by the big bad monster.  Way to go, America's Finest!",Jeepers Creepers
310,Asura_H,Great monster,10,17 April 2021,"When I watched this film I was afraid of another weak, dumb and easy to defeat monster. Indeed the design looked great. A lot of good special effects and make up in an actor who isn't overreacting. Powerful and invincible, of course a ""good end"" where goodness defeat evil is a cliché, it is impossible with such fiend and the monster got his reward. Of course, a creature not really evil, just needs to feed and is an artist, intelligent and talented. That made connection with me. I give 10 because of my feelings than anything else.",Jeepers Creepers
311,RJC-99,"Nice premise, squandered",8,20 February 2003,"Victor Salva's auteur turn in B-horrorland is better than most, mainly because he is so much more interesting a storyteller than many of his genre contemporaries.  ""Jeepers"" has several things going for it: suspense, developed characters, above-average acting, and visual style.  That's not to say it's great or even very good.  The movie is wildly uneven, a problem bound to disappoint anyone grabbed by its beguiling opening.About that opening: like the low-budget filmmaker he most resembles, George Romero, Salva has built his story upon simple, elemental horror.  Kids witness what look like bodies being dumped down a sewer pipe next to a rotted church; their curiosity must be satisfied.  What he accomplishes in the first act is a quite masterful bogeyman set-up, disturbing yet inviting, and for a moment, we may think we hear Tobe Hooper's chainsaws. Especially good is Salva's patience in developing his sibling protagonists, their dialogue and reading good enough to establish what most genre work can't even dream of -- plausible characters.  But where Romero is famous for exploring the dimensions of his (deceptively) simple premises, Salva retreats from them into mannered predictability.Narrowing his scope to a cat and mouse game, the writer-director fritters away too many possibilities even before the second act is out, and the third act is plainly bad.  Why bother subverting expectations early on if you're only going to resort to cliché later?  The clairvoyant character is lifted from ""The Shining""; the police station siege is a  ""Terminator"" retread. And why establish an aesthete-predator at all if you're only going to have him jump out periodically and kill, like any Freddy Krueger?  Salva has complained about last-minute budgetary restrictions yet so much has gone wrong by the final half hour, dissipating tension, squandering sympathy, indulging in camp, and (the worst misstep) calling in his deus ex machina voodoo chile, that it's hard to see what more money could have done.Salva's imagery, however, is always striking.  The production design is shoestring brilliance, helping make his highway and sewer pipe sequences genuinely spooky.  And there's subtext aplenty.  The current of fetishistic erotic violence invites all sorts of interpretation; in fact, fairly or not, this may be the first horror film for which knowledge of the director's well-publicized past seems likely to make some parts scarier.",Jeepers Creepers
312,bibleboyiam,Ridiculous Yet Fun to Watch,6,16 September 2003,"*Possible Spoilers* Although this film is rather absurd, it is still worth watching. It was good enough to go back and rent two years after viewing in the theater.The highs of the movie are the old supertruck that the Creeper drives in the beginning of the movie, the semi suspenseful scene in the police station, and the bodies in the basement of the church. The lows are the old psychic bitch, the maddening song she sings over and over, and the idiotic main characters who would have never gotten into such a mess if they had just kept driving.Overall, a fun 90 minutes to spend on a lazy Friday night. 6/10",Jeepers Creepers
313,SomeGuyName,... Deeeeerp!,5,12 October 2017,"This movie was above average as just a movie(not really a horror) and it was genuinely funny. It's the only horror that I've ever seen that has comedy elements at the right timing, so as to not ruin the scares - but the scares, in and of themselves, were not good enough. I know it's a tired complaint that ""people act stupid in horror movies"", but most of the time I disagree, or at least understand the character's motivation. But in this one, the lack of suspension of disbelief - on behalf of stupidity - actually managed to ruin much of the movie for me. An example, early spoilers: so the siblings is harassed by some creepy dude in a car, and they later see him throwing some suspiciously lumpy sheets down a pipe. They decide to go back and check if those were really dead people - that's fine, I understand being curious. But then the brother gets stuck down the pipe with a bunch of bodies, and instead of yelling at his sister to go get some help, he demands that she waits at the road for someone else to drive by, so that she can tell them to go get the police. This is completely unbelievable; nobody would ever leave their car out in the open like that, when it is clearly established that an apparent serial killer is one of the only ones who frequents the place. And since the creepy dude previously saw that they were two in the car, he'll just go kill them both the second he spots it - so it's not even in the brother's own selfish interest that she stays. Why not just hide, and wait for his sister come back with the police? I know they actually got away, and I know it's minor, but it just bugged me.Adding to that, when the brother sees the first body, he takes minutes to even react, and when he finally starts looking for an exit, he stops to do stuff like properly tie his shoes, and further stare at all the bodies. A real non-fictional human would instantly panic at the first sign of death, and get the hell outta there, because stuff like like this are what helped us survive as a species. ""I'm not seeing this"" - no, cause you'd be gone right now. Situations like these happens all the time in this movie, and that's sad. Because it doesn't mean that the jump-scares are not perfectly timed, and that this movie is not exciting, or original. It also has a lot of indie-charm to it. It just ruins much of the great pacing and atmosphere, when the only time you will ever see a character just standing there, is in the face of immediate danger.And one last thing. The description for this movie - ritual murder monster - is a huge spoiler, and only first revealed by the second half of the movie. I spent the first twenty minutes being scared of the person in the car, and then I read the description and spent the rest of the time waiting for the monster to appear, killing the suspension. That said, the simple lore behind the monster was great. I just wish it didn't look at stupid as it did, and that it had eaten someone's hair as a first priority.",Jeepers Creepers

The reason you couldn't see them before was probably because of that long cloak he wears. He probably had the weapons inside it.""Why are the characters so stupid?""I honestly don't get anyone asking this one. These were simply some of the most intelligent characters I have seen in a horror film. Much more intelligent than the excuses for humans in popular horrors such as Saw, Hostel, Paranormal Activity or Insidious.""What does the Creeper do with the boy's body? Why are his eyes missing?""If you weren't listening to the dialog in a movie you're watching you must be pretty stupid. The Creeper wants eyes. He won't take a person's eyes unless he likes them.""Why is it never explained what the Creeper is?""Unless you're so socially withdrawn that you only go on the internet to make fun of great movies you'd know there was a sequel and another on the way. Director, Victor Salva probably wanted to finally explain everything in the third movie, that way he could make more movies in the series and not have them simply be sequels, but films with a purpose, moving up to the big finale. The third movie, where everything will probably be explained.Now a question from me.""Why do you have to analyze everything?""Movies were made to watch for pleasure. They're supposed to be fun and a way to pass otherwise useless time. Why can't we just enjoy these movies and stop thinking so hard about things that don't matter.

It's just disappointing because this movie had so much potential, but it fell apart towards the middle and end, and it just sort of became an average horror flick. It's still worth a watch though.

It seems that several of these are released about this time every year (recently the Haunting of Hill house movies...ugh).  I usually regret spending the time and money to see these films, but ""Jeepers Creepers"" doesn't fall into that category.  Thankfully, It does not follow the same old tired plot as every other recent horror film.  Rather than introducing a group of people (and making it pretty obvious who will be among the first few to get whacked), the film focuses around two main characters, and does a good job in doing so.  As someone said earlier, the ending is definitely unconventional.  Given the success this film has met so far, I would not be surprised to see a sequel next year.",Jeepers Creepers

We learn that the creature takes a ""liking"" to certain people and hunts them down to take them...but again, we never learn why it selects them. Sometimes the creature seems invincible, like when people are shooting guns at it at point blank range, but yet it was at least temporarily injured when struck by a car...seems somewhat inconsistent to me.

I'm not one to pick a horror movie apart at the seams, because this genre tends to have plenty of implausibilities simply for the sake of a good scary story line. We've come to expect that from films like this. Director Victor Salva presents us with one of the most frightening opening sequences in recent memory, and the fear and tension are kept at a maximum during the entire film. There's no gradual buildup here as in so many horror films. I've heard several people tell me they liked the movie until the Creeper creature showed up, but then they lost interest. Not me. The Creeper is one of the more imaginative movie monsters of recent years. The photography is another plus. Very good use of light and shadows. All in all this is a horror flick that is head and shoulders above most.",Jeepers Creepers

But as happens with many horror movies, when the plot is advanced the movie gets worse and worse.  Classic horror movie mistakes, I thought, were a thing of the past, with the help of Wes Craven's ""Scream"".  This is obviously not the case. Cliches run wild in this movie.  People in the audience were literally saying ""just drive away"" which resulted in a laugh in the audience.Finally, some movies don't have a beginning, middle and end.  Some are designed simply to make sequels.  It's like a multi-million dollar franchise.  Why on earth would McDonald's only open one restaurant?  They wouldn't.  So, I'm sure we can expect ""Jeepers Creepers 2"" within the next year or so.  And I'm sure it will be worse than the first, which means I would shoot myself in the foot if it meant I didn't have to watch.Don't bother with this one.

Now that I've seen it (and I'm very happy that I went to the theatre TO see it) I have to say that it is far from horrible...and probably one of the best horror flicks I've seen in a while.I really enjoyed the characters that existed in the movie, and the fact that there wasn't a whole lot of them really was a bonus too.  It's great that the two leads were a brother/sister duo instead of two sex crazed teens in love.  You never see anything but that... ever... until now.  The ""bad guy"" was a great new creation as well.  Something original.. something new... something fun.  I didn't however like the Psychic woman because I thought that bit of the storyline was too contrived... but necessary for the progression of the movie maybe.The movie itself had great use of sound instead of visuals.  Yes it did have some gore... but not all that much because like I said.. it was the sounds that made this movie what it was.The ending was brilliant.  Simple as that.

331,Deafy the Timid Diver,WHAT?!?!?!,4,31 August 2001,"Ummm, ok, after reading some of these comments, only one thing came to mind...did they see the same movie that I did?!?!  The first third of the movie was actually doing just fine, riding a 6.5 or 7 out of 10.  Then things went downhill from there, and in quite a hurry.  The Creeper was not that frightening in his true form.  If anything, his human form was more ominous.  I also started noticing the implausibility of everything that was going on, and I am not one to dwell on these things during any movie, usually suspending disbelief when I stroll into a theater.  I thought that the creeper must have taken the BRAINS from these two at the very beginning of the movie because they keep on doing stupid things after stupid things. I found myself thinking, ""Why are they doing that?"" ABOUT EVERY 5 MINUTES!Here are more ramblings before I forget-It seems like that there was nothing going on during the movie.  Ever watch a movie asking yourself at the end, ""Boy, nothing really got accomplished..""  This is a prime example.  We don't get to see enough of the Creeper...Half of the time I was rooting for the kids to die for their stupidity...The old lady psychic in the movie was pointless, with the exception of having the title make a little sense...AND THE ENDING WAS DISEASED!  I can tell that the people in the theater (about 25-30) kept sitting there, hoping and praying for more; then the credits started rolling, and out came the collective groan from the audience.  There was not really a point that I was afraid of the Creeper, which, of course, is not good for a horror movie...And what was up with the day after the creeper did his thing?  The police station was back to normal, with everyone acting like nothing ever happened!  Where was the SWAT team?  Where was the Army?Well, all in all, I gave it a 4/10.  Like I said, it was riding high at the beginning, but the ending left a bad taste in my mouth.  You want to be scared?  Go rent the Exorcist, Stir of Echoes, Alien, or Event Horizon. Maybe shell out a few bucks and check out The Others in the theater, probably the most under-rated scary movie that I have seen.  Was JC Worth the 6 bucks I paid for it?  Probably not.  Either go see an early showing or wait to rent it.  Good Premise, poor execution.  A better ending (which I guess is mostly opinion) would have bumped this to above a 5 (6.5?), but when the dust settles, we are still left with a very average horror flick.",Jeepers Creepers
332,Cydone,"Not that bad, its evil, and alittle different!",7,22 October 2002,"You gotta love the end. Its evil and sweet to my mind to see this movie end like this.Its silly, has its B-movie moments, I cant help to think about The Thing and The Mothman Prophecies, when watching this flick. It tries to build up some of the ""creature"" suspense, The Thing so admirably succeeds in doing. And it has some of the run and chase feel of the Mothman Prophecies.Although not too much depth or anything great in this movie, I like to see a creature face-to-face and up front for once. No hiding here (at least not too much) The drawback, and perhaps the reason horror flicks never show their creatures up front, is we get attached to this thing, to this silly looking creature. Hey he cant live without the things he do, and he is having some nice and cosy times in his cavern.Its not great, alittle boring at times, but worth attention, at least as long as it lasts.

Two siblings are on their way home and take the long drive across country. It is here they run into The Creeper, a moth-like creature who awakes from hibernation every twenty-three years to feed on anyone he takes a liking to. Needless to say, he takes a liking to our heroes and the rest of the film is them trying to escape. The first twenty minutes of the film are quite creepy - with the exception of the annoying stupidity of the brother - what with only seeing The Creeper as a shadowy figure who drives a monstrous truck (in itself, very bizarre). The middle part of the film drags and quickly slips into predictable nonsense. The main problem is the villain. As soon as you see his face, any air of mystery or suspense disappears. If anyone remembers the early Tom Cruise film Legend, think the red demon played by Tim Curry - only more comedic. The special effects at best are passable, the acting okay and the script...predictable. And then the thing just ends, with not much as way of an explanation. I guess that means we have to watch the sequel (which I won't be doing). The very generous 3 mark is for the scene-setting first twenty minutes.

336,TheSonomaDude,Unique and creative with some flaws...more than I can say for most horror films now...,8,26 July 2012,"Sitting down in a theater in 2001, I assumed this would be another crappy teen horror film with useless sex scenes and cheesy unrealistic plot points (I reviewed movies at the time for my community). However, I was pleasantly surprised.First off, I think we all know now that director Victor Silva is a convicted child molester. While that is without a doubt awful, he does a great job directing this film. His criminal background shouldn't effect the film he made. I'm not supporting him at all, but I did like this movie.Anyways, the movie starts off extremely chilling and terrifying. The first 15 minutes of this movie will send a chill down your spine. However, once the kids go into the house, the film slowly starts to descend at a slow but sure rate. By the end of the flick, the film is very 'meh', but maybe that's because the film couldn't live up to the beginning. The Creeper, the villain of this horror film, is easily one of the most terrifying villains of horror in a long time. The way he looks, what he wears, his truck, what he does. All of it is horrifying. I proudly tilt my hat to whoever did the makeup design. However, the ""twist"" at the end, while definitely unique, kind of takes away from the seriousness the film had. It looked good in Vilva's head and on the storyboards, but when it transferred to screen, it just isn't subtle. As I said, the first third of the film is great. The second third isn't as good, but still manages to keep up the thrills. The climax in the police station is sadly quite boring and loses all the tension the film was building up (despite that the scene involves a massive shootout), but its the VERY ending, the last 2 minutes of the movie that satisfy me. The film in general has a very dark, subtle, and eerie feeling that you just don't see in horror films nowadays. The camera angles are very Evil Dead-esque at times and really add an evil tension to the film.Overall, this is a nicely made horror film with some flaws here and there. If you can get past the directors terrible criminal background, then check out this film. However, I don't recommend the sequel.",Jeepers Creepers
337,internsrf,ok to bad when it came out - terrible by today's standards,1,21 May 2021,"I remember seeing this in theaters when it came out, and even then back in the early 2000s thinking it was a pretty dumb cheesy B-level horror film, and yet today in 2021 I had convinced myself that maybe I was too harsh in it 20 years ago. However after watching it today, it doesn't even hold up to standards of the worst films. No story, no plot, no characterization, the most nonsensical plot imaginable. I mean, why is there a psychic - Irrelevant. Why has no one noticed the 100 other dead bodies over the past few years - irrelevant. Why doesn't a single cop (of the laughable 50 that suddenly appear out of nowhere in this 1 gas station / diner town fire a single shot in the comically long 2 back to back 10 minute scenes where the monster just stands there. There are so many terrible moments in this film, it will just make you angry by the end of it. Dumbest characters, dumbest story, and terrible performances abound.

But, sadly, this film was very bland and not worth their time and talents.This film adhered to every gimic, stereotype, and cliche of a teen horror film.  And even though they tried to poke fun at themselves for doing it -- it failed miserably.There are too many things wrong with this film to list.  Wholes in the plot, some questionable acting.  Example: a monster that's been on the prowl for decades, has killed over 600 people, and only now does everyone in the area find out about him?!  Why?!  Because if you don't, there's no movie.And, if you're going to make a horror film - the 50's are over - straight monster movies don't work.

340,TrickyTheHorrorFreak,"Fantastic, intense first half is let down towards the end. A fine creature feature regardless.",8,8 February 2007,"""Jeepers Creepers"" is a fairly stupid name for a horror movie. It certainly didn't inspire confidence in me that this would be anything but another lame teenager based slasher flick. As it turns out, ""Jeepers Creepers"" is much better than it sounds, and while it falls a bit short of classic status, is certainly not to be underestimated.Darry and Trish Jenner are traveling home for spring break when they are violently harassed by a seemingly psychotic truck driver. Soon after they witness the same driver dumping what appear to be bodies wrapped in sheets into a drainpipe. From this point on, the siblings are torn between helping the victims and escaping this malevolent madman intent on tracking them down. To make matters even worse, it soon becomes apparent that their attacker is far from human.I'll start with the positives here. The first half an hour of this movie is sensational! If it had managed to keep the standard set in this early period for the entire running time, it would indeed be a fine horror movie. Darry and Trish have fabulous, believable brother and sister chemistry. Their acting may not be award quality, but it's far above typical horror genre fare. When the terror starts, and it starts within the first few minutes, the viewer already has a connection with these characters and that's a credit to the actors and the direction of Victor Salva. These first scenes are seriously intense and I love it. To continue with the positives, the creature itself (The Creeper) looks fantastic. They really created a horrific and fascinating being. Without giving too much away, the filmmakers slowly reveal more and more features of The Creeper as the movie goes on. By the end of the film, you can see him in all his glory and it's a quite a site to behold.So why don't I consider this to be a classic? Basically, it goes downhill in the second half of the film. I've always been opposed to the use of psychics to tell a story and ""Jeepers Creepers"" is a classic case. With no easy way to tell the audience of the monster's history, nor his reasons for killing, the writers created a psychic woman that for reasons completely unexplained, has a complete knowledge of not only The Creeper but can also see into the future. I admit, it's not done terribly, but it does annoy me. Secondly, ""Jeepers Creepers"" can't quite decide whether it takes itself seriously or not. In my opinion, the first half worked so well due to its intensity and the seriousness of the scenario. Once it starts making self-referential gags and The Creeper starts whistling the Jeepers Creepers tune, I feel it loses that intensity. There seems to be quite a market at the moment for movies that mix comedy with horror. I just feel this wasn't the movie to do it.Do the positives outweigh the negatives? Yeah, I think so. I really enjoy the movie as a whole and recommend it to any fan of creature features and horror in general. The sequel also has some merit and I hope we see more of The Creeper in years to come.",Jeepers Creepers

343,Viz79,One of the best films of this genre in recent memory,10,26 October 2001,"I went into to see this movie with great expectations... and I have to tell you, I was not let down but I was *very* surprised. You see, it was not what I was expecting but what I got was more than satisfied. Im afraid this is one of those 'Blair Witch' films... you are either going to love it or hate it; there is no go between.I myself absolutely love horrors and my top horror flicks include films like Blair Witch Project, The Exorcist and What Lies Beneath. The first relying completely on your own imagination wreaking havoc on you, the Exorcist is a masterpiece from the late 70s bringing you the most disturbing horror straight in your face and most recently, What Lies Beneath, which is a beautiful piece of silent and sudden shocks through out. As far as I can see, each is horror pure and simple but working in very different ways. And Jeepers Creepers belongs right there with them but introducing a new way of looking at it.Another viewer made a perfect comment here talking about audience reactions.. you see, it seems audiences are reacting the same everywhere. They are jumping out of their seats in certain scenes, other times they are screaming at the pair on the screen for being so stupid and curious for their own good (the ultimate horror cliche.. will they ever learn.. that those kids!), gasping in sheer disgust at certain scenes etc etc.Hold on.. isnt that what you get from horror films? And out of the three mentioned before, while each did its own thing, none achieved all of these together. But Jeepers Creepers manages to raise tension, has no problems laughing at itself and paying homage to everything horror films has brought before and introduces a horror 'villian' that will be hard to forget for some time. And the ending... well Ill leave that for you but I was certainly very pleased with it.Simply put, if you honestly love horrors, you will love this - it pays tribute to all the best ones and seems to have the best of everything. Don't be put off by all the negative criticisms here... the critics loved it and they never love anything :), and it seems to have broken box office records too.

It starts out the first 15 minutes of a brother and sister bickering like little kids, not acting like young adults they try to portray.  The ""bad guy"" visually looks nice, but he has absolutely no substance and in the wake of classics like Nightmare on Elm Street, Halloweeen, etc., this bad guy (who has no cool name) is more on the level of Barney that Jason.

BEWARE!!!!",Jeepers Creepers
346,djen303,above average first half,7,10 May 2002,"I must say, I was expecting a lot worse from this film.  The whole first half is genuinely scary.  Although the brother and sister's rivalry was played up just a bit too much, their characters were still a lot more believable than most modern scare films.  Their dialogue was especially natural, and didn't contain a single ""oh my god, like, did I just totally see, like, an undead demon, or is it just me?"" which I praise the writers for (there's only so many times Buffy the Vampire Slayer can say lines like that before I start doing a little slaying of my own).  Despite the constant squabbling the kids do, you can still warm up to them enough to feel empathic about their plight.  The cinematography was excellent, my favourite scene being the long pan up the side of the church.  The music and sound were cued perfectly and conveyed a true sense of fear, anxiety and isolation.Unfortunately, the second half of the movie really suffers.  Like so many other movies, once the killer/monster is revealed the whole thing goes down hill.  It goes from relying on X-files-like suspense to bland gore and a cliché monster suit.  Top it off with some overacting ""we're not taking any crap"" police officers and a poorly acted psychic lady and you turn what could have been a gem of a scary movie into a second rate dud.  The biggest disappointment was the end.  It was horribly tacked on in a desperate attempt at being a shocker.Other then the whole second half, the only other complaint I have is regarding the DVD.  The menus show clips from the movie which essentially run in sequence, and if you pay attention to them, they spoil just about everything.  Where they are, what the monster looks like, etc.  I haven't bothered to watch the menus all the way through but with any luck they spoil the ending too (but that's not really so bad in this case).",Jeepers Creepers

Instead it turns out to be the poor, formulaic adventure of two late teens faced with the challenge of surviving their own decisions and each other's half-witted lines.The mish-mash of ridiculously recycled dialog, recycled action, and inhumanly obtuse motivations easily override what, at the offset, could definitely have been the first 21st century Texas Chainsaw Massacre.Now many people seem to find the plot and dialog fresh and invigorating, but then again a recent local survey had Perkins voted as one of the best restaurants in town.

I'm a massive fan of the horror genre, so I welcome any new horror movie that dares to be different.  Jeepers Creepers starts creepy and ends creepier.  Although it starts to sag slightly in the middle (a plot thread involving a psychic is so thin you could hang hairs on it), there's enough tension and humour to more than make up for it.  It isn't the best horror movie of the last ten years.  That would be Ginger Snaps.  But it certainly comes close.  The acting is amazing, the beginning (which pays homage to Stephen Speilberg's 'Duel') superb, and if the monster is a little hard to believe (it looks a bit like an overgrown fish), the scenes it is in still drip with fear.

It starts with no exposition and puts the viewer right in the middle of some gruesome goings-on.

There are no boring dialogues, useless explanations of things that should be left unexplained, or ""hip"", post-""screamesque in-jokes. And, hey, no stupid teenies at all!

Almost insultingly stupid.  NO ONE, & i mean NO ONE would have went back to that house.  The main characters from Dumb & Dumber wouldn't have went back.  Not to mention the incredibly stupid move of climbing down the well.  I nearly walked out of the theater on that one.  I'm sorry, no one on earth is that dumb.  But even with that, the movie was still clinging to an ""ok"" rating.  That is until they met the woman with the cats, that was the start of down hill.  & it continued down from there.  I fail to understand what the psychic ladies purpose was.  Was she just there to have a black face in the movie.  I really hope not.  She was stupid & annoying, & no person in there right mind would have listened to her, she sounded as stupid as the siblings.  She deserved to die as much as they did.  I was cheering for them to die.  I was absolutely p***ed that only the brother died.  I was waiting for the sister and/or the psychic to join Darry.  This movie sucked.  Dont waste your money.

359,kevin86,"A stylish horror film with ""CLASSIC"" written all over it.",9,4 June 2002,"Jeepers Creepers is a stylish horror film with classic written all over it. In the fashion of the old black and white horror movies, Jeepers Creepers is meant to haunt you not necessarily make you jump out of your skin (although some scenes do). Its a simple story done in an old fashioned yet brilliant style. The story follows Darry and Trish, siblings on their way home from college to visit their parents. While driving they are nearly run off the road by a creepy old car, which they then find parked by a church. It is there that they see a man wearing a trench coat dumping bodies into a sewer duct. This of course leads to a hideous chase as the ""Creeper"" targets the two as his new additions.What I loved about this movie is that it wasnt REALLY trying to impress anybody with big Hollywood visual effects and fascinating sets. Its all placed in the quiet, yet haunting, backroads and fields of the plains. With most of its action being seen in an old abandoned church, a hick diner, an old ladies darkened house, and the county's police station. It reminded me of those old monster movies where a small town was being plagued by an evil creature (ex. Swamp Monster). And I enjoyed seeing this on the big screen again.In terms of the monster, The Creeper is right down to it BAD. He's the definition of a villain. No change of character whatsoever is seen by the Creeper. His one goal is to get what he wants, and nothing that may come in his way will change his sights, no pleading, no bargaining, he wont let up. This I liked, it really gave you the sense that he was out there to get them, and unless Darry and Trish found an incredibly smart way to shake him, or a method of killing him, they would have to run from him forever.
Sure the ending may have been a little dark and dreary, but it ended in the way it should have ended. I personally found the ending to be EXTREMELY fitting for the film, anything else would have been a sad attempt at trying to make all the viewers happy. What was so great about it was it set up the idea that there may be a sequel, without just forcing it in last minute like a lot of movie's have before ('I Know What You Did Last Summer', the killer is alive and all of a sudden attacks Jennifer Love Hewitt at the last possible moment... too forced).The acting of a brother/sister relationship is really well done by Justin Long and Gina Philips, the Creeper does a great job at being a hated character, and overall payoff seemed well worth the time. I urge you to at least give this movie a try. It truly is a creepy and disturbing film that all horror fans should take a look at.",Jeepers Creepers
360,DeadpoolX,"Good, for a while",6,8 May 2003,"For the first hour or so, Jeepers Creepers is an interesting, creepy, even innovative two-person horror chase with an unsettling villain and several genuinely unnerving scenes.  After the Creeper discards his hat and coat and his true nature is revealed, however, it quickly falls apart.  The monster suit may be well-designed, but it just isn't that sort of movie, and the truck-driving, bat-winged, trenchcoat-clad Creeper is far more disturbing when seen in the half-light of a cornfield at night, or the shade of a tree outside a rotting church, than he is in full view during the finale inside the police station.

I know some people commenting are turned of by what they consider stupid moves by the characters. Oh come on. It's a horror movie. What kind of movie would you have if everything happened in a logical and expedient manner? Why must the characters do certain things?! Because it's a horror movie and you have to do stuff to keep it going. Anyway, I'd highly recommend this movie. I particularly love the ending. I think it's great.

I can agree with what basically everyone else is saying. It starts off well, but quickly enters the ""laughing at the film"" genre rather than the ""laughing with the film and being genuinely scared"" genre...leaves a lot to be desired.A couple of niggles to give you an idea. The truck hits the back of the car ( serious damage you might think) - cut to the camera shot showing the car from behind swerving all over the road - Look! the car is un damaged and repeat three times...( I mean the film then shows exactly the same footage of truck hitting rear of car and then rear of car swerving - undamaged ) car subsequently smashes through a farm fence and into a field, resultant damage to car, is one broken headlamp lense.Then from the field they decide to go back to the church.  The sun is starting to set in the sky... they arrive at the church five minutes later in the middle of the afternoon with the sun high in the sky!As for a lot of people saying it has a good ending, well I'm sorry I must have missed it, for me it was quite predictable and hardly inspiring. What's this about it being the scariest movie in ten years?(on the trailer) and the name dropping of Francis Ford Coppola, he was only an executive producer - which means he got paid a lot of money just so they could put his name in the titles and use his name in the trailer.2/10",Jeepers Creepers

The Creeper is definitely among the best horror characters from me.After a very intense first half, the film tends to fall apart in the second.

The characters were strong, with good acting from the two main parts as well. The story was clever and creepy, you got a sense of dread building from the moment that truck showed up behind them. The suspense was excellently built throughout the film.The thing that let it down was the ending. It was building up to a big finish, maybe some sort of stand off, I really wasn't sure what to expect. In the end it was a let down. They just let Jeepers Creepers fly off.

The script writers obviously thought of a decent start and then couldn't think of where to go next so they decide to bring in a flying creature which causes havoc every 20 years or so.I personally think the only scary films are ones that have a slight possibility of happening and that if possible you should never see what is scaring everyone. This film starts off quite well and the suspense starts to build, only for you to find out a monster is at the root of it, none of the residents seem surprised this monster comes back every few years either. I think if i lived where it is set id be slightly concerned by the occasional visits of the flying beast.To sum up, this had a good start and then the director takes it down the wrong route, id rather have the bubonic plague then watch this again. 3 out of 10.",Jeepers Creepers

Sad to say that this movie was not a stitch (no pun intended!) on some of the other movies in its genre.  It was so awful, it made ""I Still Know What You Did Last Summer"" a perfect ""10 out of 10"" movie in comparison.  The plot had gaping holes (and I mean *gaping*), the ghoulie menacing the main characters was some lame hybrid of every teen horror movie killer and there were so many cliched moments that the majority of ""terrifying"" moments just fell (and felt) flat.  The most annoying part of the entire movie was the last twenty minutes of the film - a ""showdown"" between the main characters.  You keep thinking that maybe the film will get better if you watch it for another five minutes, but it only gets worse and worse.   However, kudos must be given to the two main actors, Gina Phillips (Trish) and Justin Long (Darry).  Their ability to convey fear (especially Long) was truly convincing. They did their best with a very mediocre script, and brought an air of believability to what is otherwise a dog of a movie.",Jeepers Creepers
370,HarmenB,Where's the inspiration?,5,11 February 2002,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** This movie is only for those people who expect a 'simple popcorn flick' with some creepy moments and some laughs. Even then the problem is that those two ingredients only occur in the first half of the movie. There are some funny conversations with wise-ass remarks between the two protagonists, which can look familiar for those who have a brother or sister. Also, there was even a gloomy sense of doom to be felt at times. The second half is just too stupid for words. The actions of the protagonists are often too unlogical, the (forgettable) events don't contribute to the story and atmosphere, a unnecessary character is being introduced... Now, one hour after watching this flick, I'm thinking that the writer a) faced a killing deadline, c) let somebody else write the 1st or last half of the movie, or b) loses his inspiration very quickly during the writing process. *BUT*, maybe that this is a failed attempt to create something like a cliffhanger for the sequel. ***SPOILER ALERT!*** That would somewhat redeem the bad ending, which I think a simple popcorn flick shouldn't have. I like bad endings, but not in this movie. It seems like nowadays every untalented director can make a crappy-but-hyped teen movie and get too much $$$ for it.

It gets VERY tense when the boy falls down the hole, gets horrific when he finds a still alive mutilated victim and builds really well from there with them being pursued by this mysterious figure. Unfortunately once the monster is revealed as the usual 'Demon'it goes downhill fast into the usual kids and cannon fodder extras vs invincible Demon/monster standard fare. It goes further downhill with the introduction of the stereotypical 'psychic' figure, which may have been an effective way of increasing the tension if she'd appeared before it all kicked off, but doesn't really add much suspense when all hell has already broken loose.Watch it for the 1st half which is great, but shame they couldn't finish the job or we'd be talking about a classic.",Jeepers Creepers

I went through as much pain as any of the characters who bit the big one in this flick. As I came to imdb.com to complain about this terrible monstrosity of a movie, I realized that right there on the main details page was a comment of, ""Terrific, sharp and surprising"".  The only surprise I witnessed was the ratio of people who walked out to the number of people I thought were going to walk out.  Sharp?  About as sharp as a dull, dull pencil.  The characters engage in long, endless drones of conversation ABOUT NOTHING AT ALL!  At various points in the movie I wished they would be killed instantaneously because they were extremely annoying. Plot, anyone?  Nope, none at all.  Plot hole?  Now, we're talking about the whole movie, which turned out to be one big plot hole.  *SPOILERS AHEAD* The church burned down supposedly, but there they are at the end, in the basement again.  And where did the bad guy come from?  Why only the twenty third summer for only twenty-three days?  Where did the van come from, why is it so fast?  Why did I not walk out of this movie?  What the hell is the killer supposed to be?  Why can the killer be run over to deformation, not to mention being blown away by a double-barrel shotgun, but handguns do nothing?

Within minutes I was gripped by the mysterious and quite scary atmosphere created when we first encounter the rusty old pick-up. I even jumped when rats left the pipe by the church. By the time they reached the cafe I was engrossed in the film. However from then on the film went down hill. The bat-thing killed the police by flying onto their car and pulling them out through the windows and even the roof. At this point I asked myself how come it doesn't do that to the teenagers? The bat-thing could have also killed them at the old woman's house and the police station. That really ruined the film. It just didn't fit in with the other actions of the monster. Not only that but the police station scene was poorly done. Little tension was built up and the ending was poor. Furthermore too many questions were left unanswered e.g. how did the women learn about the bat-thing, where did see come from? Or how long has this been going on and why did the bodies have stitches through their chests, after all the monster only wanted tongues and eyes?

391,jasonblack_123,"Very impressed, very innovative",8,11 January 2016,"For years I had heard nothing but mediocre things about this movie. A few nights ago I watched it and was pleasantly surprised and impressed. This movie terrified me, chilled me right to the bone, and not many horror movies do that to me. From the early shot of the Creeper's truck coming into frame and slowly into focus at speed seen through the windshield (One of the coolest and most innovative shots ever I think) to the ending, Jeepers Creepers has a lot to offer.The biggest thing for me was both the premise and the ending. The premise is actually very unique and is absolutely petrifying when you think about it. An inhuman monster luring people off the highway to eat their body parts and keep their bodies in a dirty, grimy lair, that is just pant-wettingly terrifying. And the ending especially impressed me.*SPOILERS AHEAD*At first glance it appears that the filmmakers are going to phone it in and give us the standard climax (The cops shooting and/or blowing up the Creeper and saving the two protagonists) and that is what I was gearing myself up for. Fortunately, the filmmakers were a little bit more imaginative and went with the ending we got. Honestly, it's a struggle for me to remember a movie that has a more bleaker ending than Jeepers Creepers does. The sheer finality of it all, the helplessness of the psychic character (who wasn't killed, surprisingly) and the disillusioned look of the sister all play a big part in this. And I've often wondered what it would be like to see the sister having to return home and explain to her parents what has happened to her brother, that's how much you can get invested in these characters. Is it a perfect movie? No, not at all but is it enjoyable and a breath of fresh air? I believe so.Highly recommend this one!!",Jeepers Creepers

Dahhhhhhhhhhhhh dahhh dahh dah DAHHHHHHHHHHHHH....DUMB.Victor Salva's writing skills are best witnessed in the movie POWDER.It shocks me he had to stoop very low to scrape this screen-play from the bottom of the barrel - literally.The dialogue does not equal that of any kid I ever hung around with EVER!!!By the way - the creature DOES look like FREDDY. Are y'all BLIND? Guess so. Anyway, the only reason I watched this is because of the relief of commercials.This is teen fodder, lame brain fodder.

It wasn't cheesy; it didn't have mindless killings; it didn't have mindless sex. It was a story with some thought put into it. It was original from what I know. Not a whatever remake. And I really don't get the people who will give this a one star, talking about the actors or the script. Really, I didn't know we had sooo many expert script writers and actors on IMDb? The actors acted and the script was fine. You even had some person talking about that this is not how brothers and sisters act in real life. In what world this person is living in? I don't know. Some brothers and sisters are sometimes friends in real life just in case some people didn't know that. They had good and dark humor. It was at the same time serious. And yes it was really scary and the end was epic. And the brother and sister type horror movie was a change. Not a group of boyfriends and girlfriends who start doing naughty things and then bam he comes the boogie man. Like I said this movie is original. That is why I give this a 10 out of 10.",Jeepers Creepers
394,jakeev67,above average horror film,8,23 April 2006,"Let's face it, Jeepers Creepers wasn't meant to be a masterpiece. But in terms of creepiness and originality, Director Victor Salva definitely came up with a wicked little gem that despite some of it's flaws, still becomes one of those horror films that get you thinking.A brother/sister combo are driving through rural country when they see what looks like a transient throwing bodies in a sink hole.What they find out later is that the murderer turns out to be an ancient demon that only lives for 23 days every 23 years.But in those 23 days, it feeds it's insatiable hunger on the surrounding citizens.Good news is, the ""Creeper"" is a discriminate killer, only going after certain humans it ""smells"" out and of course killing those that try to get out of it's way.The stunning ending shows you why the demon relentlessly chases after the hero's.Veteran actresses Eileen Brennan and Patricia Belcher were thrown into the cast in different scenarios: Brennan got one of the creepier scenes as the ""Cat Lady"" whom the hero's come in contact with on the lam from the Creeper. But Belcher is overwhelmingly annoying as the psychic Jezelle, who sheds light on what the killer is after.The plot is uneven at times, but for sheer horror, Jeepers Creepers often delivers the goods.",Jeepers Creepers

But. But what is it with those movies that they ALWAYS seem to melt down at the ending?! They start of great, setting the mood, genuinely creepy... but after the first half, the writers seem to run out of steam. And I really dislike to see brothers and sisters in a movie like this. First of all, they always seem to argue, even when their lives are at stake or when one of them is about to get into really big trouble. I have a brother and I've been a teenage girl, but if something like this would have happened to us, I wouldn't have been arguing with him! I would take a hold of his arm and not let him go until we were both safely at home. I would NEVER let him go of on his own and if he would fall into a scary dark pit, I'd jump in after him without a doubt. Second of all... Well, I don't really want to give away the ending, but... Alright: SPOILER AHEAD!!!!!!!!!Though the ending of this movie is (for American-movie standards)pretty daring, I didn't like to watch it one bit. Being a big sister meself I mean.

It looked like a Saturday night, turn the brain off kinda thing, so I went along expecting a cheezy teen horror film.What I really got knocked my socks off.  The opening half hour is harrowing, knowingly tipping its hat to movies such as The Hills Have Eyes or Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  And the best way it does that is to get us into the heads of the two lead characters.  They may not be likeable or perfect, but they are real.  So when they find themselves in trouble, you're scared with them.And when you find out eventually who's chasing them, even though it requires a big leap of faith, you take it.Any prospective film makers out there should watch this movie.

402,Blackavaar,Good beginning become total clap trap by the end,2,15 September 2006,"The beginning of this film had me very intrigued. The whole opening with the crows and the rusty killer's truck was great. Though I did have a problem with the part where the kid slides down into the killer's lair. He had just seen the killer dump a body into the same pipe and drive off and yet when he falls in he doesn't land on them (as he should) and the body is neatly layed up on a table (who the hell moved it?). The lair itself was very creepy and gave a feeling of dread as you realize this killer has been doing this for decades at the very least. But then they get to town and the whole movie turns to crap when the goofy psychic is introduced. ""I keep hearing this song while one of you is screaming (hey dumb psychic was it a male scream or a female one, they vary quite a bit). He wants one of you but I don't know which one. Then the killer turns out to be some creature with demon wings who eats parts of people to repair himself? What? How the hell does that work? He eats a heart, chewing it and everything and somehow it works perfectly when it arrives in his chest? Here's an idea, when writing a horror story remember to put some damn realism into your cheesy plot. It makes it easier to suspend disbelief if there is a feeling that it could be real.I'm not going to go all into it but other than the first 10-15 minutes I hated this film. The whole concept of the creature became totally idiotic by the time it was totally explained. And the ending... ergh... why would this creature carve out the entire back of the skull and remove the brain if he only wanted the eyes? Oh, he wouldn't. The director just wanted the creature to look through the face like a mask for the end scene is all. It makes no sense and is totally idiotic.

I should have known this movie was going to suck when the opening credits rolled on for what felt like a good 10 minutes...that car just keeps driving and driving and driving....and for some reason whenever these two kids feel like investigating a dark lurid place they turn the car off, and sure enough every time bat-boy comes flying out TA-DA! The car won't start. Every Single Time.In all honesty I only have myself to blame, I mean despite the fact that this movie is titled ""Jeepers Creepers,"" which should be adequate warning for a crappy movie to begin with, I still went. The acting is horrid, the directing is horrid, the script is horrid, the soundtrack is horrid, basically the only thing not horrid was the bat-boy super killer thing; it looked like a pile of dead leaves in a trench coat.If you truly have an unquenchable desire to see a movie which contains the words ""jeepers"" and ""creepers"" in the title, skip this and jump straight to the sequel.

The movie starts out making you think the killer is a certain psychotic serial killer without being too unique other than his 'beat' up old truck (a nice touch).  The tag reads 'beatngu' and he follows and terrifies two young sibling characters.  Each is played quite well and interact with each other convincingly. Other than the usual and ridiculous 'Don't go down the deep dark hole held only by your feet'-type scenes in the film where you have to wonder who in the world would do that.  The majority of the movie was fascinating, edge-of-your-seat horror; for all who love a great scare. I can't say much more without telling too much.

The reason the movie is scary is that it is the classical boogey man character and you can actually picture yourself as either in the role of the brother or sister.The visual effects ane not the greatest but the movie relies on the viewers imagination by using darkly lit scenes.The ending is a bit of a letdown and makes the movie look average.

The movie starts out with about 30 minutes of a boring conversation in a car between a boy and his sister. This may have been the best part of the movie. The characters make so many unrealistic actions, that you wonder if they have become senile at age 25.

419,Sandro-LN,A new addition to a clichéd genre.,2,7 February 2002,"I saw the review on the main page for this movie claiming that Jeepers Creepers had a great script, and that the movie was full of surprises.  I couldn't disagree more.As I was watching the film I knew that I had to review it here because it was so bad.  In fact I had so many complaints that I grabbed a notebook and pencil.  Regrettably, I think I still missed numerous flaws in the movie, but this will have to do.  In order to review this as well as possible, I'm going to have to give away some SPOILERS, but I won't tell you everything (as though you couldn't guess it anyway.)The lead-in to the movie is a brother and sister on a road trip home.  I'm thankful for their relationship as it is, because at least we avoided the ""evil monster killing the couple after they have sex"" bit.  Unfortunately, we weren't able to escape the ""faceless driver in a speedy vehicle"" that has been done numerous times over.  And, of course, the truck appears to be a dilapidated rust-bucket, but it can still go faster than anything else on the road.  After being rammed by it a few times, Trish (Gina Phillips) and Darry (Justin Long) see the truck shortly afterwards on the side of the road, the yet faceless drive shoving a body-shaped object down a pipe. Rather than report the suspicious behavior, they have to go inspect the scene after being totally run off the road by ""The Creeper.""This is where the clichés start to overwhelm the viewer.  Firstly, there is the overly-curious brother who just has to get a closer look at everything, and that includes him having his sister hold his legs while he crawls down the pipe a bit.  Naturally he falls in (of course!) but not before his sister tells him that he's acting like a person in a Scary Movie, doing something stupid.  Speaking for myself, I'm tired of actors in scary movies commenting to each other how their behavior is just like people in scary movies.  Scream and Scary Movie parodied it enough, let it be!Darry sees some things down in the cellar of the Church he's under, and they're naturally so disturbing that he's shocked into silence for the next few scenes.  Although his terror is over the top, let me just say ""thank God"" that I didn't have to listen to anymore sappy dialogue during that time.  Darry and his dear sis Trish finally come to a Diner where the local yokels stare at them as the new curiosity of the moment.  Trish pleads with the waitress to call the police, but instead of saying ""we think there has been a murder"" which would get her to the phone right away she has to be mysterious and unrevealing saying ""please"" more than once and merely alluding to some distress.Enter the requisite sage.  While waiting for the waitress to call the cops, the payphone next to Darry and Trish starts ringing.  They have to stare blankly at it for 5 or 6 rings and be asked ""are you going to get that"" by a patron before picking it up, because otherwise we the audience might not feel their sense of discontent and apprehension.  Just answer the damn phone!!  On the other end is the sage.  In keeping with tradition we don't see her face, but it is a woman and she's a minority as suggested by the American Indian Dream Catcher.  She's also probably a bit overweight - later confirmed when we actually see her - but in order to maintain whatever suspense he can get, director Victor Salva leaves her somewhat anonymous for this scene.  Although she is the Woman With The Answers, her character again holds to cinematic tradition by speaking in a manner that reveals NOTHING to the audience or the characters: simply put she talks as though everyone knows what's going on.The action by this point isn't really action.  It's moments of suspenseful pauses and pointless dialogue and it doesn't get much better later in the movie.  There is also the ceaseless yelling which seems to be unavoidable in today's movies - if someone isn't screaming or whispering they're probably not saying anything important, right?  The next cliché I'll mention is the Car That Won't Start.  It pops up at least twice in this movie, augmented by a poor transmission that always seems to jam up when it's needed the most. How un-surprising.I've got a few more points to cover, but I'll spare you them all and cut to ""The Creeper.""  I don't think you'll be surprised to learn that it's not human.  Given that premise, you're forced as a viewer to accept whatever model of monster the writer gives you, and this one happens to be something that is biologically impossible by any earthly standards.  In order to breathe, the Creeper eats human lungs.  Nothing in nature works that way (at least on a level as complex as human physiology) so now the monster has to either be magical or unworldly.  To me, that strips whatever credibility the movie had left.  Leave the aliens to Star Wars, and the magic to Lord of the Rings.  Please.There's so much more that I want to tear into, but I fear that this review has become long enough.  I'll leave you with my rating: 2 out of 10, and I was considering dropping it to 1 of 10.",Jeepers Creepers

What's even worse is the fact I paid good money to see this film with a mate. To be honest I knew what I was letting myself in for as I only went to see it because my friend wanted to. For all those people who actually like this film a question for you WHY!!?!? The first main area I'm going to address is the ""homage"" to ""Duel"" which is so eloquently written by another IMDB user. I have to say that I haven't laughed so hard in a long time at how awfully bad this was directed. For anybody who had seen Duel will know that Spielberg's major debut is a suspenseful film which is more than can be said for this travesty of film-making. The acting like with any horror film is never oscar material but for this the characters were so wooden and lifeless you didn't care whether they were killed or not. Overall this is of miniscule interest and just goes to show that all Hollywood studios are after is money which is even more evident now that the originally titled Jeepers Creepers 2 is out soon.",Jeepers Creepers

Plow forward at your own risk.I don't usually watch horror movies, but I had no choice but to watch this on the charter bus as there was not much else to do.  Although the demon was pretty cool looking and I liked when Derri shouted ""INBREEDING,"" the rest of the movie was pretty damn terrible.  Somehow it didn't seem right that Joel, Tom, and Crow weren't in front of it.Unnecessarily gory and disgusting, this movie didn't scare me, only grossed me out.  The two main characters are complete idiots.  Yes, let's crawl down this dank and stinky tunnel in front of the abandoned old church with dozens of crows roosting on it; that sounds like a good idea.  Nothing else to do. I guess they never stopped to think that there would be an unstoppable demon (who really loves old jazz) who's after their sight organs storing his junk down there.After they've seen a pit crammed with mutilated corpses and were almost run over by a psycho-piloted truck, you'd think they would listen to the wise old lady giving warnings over the phone.  But, no, they just curse at her and get some hapless cops to help them.  It's not really the cops' fault, though, as those idiot kids should have just driven on home and reported the guy, who, although he's a sadistic creature from Hell, has a convenient, easy-to-remember vanity license plate.And, I'm sorry, but the male lead looks incredibly stupid when he's scared. A few minutes into the movie me and my friend couldn't help but burst into giggles every time he put on that thin-faced, poochy lipped, bug-eyed stare.I wonder what the musical selection will be in the sequel? Perhaps the demon will pick up prostitutes to the tune of Cab's ""Minnie the Moocher,"" or graft farm animal parts onto the kids while jamming to ""A Chicken Ain't Nothing But A Bird.""

423,Threeman,ABYSMAL,1,8 April 2002,"This is an unforgivably poor addition to the horror stable, and I'm stupefied that it has enjoyed such commercial success.  Granted, a judicious, omnipresent marketing campaign successfully duped a lot of punters, myself included, but does bad word-of-mouth count for nothing these days?  How is it that this unsightly, over-hyped juggernaut continues to bulldoze its way through the high-street stores, commanding premium shelf-space?  I noticed a few other dissenting voices on these pages, but I feel we may be too few and too late in our mission to prevent this rubbish raking in further undeserved millions.The movie begins with an inspirational ten or so minutes of tension-building, and promptly commits narrative suicide.  Jettison mystery and suspense, replace with comically illogical character behaviour.  Good move.  Hint at an unseen, unspeakable evil, then promptly substitute with the most ill-conceived, laughable creature in a rubber mask.  An even better move.  Trade all subtlety for trashy, in your face clichés.  Sprinkle liberally with an utterly stupid, gimmicky plot device involving the film's title.  What genius.It's precisely because JEEPERS CREEPERS hints at greatness in a fleeting, opening salvo, only to undergo a bewildering change of direction, that it deserves all this vilification.  It shouldn't have happened like this.  And you shouldn't have to watch it.  There are so many other horror movies out there more deserving of your time, and that includes a myriad straight-to-video-hell numbers wallowing at the bottom of your local store's bargain bucket.",Jeepers Creepers

The initial minutes take elements from other a number of road movies. The key strength of the movie is the Creeper himself.The creation; The Creeper is unlike many horror creations - he/it is actually scary. Compare the Creeper to Jason, Freddie, the wishmaster etc etc - No contest. Is he a demon, a devil or a fallen angel ?Every 23 years he feasts for 23 days, and takes the parts of his victims he wants.

It must've had a supercharger under that giant hood, not to mention 3 or 4 locomotive air horns. What year was that wreck built? When in the past did they use demonic milk trucks anyway? Wouldn't you notice a truck like that cruising the roads where you live? Especially if people kept disappearing on a regular basis. How bad are the local police? Oh wait, that question gets answered in the movie.The best scene is when cat crazy granny cracks the annoying brother in the jewels with the shotgun, makes me laugh out loud every time.The sister is hot, the brother is annoying and stupid.

You get a clue that the filmmaker knows better from some scenes but yet fails to deliver in some. It has good moments but yet it's also very cliché'. It looks and feels like an old horror film. The slow set up is interesting too. There are a few weird and strange moments but it seems that the film stops itself and doesn't flow with the momentum. I found that usual but interesting. And ""that thing"" is just weird. I'm glad the filmmaker is not afraid to make a film about it.",Jeepers Creepers

What Mr Coppola was thinking attaching his name to not one, but two of these films, is beyond me. I am someone who is fairly sensitive to scary films; so when my girlfriend suggested hiring this, and on the cover (UK) it has ""will give you nightmares for weeks"" I was really apprehensive and ready to be scared. And the beginning of the film is good, hence the 3 stars I've given it - but oh my, once the two main stars (who frankly look so stupid as to be worthy of slaying - remove them from the gene pool, please) reach the diner, the scariest parts of the film are over. As another reviewer has written, horror works best when you can imagine the incidents occurring in real life. In this film, any semblance of credibility is long, long gone before the final third starts; and it ends - thankfully quickly - in a flurry of illogical and badly-acted scenes. Only scary if you are in your early teens and still half-afraid of the bogeyman under your bed.",Jeepers Creepers
429,sonicred007,Great horror tale with lots of scares,8,28 December 2011,One for the genre heads ... this is pure horror with a beast of unknown origins and a provenance explained during the movie. Leave your plausibility hat at home - it'll only ruin the escapist pleasures of it. I particularly liked the repetitive use of the Jeepers Creepers theme tune ... gets scarier every time you hear it. Dialogue is sharp and simple lampooning of rural cops/people is avoided - creating a real world you can believe in while fearing the monster in the dark. Why it's chasing the brother and sister hero combo we're never quite sure? Somewhere between the urban legends of the vanishing hitchhiker and missing boyfriend. Loved it,Jeepers Creepers
430,Hushpuppy_20,Like the X-Files only bad,5,6 September 2001,"Jeepers Creepers was a waste of time and money. The monster in this film looks to me like a bad X-Files reject and his overall stupidity made me laugh more than anything else. How could ANYONE be stupider than the two teenage leads? Sure that can be fun in its own hokey way but after the 30th time one teen looked at the other and said ""Let's get out of here!"" I was just annoyed by they're wide-eyed fake terror. The final nail in the coffin of this bloated corpse of a film had to be the over-acting psychic. Yes, there was a psychic. Mainly this characters only purpose was to fill in the plot holes, and she did this poorly. To fill this films plot holes you would need the films writer/director setting next to you explaining things too you as you watched step by step, and we all know how annoying THAT can be. Skip ""Jeepers Creepers"" unless you are a gore fan, which this film delivers in buckets. Stick with a SMART horror film like ""The Others"". The only way I would recommend this film is if you snuck in the back way. I hope since ""Creepers"" was #1 we might see another horror film revival, but I pray that the next promising horror film doesn't turn out to be a piece of trash like this.",Jeepers Creepers
431,Hushpuppy_20,This mess should have been an X-Files episode.,5,3 September 2001,"------------SPOILERS---------------------------------- WARNING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS Jeepers Creepers could have been a great movie. It had all the ingredients early on. A cool scary song ala ""Mr. Sandman"" in ""Halloween"", a psycho hillbilly vibe, a creepy scarecrow monster. Then they had to add in the psychic old woman, the special effects that were not all that special, and the worst gimmick in modern horror history. Get this. Whenever something bad is going to happen the song ""Jeepers Creepers"" plays beforehand. I dig the song but why not just put it in the background for atmosphere? Probably the worst part of ""Jeepers Creepers"" was that it was not believable, even by horror standards. At least in old horror films like ""Friday The 13th"" the kids were stuck out in the woods and stalked like animals. In this film the clueless teens nearly get killed by the movies monster early on, only to go back to his house to find out if it was really bodies he was throwing down that sewer? Hmmm, I wonder? Next one teen ends up falling into the sewer! He sends his sis for help, and darn it she gets chased by the killer too. They survive this and end up in town where no one will believe they're CrAzY story. Do they ever? They just know the killer is after them! Rather than driving away or calling the FBI these two decide two local cops should follow them out to the killers house AGAIN! Jeepers creepers! Two deaths, one via decapitation, later the teens are on the run again. Then they are with the cops again. Then they are attacked again. The monster in this film had so many chances to just pick these two off so many times it is hard to find him scary. Even the over-acting psychic couldn't save these two clueless morons. If either of these two had been in a GOOD horror film they both would have been dead by the time the concession stand closed down. How many times in this film did one of the wide-eyed teens look at the other and say ""LETS GET OUT OF HERE!""? That was what I was thinking after about an hour of this film, which feels long at 90 minutes. For this to have been a scary movie it should have been the teens against the monster. Period. They didn't need the 45 extras or Madame Cleo's granny to explain all the plotholes. The monster should have been a crazy cannable hillbilly and not the lame mutant winged monkey he turned out to be. WHY DID HE HAVE WINGS??? Even the creepy ""twist"" ending was predictable. Let me give you a hint, the killer needs human body parts to survive and the song goes ""Jeepers Creepers Where'd you get those EYES!"". If you are like me and hate gorey mess films like this stay away from ""Jeepers Creepers"". Something tells me ""Jeepers Creepers in the hood"" isn't far off!",Jeepers Creepers

437,DrKnow,Never saw it coming!!,8,25 September 2001,"I went into this movie, primarily because the friend that I was with had seen everything else.  I am SO glad that he's such a movie geek!!! Jeepers Creepers was fantastic!!I love movies, but most of all I love creepy, thrillers.  Unfortunately most of the time I have to be satisfied with brief moments of suspense, because quality thrillers are so rare.  This movie had me on the edge of my seat for the first 45 minutes, and highly interested for the other 45.  I haven't felt such tention in a theater since the first time that I saw the ""Blair Witch Project"".  JC gave me the type of fear that I haven't felt since I was a child watching ""American Werewolf in London"".  And I can't believe that it came from ""Jeepers Creepers""!!!""Jeepers Creepers"" is basically the story of 2 siblings traveling home from school for the holiday.  Of course they decide to take the long way home, on the mostly deserted highway.  Unfortunately for them it's not completely deserted.  They meet up with a freak show villain, and spend the next hour and a half (movie time)running for their lives.First of all, this movie was great because it involved a brother/sister team.  No love interest, no sexual tension, but rather a brother and sister fighting for one another.  Gina Philips and Justin Long(from tv's Ed) play Trish and Darry, sister and brother in big, BIG trouble.  It was a really nice change from what we always see.Secondly, I was thrilled because the writer/director (Victor Salva) understands that sometimes what we don't see is scarier than what we do. For the first 45 minutes when the tention was strongest, we don't quite see into the villain's truck, or he's just a little too far away to see clearly. We are scared by our own imaginations, and by the horrific sounds created by the creeper's truck.  That was when this movie was at its best.Unfortunately about half way through this movie, good ol' Victor seemed to forget this philosophy, and the energy diminishes as we see and understand more and more of the villain.  Too bad, this movie could have been amazing.I admit that there are holes in this movie, like ""what's with the 23rd days and the 23rd years, but ultimately the holes don't matter.  This is the type of movie that you see for atmosphere and tention, not plot and cohesiveness. Because of that, this movie was fantastic..It was way more than I was expecting.  I thought that the central characters were just fine, and the direction was great.  He used sounds and unknowns, rather than special effects and explosions.  Nicely done, I just wish he'd been reminded about half way through to stay with it.  He was on his was to creating a horror classic!!Oh well, it was 45 minutes of more fear than I have experienced in a long, long, time.  Another 45 minutes of solid entertainment, and an ending that had the nerve to stay true to the rest of the film.  I was really good, and I never saw THAT coming!!",Jeepers Creepers
438,TVvuer69,Good little horror flick,7,23 December 2002,"I missed Jeepers Creepers when it came out in the theaters, so I eventually spotted it on the DVD shelf at the video store.  The synopsis on the box pack piqued my interest, so I took it home thinking it would be similar to the numerous Freddy and Jason movies that have dominated the horror genre for the last 20 years (I'm sure it's been that long!).  Anyway, the movie starts off with brother and sister driving home from college when they spot a burly figure of a person dumping what seems to be a covered up dead body down a drain.  They keep going but Darius (the brother) becomes increasingly concerned that the person covered by the sheet may only be injured and would certainly die if they do nothing.  His sister Trish, however, wants to keep going out of fear that intervening could lead to dire consequences as it would in most horror movies (a good reference they've been watching them at least).  Of course, they turn back and Darry climbs (then falls) down the drain to find not only the person wrapped in a sheet, but a few other victims as well.  Brother and sister eventually find their way out to look for the nearest sheriff, only to be pursued and nearly run off the road by the large figure in a huge truck.  The two eventually make it to a small town to report their findings to the sheriff's office, but a series of incidents make it certain they have company (the wrong kind of course!).  They find their car broken into and Darry's dirty clothes strung out all over the ground.  It's a sure bet now whatever's pursuing them has the characteristics of a bloodhound, with the likelihood it has Darry's scent down pat.  Brother and sister later get help from a woman who's in tune with the supernatural, telling them what's hunting them down.  No matter what they throw at it though (like running it down with their car several times), it keeps coming for more until it gets its target.  The two fight valiantly until the very end, which I thought was tragic.  Yep, for once I was actually sympathetic for what happened. Frankly, I hope they don't do a sequel since it was a pretty good movie.  To do so would certainly ""jump the shark"" as with what's already happened with the Jason and Freddy franchises.",Jeepers Creepers

There is little that can be said without spoiling the plot for people, so I will just put it this way: the degree to which the 'killer' is superhuman/supernatural is just too much.  It takes away from the thriller aspect of the film.  When you walk back to your car after the movie, or into your basement to do laundry later, you will not fear that this killer could be waiting for you in the darkness, unlike the feeling you may get after ""Halloween"", ""Silence of the Lambs"", or ""insert your favorite good horror movie here"".Also, the end was awful.  Just as it seems that we are about to start a bit of an adventure, it ends.  Many questions are left unanswered.  When you combine all of this with some huge problems with the plot. 
I should note that I am easily pleased by horror movies, so for me to say negative things is unusual.  However, if you like these films, go see it anyway.  The ravens were cool, at least.",Jeepers Creepers

And the story could have been a lot better.The performance of the two leads (Justin Long & Gina Phillips, I think) was adequate, but the characters themselves are too annoying for the views to care for them.  Funny how Trish in the movie commented what Darry did was ""stupid things people in scary movie do"", and throughout the entire movie you have to watch the siblings acting stupid.  Really, to be stunned by horror on first encounter was one thing, but standing still for every single encounter was painful to watch.Minor spoiler---This movie certainly did not meet my expectations.  Yet I did find the part where the creepers walk in front of the car was awfully funny as he looked so much like a Darth Maul clone... and probably that's about the only part in the movie which I found funny.Kinmui",Jeepers Creepers

The beginning of the movie was a bit slow and completely unbelievable, but not terrible.  As the movie progressed, things went downhill from there very quickly!  The dialogue was ridiculous and clichéd, as were the characters and the plot.  I couldn't believe anything that was happening and everyone in the audience including myself was burst out in laughter and disbelief many times because of the sheer absurdity of what we were watching. I can't believe anyone would make a film that is so incredibly horrible.  Sitting through that movie was torture, except for the hilarity that came from the ridiculous moments.  It makes no sense, has a horrible ending, and makes me want to cry, scream, and tear my skin off just thinking about it.

[you fill in this gap with something especially disappointing you've experienced recently].  I must admit, I was a little bored with the Sixth Sense near the end and I forgave the entire film (and gave it 9) after the revelation, so I didn't want to write off Jeepers Crappers until it finished, and was actually expecting a really good ending, since FFC was involved.  Needless to say, I was very shocked when the creature just b**gered off with Darry and the film's pace dropped like something very heavy and then ended about five minutes later.I don't know why Coppola admitted to being involved in this pile of steaming cow dung.  I thought Scary Movie 2 was bad, but it definitely bettered this one.  Anyone who can't see The Blair Witch Project is infinitely superior to this rubbish needs their lungs and eyes removed.Do not see this!

After that, when you 'sort of' get to know what Jeepers Creepers is, switch off or turn to a Jerry Springer show - you'll probably be better off.The youthful couple start off as believable, even though the kid does suggest to go back to certain place, which, to my mind, was ludicrous thinking on his part and also slightly unreal.

The plot is so contrived that it drifts into a new element ever five minutes.  It seems as if the budget ran out and the last half-hour of the movie is spent wrapping up the beginning.However, the movie shares the same elements of classic 50's horror films.

Actually I think there was only one real thing I enjoyed about it and that was the license plate.  BEATINGU.  Took me about a minute and a half to figure out it said B EATING U.  I admit I was slow on the uptake but it kept me interested for that minute and a half.It was very hard to keep focused on the film itself.  I found the plot boring.  The fiend as scary as the demon of the week on Buffy The Vampire Slayer.  The tune was as old as the dinosaurs.  I just really couldn't get into the film.

I thought the only mildly spooky scene was the last one, which I won't describe as not to spoil the ending. I will say that it was somewhat unexpected, but not that big of a twist either. Critical words aside, I didn't intensely dislike the movie either. It was just a typical horror movie like I saw as a kid.

455,Squeaky-Voiced-Teen,Blob,7,3 January 2006,"Jeepers Creepers is a collection of clichés, shamelessly stitched together (no pun intended) to form an unorthodox horror movie. Everything you ever saw in every horror movie you will see in Jeepers Creepers. But, here's the catch: It works. I don't know if it's the characters, the setting, the dialog or maybe even directing that saved this movie but something did. The first half-hour is nothing short of scary but it slows down at about the last half-hour.The movie is about a brother and sister driving home for spring-brake. On the road a creepy old van nearly kills them, but they survive, later on they see the van, and whoever was in it standing by an old church. He's dumping something wrapped, roped in a sheet with red stains on it down a pipe. While doing so he spots the children and chases them. This leading to several scary moments.The most annoying thing about this movie was definitely Jezelle Gay Heartman, a person that lives in the town that the kids end up in. She is quite possibly the most annoying person ever to ruin a picture. She knew all along what was happening but still felt the need to speak in riddles. Very annoying. Anyway, my point is, even though Jeepers hit a few wrong notes, it still makes one of my favorite horrors ever.But i've seen it so often now it can't scare me anymore and i call it ""fluff"": something to keep my peepers busy.",Jeepers Creepers
456,new-spirit-jazz,Now this is an odd movie,6,29 August 2005,"I immediately liked it when I saw the first scene. On some country road that could just about anywhere in America, a car approaches. As it comes closer, you begin to hear dialog between the siblings (as in the rest of the movie, most of it just babbling, some of it quite funny). The scene takes exactly 55 seconds. That's a slow pace, and the movie mostly sticks to that. I really enjoyed that, how many movies dare to be really, really slow these days? In one scene, Trisha looks up into the sky and the camera slowly rises so we look down on her. The fact that she's doing that is pretty gratuitous, but the scene itself, just the way it's done - a pleasure to behold.So Mr. Salva shows off some style here. Minimalist and well done.I also found the acting pretty decent. Unfortunately, that's about the only qualities this movie has. The story is supremely simple, and after a promising introduction, it collapses rapidly. The teens alternatingly try to hunt down or escape from the killer, accompanied by clueless cops and a Matrix oracle replica who Just Can't Stop Talking.The down slide continues until the very end, with a final scene that neither makes much sense nor managed to captivate me in any way (won't spoil it here). I suppose it could have been dramatic had I had any clue why the people on screen did what they did.That's what's so odd about this movie: its unbalancedness. A lot of good workmanship thrown at an utterly ridiculous story.When you go rent it, print out this review and talk the clerk into halving the price because you're only going to watch the first 45 minutes.",Jeepers Creepers

I had never seen it before but the media gave it a good review so I got it oblivious to its contents. If i could give you one word to sum up this film, that word would be terrible! And hears why. The shots are too long, turn off the lights to make it scarier and you would still be falling asleep, the beast couldn't scare my four year old cousin, the car used is constantly stalling, the beast takes too long to simply kill the victims, the theme song is annoying and finally there is no hype to any dramatic scenes. Seriously if anyone reads this then my advice to you is do not purchase this film if you are curious about it. This film is bad, no wait, it's terrible!",Jeepers Creepers
458,ktownpirate01,Save your money!,1,31 August 2001,"The worst part of this film was learning that Francis Ford Coppala wasted his money on it as an executive producer. The acting is a bit contrived, but no worse than what you might find on an bad TV show. No, what kills this film is that it trys to go back to a formula that worked in the 80's. Unfortunately, the teenager making the stupid mistake in this day and age simply doesn't work. The story is quite aweful. Why is this demon around? Why does it eat? What's the deal with the Madame Cleo-ish woman with visions? Why can't these people afford good CGI?All in all, the WORST film to come out in this genre in a long while.",Jeepers Creepers
459,dcarter73,A good film ruined,7,8 November 2001,"I have to admit after reading mixed reviews on this film I prepared myself for a typical teen slasher, and the innevitable feeling on leaving the cinema of being cheated.However I have to admit I was totally engrossed in the film up until a certain point.  There was plenty of suspense, and the kind of energy that films like the TCM (hence the comparison) were renowned for due to the feeling of unease, building tension and fear of the unknown.But then they revealed the 'evil villain' and the whole atmosphere it worked so hard to create was destroyed in seconds.  I'm not saying the film was ruined, just that it went a bit too Stephen King for my liking!  However I'd give an overall 7/10.  Seen better.....but seen a whole lot worse !",Jeepers Creepers

461,davetrave69,NAFFFFF!!!!,2,23 November 2001,"Wow! What a disappointing film. The trailers go on about the scariest American film for ten years and show a shot of an audience jumping in their seats. Well there was one bit which made me jump near the start which was clearly the bit they showed. The film gets one point for that. Then there is the scary lorry chasing them (a la ""Duel"") which was good, one point for that, and that's it!!The film descends into a pathetic story of an inhuman killer (the devil?) and ends on a really low note which is beyond disappointment and boredom. Who says the devil has the best music? On this showing he deffinately doesn't have the best films either! :)Watch it just so you can confidently say it's NAFF and slag it off as any other human of even minor self respect will do.",Jeepers Creepers
462,ecw06,very good but very frustrating,7,18 September 2006,"MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS !well i finally managed to watch this film after years of friends bugging me to go and watch it. i had seen the trailers and thought to myself yeah big deal it just looks like another one of your typical run of the mill teen horror film anyway i swallowed my pride and decided to watch it and to my surprise i absolutely loved it. The way the opening scene was orchestrated with the two leads driving down the highway and then getting terrorised by a truck was absolutely beautiful. There was tension in those opening scenes which i personally don't think has ever been seen since Tobe Hooper's Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE or Sam raimis EVIL DEAD. sadly we don't get suspense like that anymore cos Hollywood seems to think that a great horror is getting pretty people and killing them BORING. So as i was feeling nostalgic for the golden age of suspense/horror the film sadly descended into the all to familiar Hollywood style of horror film making these days. lots of gore but no suspense. Fair enough having a demon that comes alive every 23 years and can only feed for 23 days was different but you need the suspense to make it work instead it just became very frustrating to watch it become another typical teen horror with the two leads screaming, getting lost, gearbox not working, (come on) and etc, etc. all in all a very good but very frustrating film.",Jeepers Creepers

Half way through it I was asking myself if maybe I heard him wrong.Not only is this not a good movie, it barely qualifies as a horror film.  It should be reclassified as a comedy.  The acting was was bad, and the storyline has been overdone.  Can the writers not come up with a new idea for a horror film.  This had Freddy and Jason written all over it and it still managed to incorporate ever cliche' from the more current horror films.

We were teased a little with the background of the two main characters, but did it ever go into it more than that?  Nope.  It may be leaving openings for sequels, but they could've done a little better.  I guess if you don't want to think, just sit there and absorb a simple story then it's okay.

470,KaterinaNV,"Entertaining, but not all that",6,3 December 2002,"I found parts of this movie, mainly the beginning to be very promising. I really thought that it was going to be an 'on the edge of your seat' horror film and the opening had all the tension and weirdness that one needs to set that kind of atmosphere.  But as the movie progressed, even though it never sunk to being bad or even mediocre (no Friday the 13th B.S. here), I think it became a little bit of a disappointment because it didn't live up to the promise that it made in the beginning.  And although I like to let my mind fill in the blanks, there was a lot that went unexplained that made it so that I wasn't really satisfied by the time it finished.  I didn't recognize the names of the actors or the director, and they were neither here nor there for me - that's not to say that I thought the performances were bad, they definitely were fitting and on the mark for the genre.  It's just that they didn't really stick out for me.All of the above being said, if the movie was on cable on a cold winter night, I'd probably relent and watch it again - it's certainly better than most in it's category, but would I recommend it as a 'great' film?

Does anyone remember the original Alien movie, and what made it so scary? Did you see the guy in the rubber suit? No, never, just shadows, movement, etc. That's what the beginning of this movie promised.

473,spotlessmind03,"Tense ""Road Trip Gone Awry"" Slasher Romp",7,11 January 2011,"I really enjoyed ""Jeepers Creepers"", a film that made its mark at the box office during a time when there seemed to be a lot of ""road trips gone wrong"" features churning out from studios. Where normally a group of teens would be stalked by a suitably scary psycho in an isolated country setting, writer/director Victor Salva decides to deceive his audience and go down a much darker, disturbing road.Jumping right into the action, Salva pits a brother (Justin Long) and sassy sister (Gina Phillips) against a maniacal trucker who runs them off the road about five minutes into the film. Just when you've caught your breath, the siblings happen to pass the psycho again, this time spotting him throwing a body down an old pipe next to a decrepit church. It's at this point that (a.) the film is scariest and (b.) the screenplay is smartest. Like Wes Craven's classic ""Scream"", the characters directly reference themselves as being in a horror movie, in an intriguing exchange where they debate whether or not to check out that nasty old church and see if someone's alive, or take a queue from scary movies and just get out of there.Seeing as this IS a scary movie, we all know what they end up doing, and this sets in motion a horrifying chain of events as they become targeted by a monster that's best left to your discovery, viewer, rather than giving away all the fun in this review. What I will let you know is that Salva keeps the film brimming with tension and shocks, right up until the rather clumsy and offbeat ending sequence. ""Jeepers Creepers"" is one of the best examples of that sub genre of road trips gone awry that seems to have been started by the original ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and Salva infuses energetic visual style and imagination into this violent monster movie, even at its most unbelievable moments.",Jeepers Creepers
474,TheVilagentRR,scary but with a bad ending,6,25 May 2011,"This is a really good movie,but the end is a let down. It is really scary the first time watching. The main characters are Justin Long & Gina Phillips. Justin Long is amazing as Darry Jenner. It's just sad that he is killed off at the end. Gina Phillips is good in her part as Darry's sister Trisha Jenner. If you want to watch a truly scary movie,watch this. I would not recommend watching the second Jeepers Creepers though. It is terrible made. Justin Long has a bit part in the second one. The rest of the cast is terrible,the script is terrible. They are making a third one,it doesn't come out till 2013! So fans have a long wait. I read that some other people wish Justin hadn't have been killed off too. Then there were some who thought he was a gay (not literately) actor. I definitely think he is a great actor.",Jeepers Creepers

So time passed and when I was about 12-13 years old, I got to see it finally. I don't know if it was because I was just a kid but I couldn't sleep alone that night, and for many many nights. It was one of the scariest movies I had seen, I really thought that Jeepers Creepers was gonna come through my window and eat me. His teeth and eyes are so scary.

Now I like to think of myself as a mans man. Someone who can kill small spiders and such like. However, this film SCARED me. There, I said it. I literally jumped a number of inches out of my seat when I wasn't sitting on the edge of it. Very frightening stuff! Well the first half was anyway...
I felt that the baddy character - a cross between Star Wars' Darth Maul, Hannibal Lector and a bat - was a bit dubious. In my worthless opinion he should have remained as the unseen shadowy figure that he appeared to be. I'm also not too sure why he would listen to a 1930's (or whatever year) recording of the song ""Jeepers Creepers"" on an old gramaphone. Nor where he would be able to pick up a copy...That said, I thoroughly enjoyed the film but am still making up my mind about the ""abrupt"" conclusion.In a nutshell I would say: ""Scary, original and some excellent dialogue between the main brother and sister characters.""A Mr Mad rating of: 7.5 loons out of 10.",Jeepers Creepers

The setup is fantastic even though it is nothing new (Duel & Phantasm come to mind).  The brother/sister dynamic helped me to identify with characters that may otherwise have been unlikable.  What prevented this from being a great horror movie (other than the ending and loose ends) was the revelation of the ""creeper"".  The shot of the shape in an overcoat and brimmed hat watching the kids' car as it slowly passed the church for the first time was perfect.  The car walking scene was also great.

C'mon, the TRUCK is the scariest part of the whole dang movie...they could've built the whole plot on the whacko with a truck! Heck, for a few minutes, I thought that the Undertaker from WWF fame was playing the bad guy, and that was enough to give me the willies...that all ended when the kid went down the drain. After that, the kid with no lungs alerts the viewers that this movie is about to go from cool to stone cold stupid...and it does, shutting off so soon there isn't an ending...heck, there's barely a beginning...and it's a shame such a promising beginning had such a lame movie attached to it. What the horror genre really needed was another freak in a monster truck driving over teenagers, not another demon monster from beyond stealing folks eyeballs. Definately a disappointing movie.

The movie left so many unanswered questions, and it dragged on so much.

If I could award negative points for a film, I'd give it a -5.The plot was sluggish and the movie at not point had a shred of originality. The entire shootout at the police station looked exactly like the shootout in Phantoms. The entire torture room looked like a tamer version of Dee Snider's Strangeland. The demon wasn't even that convincing.
The editing was almost as bad as the plot points. One moment the car the kids are driving is smashed to bits, the next it looks like it came off of a lot, brand new. The color schemes were horrible, as the colors would suddenly brighten at a moment's notice.The characters never tried to get remorse from the audience. If something like what happened at the begining happened for real, not a single soul would actually go back to see the crime scene. I heard more laughs in the theatre than screams, or even the occasional ""that's gross"", because everything in this movie has been seen before. The fact that the girl (I'm not gonna even bother remembering her name) referenced the Scream movies didn't help much either.Whoever approved of this film being made should actually sit down and think real hard about this abomination that he/she released.

484,Silverskin,Refreshing and totally ok.,6,12 March 2002,"Don't read this review until after you've seen the movie!Just finished watching Jeepers Creepers. After, as I usually do, I checked in with IMDB to see what my fellow people thought.  What the hell were you people that are putting this movie down expecting?I hadn't heard or seen anything from this movie before I saw it, and the experience reminded me of when I saw ""From Dusk till Dawn"", also without previous information. That movie, like this one, started off at one pace and then changed. That doesn't necessarily make this a bad movie. If it had been inconsequent, then I'd agree with that it was bad. But it wasn't. It changed a good deal during the development of the storyline, but it didn't offer any dumbass solutions or go against itself, something that is very common within this genre.  The idea with the siblings was good. Makes for a nice change from the ""four-to-six-youngsters-rent-a-cabin-in-the-woods""-routine. The scaryass truck with its scaryass horn was frightening. Another good thing was that the ""car chase""-scenes took place during daylight, something that made it even more disturbing. That and the fact that the first time you see the ""Creeper"" he is very relaxed with dumping bodies down the pipe during afternoon sun.The fact that the brother/sister-team react realistically (your guess is as good as mine) to what they see and that they share ""screenpower"", that is to say one of the leads aren't naturally the ""hero"" or ridiculously stupid, is also refreshing.  The dialogue was above par, without the usual do's and don'ts of the genre. Also, for the people who are putting this movie down - learn to watch for what's relevant and what's not. ""Where did he get his custom-made license-plates?"", ""Where does he keep his car?"", ""How can he drive the car if he hasn't put gas in it for 23 years?"" Who knows? We have no information to tell us what he did before we ""met"" him. If you accept the fact that the antagonist is a demon, what is it about the gas that bothers you?>I for one am glad that this movie got to be made. With the reviving of the horror-genre there's been so much unbelievable tripe that this movie, which takes an ironical, intelligent and entertaining stance, is a pleasant surprise. My rating: 6/10",Jeepers Creepers
485,ijh1977,promising ......but....,5,22 October 2001,This is a movie that starts out so well but finishes poorly - Disappointing overall as the first 1/2 is nicely built up with plenty of tension and the odd moment to make you jump.But then it goes all weird and introduces a couple of crap characters and becomes a 'run around scared' movie. Boring 2nd 1/2 and cliched ended.Verdict: Wait for the Video !,Jeepers Creepers
486,doctorben,Surprisingly scary little flick,8,24 September 2001,"Okay so I admit, I am a movie addict.  My family is seriously thinking of holding and intervention for me.  So I see every movie that comes out, what's so wrong with that?  Everyone needs a hobby ... right?  Okay well the point that I am trying to make is that I've seen so many movies that I really thought I was desensitized to movie scariness.  I thought nothing could scare me anymore.  I was wrong.  Jeepers Creepers actually had me closing my eyes in scenes.  I haven't done that since I was six years old! Jeepers Creepers starts out innocently enough.  Darry (Justin Long) and his sister Trish (Gina Philips) are driving home from college for spring break. They are terrorized on the road by a big, nasty old truck it eventually passes them by and they continue the trek home.  They later see the same truck parked outside an old church and its driver dumping what appear to be bloody bodies down a pipe in the yard.  They of course have to investigate and the real scariness begins.  Now I'm not going to give away anymore than that because I don't want to ruin any of the scares for you.  Up to this point I was counting and timing the scares.  'There was the fake scare... now here comes the real one in 3...2...1, right on schedule, next please', It was all pretty routine.  It wasn't long though until I realized that I wa s actually a little scared.  It all snowballed from there.  Before I knew it I was actually looking away from the screen, considering going for a refill on my drink and asking myself if I really liked being scared by a movie after all, why didn't I pick a harmless little comedy to see?  The thing was that it wasn't like most movies where the scares pop up every now and then, it had this pervading sense of dread.  I was tense and even afraid for a good 45 minutes.  Things got a little less scary towards the end but still...it was almost a relief. Now don't get me wrong this is obviously not an academy award winning movie, but it was very effective.  The acting is solid, the dialogue descent and the effects pull things off.  What I really liked about Jeepers Creepers was that it did what it set out to do, scare the pants off me.  I also have to give kudos to the script for not falling completely into horror movie routine and sticking to it's guns on some rarely seen plot points.  You'll know them when you see them.  It was also nice to see the leads as a brother sister team, you don't see that so much, it kept the story from falling into the tired and useless sexual tension or flat out sex scenes.  I'm going to go off on a tangent here for just a second so bear with me.  What is it with moviemakers thinking that every movie needs to have a sex scene.  Does every human activity really lead to sex?  'We are being chased by a man / monster who wants nothing more than to kill us, lets stop off at this motel for a quick s**g and then be on our way'.  Honestly, it's useless.  Okay sorry about that, back to Jeepers Creepers, which had no sex if you were wondering.  So to wrap things up, if you want to be scared, go see this movie, it'll be worth your money.  I'll never be able to hear the song Jeepers Creepers again (not that I heard it much before this movie but you get the idea) without a little chill running up my spine.",Jeepers Creepers

And the movie does a lot of set up mystories in the first 30minutes, such as the underground cave scene... But the second half of the movie didn't explain anything. It becomes a short story collection.  It seems each part of the movie are not connected at all, some characters are there for no reason.  It jumps from one part to another, and it makes no sense what so ever.

Even though the movie does not explain much of why things are happening it is very entertaining and actually scary.  I am a person that rents every new horror movie that comes out in hopes that it will actually be scary for once and I have to say that this is fairly scary and tense.  The ending is disturbing.  Very good movie to rent.,Jeepers Creepers

492,welsh_freak,"Excellent start, but trails off into appauling",6,2 August 2002,"Everyone had raved about this film. I went into the cinema expecting a good horror. It started off absolutely brilliant. For about the first hout, I was on the edge of my seat. The underground layer was a great way to be introduced to the creature who you suspect is a man. Up until then, he's only been ramming the poor brother and sister who are innocently driving home from college, making words out of number plates. This joke however, was played a little to much, with the creature's number plate sounds like ""Beating you"". One serious question to ask the writer: what sain person would go to the house after some maniac who tried to kill them dropped a body into a pipe? I know I'd be the other side of the country by that point.Unfortunatly, the tenseness of the film is spoiled when you realise the creature can fly. And the awefull stupid and annoying shot of the creature walking into the police station spoiled the entire film for me. I just couldn't take it seriously after that. The film just gets worse from then on, until the dull punchline of the film takes effect, with the creature flying like a bat away from the police with its victom hanging. Someone tell Victor Salva to keep up the brilliance of the first hour next time.",Jeepers Creepers

I would also agree with some of the other reviewers who pointed out that a demon who owns a truck and travel around in it is ridiculous... Even more so when they themselves makes the point that the demon can fly faster than ANY car/truck in the movie! Anyways, the director lacks imagination (so does the scriptwriter): everything you see in Jeepers Creepers, you've seen done A LOT BETTER elsewhere, and often too, none of the most important plot points/characters holds up to someone that has seen more than half a dozen good movies before...

After seeing the creature drop a body into a pipe, they go back to try to save them. When they go back, they find hundreds of dead bodies, including the couple who died on that same highway many years before. After the creature spots the two, they can never escape.

498,bnz99,Way below average movie (with the ultimate spoiler),3,15 August 2009,"This movie is somewhat of a mess. I primarily watched it, because it is an early Justin Long movie and i kind of enjoyed movies with him so far. Technically, he doesn't let you down, his acting is still alright, but the story is somewhat messy - maybe its misled from the trailer.The movie is good up to the point where Darry, the character played by Justin Long, and his sister go looking for help. It's all downhill from there, the story becomes illogical and what seemed to be a more realistic horror movie becomes a fantasy film where the killer is some sort of demon.So far so good, i could live with that if there was some proper back story to all the happenings in the movie. But there simply is nothing like that. Just a demon walking around, killing people. Oh, yes, this is the ultimate spoiler. There is no need to watch the film, because there is no mystery and suspenseful or fascinating story that is told at some point. What is left, is - i really have to repeat it - the story of a brother and sister behaving irrationally and a demon driving and running around killing people. If you like dumb movies like that, go for it. If you are looking for a suspenseful, thrilling story where you are told at some point *why* something happens, skip it. It is also nothing like one of those movies where you are just glad that the main characters get away from their hunters in the end. The ending is just hugely unsatisfying.",Jeepers Creepers

But if they didn't what could the movie have been about?! Dumb choices always happen in horror movies, but when these two teens make a dumb decision it's waaayyyy to unrealistic. Let's stop trying to make sense of a movie that has a flying demon that can only eat someone if he scare them and just marvel at the creativity of it. If they didn't go back to the church and went to the next town for help instead the Creeper wouldn't be after them and there wouldn't be a movie in the first place. That's what the movie is about a brother and his sister being chase by a monster so he can eat one of them. And Jeepers Creepers has an ending in which the bad guy gets away with it, that's a very risky move but those are some of the best endings.",Jeepers Creepers
500,TKelleher98,Horrible with a capital H.....,2,26 March 2005,This was not a good movie. In the beginning I was thinking this is going to be good and I was excited about the rest of the movie. But when the monster stared to make out with the dead male police officer I didn't know what to think. The plot was simply to fantasy for me and I though it was just weird.Another strange part was when the monster had the two siblings together and he started smelling the brother. I mean were they trying to make him gay or something it just did not make any sense to me.Now I have not seen the sequel but I hear that the brother (who somehow strangely in the sequel considering that his eyes were cut off at the end of the movie)is in the sequel. This is just ridiculous. I am giving this move a 2 out of 10 stars.,Jeepers Creepers

Also the creeper on top of the police car and cat lady scenes were good as well, lets just say when the monster as the truck, shadow and creepy man the film was very good.However once the creeper sprouts wings the film goes a bit downhill, then he/it is revealed to be a bat/lizard/demon hybrid you can't help thinking WHAT!!!! This had potential to be so much scarier but just goes into B-movie hell. And the pyschic woman woman annoyed the hell out of me.Watching it again I think they were trying to create a B-movie feel so it redeems itself there and gives itself a full star for the very last scene.",Jeepers Creepers

The lead actors really carried the movie well. The filming, writing and sound was fantastic. I was glad that they didn't go with famous actors. The Chemistry between the lead actors really helped sell how close they were and really made the fact that the sister would sacrifice herself for her bother that much more convincing. The movie did loose a little when there were many actors in the scenes but the move did hold on to the very end. I liked that it almost had a tales from the crypt type feel to it.

In my own opinion, this entire movie was pure garbage. This is entertainment in it's cheapest form. Anyone with intelligence would be insulted seeing this movie. Most of it didn't make sense.The characters made the worst decisions possible. Even in other horror movies where they make bad decisions, it's because they don't realize how dangerous the situation is. The two characters in this movie KNOW how dangerous it is and they still decide to throw themselves into danger.The bad guy/monster/boogie man, which is never explained by the way, looks so silly that people in the theater were laughing in the supposedly scary parts.The acting was horrible, the script was incoherent, the special effects were cheap and I don't understand why people don't see this. The only ones who do are the critics, yet after ripping the movie apart, they give it two out of four stars. If Jeepers Creepers is two stars, I would be scared to see a 'no-stars' movie.There was one scene, however, that I really related to the female character. This kind of summed up the entire movie for me. She watches the monster killing one of the town's police officers from a distance and is horrified. She gasps and whispers, ""I am NOT seeing this.""

The dialog is outstanding for this kind of movie, making you uneasy and on your toes, not just by suspence but by making you really want to shout -Shut up and get the hell away from there. And it never falls into the trap, with catchy oneliners that often totally ruins movies of this genre.

The spirit was there, for atleast the first fourty five minutes, but past that, it started to go down hill.  One thing can be said for sure about this movie, and that is, that it was a horror movie. This is most definately not a ""teen slasher flick"".  Unfortunately it wasn't scary.  I don't know really, I'm probably too up in the air about it right now to be writing a review.  In the spirit of Mothers Day or Texas Chainsaw Masacre II, it maintained a good level of comic fright.  But it never delved in to the deep fright that keeps you up at night...instead it went for a couple jumps and startles, but that's about it.  I suppose that's do to the fact that Swamp Thing just isn't scary.  Ok, I guess that's about all I have to say.  It's worth seeing most definately.

It looked cool and I like horror movies anyways, so since i couldn't get a chance to see it in theaters, me and some friends rented it last night. Like everyone is saying, it starts out great. But after that it levels out for about an hour, then it picks right back up again until the end, which is sudden. Not particularly dissapointing, just sudden and unexpected. The plot is great. A pair of twin brother and sister are driving home from college. For some reason which either I didn't pick up or isn't mentioned they end up on a long and seemingly deserted highway in the middle up some great country backgrounds. They begin playing a license plate game to pass the time. They see an old truck with a vanity plate which says BEATINGU. Take a guess what that means, it is pretty obivous to everyone who ISNT in the movie. Anyway, later they see the same truck a little farther down the road, parked near a church. The driver (dressed completely in black) is taking bundles wrapped in sheets out of the trunk and throwing them down a pipe. Yeah, the bundles are what you think they are, it aint that hard to figure out. The driver sees them and runs them off of the road after a short chase. He then drives away for some reason at all. The boy gets little curious as to what the driver was doing. You know where it goes from there if you've been researching this movie. This movie has a great bad guy, cool death scenes, and okay acting by the only two real characters in the whole movie, the twins. But, it has some flaws. Actually, it has alot. The score is the most annoying I've ever heard. Its not even music, its a motor (yes, a MOTOR) revving up over and over again in a loop whenever something happens. Theres a strange Mrs. Cleo-like woman who does nothing to explain what this creature (demon, devil?) is or why it does what it does or how to stop it, and so has nothing to add to the film except more confusion. The movie takes a reeeaaallly long time to get moving, but I guess it has to if you really think about it, because it has to go through the normal introduction of setting, character developement, and to fire up the story a little. I'd say the ending is the main reason that more than 300 people who saw it gave this movie a 1 rating and only half that gave the movie a 10. It is VERY sudden, because you think that there is going to be a final showdown between the survivors of the creatures final rampage rather than what really happens. It really blindsides you. But I guess thats because there was a sequel in mind all along. I hope that the sequel can heal the originals wounds/",Jeepers Creepers

You will never get bored watching this movie, especially the first third is really good, but then it turns out to be just another monster movie.How much more terrifying would this movie have been, if the story was halfway imaginable? ""The silence of the lambs"" or ""Se7en"" are so frightening, because you can imagine that something like that could actually happen. In ""Jeepers Creepers"" this is obviously not possible.

517,eXistor,"Great start, bad ending (!!spoilers ahead!!)",4,4 January 2002,"warning: spoilers ahead.I saw Jeepers Creepers yesterday in a sneak preview and i already read some good things about it, not in the least that it draws comparisons with Texas Chain Saw Massacre, not a comparison to be taken lightly, this movie indeed has the same atmosphere fot the first 40 minutes or so, with the lead characters being like people you could actually know or better still, you could see yourself in these persons, it all starts realistically enough, with the two kids driving on a desolate road playing roadgames (didn't we all), then pretty much out of nowhere they're attacked by an old rusty truck and after they get rid of the truck, they move on, later they come across an old church, where they see the old truck and a shadowy man dumping what seems to be a body wrapped in cheets in a vent of sorts. After the truck is gone (it went after them again, but they managed to shake it off) they check out the pipe, where he dumped the body and needless to say one of the kids falls in where he makes some pretty gruesome discoveries.Now this is all fine and dandy, but after this unsettling, but very good and unnerving opening, the movie falls completely flat on it's face, it's not long after this that the ""creeper"" (the killer) is revealed and this is the film's one BIG flaw: (SPOILER) the killer is not human, but a demon of sorts and all the events that occur after this is revealed are totally ineffective, for instance there comes a bit where he decapitates a cop then picks up the severed head, sniffs it and then proceeds to rip out his tongue with his own teeth. This would be effective if the Creeper were a human, but when a demon or non-human does something like this it's simply nothing special, because all monsters are SUPPOSED to be doing crazy stuff like that, but when it's done by a human then it becomes truly creepy and unnerving.All that follows is done in the same way, coupled by some lame special effects some obligatory characters that are just begging to be killed off. If they had kept the initial atmosphere like in the first half of the movie then it would be worthy of being mentioned alongside of Texas Chain Saw Massacre, but as it stand it's an unfortunate attempt at recreating true terror, which it at first does, but it manages to throw it all away because of the unraveling of the Creeper, it does end on a positive note though, which i will not give away.conclusion: it IS worth your time, just be wary that the second half is nowhere near as good as the first, catch it on video or dvd 6 out of 10",Jeepers Creepers
518,bubbagod,An enjoyable horror romp,6,27 October 2001,"Everything looks promising: no star studded cast, a relatively unknown director with a scorched past and Francis Ford Coppola (he of Godfather fame) as executive producer.Expectations for something original are not unfounded. And it doesn't fare too badly at the beginning, introducing two siblings who come across a potential murder case in a downbeat town. Further investigation leads to chaos as the two leads battle an unstoppable menace.Residing comfortably in the 'B movie' status field, the film comes with an unfinished look about it and this is where moviegoers will find themselves divided. Baulking at the plot loopholes combined with a sudden ending will result in dissatisfaction. But follow it through and one will find an enjoyable horror romp.It's not a classic, by any means, but then it never sets out to be.

519,TheoTraverz,Great set-up with a very unsatisfying payoff,3,31 January 2002,"Jeepers begins with the promising signposts of a chilling teen slasher flick- two college siblings, a vacant rural, road, and a maniac who tries to run them off of it.  And even when the logic that the drives the two protagonists slowly unravels, there's room to suspend one's disbelief and join them on their journey into the unknown.Then, very abruptly, a supernatural element is introduced as if to make the film more intriguing.  Instead it only refutes all the elements introduced in the first suspenseful half-hour.  The villain appears to transform suddenly from the possibly-deranged-backroads-serial killer to the other-wordly-winged-cannibalist.  Horror enthusiasts will particularly cringe when the spooky Hattie McDanielesque psychic appears from nowhere and wants to risk her life to save these two college brats from the evil flying demon.  What could be a mindless but disturbingly entertaining shock flick quickly becomes an exercise in connect the horror movie cliches.By the end, the only thing scary about ""Jeepers Creepers"" is the fact that people actually spent time and money to make this movie.",Jeepers Creepers

This film had an average beginning, nothing original though, and went downhill steadily from there. The acting was ok given what they had to work with, but the plot was largely unoriginal, and the special effects looked bad - i have no complaints about cheap special effects, Sam Raimi showed us that brilliantly entertaining effects can be achieved on a budget considerably lower than this film's was in The Evil Dead, but this movie's looked like theyd cost a fair bit and just come off wrong. The bottom line is, you should not make your audience laugh at your monster in a horror movie. The best way to make a monster scary is to show it as infrequently as possible, and rely upon the audience's imagination. Having seen the 'creeper' run over by a car repeatedly, then stand up and walk around with an amusing limp and comically squashed limbs, there was no way he was going to scare me. overall, A huge disappointment, especially given the claims that it was 'the best US horror film in 10 years' on the advert!",Jeepers Creepers

I love a good scary movie, and so I finally decided to rent this and see what all the hype was about.  I must say that I was expecting something extrodinary and what I got was a big let down.  The beginning was a little suspensful but after that I didn't find myself scared at all.  All the situations seemed entirely predictable as far as who was going to get ""caught"" and at what moment.  I must admit that the ending was a little surprising but in no way scary or very suspensful.  The biggest problem I had was that the movie ended WAY too quickly and left too many loose ends. My friends claim that you are not supposed to know all the details and that it's supposed to be mysterious, but I found that so many questions were left unanswered that the movie ended up making little sense.  Luckily I got this on a free rental so I didn't have to be too mad about wasted money.  IMO ""Wrong Turn"" is MUCH more suspensful and scarrier, although several of my friends still claim ""Jeepers Creepers"" is better.",Jeepers Creepers
522,film gal,"GOOD AT FIRST, A LITTLE LESS WHEN I SAW IT ON VIDEO",4,27 April 2002,"JEEPERS CREEPER is at first glance a good creepy film. Nice mood and cool creepy elements. Cool looking weird car. But when I watched it again I started to see the frayed edges of the story coming out. Just too many things that just seemed tossed into the mix to spice it up. Like that cooking guy EMERIL... ""BAM... Let's take it up a few notches!  BAM... Throw in a ton of dead bodies.  BAM... Throw in a weird car with a strange vanity plate.  BAM... Throw in a psychic.  BAM... A weird discombobulated creature. BAM...  But then all those BAMS starts raising other questions and things just start to fall apart some. I think it's a good harmless flick but it doesn't really go beyond that when you look at the details. And maybe that's my problem.. Looking at details on a horror flick.",Jeepers Creepers
523,Craven de Kere,Horrid horror that manages to surprise (a little),7,27 May 2002,"Well, it starts like your run of the mill thriller, you expect stupidity beyond belief and you are not disappointed. You expect unrealism and there you are not disappointed once more.While the film is cheesy as nachos (or my analogies) it manages to spook you a few times, and I'm not easily spooked by films.The film is a tremendous letdown because toward the end they lose the fear factor by showing too much of the mystery. It was much better when they kept you guessing at how they'd put the stars in danger yet once more.The leading characters get away so many times that you end up watching the film to the end to figure out how they are gonna get tossed back into the fray.But any and all creativity the writers had ran out 3/4 of the way through the film. If you skip the last 20 minutes you'll enjoy it more since guessing at where the meandering minds of the writers went is the only thing that makes the film remotely interesting.",Jeepers Creepers
524,Cleptomaniac,Fantastic!,9,17 August 2002,"Now this is something I really didn't expect. Before I've watched Jeepers Creepers, I had heard nothing about it, so I didn't know what to expect. Didn't see that one coming.The movie is definetly the scariest thing I saw, if only for it's first half. It starts with a brother and sister driving home from college on a country side road, when a truck (license plate BEATNGU) appears behind them, signaling them to let it pass (or some such). After the truck passes them, the brother and sister notice the driver dump a sack into an old pipe next to and old building at the side of the road. From there on, the movie paces up a bit.Jeepers Creepers definetly is very scary. The scenes with the truck (that does look like something that came from hell) and the old church are simply terrifying, and they will keep you on the edge of your seat. Unfortunatly, about at the middle of the movie, it takes a stroll to the dumb side, where there are many plot holes and inconsistencies. Still, just for first 45 minutes, the movie is a blast.The acting is simply brilliant, where the actors portray Trish and Derry nicely and very believably. The plot is very interesting, unlike many other slasher flicks. Overall, watch this movie, if only to make sure you're not missing something.",Jeepers Creepers
525,Silverblade17,Best Horror Movie Ever!,10,28 August 2002,What I liked about Jeepers Creepers was how it was a drama in a horror movie. You feel like you know Trish and Darry and that's why the film is so good. Also Jeepers Creepers uses alot of old horror tricks to shock you but also adds new ideas. The ending is rather strange but at least it didn't ruin it like I've seen in so many other movies. The beggining of the movie is chilling and the second half is an all out out horror which make it very watchable. Overall Jeepers Creepers is probably my favorite film.,Jeepers Creepers
526,michaelanderson65,Outstanding horror film,10,30 November 2006,"Every once in a while a new horror film comes along that reinvents the genre (Jaws, Halloween, The Exorcist, A Nightmare on Elm Street). These films not only prove to be entertaining, but they add something new and visionary to a market that seems to thrive mostly on rip-offs, sequels and spoofs. JEEPERS CREEPERS should be counted among them. While it doesn't maintain the level of thrills it achieves during the first 45 minutes or so, at just 90 minutes it does still manages to keep an effective level of adrenaline pumping shocks and scares and has one heck of a creepy ending to boot. The acting is first rate and the movie looks terrific. The CGI effects are thankfully kept to a minimum and its just a fun ride! There's nothing more to say. Rent it. Buy it. Enjoy it.",Jeepers Creepers

So we put in Jeepers Creepers. This was the worst movie I've ever seen. Well, besides The Village (or Jeepers Creepers 2).My friends were actually getting scared during the ""climactic"" scenes, so for comedic relief, I, being my cocky self, ad-libbed some of my sarcastic humor. In example, I said, ""That looks SO real."" and everyone started laughing. They were like, ""Oh, man, you ruined it. I was actually scared."" Psh. Sure.This gets a 2 out of me for some humor, but it's totally self-inflicted.Words of advice: DON'T WATCH JEEPERS CREEPERS (or the sequel).",Jeepers Creepers
528,BatwebGothicReviews,Properly Creepy: One of the best stand alone horror movies,7,25 July 2016,"I rather liked this movie from its first scene. Instead of focusing on a group of romantically involved teenagers, it centers on two siblings, Trish and Darry. The naming is important on more than one levels you will get the pleasure of discovering towards the middle of the movie as well as the very end. I personally kept hearing ""Barry"" instead of Darry throughout the film but the unusual male name Darry actually derives from Darius, which you probably got but I did not realize at first.To make matters even more interesting, the character of the villain was very unique in its characteristics and also based on a UK folklore character from Victorian times, which I knew of and could not get enough tales about, but the movie villain definitely has its own background history too, so is not a direct imitation for those who are too turned off by an obvious borrowing from the past.I liked how the scenes would change from morning to the evening, from being so familiar and dreary at first, with green pastures and cows, to an almost Gothic like nature when the night approached.I also enjoyed how small town life could be portrayed with such a quality reminiscent of dream life, without having anything to do directly with dreams. I consider this first movie to be an unequivocal proof to the director's (Victor Salva) genius.I don't believe he took part in the second Jeepers Creepers but heard he would be involved in the third and am looking forward to seeing it. I also found the two young characters engaging. Justin Long did a very striking performance despite his age. You probably remember him from his later comedic career, but I found his first horror movie and his next one to be some of the highest points in his acting career.The movie Jeepers Creepers 2001 has a good plot and consistent characters(even at their dumbest, their logic is still understandable even if us, the viewers, would be smart enough from watching all the horror not to follow it. LOL)But equally interesting is the choice of the sound track. The movie features some music from 1938 which was pleasantly quaint and spooky since it was introduced at the most appropriate points of the plot. I think it is a fairly good movie, slightly above the average stock because it shows originality on so many fronts and gives your imagination as much, if not more to work with, than trivial visual effects.",Jeepers Creepers
529,ceciliamcphee-51032,A classic in horror,8,28 November 2018,"Jeepers Creepers is not one to be underestimated. The undeniable creepiness of this film will never leave your mind even months after viewing. Although not an amazing masterpiece; it is a horror which gets under your skin and gives you goosebumps, making you think twice about switching the light off before you go to sleep. The chilling theme song matches perfectly, and the acting is excellent from beginning to end. Not deserving of a 10/10, but for horror, it is not far off. Definitely worth a watch for horror fans, or anyone who is willing. It should not disappoint.",Jeepers Creepers

532,Ben-117,Ridiculous,2,8 September 2001,"Yeah, yeah it's supposed to be ridiculous right, it's a modern day horror flick, but this movie was at times just downright retarded. Aside from some good lighting and a few cool camera shots this movie isn't even worth renting.  It's hard to care about the characters and whether or not they die because everyone in the film deserves to.  The psychic was especially annoying.  And the fact that the song jeepers creepers plays an important part in the movie (it's the monster's favorite song!)is smack yourself on the forehead stupid. Everytime it plays it induces laughs rather than terror.  And what is with the killer?  What is it?  Why is it killing people?  Why does it sew the bodies back up?  Apparently it's killed a lot of people, why didn't anybody notice until now?  Where did it come from? Does the list of things that are introduced in the movie and then never addressed again end?  Who cares?  This is just another movie made by people who are glad to take your $$$ because they know 2 weeks from now (or less) you'll forget you ever even saw it.  Garbage",Jeepers Creepers

534,gibbo-5,Weak,1,28 February 2002,"This film started off okay, but it got bad very quickly. The rusty truck and the dark figure in the hat and coat were pretty ominous, but once he was revealed to be a silly monster, the whole movie became laughable. And the two leads were horrible actors given a horrible script. The male decided to channel early Keanu Reeves with the dumb-founded expressions continually across his face. And it was frustrating seeing the two of them continually do illogical things in the face of trouble. The rest of the movie was filled with bad horror cliches. I've just about had it with horror movies taking seemingly innocuous things (the song ""Jeepers Creepers"") and trying to make them spooky. And the ending? Well, it's pretty obvious that the makers of this film didn't feel like trying to think of a way to wrap it up, so they just summarily ended it at the 90 minute mark. I don't expect horror movies to be masterpieces, but they should be entertaining, which this is not.",Jeepers Creepers

I'm pretty sure that this was the worst movie I have ever suffered through in my life (tied with Tomcats) and I've seen a LOT of movies.  The only thing that I don't understand is the lack of intelligence exemplified by certain critics and users of the IMDB. POSITIVE REVIEWS?!?!?  Oh my, the world is a sad place indeed where such a schlock of crap can garner any form of word of mouth other than a screaming tirade of how horrible it was.  Please, let this movie die fast.

537,abstractthinker,First scare in a long time,9,24 July 2002,"Before the 80s, we had traditional horror movies like Dracula, and Frankenstein. With their 'old-horror-movie' special effects, they provided great entertainment. In the 80s, we had the Nightmare on Elm Street series. I remember not being able to sleep after one of those movies (I was too young to remember which one). In the 90s and even into this millennium, we have had teen-slasher movies galore. However, Jeepers Creepers takes us back to the 80s, without actually taking us back to the 80s. Without masses of computer-generated special effects, this movie still provokes our fear, and tantalizes the senses. Unlike teen-slasher movies, you do not spend the movie trying to work out who the killer is, but you are concerned about the characters. Like most horror movies, you invariably end up shouting at the screen telling the characters not to do something, but in this movie, I did that only once. The other times, the characters were intelligent enough to know what to do, and not enter the dark decrepit house with no one around for miles, and no one knowing where they are, etc.The acting is great and the direction better. I will definitely look out for more of Victor Salva's work. On the whole, if you go into this movie thinking 'I want to be entertained and frightened a little"" then this is the movie. If you are thinking ""I want to see a movie where the characters are incredibly believable and so is the story"" then give this a miss.",Jeepers Creepers
538,brian.evans,Stupid White People,1,4 September 2001,"With all the hype surrounding this movie, I expected something more...especially given the supposed quote from Clive Barker about how good this was. SPOILERS Imagine my disappointment to see that it is nothing more than poorly-defined characters in a poorly-defined situation doing the same old stupid things that get white teenagers killed in every other horror film since the genre was invented.  The irony is that at one point the sister says to her brother, as he is about to go into the scary pipe to search for possible dead bodies, ""You know that point in every horror movie where somebody does something stupid and everybody hates him for it?  This is one of those times.""The whole movie is filled with those times and if you are worried about knowing what happens in a completely predictable film, then don't read on. When the big, huge truck comes barrelling up behind, do they get out of the way?  No, of course not.  They simply swerve all over the road rather than pulling over, despite the fact that the sister is screaming for her brother to do just that.  When the truck pulls up beside them, do they slam on the brakes to let it pass?  No, of course not.  They rev up and pull in front of him again.  When they stop to see what has happened to the police escort and they see the bad guy, do they immediately run away and put some distance between them?  No, of course not.  They stick around to watch him eat somebody.  When the bad guy is blocking the road and she tries to run the bad guy over and he leaps over the car, does she count it as a blessing that the way is clear now and get out of Dodge?  No, of course not.  She has to try and get him in reverse, only to have him jump again.  And then she taunts the guy.And, of course, none of these characters are fleshed out in any sense.  We know the sister is having guy troubles, but we never hear anything about what it is or why it is motivating her, despite the fact that they make a very big deal out of it.  When the brother has a harrowing experience, he goes into and out of shock as if only to make things frustrating for his sister.  The bad guy just is, even though he's set up with an ancient reason for his existence...that never gets explained or has anything to do with anything so why bother mentioning it?At least with the Blair Witch Project, even though you never see whatever it is that's after them, they put some back story into the concept.  This movie has none.  There's no point to the protagonists, there's no point to the antagonist, there's no point to the victims...there's no point to even see the movie.",Jeepers Creepers

A couple of post modern moments - Trying to stop her brother crawling down a hole, Trish (Gina Philips) tells him ""You know the part in horror movies when somebody does something really stupid, and everybody hates him for it? This is it."". It's a nice line but it doesn't stop it from being true - he does something stupid and you hate him for it. Trish gets all the best lines (All three of them), and is generally plucky and likeable. Her brother, Darry(?) (Justin Long) is just irritating, with a range of facial expressions that recall the young Keanu Reeves after too many botox injections. The demon, once you get a half-decent view of it, looks like a day-player that wandered off the set of 'Buffy'. There's a deux ex machina who supposedly turns up to explain all about The Creeper, but whose explanations don't make a lot of sense.

While the idea of a demon or some other evil creature whose sole purpose for existence is to eat human beings is a hackneyed one, the acting is quite good and the suspense builds throughout. What seems inexplicable to me is why the demon even needs a truck; he is able to fly and transport his victims to his ""pain"" castle. It makes for some interesting (and frightening) scenes, but, as is so often the case in movies of this genre, it raises too many questions: Why didn't he just abandon the truck and fly to his quarry if he wanted to catch the kids in their car? He did this with the two cops he kills. Even more troublesome is the sad state of the police department, which has failed to notify the state police, the FBI, or other agencies that would be swarming into the area the moment people began disappearing; this is, after all, the eighteenth day of the demon's feeding frenzy and he's obviously been quite busy. While all this may detract from the continuity of the film, the results and suspense still warrant an overall positive review",Jeepers Creepers

The only problem is that the film attempts to explain,via a convenient placed Psychic,the awful truth.Its a little lazy and not very convincing at this point.Why explain the mystery at all?It destroys the terror of the film and moves it into bog standard Demon territory.A little more work on the third act & a bigger budget would have made this an absolute corker!

From beginning till end there is not one single scene in this movie that was ever interesting. The ending though I will not reveal it was the worst ending ever in any movie.

We might as well be entertained by watching pretty, pretty pictures set to music. This could be entertaining if one is a completely baked, die-hard stoner, but really, it's terrible. The whole point of a horror movie is to be startled, grossed out, and above all, scared. If you have to stop thinking to enjoy something, then it isn't worth anyone's time, and it's an insult to us, the audience, that filmmakers make stuff like this. They're basically saying, ""Yes, it's no good, but that's okay, because you're too stupid to appreciate anything better."" We, as an audience, have to stop patronizing crap like this and demand we are served quality entertainment.

555,mullert90,YEAAAH!,9,2 September 2001,"Been a while since I wrote a review, but this is the one to bring me back to the keyboard....Genuinely creepy, this is the perfect antidote for the ""I Know..""/""Valentine""/""Urban Legend"" virus infecting our movie screens. (I fear the upcoming ""Soul Survivors"") This one doesn't fool around, the ""Creeper"" is truly frightening and the whole ""middle of nowhere"" setting works wonders. You don't see too much blood, but what you have are two likeable characters running for their lives from one of the most vile, scary villains I've ever seen.  The pace is relentless, kicking in about 10 minutes into the film, and we get some really disturbing imagery (the underground chamber is fantastic). Great weirdo supporting characters, too, with some pretty black humor. Horror fans rejoice, Victor Salva has given us one of the finest since the 80's heyday.  I loved it....If I have one complaint, though, it's the psychic character.  Existing only for exposition, I think it would have been scarier knowing even less of the Creeper.  Otherwise the two leads do a great job, the beast is really cool, and it's the most heartpounding thing in a long, long time.  I'll be avoiding the back roads for awhile....It was funny though to note the reaction of the teeny-bopper filled audience I saw this with.  Throughout the movie there were screams galore, and during one of the best scenes (you'll know it when you see it) EVERYONE was screaming ""GOOO!!""  Seemed everyone was diggin' it. But afterwards all the little ""Scream-ies""  were complaining about the ending.  So---GOD BLESS VICTOR SALVA!!!!",Jeepers Creepers

This is, without a doubt, one of the WORST excuses for a film I've seen in quite some time.  This is absolutely ridiculous.  There is not one redeeming quality to this film.  It's not scary.  It's not funny.  It employs every horror flick cliche ever used before.  The plot doesn't make a lot of sense and the characters are morons. Absolute garbage - save your money",Jeepers Creepers

It would seem that the explosion of mindless teenie horror clones has taken a turn to something a bit more creative.  The story is simple and the characters are believable.  This film is NOT about 6 upper class white kids and an obligatory rich black friend (thrown in for ethnic equality purposes)running around trying to escape a psychopathic serial killer in a rich suburb of some picturesque little town. Rather, this film is simple and to the point.  Two college students stumble upon a monster created out of pure evil from ""some dark place in time..."" and spend the duration of the film trying to figure out what this thing is and why it wants to kill them.  I thought this film seemed very believable. The characters behave in much the same way you might in a similar (although unlikely) situation.  I had the feeling that there was a good deal of footage cut from the film as is evidenced by a lack of closure and some unanswered questions regarding character development.  My advice is to check this one out.  It looks like a sleeper hit to me.  And trust me, this Creeper is a bad mamma jamma.",Jeepers Creepers
558,LadyGray,One of the worst movies I've ever sat through.,1,3 September 2001,"I found this movie to be a severe disappointment from what I was expecting. I was not frightened, I was not distressed, I wasn't even slightly uneasy. I left the theater with the feeling that I had just wasted $5.00 and a good two hours of my life.  The script was so horribly written the film was painful to sit through, and I only did so only hoping that it would get better.  This hope was never met.  Every time I thought that there was a situation that could lead to something exciting or half interesting it was never acted upon.  The plot was exceptionally predictable and equally over done.  The so called villain/monster was laughable.  It was the typical generic monster with absolutely not creative flair.  Gina Philips and Justin Long did as good of an acting job as they could considering the script but the characters themselves were just plain annoying.  I have never wanted to just hop into the film itself and smack some common sence into two people as badly as I wanted to in this film.  Once again the trailer was far superior to the film itself.

However, it doesn't take long for the tired old cliches (and worse) to surface.  The ending is even more horrid, making the movie even more stupid (which up to that point I had thought impossible).  The ending made me CRAVE an old tired cliche.I was in a crowd of college students, and throughout the entire movie I could swear I heard people collectively rolling their eyes.  After the first 30 minutes I was just waiting for the movie to be over.

The first half of the film had me on the edge of my seat and I was beggining to think someone had actually made solid horror movie, while at the same time breaking the trendy mold of late 90's ""Scream"" teeny bopper horror flicks.  Those thoughts quickly came to a halt midway throught the movie, when our seemingly mortal psychopathic killer turns into a superhuman demon who can fly causing a burst of laughter throughout the theater. The movie turned from an edge of your seat horror thriller to a laughing stock.  The drastic change from realistic to unrealistic ruined any chances of ""Jeepers Creepers"" becoming a successful horror film and will leave you shaking your head exiting the theater just as you did for the ""Blair Witch Project""",Jeepers Creepers
562,HanLec,Another One of These,2,17 February 2003,"SPOILERS!!!!!!Unfortunately, the IMDB restricts me to 1000 words in which I may decry this film as RIDICULOUS, even for a teen-horror-cliche type of movie.  If I were to say all my thoughts in paragraph form, I would wind up rambling and making no sense, so read my list as to why this movie SUCKS!!!!1.  No one would ever, EVER go back to the site where you saw someone dump a body.  However, the case in this movie was even more ridiculous than that because the ""guy"" that they saw dump the body just tried to run them off the road TWICE!!(I'm guessing they were driving home from community junior college for the challenged).2.  When they ran that thing over, why the hell didn't they just keep going! I doubt any sober person would drive to a police station and say that they just ran over a monster and would very much appreciate some help.3.  WHY didn't they explain that psychic's dream at the end!  Did she know it was him that the thing was after or was she really wrong.  Also, I doubt after seeing what happened people would still think she was a crazy old lady.4.  Poor Derry would have not been able to ""scream in the dark"" as he was. His head was clearly punctured through and he would have died instantly(unless the screaming was the result of listening to that song. I felt like I was watching a porky pig cartoon).5.  It's not exciting when the bad guy can't die.6.  MOVIES ABOUT MONSTERS DON'T WORK!!!!  There is NO SUCH THING AS MONSTERS and therefore no one is going to see this movie and feel creeped out when they go out at night.If you want to see a real horror movie that takes place in the country away from all possible help, watch the original Texas Chain Saw Massacre, where you may feel the scenario may really happen to you(I know there are a lot more people who would want to see you tortured to death than monsters that do).",Jeepers Creepers

Sure, the scene with the Creeper squished in the road and that wing popping out and flapping against the ground is cool, but the scenes leading up to it are not.

I was intrigued by the opening of this film when I first started watching it on cable the other night. Yes, I was sucked in initially, but the movie actually got LESS scary and creepy as it goes on. Yes, less scary. Totally lame ending. If the monster kills off practically everybody he comes across, with the ability to almost instantly find/attack his victims, why does he need to continually chase these two? Oh yeah, because then there'd be no movie. In the end of the movie, after instantly removing every body part it wants from every other victim in the movie, the monster feels it necessary to fly away with one of the main characters. The reason? Apparently to set up the lame final scene.A waste of time. Predictable except for the very beginning. Not scary.",Jeepers Creepers

There are many areas in the plot that could have been better written.  For example, the title, Jeepers Creepers, refers to a song by that name.  As the main characters find out long into the film, it serves as a warning that the monster is near and about to strike.  But the song is only heard one time for that purpose: While the two are leading the police to where they spotted bodies.  This happens because Trysh decides to tune in another station on the radio. What if she hadn't turned the dial?Much of the movie time is spent with the characters talking to police and other people.  It is halfway through the film until the monster is even seen (aside from a shadowy figure passed off as a man)  Many of the creatures actions are not explained well.The end of the film also lacks, but I'll let you see it.Maybe it was left wide open for the sequel, which I hope can pick up the slack.",Jeepers Creepers

Basically the bit when instead of going to the nearest police station and reporting what may or may not at that time have been someone chucking a body down a chute they decide to go to the aforementioned chute and climb down it. This, I add, knowing that it is the haunt of a particulary psycho individual...... Ok there would have been no film if I imposed my end on it. But why?? would anybody else have gone back??? No (except possibly old Syd a la Scream) And then this killer turns out to be some kind of quirky goblin. Terrifying? Not at all. Sophisticated cinema audiences demand a killer who doesn't gobble along to third rate jazz music and who isn't necessarily some kind of supernatural joke. Some weird people found this frightening, so I suggest they go and watch something like Bambi because thats the only film I can think of that is less frightening.

The build up to this movie was enormous; it was classed as 'the scariest film ever' and 'brilliant'. Personally I don't think that those comments could be farther from the truth. I think Jeepers Creepers was a very poor film. It had a very very predictable plot line, the story just wasn't thought out. And the villain, well, very poor attempt at scary I have to say. For a horror it was a total let down and I would not recommend it to anyone who wants a good scary horror with a clever plot line and generally exciting thriller qualities, because it was none of these things.",Jeepers Creepers

But now that I've seen it, I've been really surprised by the quality of the scenes which gives you real bad feelings (lots more than Scream or stuff like that....). Moreover the music is retro as you can expect it to be and gives the movie a real American bad country ambient.... The only problem I have with it is that most of the behaviours of the two main characters are completely irrational even if they are facing the scariest situtations ever. But honestly I think that it makes this movie not as powerful as it would be if the staff had been working a little more on the main character's behaviours and interactions with other characters.( But maybe as I'm a latin cultured man, only my perception is different, not the reality of the movie?)

When asked about this movie I tell them that the first half-hour is good, and that each ten minutes after that seems like it was written and directed by someone else, and each person didn't get to see what the person right before him had done.

Nothing more, nothing less.",10,10 August 2003,"From Sixth Sense to Blair Witch Project and right on through to The Ring, in recent years horror movies have been missing several key elements.  Let's look at the horror movies of the past: Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and Halloween.  We're talking about the days when it was OK to show blood and gore without worrying about how real it looks.  The Ring shows gore for like 1.5 seconds and then cuts away. Blair Witch Shows a burry rag with blood in it and later a guy facing a wall. Sixth Sense doesn't even have people being stalked and killed, for Christ's sake!Jeepers Creepers brings us back to what horror really is.  Horror is a demonic creature with a scary truck and a basement full of mutilated corpses.  Horror is that hand that grabs the main character's ankle during that calm silence, causing you to jump 3 feet in the air.  Horror is knowing that there's no way out and some folks are gonna HAVE TO get their heads cut off.What is so hard about getting those elements in a movie?

A lot of it was random and didn't make sense. For example, at the end, when Justin Long's eyes have been eaten out, you can see that his body has been hollowed out.If that were the case, he wouldn't have been screaming ten seconds ago, and his body would not stand up. Also, what is the significance of the song ""Jeepers Creepers""? Another question: The Creeper could see through the entire movie, so why did he eat Justin Long's eyes?

Like others have said, it starts off with promise - but very soon it descends into total drivel.I found myself constantly predicting exciting plot twists, only to be disappointed by the silly direction the plot kept going in. When strange things happened, like the phonecall at the diner, or the incident with the cat woman, I was excited because I was relishing some final ingenious denouement where these disparate and seemingly disjointed themes would come together. But it never came! I really am at a loss when it comes to understanding those intelligent reviewers who really raved about this film - I am really disappointed. Yes it began well, yes it referenced some horror greats, and yes the central actors gave good performances.

One of the best horror movies out of all. The graphics are perfect. There is not one momment where anything looked ""fake"". Gina Philips and Justin Long were the perfect choice for Trish and Darry. The 1960 Chevy Impala that was used was awesome. Also making the creature immortal was a great idea, seeing as how it came back after Trish and Darry ran it over many times. The liceance plate ""Beatingu""was a good idea. Gizelle Gay Hartman plays a very important part in the movie, explaining why the creature does what it does and explains the Jeepers Creepers song. All around, Jeepers Creepers gets a 10 on my vote.",Jeepers Creepers
592,bigdzgirl2003,Needed a better ending,9,28 December 2004,"I liked this movie more than the 2nd one. Justin Long is so adorable! The movie had good acting with very little flaws and mistakes. I don't think they should have shown the Creepers face until later in the movie. That would have made it more suspenseful. Why did they show the creeper getting ""Dairy's"" eyes and skin if he didn't even use them in anything. The ending could have been better and that is why it only got a 9 from me. It really got my heart pounding. Too bad she ruined a perfectly good car. She should have made an appearance in the second one though.Overall, I thought the movie was great and kept me on the edge of my seat.",Jeepers Creepers
593,berserkly,"A Good First Half, A Less-Than-Satisfying Ending",5,15 April 2006,"Enjoyable but only if you don't expect too much. The journey, particularly its early stages, is far more exciting than the destination.It starts off as with a near-perfect setup. Two completely believable, squabbling siblings catch sight of the unexpected, pursue it and find horror beyond imagining. Our heroes spot what looks like a body being disposed of, investigate and find a by-God monster.The transition from what appears to be a reality-based crime in progress to out-and-out nightmare is well done and extremely satisfying. Unfortunately the climax isn't all that climactic and the resolution fizzles.I was left feeling less than satisfied. Fortunately, I didn't know that writer/director Victor Salva is a registered sex offender--and a stupid one; he made the mistake of filming himself having sex with a 12 year-old actor--before I watched the film and therefore was able to view it without prejudice.To summarize: The best recommendation I can make is to tell you to watch the first half--and then imagine your own ending. It will probably be more inventive than the actual one. Berkeley Hunt Studio City",Jeepers Creepers

This film has it... enjoy the ride. Oh, and in some places... it's really really gross; but I get you might like that. I've read the reviews and there are a lot of goofs, but again, you're not watching for literal value. Actually, the actors are believable enough and frankly, if you don't jump a few times, I will eat my words!With that said, I think the plot, scenery, and action are well thought out. I like the 'peaceful' country side, small church, tight community mentality of the movie. That is the scariest part of it all.",Jeepers Creepers
595,Aelfwyn,Brain-Dead Garbage,1,17 January 2010,"The only thing more appalling than this movie itself is the knowledge that anyone actually enjoyed it. I can only assume the people who rate it highly were drunk, or stoned out of their minds, and they thought it was a comedy. Perhaps if I'd been intoxicated enough, I too might have been able to laugh at it -- but it would have taken a LOT of intoxication to overcome such an insultingly stupid movie.It was 90 minutes of relentlessly bad acting (both over- and under-), glaringly showcased by trite and unimaginative direction, and even further spoiled (to whatever extent that it was possible) by pathetically low-budget special effects. And all in service to a plot so incoherent and devoid of purpose that even the characters themselves don't appear to have any good reason to go on living -- and I couldn't even feel appropriately apathetic about their meaningless lives, because my loathing for the movie grew more and more intense with every passing minute until (about halfway through the grueling torture) I ardently wanted every single character in the movie to DIE.And not in the GOOD way, either. Not in the way that one casually despises the horny teenagers in a standard slasher flick, and secretly delights in watching Jason/Freddie/Michael/Whoever carve them up.In THIS steaming turd of a film, the allegedly-scary Bad Guy -- the ""Creeper"" -- is cursorily explained away (far too late in the movie for me to have cared anymore) as some kind of ancient demon who comes back (from where?) every 23 years. Or something. Anyway, this ancient demon thing drives an antique truck around the countryside (where does he purchase fuel?), collecting the corpses of a seemingly unlimited supply of victims (whose disappearances apparently go unreported and unnoticed by any authorities), and he uses those corpses to rebuild his own body.Why he NEEDS to do this is beyond me, since it is repeatedly demonstrated that nothing can kill him, but that's only ONE of the many things the movie never bothers to explain.Oh, and evidently he hunts by scent, and likes the ""smell of fear."" Which is why he spends a great deal of the movie skulking around, sniffing things -- such as the insipid male protagonist's underwear, for example.Nope. Not kidding. He tracks the protagonist to a truck-stop/diner/irrelevant location full of irrelevant extras, for the sole purpose of breaking into the car and rooting through luggage to find the protagonist's underwear. This is presumably to get the scent, yes? So the ""Creeper"" can hunt him.But, uhhh... if the ""Creeper"" was able to track the insipid male protagonist to the truck-stop, then why did he NEED the scent? And even if we ignore that... once he HAD the scent, surely he knew the kid was right inside, yes? He certainly managed to use that scent to track the kid everywhere ELSE in the movie. So why didn't he just march on into that truck-stop and kill the punk -- and everyone else in the place, too? Was he afraid of all the beer-bellied truckers? If so, WHY? He later attacks an entire station full of heavily-armed policemen to get the very same kid -- killing some prisoners and quite a few of the police in the process, and shrugging off automatic weapons fire without a care in the world -- so why did he NOT simply kill the kid at the truck stop? What was stopping him? The moronic script, that's what. The talentless hack writer/director still had about half of his obligatory 90 minutes to fill -- so the otherwise implacable, unstoppable ""Creeper"" runs away from the truck-stop, just because a waitress screamed at the sight of him sniffing underwear in the parking lot.The whole miserable movie is FULL of inexplicable, time-filling idiocy like that.Why does the ""Creeper"" try to run the insipid male protagonist and his sister off the road in the beginning, yet FAIL to kill them right then and there? Because if he did, they wouldn't have 85 more minutes of crappy movie to feed you.After they've witnessed him dumping bodies at his Evil ""Creeper"" Lair, and he tries to run them off the road a second time, why does he FAIL -- yet AGAIN? Because there were still 80 minutes of crappy movie to fill up with MORE pointless stupidity.Why do the insipid male protagonist and his sister go BACK to the site of the body dumping instead of heading straight for the police? Well, because that's what people in stupid horror movies DO, yes? And when the insipid male protagonist has stupidly fallen down the body-dumping chute into the Evil ""Creeper"" Lair's basement, and is admiring the collection of corpses, why is his sister just lounging around up top looking not the least bit concerned about her brother's predicament? Indeed, why does she look bored and disinterested? (Well, okay, THAT one is easy to answer.) But why is she standing way over at the far left side of the screen, with all that empty, unfocused background on the right? Well, because the talentless hack writer/director thinks he's clever, and he's about to... CUE THE TRUCK! 90 minutes of that rubbish. Appallingly stupid, incoherent, PREDICTABLE rubbish.The only movie I've ever seen (in color) that was WORSE was Battlefield Earth.",Jeepers Creepers
596,zip311,Lovecraftian,7,10 June 2005,"If you were a fan of H.P. Lovecraft, this movie tries to follow in his footsteps and you can see how.It starts with what is a seemly perfectly logical (if majorly psychotic) crime, and progresses towards a supernatural monster which is of unknown and incomprehensible origin. The refusal to actually fully show the monster until the last few scenes of the movie is dead on Lovecraft.However, the archetypal 'mad seer' of Lovecraftian style is put into the story in an improper manner. She is given enough time in the plot and enough evidence is shown on screen that she acquires credibility to early in the movie. If this were a story by Lovecraft, we would not realize that the seer is sane, would think her a mad old woman until the last scene. Then, had Lovecraft told the story, suddenly seeing the monster would have made the seer crazy, made all of the pieces come together, and forcing you to realize that the horrible supernatural is the only remaining logical conclusion. Instead, the movie gives little by little credibility to each part of the insanity along the way, denying the final shock that could have accompanied finally seeing the monster in all it's otherworldly glory.That being said, it is a decent horror movie, and had it's fair share of surprises. I was expecting the standard corpse in the bag in the beginning of the movie, and was pleasantly (and horribly) surprised.",Jeepers Creepers

At first it really ticked all the right boxes and even had great lines such as: ""Is it dead?"" ""no, they never are"" which of course is true!! There were chases, scares, weird monsters, a good plot and even good acting. Everything you could wish for in a decent horror movie. But the ending was really sudden and the climax which was built up all through the film came to absolutely nothing. I have never been so disappointed at a film ending.The first hour was well worth watching after that don't bother. I give this film 3/10.Jeepers Creepers 2 was even worse, the characters didn't get much further than 3 yards from where they were first attacked. No scares, bad plot.

I went in for a re-watch because I recalled what a cool movie it was, but felt a little disappointed after the second viewing. As many people said, the earlier part of the movie has a lot of solid scares, but the thing that struck me most during this viewing is how much the Creeper's awesome and totally terrifying concept is let down by his appearance and scenes like his repeated acrobatics over the car. I loved the humor in the movie, but today the scares simply weren't enough to make me want to watch it again in the future.That being said, if the third movie ever makes it to the masses, I wouldn't mind seeing it on Netflix or Amazon Prime, but wouldn't bother seeing it in theater.",Jeepers Creepers

Overall a Jeepers Creepers is an exciting very scary horror movie its a must see.

601,leopard_slug,A real standout!,10,16 March 2006,"Impessed with the style and aversion to cliché. First of all, the killer is a good old-fashioned monster, not just some random escaped mental patient. Mysterious, unearthly, parasitic, but a very plausible legendary creature.Also appreciated that the main characters - instead of the usual boyfriend-girlfriend combo - are brother and sister. You really feel that relationship, she even calls him ""Brat."" It's very relatable. They pick on each other and mock, but you can tell they're close anyway. Great sibling relationship between the actors. The creepy Fla. backdrop with its Spanish Moss really lends itself to the dark desolate atmosphere as well.I actually liked the characters - this hardly ever happens to me during a horror flick!Suspense, wacky touches and a great supporting cast add personality.When you know one of them is going to die with that song playing, you really don't want either one of them to suffer that fate, because they come off like real people, not extraneous anonymous teenage victims you want to have killed off.And, to counter a bad cliché, when the sister offers herself up to save her brother, the creature DOESN'T EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE IT! That martyr stuff usually works in this kind of movie! Gives it an emotional, heroic edge... but, not in Jeepers Creepers!This one defies convention, and does it with style!

I didn't even pay for the movie but the crap that was on the screen was so horrible I almost left, but I didn't and I am almost glad.  To be honest with you, you should probably see this movie, but not more than once, just to experience it.  You'll enjoy it more if you don't pay though.

The characters have many chances to just run away but instead they watch the demon wasting long minutes of time.  I think that that is way too over done in the horror movies.

Then again, perhaps not.  It had some very cool moments as well as very scary ones, but between these moments the film seemed to struggle to fill up an hour and a half.  Most of the scenes that are meant to build suspense end up being too long and drawn out, as the main characters don't really seem to want to escape.  When you go to a horror movie you expect the main characters to make bad decisions, but many of the main characters' actions are simply inexplicable.  Just like most of their dialogue.  A lot of sub-plots are started only to be mentioned in passing or never again.  It seemed as if the movie was meant to be much longer, but some plot lines had to be cut for some reason.

In true time-honoured horror tradition they spy someone nasty doing something dodgy and decide, against, better wisdom, to investigate, but who cares. They get into a couple of scrapes, think they've killed him, only for him to comically limp across the car park in pursuit. The audience were laughing - this is supposed to be horror, not the spoof of Scream!!

The demon was almost as dumb as the two kids. Nothing made any sense.Why would the demon only eat some parts of some people? Why did he sew bodies together? Why did the cops not shoot he demon in the face at the end of the movie? Why did a demon drive a car? Why did that girl not know how to drive a car? The characters are not well done either. Their is no continuity between any of the characters. That retard kid was all over the place, the retard kids retarded sister didn't make any sense either. Their emotions were always changing without reason or explanation.Lets not forget the f****** demon. I mean seriously, what a pathetic excuse for a bad guy. He can kill hundreds of people no problem, but he has trouble killing these two retarded kids, and in the end he doesn't even kill them both? I wanted those two to die, they earned it.I'd rather fist myself with a cinder block than watch that movie again.",Jeepers Creepers

This movie can be watched many times i personally liked the acting of both the characters or maybe it was because i was a teenager when i watched it with my friends . I loved the beautiful Gina philips ,the siblings love towards each others was presented without being corny. Its not a movie like slash and dice,cannibals like chop .

627,Krissibaby88,Could be worse,2,9 August 2006,"This movie was a disappointment. The first half of the movie leaves you in suspense, but the not-so inspired middle and end are less than adequate. It is too inconsistent throughout. example: When the protagonists first see the demon/monster at the church it tosses several bodies down a pipe. When Darry falls into the pipe, there is only one evident body and it has moved out of the way of the pipe. Jeepers Creepers would have been much scarier if the villain was a psychotic man or a cannibal with the same habits as this ""bat out of hell"". It has too much of a mix of Sci-fi and realism.

The first half to two-thirds of the movie is very good. It paints the picture of a seriously deranged killer seemingly bent on murder for no reason other than the kill.  The Brother-Sister chemistry is well done and the tension builds nicely. There are a few cliches early but I could live with them. But once they get to the roadside cafe the movie fell apart for me. It went from something that felt like it could happen, (albeit very very very unlikely)to tired cliches and a killer I was longer afraid of because of his ""powers"" for lack of a better word. He went from someone who could be real aka Henry Diary of a serial killer, to just another horror movie killer that could never exist.

How anybody can still say they felt for the main characters after dozens of their completely idiotic decisions is beyond me. But what the heck, as long as the creep is scary right? Well, I must agree with the rest that the first 30-40 minutes he IS. You don't know what or who he is, and that works. But after that..... Well he just doesn't have it, does he? He looks like a copy-pasted Sith from the Star Wars movies minus the make-up and plus some wings. Furthermore, the plot is non-existent, the ending is completely crap, every survivor we see longer than two seconds is obviously meant to come back in the sequel, and I've seen better acting in National Geographic documentaries.Best horror movie ever? More like the worst: bad taste, bad acting, bad plot, bad guy who should have stayed anonymous, and  worst of all: it lacks any form of humour. Ugh... As I was watching this movie with some friends, the main comment was (advice to main characters): no... don't... ohhhh... too late, you did. And this for the full length of the film. It gives you an idea of the feelings you'll get when seeing this movie. Well, at least you can say it is an emotional experience watching it.I'm glad at least one of the two dies at the end.

I now think that he was meant to play a stuttering teenager, just not in a horror film, ever again.  He and Gina Philips made this film almost unbearable, though they didn't have much to work with - the script was born from the same place as the big scary monster in the movie (Hell, of course).  I really don't like to put people down like this, but I'd like to think we could expect more from a major motion picture in this day and age.

634,BlairM,Quite a let Down,1,5 September 2001,"I don't want to start an argument over this but...unfortunately I disagree with others who say its a great movie with all sorts of great plot twists. These days since Scream is seems that making an in movie joke about horror movies is the popular way to get the audience to look past the characters stereo-typical stupidity and other short comings.  Like ""you know the part in the horror movies where the guy does something stupid and everyone else hates him for it...this is that part"".  Something to that extent was said right at the start of the movie, what I would call a cover up for the fact that Guy is quite stupid.  ""just hold my feet while I look down this well"" he says to his sister.  It was frustrating to watch, there were extra pieces that weren't used in the film.  Like showing that the victims had their bodies sewn together after they were attacked...it never actually happens in the film as far as we see and the motive to sewing them up never gets addressed, and lets not get into the psychic character...  Jeepers Creepers starts off with this killer being some sort of mad man and fizzles out to just your typical monster fest, complete with excessive violence to cover the lack of purpose in the story-line.  To wrap things up, the ending was a lacking, in my opinion.  I won't say why because I wouldn't want to spoil the movie further (if that is possible).  I haven't been this disappointed with a movie (or its ending to be exact) since Planet of the Apes (2001). Of course that's just my opinion.",Jeepers Creepers

I think the movie might have been a little better if the kids weren't brother and sister and instead lovers--at least then there would have been a possibility of a sex scene (thats just my own twisted view--back to the actual movie).Complete lack of developement on any character and you simply leave not caring, not scared, not entertained, and most certainly very frustrated. There were way to many scenes where that characters committ to the obsurd action-reaction to any of the rediculous situations that makes you want to slap the characters in the face.Don't waste your money, rent Critters (a far more brilliant film) instead and stay at home!",Jeepers Creepers

There is no explanation as to whether the monster is a demon or what not, and little or no information given about it. Guess the script writer couldn't think of something creative or even copy something to make it more plausible.

The watching audience should be able to answer the question ""Why?"". ""Jeepers Creepers"" doesn't satisfy any of the normal expectations of a horror film. This movie was both written and directed by Salva, who seemed to think of nothing but marketing while creating his incomplete ideas. The bad guy doesn't even have a name. The door is wide open for a sequal, simply because the first movie didnt do anything it should have.

648,MeInTO,Great monster movie,10,3 September 2001,"I really enjoyed this movie. And I feel most reviewers are short-changing this film by lumping it in with other lesser movies as a ""teen slasher flick"".This was my take on it- There were some serious jumps (at least for me and others in theater) and definitely some creepy pit of your stomach tension. This I felt was achieved by the director not showing a lot and letting the audience figure some things out for itself (or have their own theories about this thing and its origins). Also, I felt the reactions of the characters to what they are witnessing was realistic-as opposed to what people usually do in movies today.If you are looking for a lazy movie-going-experience where everything is explained and wrapped in a nice pretty package in 90 minutes-this is not your movie.On the other hand if you are willing to suspend belief and watch a fun, scary, interesting, surprising monster movie where you may have to come to your own conclusions about some plot points -I would recommend this movie to you.",Jeepers Creepers
649,Euthydemus,Painfully Disappointing,2,3 September 2001,"Going into this movie, I was excited about seeing an actual horror film in the theater again, from what I could tell from the previews anyway. As the lights dimmed and it began to play, I could already feel the ice flowing through my veins, in anticipation. I was quickly thrown into a state of utter boredom with a long, drawn-out opening sequence of the two main characters exchanging dialogue. From there, it quickly began a downward spiral of disappointment. The acting left something to be desired. But, this couldn't really be avoided given the horrible script. The story itself started out on a good premise, but seemed as the movie lingered on, that the writers ran out of steam, and just wanted to finish with something, no matter what it was. The special FX were terrible. I grant that it is a nice break from the computer-enhanced FX that we've all come to loathe and despise, but not by much. The main ingredients essential to all horror films, which are responsible for adding suspense, were amplified to an exponential degree in this film, producing many painfully annoying scenes of stupidity. There were some good moments in this film, in particular the end-scene just before closing credits, not so much the actuality of the scene as much as the twist; but it wasn't enough. I gave this movie two stars because though I thought it was terrible, when all is said and done, it is a horror film. But, if I come out of a film knowing that I could write a better script, come up with a better story, and accomplish better FX than what I just saw, then I am disappointed.",Jeepers Creepers

The characters, while well acted, were written as such morons that after the *5th* time we get a close-up of their shocked expressions as they stare at the creature approaching them, I found myself wishing that the demon would get it over with and kill them.Still, considering how unimpressive the demon was after finally being unmasked, I can't really fault them too much for not showing the appropriate level of fear. They were most likely thinking the same thing I was, ""What is this rubber monster, and when is Buffy going to show up to put a stake in its heart?""Sadly, there was no slayer to be found, so the movie kept right on trucking, taking the unfortunate audience along, to it's horrifying conclusion.And I don't mean ""horrifying"" in a good way. I mean horrifying in the ""I can't believe that telegraphed the ending this badly, and then followed through with exactly what they telegraphed without giving even the pretense of a surprise twist, or even a sense of irony"" way.I can not recommend this movie to anyone, and frankly I would be afraid of anyone who would.",Jeepers Creepers

This movie was not scary, though the sound effects were annoyingly loud -- as was the lead actor. Enter the Creeper. Here we have a supernatural demon creature that is immortal; has large, leathery wings for flight; eats certain parts of humans for 26 days every 26 years; AND drives a rusted out 1940s era army ambulance?  Who thought this up? Even better: the Creeper's truck has personalized plates ""BEATN6U"" ... the idea of a DMV office issuing personalized plates to a supernatural demon creature is pretty implausible.  The ambulance is pretty cool though and reminiscent of the truck from ""Duel."" The makeup effects were sub-par. The Creeper's corpse collection was too shinny and looked like a bunch of mannequins.  I would have at least expected a bunch of blood and gore from this movie, even the eating scenes lacked any sense of remote realism.  When we see Darry's hanging corpse in the final scene, you can see through his gouged out eyes and through his missing skull to the Creeper behind him. His face is completely intact, but if his skull had been removed there would be no way for his face to retain its original shape.  The makeup effects were quite unconvincing and technically flawed. And the plot holes: A supernatural demon shouldn't have any reason to sew up its victims after it ate their insides; it shouldn't be  worried about authorities locating its corpse collection, thus setting the entire abandoned church afire when the two kids report their findings to the police.  (And we only heard about that over a police radio broadcast -- it would have been nice to actually see some good effects.); and it certainly shouldn't drive a truck. And what about a normal human reaction to seeing a supernatural demon? The Creeper assaults a Sheriff's Station: the entire department ineffectively shoots at it, watches it bend steel; eat people; kill most of the cops; walk on walls; and finally take a victim and fly out of a window...and what do they do the very next morning?  Nothing. They act as if it's business as usual.  And did they ask the Creeper to take a short rampage break while they changed into their SWAT gear from one scene to the next? When Trish's parents came to pick her up, she acts like [""oh, I guess Darry isn't here, I guess I'll go home now.""].  Hmmm. This movie's concept had great potential but the writers screwed it up. Had they written the Creeper to be a psychotic, methodical, serial killer they could have had a darn good film.  Instead they insulting our intelligence with a creature that they didn't develop properly and dialogue and scenes which were too shallow to be believable.

They are playing games trying to decipher the coded messages in vanity license plates and exchanging sibling rivalry quips and banter when, without warning, they are almost run off the road by a rusted, beat-up, '40s era pickup truck.  After a slight recovery, and a few more friendly jibes, tensions return to normal until the teens notice the same truck pulled to the side of the road.  Slowing down to watch the driver of the truck as they pass, they witness something that horrifies them to their core.Jeepers Creepers had tremendous potential at this point with a plausible and suspenseful build-up, but it slowly frittered away that ethos with a series of unrealistic forays into the supernatural and, worst of all, zero plot or motive exploration.Had there at least been some suggestion as to the motives behind the horror or maybe some more back-story to the evil character then suspension of disbelief could've helped the suggestion of supernatural forces.  But ""just because he's evil"" isn't good enough.This movie had the potential of being a truly scary and original horror movie, but it ended up being clichéd, formulaic and entirely unrealistic in the end.Clive Barker called Jeepers Creepers the ""one of the most scary and stylish horror movies he has seen in a long time.""

There definitely wasn't enough gore for gore hounds (except for the ending scene), and there sure wasn't enough suspense for normal movie watchers. It had a couple of cheap shocks, but you could see them coming from a mile away.Also, for all the talking that went on in the movie, nothing really was explained.

If that truck tried to take me out I'd be freaked out. It was more like a death machine. But the creature passes these two kids and they see whatever it is throwing wrapped up blankets and rope. So the thing left and of course the young man who is played by Justin long wants to go down the pipe to see what the freak was throwing down it. And just as he expected he found bodies. So he somehow gets out from were he's at and when they drive off it comes back and trust to run them out.

665,BlakDragn,Great movie.,10,16 September 2001,"This is one of the best horror flicks I've seen in a long time.  It was more of an older-style film, and wasnt nearly as predictable or disappointing as movies like Scream and I know what you did last summer.  The soundtrack was great, all of the songs fit into the movie very well (Although the lack of new songs might disappoint some people).  Even before you come face to face with the villian of the movie, the suspense keeps increasing.  There were a few bits of comedy used to lighten the mood, as there are in most movies, and those bits were golden.  The villian himself was a classic, and the story behind the movie was great.  This is one of the few movies I've found worth the $8.25 to go see (The last one being Road Trip).  If your looking for a scream clone, go elsewhere, but if you want a good, original horror flick go see Jeepers Creepers.",Jeepers Creepers

Not knowing the killer's origin really makes his character two dimensional. However, the story still has a very cool plot, but the ending leaves much to be desired. I don't regret seeing Jeepers Creepers, but it could have been so much more. Maybe we'll see a better sequel that sheds more light on the killer.",Jeepers Creepers

Dialogue between the characters sometimes had nothing to do with the story. It really wasn't all that scary. The ending was pathetic. I left the movie feeling like I should have been paid to see it. I wasted a good hour and a half sitting in the theater when I could have been doing something more constructive such as searching IMDB. :),Jeepers Creepers
668,csowards805,My Favorite Monster,10,31 December 2006,"I was prepared to believe that this movie was going to be another one of those campy, poorly-acted teen scare flicks, but curiosity got the better of me and I took a chance. The main characters were convincing as brother and sister, with their natural exchange of sibling sarcasm and harassment, and their reactions to the story's events as they happened were appropriate and believable. The movie's opening action was pure horror genius and sets the stage for things to come. I particularly love a fright film that can create the mood by taking common, otherwise normal objects and settings, and turning them into symbols of sheer terror -- a deserted country highway, an abandoned, boarded-up building, and an old, beat up automobile -- this movie does not disappoint! Add a rather large and strangely dressed character whose face isn't easily seen and you've got gold! Don't let the teenage main characters fool you -- I was 23 when I saw this movie and it kept me out of my mother's basement for 2 weeks! My only regret was that I didn't get to act in it!",Jeepers Creepers
669,BillyGerrish,SIBLINGS ROCK!,10,11 November 2021,"They say that your sibling (if you are so lucky to have one) is the closest, most similar person to you on the planet - in accords with biology (if nothing else). Jeepers Creepers begins with a long shot, the camera capturing a two-lane road in the country with a hot-rod speeding toward it from far away. When we get up close, we are in the car with a 20ish year old male driving with a 22ish (slightly older I would assume) female in shotgun. Music is playing, the weather looks beautiful so the windows are dropped, arms out the window basking in the sun and wind, sunglasses on - this is one cool couple, but they are brother-sister -- and no ""but"" needed because bro & sis can do this too. And shortly thereafter, you/I hear that familiar chatter that be no other than sibling shenanigans. I am that lucky @lindaglynch.The siblings were playing a license plate game - be the first to identify the vanity the vanity plate is going for. 6A4EVR is the first plate of the movie and brother impetuously blurts out- ""gay fever."" (Buzzer sound) ""Sexy forever"" (ding-ding) - sister won the point. They then pull up beside the RV, notice that the couple in the RV do not seem anything like their license plate, and laugh. Mind you, of course, this is Scary Movie Season, so the fun and games must soon cease. Cue the creepy jaloppie -- a punched up oil barrel that hisses, snarls, fumes, shakes, and surely smells. Like a demon-dog from the fiery place it closes on the hot-rod and it's innocent cargo. Speeding, swerving, ramming this brooding, brash bastion of beastily brass did do, and as fast as it comes is as fast as it goes with the rear-plate: BEATNGU. ""Beating you"" -- but after a con-job (confirmation-job) with miss google, it turns out that it is B-EATING-U -- which will come to make sense. I missed it; Linda would have nailed it for a point -- she's a super sleuth and really good at scattergories (not to mention a plethora of other more obvious things). So that is where my brain is at and where it shall remain -- family! Good job gray matter!While enjoying this opening scene, I found it curious that the boy and girl are brother & sister. IMDb is one of my favorite apps on my phone. Movies feed, my curiosity spikes, and that is most likely why I like them so much. With JC on the tube and IMDb in my hand, I take a sally through the movie's trivia. It was very nice that someone there had my same curiosity and said that the director, Victor Salva, wanted to have it be siblings to have no romantic stickiness attached to their actions while dealing with the beast. I was right on that one because that was the direction of my thinking, and my thoughts turned to my sister.I'd like to wish this beautiful gift of a sister upon everyone. It is always such a treat to spend time with little-sister, Linda. Now that we are more mature humans (I'll speak for Linda here) than years ago, when (now speaking for me) I would demo wrestling movies on Linda as though she was a Larry (my long-lost brother) and then call yellow snow ""dog wee-wee"" (even in the summer) to make her laugh so she wouldn't tell on me for the wrestling. But there is an innocence that is pure, true, and biological about a sibling relationship -- Linda is like my best friend and has helped me through some tough stuff - recently, now, always - by being a super friend who so happens to share the same gene situation. While watching this movie I couldn't help but thinking of Linda and how cool it would be to cruise through farmland and listen to music and play a license plate game (sans the beast in the jalopy) - now more than ever - maybe mainly because we are both in a pretty good place, we are great friends, and nature is at our back. Because we can! 🙏WKGerrish -- Scary Movie Season 2021 -- Chevy Chase, MD -- November 7, 2021.",Jeepers Creepers

The only scary parts were the extremely random loud noises, which mostly came from the ugly massive amounts of crows! I was so mad after I saw this movie! The editing was bad, and 95% of the actions of the main characters was so absurd! They were about to die and they would just stand there bug-eyed until the last second and then would ""run"" into their convenient gear-stuck chevy which would go into gear also at the last second!

And that annoying woman! the psychic, that ruined it totally, infact the whole of the packed out cinema was laughing at bits that were supposed to be scary! and what was with the ending?  that was worse than the ending to house on haunted hill or message in a bottle!  How can this really be the scariest horror movie in the US for 10 years?  I have seen worse.

Up untill about half way, the story seemed original, because it was a horror/road movie, but as I ventured on to half way through the film I just couldn't believe my eyes.  The two main characters that had interested me up untill this point were now fading away.  Each scene beyond half way was tacky and pointless to say the least.  The hint of creepyness or scare had gone and was replaced by what I can only describe as cheesy.  I don't want to go into detail just in case you are going to watch it, but by the end of the film I felt cheated.

After a good and scary start I soon found myself having to try and not laugh as events got more and more silly.Some of the dialogue is very entertaining but then the next minute it hits you with a line that may well have been taken from an episode of Scooby Doo. As for the special effects, again they started off well but then seemed to have suffered from over confidence as the budget was stretched to its limits. Movies can be scary without big budgets if the filmmakers utilise what they have to the full. After all, sometimes the bits that frighten you the most are the ones off camera. Instead what we are treated to here is more and more effects and make-up which has a contrasting affect on its ability to frighten you.Credit though to the the two leads who carried the movie well. If it wasn't for their performances I may not have lasted till the end of the movie and I'm sure we will see more from them in the future.Rent it on video.",Jeepers Creepers

I agree with many of the comments already left - the film starts fairly well, but then goes downhill like a jet-powered soapbox racer. It leaves a lot of questions unanswered - which bothered me for all of two seconds before I realised I had been given no reason to ask them. No reason to want to know more, no reason to give a monkeys for any of the characters. The purpose of this film was to scare me and it failed miserably. Everything this film does has been done before, and better. I've been more frightened of the bad guys on Scooby Doo than of Mr Plastic Fantastic Wings.

It was hyped as the best US horror movie in ten years and was plugged as being original and frightening. It had the advantage of having the great name of Francis Ford penned above the title and I found myself settling down in the cinema to what I hoped would be an interesting and innovative piece of film.The first half of the movie is good and, in it's own Texas Chainsaw Massacreish way, scary. An original plot line seems to be developing in a stylish way and the young actors appear to be puling it off - so to speak - with style. Don't be fooled - it doesn't last and the film soon lapses into bad effects, bad acting, and bad plot lines. It is almost as though the first half of the film and the second are directed and written by two different people. The first half tries to be an original, well though out thriller while the second half simply cops out and enters the realm of trash horror - which there is nothing wrong with provided the the trash is sold as trash. The fact that Jeepers Creepers is sold as ""The Best US Horror Movie in Ten years"" is a joke - pure and simple. What about The Sixth Sense, What Lies Beneath, the Scream trilogy? There are countless films that are better than Jeepers Creepers. Check out the Texas Chainsaw Massacre or - if you like monsters -  Nightmare on Elm Street.I would avoid this film. It isn't what it claims to be and as for being frightening - it aint. The Horror Film seems to have made a big comeback in the 90's and the 00's.

The tension created by the continuity of action (two kids, car, empty highway, nowt else) ensured some scares, and resulted in me watching through the knitwork of my sweater. The single narrative and the slow pace worked really well to create a creepy atmosphere.It all started going a bit downhill after the diner scene.The sudden jump from all out tension and suspense to indulgent grossness didnt sit well with me at all. It was poorly explained - more down to editing that a bad scriptwriter methinks.  The crazy Jamaican woman came across as a hasty addition to tie up the plot so they could get the movie finished.  It became an embarassing one trick pony...playing on the song of the title to ridiculous degrees, and left me feeling that it could have been a much much better movie had the plot turned a different way.

The other thing that is scary is that people forked over hard earned dollars to watch this blither blather.  $7.50 a ticket for that?

When you get pass that and the awesome basement scene, You then spend about half the movie trying to figure if the driver is human or something else.The movie is very enjoyable with it's witty brother and sister dialog, which adds softening humor at the start, but fades as the horror begins.

696,Bo Didler,My Review,9,14 March 2002,"This was the first horror movie that I deliberately chose to watch.I've been a fan of Justin Long since he portrayed the young 'Questerian' in Galaxy Quest.  Very talented. da Salva's done a great Job.  I jumped so many times during this movie, and I was watching it during the late afternoon!  I appreciated how he tried to avoid the Gore and blood letting that is so common in the horror film industry.  Relatively bloodless, and still gets the point across.  Less _is_ more.  Good one da Salva. Very well done.  The characters are very believable, and the acting is done well.Only a couple complaints, 1:  The bumper on the car is not very continuous.  (I won't give anything away, but notice that the bumper doesn't always look the same)  2:  At one scene, Darry (Long) is pulling Trish (Phillips) away, and she's struggling, and he shakes a finger at her.  There is no dialogue, there is just grunting as they pull on each other.  I was confused as to this, and wonder if maybe that was something that missed the cutting room floor, or if it was supposed to be used in another shot and somehow made it in.  I don't know.  I was confused, though.Besides that, flawless, well done.  You could really get a feel that there was a sibling relationship that existed between the characters.The ending was very disturbing to my 'conventional ending' sensebilities.  It was very fitting, it was just not what I was expecting.  I also throughly enjoyed da Salva's 'red-herrings' throughout the film to make you wonder what's really going to happen.  All in all, very well done.  I would love to see another like it.  Kudos to all involved.",Jeepers Creepers

The viewers are kept in the dark about the identity of the creeper through most of the movie, preserving the mystique of the character until the final scenes.  We are able to form an attachment to the characters of Trish and Darry, two average teenagers who are about to meet a horrific destiny.  Salva creates such lifelike entities in them, we feel like we know them.  We care for this hapless pair, clueless as they are to the fate which awaits them.  We know it is coming and we dread what awaits them.  The ending as well is exciting.  Salva shocks us when the creature chooses Darry and makes away with him in the night.  We pray the movie isnt over and that Trish will find a way to save her doomed brother.  Finally a horror movie outside the pattern. . .crafted in a fashion unlike other modern day horror films.  Gina and Justin bring to life the brother and sister characters they play.  I can only hope that Salva's next work is as masterful as Jeepers Creepers.  What else can I say but . . .PERFECT!",Jeepers Creepers
699,ieattapes,Another dumb monster movie.,1,13 April 2002,"Quite honestly, it's funnier than it is frightening.  (Perhaps it's frighteningly funny?)  In any case, kudos are deserved for the costuming; there were some very well-done bits there.  Everything else, from the acting to the writing to the directing, only smacks of incompetence, be it genuine or intentional.Hasn't Wes Craven brought us enough poorly-made horror movies to last us several lifetimes?  Do we need to be subjected to a rash of others from other equally maundering and hackneyed writer-directors as well?  Frankly, that thought in itself frightens me far more than this movie ever did.If you want a scary movie, watch Hitchcock.

701,arielace,Was good but disappointing for a 2001 horror film,6,23 October 2007,"Victor Salva's 2001 'Jeepers Creepers' revolves around a brother and sister, Trish and Darry Jenner, played by Gina Phillips and Justin Long. At the start of the film they are driving home from college for spring break. The Mise-en-scene and cinematography in these shots are excellent, showing the long isolated road of the long ride home. The brother sister roles here are played fantastically. Their constant bickering and name calling is both believable and entertaining. This is a brilliant opening to the film and shows that it has great potential. They are not alone for long as an old truck with a crazed driver starts to terrorize them on the road. This is then where the story starts kicking off, and the horror begins. Perhaps a bit too fast for some peoples liking, as not long after they see a strange figure throwing what at looks like bodies into a pipe, just off the road. AS the figure sees them drive past, it gets into the same old truck that they just saw, and starts chasing them. The truck rams their car repeatedly until they are forced to swerve off the road. This defeats the mystery of the truck, the filmmakers could have left the showing of the monster for later on in the film. Darry then persuades his sister to go back to the pipe, and no surprise to the audience Darry finds some dead bodies. The bodies aren't the best special FX, but the Mise-en-scene of the cave beyond the pipe makes up for this. This is where the film starts to go downhill, as soon as you see the monsters appearance with its bad special FX, the fear is taken from you. This just proves that it is always scarier to leave it to the viewer's imagination. Overall the film conforms to horror stereotypes, for example having a final girl; Trish fails to trade herself for her brother and is therefore the last woman left standing. Also the use of a false ending conforms, but was executed poorly as there is no real closure and there is no direct hint of what the sequel has to offer. However the film does subverts the codes and conventions in some ways as that main character dies, even though the FX of the dead Darry without any eyes is atrocious. Also the use of the song 'Jeepers Creepers' is different, and works well, but again could have worked better, with more use of the song.",Jeepers Creepers
702,hudsona,BAD BAD BAD,1,30 June 2002,"I'm wondering if the people that gave this movie a good review were watching the same film. This movie was not scary, it was not very gory, and it was pretty damn stupid.The scriptwriter spent about 45 minutes writing the script, realized it was a dumb idea, and threw it away. Victor Salva (I don't care if I get his name right) fished it out of the trash and TRIED to make it into a movie.Don't get me wrong, I've watched all of the classic horror films. The main characters are just too stupid to be believable, ESPECIALLY by the old classics. This movie DOES NOT REMIND ME OF THE ""OLD SCHOOL"" classics, it reminds of some new school poop.Down to the movies itself. Dialogue: Attrocious, examples ""Don't try and be a hero!""  Plot: Undeveloped, example: This crazy beast killer thingy terrorizes a town, we are left with several questions 1. Now what? 2. Where's the back story? 3. 75% of the budget of this film was used to buy alcohol for the cast, crew, and critics who said it was a good film.RENT THIS MOVIE ONLY TO MAKE FUN OF IT, AND LEARN THAT CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT SHOULD NOT TAKE THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE FILM, ONLY THE FIRST 20 MINUTES",Jeepers Creepers

It is not slow going at all, and you do not feel the characters are safe in whatever scene they are, which means that the audience is constantly on edge.My only complaints would be that the Creeper is (looks wise) a little bit corny and has been seen before in other films- I think that he could have been done a lot better, and could have been made to fit in with the story more.Also, in the first half an hour I am constantly shouting at them not to go there or do that, and just get the hell out of there!

Anyone who has given this more than 2 stars probably thinks Scream is scary It starts off bad, then goes rapidly downhill. The dialogue and storyline are taken from the ""Horror By Numbers"" book and just leave you cringing.So a brother and sister see a body getting thrown down a hole and because they are seen witnessing this, they get run off a road by something in a truck. Whats the only sensible option? Thats right, lets go back to look down the hole. Ludicrous. I have seen someone say that if it wasn't for them doing stupid stuff then there wouldn't be a movie..er no, they do stupid stuff because the film is poorly written and has a God-awful storyline.So, back at the hole, down which they can see nothing, the brother (I have no idea what their names are as its impossible to care)gets his sister to hold on to his feet, whilst he sticks his head down. Bearing in mind this hole/shaft is fairly long so sticking your head in will make absolutely no difference. Even Stevie Wonder can see what is going to happen next. Procedures ensue and she (shock,horror) lets go of him and he drops down the hole. Good grief. Not much happens, he tells her to get help but watch out for the truck. Bizarrely, instead of actually getting help, she stands next to their car, hoping that someone will pass. Hmm, isn't it more than likely that if the guy comes back, she's history and he's stuck down a hole? There hasn't been one original thought gone into this movie, and I've no idea how I managed to sit through 57 minutes of it before turning it off at the point where some man appeared to grow wings whilst lying face down on the road for no apparent reason.Just dreadful",Jeepers Creepers

I have never ever in my entire life, walked out of a movie so angry.  I wanted to hurt whoever gave the go-ahead for this piece of garbage to ever make it to film.  It was an insult to the idea of film, to the audience and I'm am incredibly irritated that they have some how convinced people to make a second one of these.

The fact that this was green-lit to begin with.,1,5 January 2006,"In a world were audiences are all too conditioned to the horror genre, the last thing one needs is to be handed an over-hyped over-celebrated piece of mainstream clap trap. Enduring this film was hard for me, because personally there was no spark. At all. The acting was shallow, and the plot predictable, however what really annoyed me with this film was the lack of verisimilitude. Of course, this is only a film. It's an art form that is never obliged to follow the realities of life. But, specifically for horror films where the point of the movie is to entertain and thrill, if not horrify, this film is a huge letdown. I'm not against the creature genre at all - there are many great horror films that rely on unrealistic predators (e.g. Alien) and these films still fulfill and audience.

728,Aussieblue_eyes,Was a writer fired mid way through.,2,25 January 2014,"Jeepers creepers could be two really good separate movies. Starts off as a brother and sister driving home for the holidays. They of course get to a lonely stretch of the highway and crazy enough a old rusty farm truck comes bolting up behind them. Tailgating ,hand on the horn and swerving everywhere . The brother and sister concerned they are going to be run off the road by a crazed driver with the number plate BEATNGU move over for the truck as it speeds past .Great , awesome, predictable start but not bad so far. Little further down the road they see the same car stopped at a small country church so the slow down slightly and catch a glimpse of what seems to be a man in a hat and large coat carrying a bag shaped like a body with blood on it throwing it down a large pipe coming up from the ground. The driver/man notice the brother and sister . Gets back into his truck and catches up to them and tries to run them off the road a once again. Afterthe big mucho brother who looks like he would snap like a twig insists they go back to the church and check out the pipe.It's a horror movie remember so of course we have to have some idiot with a bad idea to get the movie started. So going back to check out the crazed mans pipe and not king I the police is need. I'm starting to enjoy this movie . The brother proceeds to crawl inside the pipe with the sister holding on to him up top. Things get hard so she loses her grip and he slides down the pipe. Of course. At the bottom, he finds hundreds of bodies sewn together.I'm starting to really enjoy this movie . The brother gets out before BEATNGU gets back and they bolt to the nearest cafe . Getting touch with the local police to tell them what they have seen . Police go to have a local and apparently the old church is on fire burning down to the ground. I like this movie, my minds starts ticking about where this story will lead us . Old man tries to get young drivers to drag race him on the roads hence his number plate BEATNGU - beating u . But when he is losing he runs them off the roads, watches them die, gets the guilts so takes them to his secret pipe and tries to fix the horrific injuries by sewing them back together. Once he knows the police will be on to him he burns church down to core his tracks. Pretty good story . Nope. At cafe some weirdo rings up and talks about some crap and monsters and stuff. The man driving the car crazy with the body at the church is apparently a monster his named the Creeper who comes to feed on people for a week or so only once every 20 years or something.So The creeper has wings but someone taught him to drive , it's also not a automatic car so he must have had a few lessons so he doesn't stall it all the time. Quicker to fly for him if he only has a week to get food. Someone taught the monster to sew on a sewing machine. Would love to see him thread that needle with his weird hands and sharp long nails. He looked so pretty hunched over the sewing machine . The Creeper even took time out to get some personalised number plates for himself, BEATNGU actually stands for Be eating you. The creeper sure knows how to waste the small amount of time he has every 20 years . Why would you bother spending hours at DMV for a set of frightening number plates that no one guess the meaning to them correctly anyway. Then we have the church burning down. Why bother when the creeper could have easily just eaten the police that came anyway. Once we find out the Creeper story the movie just is stupid. Nothing gets answered and the first part of the movie no longer makes sense . What's even more interesting and stands out a lot in the second jeepers creepers . The Creeper has a thing for boys, he seems completely uninterested in girls.",Jeepers Creepers

Justin Long was a poor choice, his bravado isn't believable, he wants to impress his sister, wtf?? Horror movies don't have to be people making absolutely stupid, unexplainable choices, that's the hallmark of a bad horror movie, just the same as horror films that only rely on loud bangs and flashes of light or 'scary' images. It's funny how many people think this was an good movie, but then again the masses usually like crap!",Jeepers Creepers
735,e_h-40559,Brilliant Creature with fulfilling scenery,9,18 May 2020,The first half of the movie is the most captivating scary movie I've seen .Loses steam towards the end with cheesy unrealistic scenes.,Jeepers Creepers
736,igotseriousskills,lousy,1,8 August 2006,several things were wrong with this film1. they monster was eating the cops head and the siblings were just looking at him and not running away. WHy are they dumb enough to just watch.2. why did they even look down there. The guy tried to kill them for a reason and they were about to give him another reason to. 3. THe lousy cops acted like the siblings were crazy. Didn't they realize that hundreds of people were missing. MOst cop stations would pay attention to that. 4. WHen Derry heard the song he turned up the song so loud his sister couldn't understand it. They were acting like retards. 5. WHen the psychic called to help them they acted like they didn't understand what she was talking about. It was obvious someone was after them. 6. WHen the guy drove past the gas station. They were screaming and running inside. Way to make it obvious to him. 7. when the creature was at that old hags house. when she ran in they should have ran away. They just stood and waited.the movie is poor and Victor Salva is a lousy director.,Jeepers Creepers
