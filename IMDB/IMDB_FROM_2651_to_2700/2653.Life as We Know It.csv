0,SnoopyStyle,OK rom weak com,6,26 October 2013,"Holly Berenson (Katherine Heigl) is the owner of an Atlanta bakery. Eric Messer (Josh Duhamel) is a TV sports technician for the Atlanta Hawks. Their best friends Peter and Alison had set them up on a blind date but it went horribly wrong. When their friends die in a car accident, the two bickersons has to raise their baby girl together.It's not a new premise to force kids on single people. It's the go to premise for lots of gags. It's maybe the unoriginality of it all that devalues most of the comedy. It's been done before and by better comedians.Katherine Heigl and Josh Duhamel are reasonable romantic leads but this movie desperately needs a real comedian as one of the leads to do the jokes. It was not funny even before the deaths turned it heavy. As a romance, it worked well enough but as a comedy, it fails utterly.",Life as We Know It
1,claudio_carvalho,Pleasant Romance,7,20 March 2011,"In Atlanta, Holly Berenson (Katherine Heigl) is the best friend of Allison (Christina Hendricks) and Peter Novak (Hayes MacArthur). She is single and has just called off a three-year relationship and professionally she runs a bakery, is very well-organized and plans to upgrade her business to a restaurant. When her friends schedule a blind date with Peter's best friend, TV sports director Eric Messer (Josh Duhamel), their encounter is a flop and Holly hates the reckless womanizer Messer. However, when Allison and Peter have a fatal car accident, the godparents Holly and Messer learn by the lawyer that they have been named the legal guardians of Peter and Allison's baby, Sophie, and have inherited their large house to raise the girl. Having in common only their love for Sophie, Holly and Messer have their lives turned upside-down and need to support each other to keep the girl with them and honor the wishes of their best friends.""Life as We Know It"" is a pleasant romance, despite the tragedy and predictability of the story. I usually like the films of the gorgeous Katherine Heigl and the practically unknown Josh Duhamel is hilarious in the role of a wolf. Their chemistry is awesome, but the babies Alexis, Brynn and Brooke Clagett steal the movie. I believe that everybody that is experienced father or mother will recall their first experiences as parents and will love the troubles of Holly and Messer. My vote is seven.

2,moonspinner55,"Likable stars on diaper duty...fuzzy, feel-good rom-com with instant infant",5,29 January 2012,"Fixed up on a blind date by mutual friends, a bakery shop owner (Katherine Heigl) and a womanizing bachelor (Josh Duhamel) share an instant dislike; but, after their friends are suddenly killed in a car accident, the bickering un-sweethearts discover they've been awarded joint custody of the couple's infant daughter (along with their expansive two-story home--mortgage-free!). Awesomely-extended romantic-comedy-with-child is occasionally overbearing and written at a tasteless level, with the usual quota of poo-poo jokes and slung baby food. The leads, along with a colorful cast of supporting players, certainly make it tolerable (Heigl, in particular, is very adept with the changing rhythms of the film's bumpy tone), but it's a wasted effort. Director Greg Berlanti steers the final act to a feel-good finish, but even this commercial bow seems tied too tightly. ** from ****",Life as We Know It
3,tavm,Life as We Know It is an okay rom-com/drama if you're in the mood,5,27 June 2011,"Okay, so Life as We Know It is a rom-com with some drama thrown in as it concerns two people on a blind date that turns disastrous the moment they meet but they can't get away from each other since each is a friend of one of a married couple that just had a baby. And then that married couple is killed in a car accident with the will revealing that the mismatched friends are their baby's new caregivers. I'll just stop there and just say that while I didn't think this movie was all that funny, and I didn't completely believe their falling in love when they did, I did appreciate that the movie did put some realism concerning the complications of raising a baby, financial duties concerning the house, and how jobs that take you away from your loved ones can affect lives. At least the characters aren't close to being one-dimensional like I feared so that's a plus. So on that note, Life as We Know It is worth a look if you're interested.",Life as We Know It
4,neil-476,Utterly utterly formulaic,6,14 October 2010,"Sometimes a spoiler warning is just a precaution: on this occasion I shall be revealing plot developments ie. it is a real spoiler warning.There is a fairly standard template for the romantic comedy: we are introduced to a couple who appear to be chalk and cheese although we have an inkling that they are ideally suited to each other: they are thrown together by virtue of a maguffin: in the course of resolving the maguffin they discover love for each other: a last minute plot wrinkle drives them apart: various manoeuverings bring them back together, albeit not without an element of panic.Life As We Know It fits this template perfectly. Holly (Katherine Heigl) is an ambitious, focused patisserie owner who dislikes Messer (Josh Duhamel), a hedonistic, laid back TV sports assistant director. They are godparents to Sophie, the baby daughter of their friends Allison and Peter. The maguffin is that when Allison and Peter are killed in a car accident, they find themselves guardians of Sophie and romance duly ensues. Messer is offered a dream job in another city and this drives them apart, but they get back together in the end.The thing is, they shouldn't have got back together. Messer accepting the job was absolutely right for him, and Holly taking up with nice, handsome paediatrician Sam (Josh Lucas), who she had fancied since before the maguffin (and vice versa) was exactly right for her. I would have respected this film more if it had gone with something realistic and credible instead of the trite formula.Katherine Heigl can play parts like this in her sleep, and it comes as no surprise to find her doing so here (and perhaps it is plot relevant too!). She is as gorgeous as ever, but completely forgets to be sexy. I am familiar with Josh Duhamel's name, but the only time I have seen his face is on the front of Johnny Knoxville's head - the resemblance is so strong that I was expecting something to whack him in the testicles at any moment. And the plot demanded that they have no chemistry for at least the first half of the movie, and they didn't. Then the plot demanded that they should have chemistry, but they still didn't.I must say that the short section dealing with the deaths of Allison and Peter was dealt with well. But most of the laughs were obvious stuff, smelly diapers and the like.",Life as We Know It
5,anaconda-40658,Garbage As We Know It.,2,1 December 2015,"Life As We Know It (2010): Dir: Peter Berlanti / Cast: Katherine Heigl, Josh Duhamel, Josh Lucas, Britt Flatmo, Melissa McCarthy: There is nothing about this lame-ass romantic drivel that could not be recited within five minutes. It regards those unpredicted circumstances that invade your life in which you are not prepared, such as sitting through the entire running time of this sh*t. After an accident, Katherine Heigl and Josh Duhamel are left to care for the orphaned one year old. Never mind the fact that these idiot friends seem to believe that these two individuals should be together despite the fact that they really dislike each other. Not to worry though because as formulas go, they will grow to love each other and accept the responsibility while filling some viewers with gitty feelings while others reach for the vomit bag. Director Peter Berlanti attempts to deliver a message about the struggles of parenting but the screenplay clearly is just a jerk-off formula driven travesty. Heigl wants to expand her bakery. Duhamel wishes to be promoted in the sports directing field. Both have situations where the baby becomes a burden, plus that case worker who shows up at the most inopportune moments. They also have those ever familiar diaper changing dilemmas as well as Heigl getting food spit in her face. In supporting roles are Josh Lucas as a doctor whom briefly romances Heigl, and Britt Flatmo as a ""baby whisperer."" We also have Melissa McCarthy as a mother who in bad blood with these two idiots. As life has it, this film is cheap and contains not a shred of originality. Go figure. Score: 2 / 10",Life as We Know It
6,phd_travel,Predictable,3,16 January 2011,"Very predictable but its to be expected in this kind of comedy. It just doesn't have enough funny situations and the last third really drags along with its pseudo drama. Heigl has been making a career playing girls who can't find love easily and are quite cutely desperate. But she is just too big and beautiful to be convincing in that kind of role. Josh Duhamel is OK for the role as a man who doesn't want to be tied down. The new baby cuteness is watchable for a while. But its not quite enough for an entire movie.Watch it if you have nothing else to watch or are a huge fan of Heigl. But it's not really worth making time for. Not one of the better Heigl romantic comedies - I liked ""Killers"" or ""the Ugly Truth"" better.",Life as We Know It
7,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Life as We Know It,6,17 October 2010,"The talk about town for this film revolves around a similar fiasco about how we in Singapore are so straight laced that we have to substitute ""Shagged"" with ""Shioked"" and now with this film, the poster which I thought was hilarious involving both Josh Duhamel and the kid in their respective diapers and bottles being chased after by Katherine Heigl, got removed and in place a rather creative shot from a first person baby's perspective of the two adults fussing over her, but well, you get the point. An adult in his underwear cannot make it to a movie poster. Got it.Anyway Life as We Know It talks about how having a child is usually a planned affair, where a couple consciously knows about the trade off involving the loss of freedom, and a collective effort required by two (or probably more, depending on the help rendered from an extended family if any) to raise another human being to provide love and care and to instill good values and principles. Even if baby comes along unplanned, well, it's one's own flesh and blood. But to dump a baby onto someone else's lap is something irresponsible, but for reasons explained in the film, becomes the basic premise here.With the demise of their respective best friends, Holly Berenson (Ketherine Heigl) and Eric Messer (Josh Duhamel) become saddled with joint guardianship of their less than one year old Sophie (played by triplets Alexis, Brynn and Brooke Clagett) together with a house that has its mortgage paid for by itself. But Holly and Messer (as he prefers to be called) are anywhere near chummy, which leads to the various episodic trials and tribulations that come their way since they are totally unprepared with parenthood, and have their respective careers to take care of which inevitably get turned upside down. However this is a typical Hollywood romantic comedy which is in reverse, where the inevitable melting of hearts amongst the opposites happen to provide that little dramatic complication.This is a pro-family film that shows how a child can bring two hearts together or reinforce positive emotions, and tells of the virtue and importance of proper child support provided during the formative toddler years. While the premise may seem to be a little far-fetched, it does contain enough convenience in the story to ensure the child gets to where she's supposed to, with all the legal wrangling quickly passed over, and how other family members get logically and comically weeded out.Katherine Heigl continues to rake up a series of handsome co-stars in her string of romantic comedies, with the likes of Ashton Kutcher in Killers, Gerard Butler in The Ugly Truth, and James Marsden in 27 Dresses, and continues with her usual fine comic timing and stereotypical neurotic, control freak female character portrayals. Romantic comedies work only if the leads are charming, and somehow Ian Deitchman and Kristin Rusk Robinson's story make no qualms about explicitly mentioning how hot Josh Duhamel's Messer is, and he literally drips machismo.But the scene stealer here hands down are young girls Alexis, Brynn and Brooke Clagett who rotate in their Sophie portrayal. I've not seen an ugly baby movie (who would want to make that?) and kudos to the filmmakers as they capture the trio in the best light and right moments that will just make your heart go ""Aww..."". One can imagine the kind of patience and reshoots required with children on the set, and full marks go to effort in making these scenes a success, because if the child doesn't tug at anyone's heartstrings, it'll become a stretch for the two hotties in the film to want to give up their lives for her rather than to opt for easier alternatives.Predictable fare filled with caricatures are what make Hollywood romantic comedies tick, and this one is no different. For dates and those contemplating bringing another human being to the world, just to roughly know what you'll be in for. I'll certainly try singing Radiohead's Creep as a lullaby to the next baby I encounter, just to see if it works as touted! Parents beware!",Life as We Know It

10,Hellmant,Life as a sappy rom com knows it!,4,13 January 2011,"'LIFE AS WE KNOW IT': Two Stars (Out of Five) Katherine Heigl and Josh Duhamel star in this rom com about two single unexpecting parents who inherit their dying friends baby daughter. It's full of cheesy clichés and unfunny mishaps and not surprisingly was a box-office hit due to the draw of the two stars (mainly Heigl). It's directed by Greg Berlanti, who has a lot of experience in writing and producing TV. This is only his second directing effort. The film is written by Ian Deitchman (who has one teleplay previously under his belt) and first time writer Kristin Rusk Robinson. I don't think the lack of experience was really the problem here though, the writers and director delivered just what the studio wanted them to: another cheesy romantic comedy vehicle for Heigl.Heigl plays Holly, a bakery owner, and Duhamel plays Eric Messer, a TV sports director for the Atlanta Hawks. Early on in the film the two are set up on a blind date by their best friends Peter and Allison (Hayes MacArthur and Christina Hendricks) that goes horribly wrong. Their friends have a baby that they're named the godparents to and when the couple dies in a car accident Holly and Eric find out that they're expected to live in their house together and take care of their child, at least until suitable parents can be found. They of course have no idea how to raise a child and the fact that they hate each other complicates things even more. Still they end up getting along and start to see more in each other than they ever thought they would as the movie goes on autopilot and writes itself.The film is obviously predictable and doesn't contain a single scene of originality. The jokes are about 95% misfires and the drama is all forced and emotionless. Duhamel is adequate in the film and although he's not one of my favorite actors I know several girls that love him (mainly because of his looks but I think he's a decent likable actor). He can be forgiven for this atrocity as he's not a big enough star yet to really demand the types of roles he wants to (and he has done better work in the past). Heigl has made just one bad movie after another since hitting it big with 'KNOCKED UP', her one great movie (although I kind of liked 'THE UGLY TRUTH' I have to admit but I didn't think she was very good in it). I did think she gave a decent performance in her break out Apatow role but since then has shown no skill whatsoever and her choice of roles is despicable. There's not many actors I really don't like but she's one of them.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j95Zjdlcbe0",Life as We Know It
11,Robert_duder,Clichéd perhaps but fun and cute and definitely entertaining,8,14 March 2011,"At first glance it is very easy to chalk Life As We Know It up to being incredibly formulaic. I mean we have seen this story time and time again. But as with the case of many genre films that doesn't mean that it is bad. It does however mean that the cast needs to be solid, the story fun and unique, and it has to be entertaining perhaps more than just average. Fortunately Life As We Know It works in those ways exactly. It doesn't blow you away and it doesn't make any unique leaps and bounds and yet it is completely entertaining. Part of the reason the film works is because they also make sure the film is a romantic comedy and that part of the story really works. Chemistry runs high and the idea of being new parents, suddenly forced into the job adds to the fun rather than being the focus. I think what the film boils down to is the chemistry between the leads and it truly works. Although I don't necessarily believe that the entire cast was perfect in the film they work enough to make it incredibly entertaining and that is all that matters.I have a distinct love/hate relationship with Katherine Heigl. She's beautiful and down to earth and I loved her on Grey's Anatomy. She has had some good solid romantic comedies in the past and she works well in this film as the uptight organized Holly. She isn't the perfect person for the role I think but she does well. Josh Duhamel steals the film as he often does in his roles. Duhamel has charisma and it has really launched his film career. He can have chemistry with just about anyone and as Eric 'Messer' his wild and loose personality meshes perfectly with Heigl. They have great chemistry and their romance is what holds the film together. The whole fish out of water Dad story works well with Duhamel. Josh Lucas has a small but important role as the 'nice guy' paediatrician who gets the bum rush which is common for Lucas in romantic comedies.Long time Producer but new director Greg Berlanti probably took this project on because it is formulaic. I imagine this wasn't a big challenge for a director and he was probably smart enough to just let the cast do what they could do best. The supporting cast were all acceptable and served their purpose but there was no stand out supporters. Equal parts comedy and emotion and all the makings of a great romantic comedy means this is the perfect date night movie, entertaining and fun and anyone can enjoy it. Definitely worth checking out because as formulaic and predictable as some might claim it is you won't be disappointed. 8/10",Life as We Know It
12,inkblot11,"Know this, romantic comedy fans.....this is a wonderful new view",7,11 November 2010,"Holly (Katherine Heigl) and Eric, known by his last name, Messer (Josh Duhamel) were once set up by close married friends, wife Alison (Christina Hendricks) and hubby Peter (Hayes MacArthur). The date lasted all of five minutes, as each took an instant dislike to one another and rang the gong. However, they have had to see each other over the last few years, at parties and gatherings thrown by the wedded couple. More so now that the A and P have a little girl named Sophie. A self-described ""control freak"", Holly owns a gourmet food shop called Fraiche, in the Atlanta area, where she has grown interested in a frequent customer, Dr. Sam (Josh Lucas). For his part, Messer works in sports television, operating cameras for the Hawks basketball franchise and he has a new girlfriend every five minutes. Into this setting comes a shock. Alison and Peter tragically die in an automobile crash and, unbelievably, leave custody of Sophie to their unmarried pals, Holly and Messer. After the tears and agony, the we-loathe-each-other couple realize that they must move into their friends' large home and learn how to take care of their new daughter, with civility. But, as both are practicing ""on the job parenting"", they still have quite a few arguments and upsets. Juggling jobs and babies is a tough job, they quickly concede. Could it also be that, despite Dr. Sam's growing presence and Messer's frequent galpals, that Holly and Messer will actually grow to like each other? Maybe! This is a lovely new entry into the world of romantic comedies, for all of the genre's dedicated fans. Despite the tried and true theme of mismatched, argumentative folks falling in love, the movie has a few new twists, as a result of the adorable baby. Heigl and Duhamel are perfectly wonderful as the main couple, although both are such pros in this type of film that they should probably try to ""branch out"" in their next projects or be stuck in this kind of thing forever. The supporting cast is also very fine, as are the settings, costumes, and camera work. Add on the zesty direction and polished, humorous storyline and a winning flick emerges. Therefore, Hollywood, please send us more movies like this one, and fans, take time out from life's more mundane practices and make plans for a view.",Life as We Know It

14,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,3,10 February 2011,"Life As We Know It Nowadays, it's commonplace for two people who don't love each other to raise their child in a hostile environment.Surprisingly, while the at odds couple in this rom-com are doing just that, they're doing so with someone else's kid.When they first meet on a blind date set-up by their mutual friends Peter and Alison (Christina Hendricks), uptight Holly (Katherine Heigl) and free-spirited Messer (Josh Duhamel) vow to never see each other again.But their common connection makes that impossible. And when their friends are killed in a car accident, the pair must put aside their differences and assume custody of the couple's 1- year-old daughter and palatial home.With Katherine Heigl portraying another lovesick female browbeating a deadbeat male into submission, Life As We Know It is redundant.

17,Rodrigo_Amaro,Utterly Predictable But Good,7,3 April 2011,"There must be a magnet between me and this type of comedies that we cannot live without each other, and once in a while I need to see something that I know how it's gonna be, how it's gonna end, because 1) those flicks are easy to predict and 2) sometimes, we reach for a desire that something or someone will surprise us in colorful comedies like this. Well, ""Life As We Know It"" (suggestive title for what I just said) moved just in the way I thought it would move for good and bad. The result as a whole is a nice film with a charming couple as lead actors.It goes to tell us the story of Eric (Josh Duhamel) and Holly (Katherine Heigl), two people with nothing in common united by their friends who made a surprising bond that they should raise their orphaned baby in case of their death, which eventually happens. Now, these two workaholic figures with different lifestyles and way of thinking will join forces and lots of scream against each other trying to raise a baby, something they never did in their lives. Now comes the part where you can see how predictable this film gets. Did the main couple hate each other so much and the way we see that is throughout some funny lines and almost hilarious moments? Check! Some of them will find a nice partner to be romantically involved with? Check! While raising the baby lots of gross humor, a crying baby all the time will be part of this flick? Check! After spending so much time with the kid and with each other Holly and Eric finally will fall in love? Check! And then comes the time when they break up, and the movie seems like ""Speed"" in the part where the bus has come to the end of the road and something impossible (but totally predictable) will happen to them? Check! So, if you like all of this fore-mentioned things this movie is for you! But why this film works and doesn't work? It works because Duhamel and Heigl have an amazing chemistry despite some bad jokes here and there, both in drama and in comedy scenes; the story goes okay and has things we can all enjoy if we're not too much demanding. But it doesn't work in a few levels while being very funny before the tragic event that changes everyones lives, there was some weak things that seemed unnoticed by the writers (e.g. Eric and Holly hate each other, their friends just died and he still acts cold towards her? Unexcusable!); the social worker who meets with them was created for comical purposes and it backfired badly, since she was too much goofy, annoying, and the writers while insisting in being serious at points could have make of this character the serious weight of the film, something to really balance the well humored film. At last, the ending could have been so much better if they picked the less expected one and the more realistic, I would say! Not to mention, that the subject received better and funnier treatment in pictures like ""Baby Boom"" and ""Raising Helen"". If the movie gets into a more dramatic level at many times, the comedy helps a little when these two are trying to do whatever to make the baby sleep or get calm (and that includes improvising a funny song or sings Radiohead's 'Creep' to make her sleep), a taxi driver (Faizon Love) friend of Eric hired as nanny while he's at work, and some nice moments between Holly and a doctor (Josh Lucas) that becomes her love interest. And of course, a bunch of scenes with the couple hanging out with their other friends all married, few good things about it. Clichés after clichés but somehow it manages to be a good entertaining film with some positive things. 7/10",Life as We Know It
18,Thanos_Alfie,Nice movie...,6,19 October 2021,"""Life as We Know It"" is a Comedy - Romance movie in which we watch a man and a woman becoming caregivers of a young girl after their best friends die in a car accident. They both have to figure out how they will make it work and understand that their lives will never be the same.I liked this movie because it had a simple but an interesting plot with a beautiful meaning. It presented how easy and fast can change something in the life of a person and how difficult is to not only understand that change but to continue your life. The direction which was made by Greg Berlanti was good and he presented very well his main characters something that made us relate to them. The interpretations of both Katherine Heigl who played as Holly Berenson and Josh Duhamel who played as Eric Messer were very good and the differences of their characters were simply very clever and fitted to the plot. All in all, I have to say that ""Life as We Know It"" is a nice movie to spend your time and it's very different than a simple comedy - romance movie because it combines drama with all the previous characteristics and keeps the balance something that it's very difficult to be accomplished.",Life as We Know It

At first the two don't get along under the same house but romance blossoms between the two. To be honest I thought this was going to be the worst movie of 2010 but to be honest I actually liked it.

The chemistry between the two actors and the baby was cute yet you kinda know what is going to happen in the second half of the film. That's Rom Com's for ya they are so predicable you don't even have to buy the DVD or watch the movie to see what is going to happen.The story was nice yet very predictable,the actors were great I saw Katherine Heigl in 27 Dresses and I thought she was OK not the best actress in the world but still this film is worth watching.I'll give it a 7/10 (3 stars)",Life as We Know It

Not a bad film, but not a great one either. Katherine Heigal was alright, she doesn't just play it as goofy, there is a heart to her character, but Josh Duhamel never really seems committed to this, he spends a good part of the time just mugging at the camera. He deserves better. Not to mention he and Heigal hardly have any chemistry. It comes across like it was trying way to hard to be comedy and drama. It failed for the most part.",Life as We Know It

23,estebangonzalez10,Rom-Com As We Know It,4,6 February 2011,"¨They love Sophie more than anything in the entire world, and out of everyone, Messer, they picked us.¨ Life As We Know It is a very predictable romantic comedy, with uninteresting characters, and a script I felt a 15 year old could have written. There still are however some funny and heartfelt moments that will make this movie enjoyable for its target audience. If you like romantic comedies in general then there is no reason why you won't like this movie. I am not a big fan of rom coms, since they seem to follow the same logic and clichés most films in this genre do, although there have been some pleasant surprises for me (500 Days of Summer, My Best Friend's Wedding, Love Actually, Notting Hill, and Definitely, Maybe are movies which other rom coms should try to measure up to). Katherine Heigl has to try to make a different movie very soon because she seems to be playing the same role over and over again. Her previous movie, Killers, was even worse than this one and in my opinion it's been awhile since she has made a good film. I used to like her, but now she just seems to be getting on my nerves and will think twice before going to see another one of her films. Josh Duhamel was OK in this movie and had several funny scenes, but I wasn't too excited about the chemistry between him and Heigl. Greg Berlanti (who is known for producing mostly TV series) directed this film and the screenplay was adapted from hundreds of other rom coms by Ian Deitchman and Kristis Rusk Robinson.The story takes place in Atlanta where a married couple is trying to hook up two of their best friends together on a blind date. Holly (Heigl) and Messer (Duhamel) don't get along from the get go and never even end up going out on their date. They continue on with their own lives as usual although they always run into each other due to their friendship with Peter and Alison. Messer is a ladies' man who doesn't believe in long relationships and thinks his life is great because he works as an assistant camera director for the Atlanta Hawks so he gets paid for watching games. On the other hand, Holly owns a bakery and is very happy with her life which seems to revolve around waiting for one of her clients to show up on which she has a crush although she doesn't even know his name. Finally after his 35th visit to the bakery (yes she's been counting) she finally learns his name: Sam (Josh Lucas from Home Sweet Alabama and Poseidon). He invites her out for dinner, but before they can ever go out, Holly receives a phone call that will change her life forever. Peter and Alison lost their lives on a car accident and they had left on their will that Holly and Messer should become guardians of their one year old daughter: Sophie. A huge responsibility for Messer and Holly who have been accustomed to their easy lives and don't even get along very well, but they reluctantly accept the task. If you have seen any romantic comedy from Hollywood then you can probably guess what will happen in the next 90 minutes of the film.The movie is predictable, the secondary characters are one dimensional and you don't even care for any of them, and Heigl is once again playing the same role she plays over and over again. So no, I didn't really enjoy this movie all that much, but I can't deny I did laugh at a few jokes here and there. Life As We Know It is just another one of those movies that will get lost in time and nobody will ever remember, although fans of the genre will probably have a decent time with the movie. The film relies heavily on the same jokes you have when a baby is on film: poop, vomiting, and so on. Still the most likable character in the film is the baby, Sophie, and that isn't a very good sign in a movie like this. The secondary characters in this film are almost nonexistent, and the film focuses entirely on Heigl and Duhamel's love-hate relationship. There really was no need to make this movie, we've seen it before in hundreds of other rom coms (this one even has the classic run to the airport scene). Don't watch this film unless you are really a fan of the genre.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",Life as We Know It

The characters have no chemistry and seem to go from hate to love in the blink of an eye. It's also just not funny. So basically it's a romcom that's neither romantic nor a comedy.This really feels like a bunch of people in an office somewhere mashing a bunch of tropes together to fabricate a by the numbers movie. No risk, no reward. It's sterile, annoyingly so because it really pretends like it wants you to feel.There's a couple of decent cameos. That's it. There are so many better options out there, even in just this genre that I can't imagine ever recommending this to anyone.

And ex-Grey's Anatomy Katherine Heigel, who can surpass Julia Roberts as the queen of romantic comedies if she chooses her material right.They play Holly, a type-A caterer that runs her gourmet desserts business and Eric, a laid-back bachelor and sports director, who is a ladies's man. Their date, set up by their respected mutual friends, doesn't go off as well. As it ends before it even begins. As both dislike one another with passion and that is only the beginning to come.Their friends who are, married to one another, have a baby and ask Holly and Eric to become godparents. Only two things both of them have in common. Loving the baby girl named Sophia and hating one another. But unexpectedly, their friends die in a car wreck.The movie then really begins as both don't know that they are named the legal guardians should something ever happened to the parents.

Plus Holly is beginning a romance with a pediatrician, played by Josh Lucas. And Eric still is at his, womanizing ways but that may change due to being with Holly. And vice versa!

27,p-stepien,Formulaic uninventive,3,25 May 2013,"Greg Berlanti dramedy invokes little laughter, whilst dealing with more intense life issues on a superficial purely functional level. Married couple with child Peter (Hayes MacArthur) and Allison (Christina Hendricks) ill-advisedly set up their respective best friends on a date. However the uptight restrained Holly Berenson (Katherine Heigl) is the ultimate mismatch for free-spirited kid-adult Eric Messer (Josh Duhamel). After the shortest date ever the duo come to a mutual understanding that any proximity is only forced by necessity. Unfortunately, when Peter and Allison die in a tragic car accident, their will pinpoints Holly and Eric as the sole guardians of their baby child and their estate. Despite the uneasy relationship the two decide to enter into a rugged deal, living together apart for the sake of the orphaned child. Suddenly thrown into parenthood both struggle to cope. Slowly enter romantic clichés.Will droll humour struggling to entice, instead attenuating attention, Berlanti attempts to find refuge in the easy streets, throwing in pretty sub-standard gags based on smelly kiddy poop to somehow garner any laughs. Probably the only well stringed together scene features Eric singing ""Creep"" by Radiohead as a lullaby to the entertained child. Unfortunately the tragic demise of the child's parents is formulaic and truly utilitarian, introduced as a gadget to have two independent soles suddenly thrown into dealing with an infant, aimlessly seeking laughs such a situation may cause. More dramatic issues such as curtailed freedom and necessity of opposites to cooperate fail to feature as the driving force of the uninspired script. Complications along the all converge to the expected point, but no depth is afforded to bring out the potential warmth and heart such a concept offers.The best on offer is the sympathetic and typically neurotic Katherine Heigl, who manages somewhat to focus attention. Unfortunately however her co-star Josh Duhamel fades into the background, barely registering as a character. Thus lacking true wringing drama, the movie also fails on fall on the shoulder of a romantic comedy, as the chemistry between characters is non-existent throughout, while baby toilet humour is bound to fail as a saving grace.",Life as We Know It
28,eric262003,Average Comedy Rehashed From Other Better Films,7,6 November 2016,"When I first purchased the DVD of ""Life as We Know It"", I was very turned-off by the sleeve of the cover. The photo shows Josh Duhamel standing straight up with a baby sporting colour-coordinated diapers and are in a similar stance slurping bottles towards their mouths while Katherine Heigl gives chase towards them. But then I had a change of heart when you learn that you can't judge a book by its cover alone, so i thought I'll give it a whirl. Sure when parents want to raise kids, they understand the positions they put themselves into and know the sacrifices and consequences they they must must face and the loving and nurturing they must provide in order to ensure their kids live a happy and caring life. Socialization will have to be minimal, assistance from extended family members and friends would be beneficial, and that setting good examples are the essential tools for raising a child. But what happens when a child is raised by unexpected parents who have never raised kids before or ever had any intentions until now? ""Life As we Know It"" is about a couple who now have to take the initiative of raising a baby unexpectedly and the trials and tribulations that come with the little package of joy. After the death of baby Sophie Novak's parents (Hayes MacArthur and Christina Hendricks), godparents Holly Berenson and Eric Messer (Heigl and Duhamel) have to step up to take the difficult task to raising Sophie (triplets Alexis, Brooke and Brynn Clagett) while trying to co- exist after their blind date goes bad which resulted in one can't standing each others. They never expected such events to happen as they had to hold aside their plans and their respected career agendas to raising this child which turns their life in circles. This may come across as a standard romantic comedy, but in this one there is a bit of a twist where two polar opposites struggle to raise a child while also fighting to set their differences aside. The love of a child can bring two people together or at best strive to inject positive vibes while providing essential support so that the child can live a happy and fulfilled life knowing there's people out there that love her. Though the comedy stems from the hardships of Holly and Eric raising little Sophie, the other comical idiosyncrasies stem from the legal processes, the overwhelming house mortgages and further career plans getting pushed aside.Performance wise, Katherine Heigl is still continuing her type- casted roles in her bubble as she once again is seen portraying hyper self-absorbed control freak domineering female characters towards their handsome costars. The key component to making romantic comedies sell is we have to have leading character ooze with some likability towards their characters. The script by Ian Deitchman and Kristin Rusk Robinson makes no denial that by having Duhamel as the leading male character, his charismatic manliness will surely make anyone's heart melt. The character that really makes your heart melt has to go to little Sophie played the by the Clagett trips. Every time they fill up the screen around them, the filmmakers know the right lighting and camera focuses to make you just say ""Ahhh"". It's hard to get children to act a certain way on screen, but director Greg Berlanti and company magically gives us that right amount of cuteness so that our leading stars have a legitimate reason to put every plan on hold to nurture this child. Sure this movie is formulaic with the familiar characters we've seen in this genre, ""Life as We Know It"" is a nice little comedy that is not memorable, but a fun film to watch on a rainy day. It's a quite innocent with subtle funny moments, though nothing really special. It makes you think hard if you're put in a rapid situation where responsibilities have become more mandatory than one could anticipate. Though I don't think Radiohead's ""Creep"" is a perfect choice for a lullaby.",Life as We Know It

When are directors of this tripe going to understand that you cant mix sitcom humor and scripts with dramatic solemn issues. It does not work at all. Scene after scene we have sitcom dialog mixed in poorly with real-life situations of guardianship, death, and grieving. It adds up to a bad dish served. For instance we have the so-called social worker going from serious to wanna-be provocative exclaiming ""You had sex"" in one scene - ugh. No acquaintance to say less than a business relationship speaks like that. The neighbors were vapid, the couple especially the Messner character did not see believable at all.

You were looking for a happy ending, weren't you? I thought so, but it takes some doing to get there. It's all in the telling. And, this is told quite well. And, to have Josh Duhmel and Katherine Heigl portray the God-Parents, well it just doesn't get any better. I think they are terrific actors and their chemistry was excellent.I said the sad thing because it is sad and tragic when friends die and then leave a 1-yr old baby with others.

So Holly and Eric (wants to be called Messer) are thrown into instant parenthood and go through those trials and tribulations just as if they were married and had their own kid. Well, almost. Many parents will see themselves in here.As far as the comedy goes, it was very good and I got a lot of laughs throughout starting with the first diaper change. Yes, that's always a good starter duty for new parents. The audience patiently waits for that one. Violence: No. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Not really, but Heigl does mouth an F-bomb.

33,jon.h.ochiai,Becoming A Family,9,10 October 2010,"""Life as We Know It"" is predictable. Not breaking news. 3 years ago Josh Duhamel as Messer and Katherine Heigl as Holly have a set up date by their best friends Peter and Alison (Hayes MacArthur and Christina Hendricks) that terminates in Holly's Smart Car. Holly despises Messer way too much. Life happens and tragedy unfolds. Peter and Alison die in a car accident. In their will, unbeknownst to Messer and Holly, the Novaks' name them as legal guardians to their 1 year-old daughter Sophie. Reluctantly, Messer and Holly agree to move into the Novaks' house, and raise Sophie until they can figure this out. Did Alison and Peter know something that Holly and Messer were clueless to? Do they fall in love, and transform into loving parents? Come on, we're smart and have seen our share of romantic comedies. Narrative surprise is not the strong suit of Ian Deitchman and Kristin Rusk Robinson's screenplay. In spite of all this, ""Life as We Know It"" is touching romantic comedy. Katherine Heigl and Josh Duhamel are awesome, and have a natural chemistry. Deitchman and Robinson's story strongly evolves. Director Greg Berlanti expertly orchestrates the right tone. Although, ""Life"" is romantic comedy, the set up is heart wrenching tragedy. The future of orphaned Sophie (played by Brooke and Kiley Liddell) hangs in the balance of whether Heigl and Duhamel can get over themselves. Heigl has a charming vulnerability and authenticity as Holly, who has dreams of expanding her bakeshop and dearly misses Alison, her personal rock. Duhamel is a nice surprise. He casually inhabits Messer, the Player who really has a big heart, by the numbers. However, Duhamel never overplays, embodying humanity and humor. With Duhamel we cheer for Messer's transformation. At the story arc, he confesses to Heigl, ""Together Somehow we're a family."" At times we're smarter than the screenplay. From the beginning we see through Messer's jerk facade, and distinguish the good man that he is and great guy he can be. Holly is too obsessed being annoyed, to see the obvious. Fortunately, Heigl and Duhamel are smarter than the script—hinting at the underlying love Holly and Messer have always had. Chemistry conquers a lot. Validation comes when Baby Whisperer Amy (great Britt Flatmo) says, ""You guys make an awesome couple."" Listen to the 12 year-old. Heigl and Duhamel are an amazing looking couple that has a very comfortable feel. What Berlanti does well is populate ""Life"" with quirky supporting characters and nominal narrative twists. Melissa McCarthy is good as the seen-it-all Mom DeeDee. Andrew Daly and Bill Brochtrup are funny as the gay parents Scott and Gary, who faun over the strikingly handsome Duhamel. Sarah Burns is awesome as the social worker Janine Groff, who warns Holly and Messer about complicating their relationship. Burns is hysterically touching as she becomes their biggest advocate. Brooke and Kiley Liddell are priceless as Sophie. Though hers is not really a performance, she is just being. There are the formulae high jinx with baby poop and babysitting duty. Conflict is manufactured. Messer is offered the sports TV director slot for the Phoenix Suns, which would displace him from home in Atlanta. Holly starts a relationship with solid Sam (down home charming Josh Lucas), Sophie's pediatrician. Life is diverging. Here in ""Life as We Know It"" there is an upside to predictability. We cheer for Holly, Messer, and Sophie, because we see before they do: They are a family. Heigl and Duhamel are awesome, apart or together. They overcome a lot of the formulae. Being predictable is overrated, when you have great heart like ""Life as We Know It"".",Life as We Know It

It has all the expected clichés and the predictable situations the storyline would have you conjure up. Katherine Heigl and Josh Duhamel do as good a job as the script allows; I'd say they save the movie from doing much more poorly ratings wise.If you read the storyline or synopsis and think this a movie you'd like to see, then you won't be disappointed, as long as you remember it is a light romantic drama, because I don't think much more could be done with this story. It would be a mistake to try to make it funnier; the subject matter does not lend itself too well for a comedy. Many reviews mention how nice a couple the Heigl and Duhamel make so I won't dwell on that other than agree. The rating on IMDb is the most even and consistent I've seen; it's spooky how little margin there is between high and low votes.

As a mere film lover, I have no idea how the two leads managed to make this script believable, but they did. Katherine Heigl is a known, reliable entity who's graced many a movie, but the real discovery for me was Josh Duhamel who conveyed all of his feelings to me, another guy, extremely well in situations I've never really encountered, perhaps better and more agreeably than any other male lead I can think of. Now I'm not sure why. The guy's quite a bit more handsome than me and everything's done with a light touch, but somehow, he's effective and simultaneously non- threatening, if that's the word.Anyway, this film is far from perfect, but what it's attempting to explore is a bit mind boggling. How would two people who initially dislike each other find enough common ground to come together in the best interests of a child? You won't find a 'how to' here, but all the small moves and incidents rang true to me, and the result in the end, seems quite plausible to me, at least. Things happen when two people get thrown together like this and I doubt you'll have it illustrated more enjoyably than this any time soon.",Life as We Know It

I was very surprised as i do not usually see many comedy films on on DVD or at the cinema. I thought that the actors were very good especially (Katherine Heig) who played the part of Holly and (Josh Duhamel) who played Eric and the babysitter Amy (Britt Flatmo) The story is about Holly and Eric who meet in 2007 on whilst going on a blind date and everything goes badly wrong. then one day they hear that their friends have died in a car accident. They were actually the friends who set them up on their date. Soon after they are told that their friends wanted them to take care of the baby should anything happen to both of them. So they eventually adopt the little baby. This ends up changing their lives completely as they move into their friends old house.

39,jonathanruano,A Chick Flick that is not even that sweet or funny,2,16 October 2010,"I suppose many of the readers must be asking, ""What is a cool guy like me doing watching a chick flick?"" Suffice to say, the power of a woman over a man should never be underestimated. Now for the film. ""Life as We Know It"" is a romantic comedy, which means that its success or failure depends on an interesting couple and the plausibility of their relationship. A good romantic comedy should convince us that the couple is really turned on by each other, which is the key to making a love story seem erotic. To make a long story short, ""Life as We Know It"" lacks eroticism and chemistry, with the result that we cannot believe in the so-called love story involving Holly Berenson (Katherine Heigl) and Eric Messer (Josh Duhamel). And since I could not believe in their relationship, I really did not care about these characters and I was not the least concerned about whether they would remain a couple. This movie not only fails as a love story; it also fails as a comedy. Heigl and Duhamel are not funny when they are together and they equally un-amusing when they are separated from each other. The filmmakers did try to use the baby Sophie to compensate for Heigl and Duhamel's lacklustre performance, only to discover that babies shockingly enough make for bad comedians. Sure the baby can be the inadvertent source of toiletry humour, but that kind of humour just disgusted me. So essentially this movie suffers from two uninteresting characters, Eric and Holly, a boring baby, boring neighbours representing the usual stereotypes (example: the nerd marries a fat woman, who really wants to have sex with the muscular Eric, because he cannot hook up with the hot Russian girl from the Serebro band) and a boring plot.In other words, this movie is a non-romantic-non-comedy.",Life as We Know It

Two people who don't like each other have the same best friends, who die in a car accident,leaving their infant daughter in the pair's custody.The story shows the development of their relationship through their fostering the child. As a cinema gimmick it works quite well. We get to see how the trio become a family dependent on each other with love as the final act. Both Heigel and Josh Duhamel handle the roles well and in the end you are left with a sweet love story.My main criticism is I feel it should have been a bit longer with more trials of child rearing thrown in.

The plot bases itself on what happens if married friends would like you to look after their kid(s) if anything terminal should happen to them both. Enter Sophie whose parents perish. There are actually three Sophies but they only ever appear singularly and we cannot see the joins...The screenplay centres around whether or not Holly (Heigl) and Mess (Duhamel) will get it together sufficiently well to provide for Sophie as her parent's would have wished. Of course Holly and Mess have almost diametrically opposed ideas and ideas on life choices entirely designed on making the other feel inferior. Whilst this is going on Sophie is growing up and not all is as straightforward as planned.One of the most charming aspects of the script is its penchant for discovery, or perhaps a better word would be disclosure. We witness Holly and Mess discovering and disclosing slowly but surely through the film whilst all around them people seem to be sure the ""happy"" couple will eventually get it right. Perhaps it takes more than Sophie to do that though and that is where the film works really well.The acting is good throughout, and the scenes of Sophie growing up are sometimes a joy. It is perhaps a little too strongly ""middle class"" in places but it doesn't detract from the enjoyment.I give it seven for achieving what it sets out to do.",Life as We Know It

I actually watched this one after seeing 'Faster' and actually liked this one better. So now i know if i am going to watch romantic comedies, i'll definitely choose the ones starring Kathy Heigl over the ones starring per say Jenn aniston. She is a comfortable and often enjoyable presence on the screen. My fave movie of hers to date is still 'Knocked Up' and I also enjoyed 'The Ugly Truth' that she did with Gerard Butler. In this Heigl plays Holly Berenson, when Holly is setup on a blind date with Eric Messer (Josh Duhamel) by joint friends of theirs they find out its not going to quite work out between the two of them for the lack of not being to stand each other. After a tragic car accident claims the lives of Holly and Eric's two pals they are left to care for their 2 -3 year old daughter Sophie (sorry missed her actual age in the film, if it was said at all) . We feel the stress these two are under as they deal with raising an infant and trying to bond as a family despite all their differences.

And that date is so over even before they hit the restaurant thankfully. But they never ever expect that some day they will be forced to live together and on top of that punishment they will have some one else's baby to take care of.That's pretty much the creative plot in 'Life as we know it'. I think the plot is great. It's unique and has one or two good twists. Makes it interesting to follow and gives you several good laughs and tears on the run. This plot pulls it out of the usual romantic comedies and places it on a different platter. Holly is a single middle aged woman (played by Katherine Heigl- The Ugly Truth, Knocked up) who is strict to her own rules trying to find love of her life. While not finding much luck in there she concentrates on keeping up her bakery business. Messer (played by Josh Duhamel- Transformers, Romantics) works for a TV station and has his luck placed in blind dates with woman getting attracted to him overnight. But he is not willing to commit himself on a steady relationship which makes him a light minded every day fun loving person. These two characters have differences which sound like the earth to the sky but their best friends thinks otherwise. 'Life as we know it' is a little longer than most of the romantic movies. Maybe for 10-15 minutes but its not boring. There is a good vibe to the whole movie and some good co star performances as well which spice things up.Maybe bringing out a kid with whole lot of responsibilities in to a romantic movie sounds like a bad idea. But in this it works just fine and adds a totally different perspective. The kid is sweet and so do the things the couple has to struggle though ultimately proves that its life. A good watch. No damaged feelings or unhappy ending. read more at flickshout.blogspot.com",Life as We Know It
44,neenahhh,A romantic-comedy gem,10,4 February 2011,"I wanted to see this movie last year, but I just never found the time to. It's a shame because all my friend were saying that it was superb and I just HAD to see it. One year later, and here I am, typing a review after watching it for the first time.This is a great family movie. Just great. The whole concept of the movie was very nice. It had a little bit of everything and they all meshed. There was plenty of comedy that was ACTUALLY funny, not like all the other crap we've been given lately. There was definitely romance, here and there. The budding romance between the two characters were done slowly and tastefully. It didn't just happen, like BOOM! There was character development and plenty of realizations. They had plenty of time to warm up with each other. That was nice. It reminded me of When Harry Met Sally (though WHMS is still on the top of my rom-com favorites).I loved everything about this movie. The baby, Katherine Heigl, Josh Duhamel.. The agent was good, too! I found her absolutely hilarious. Especially in her last scenes. I liked Josh Lucas a lot, too! His character was very mature and sophisticated. I was kind of hoping that Holly would end up with his character, but of course, that wouldn't be the case. It would be nice, though. Sam's a good guy.(SPOILERS) The first half of the movie centered around Sophie. It shows Holly and Messer getting used to the role of being parents. Many hilarious moments, especially that scene where Sophie was beginning to walk. I laughed out loud. Hahaha! The second half (which is actually around the 60 minute mark) shows that Holly and Messer are beginning to fall for each other. I actually smiled to myself when I realized this. They didn't just fall for each other suddenly. There was build-up. Very nice. (/SPOILERS)To sum it up, I found that Life as We Know It was a great movie! Perfect for people of all ages, I'd like to think so. This movie would be perfect for many occasions- a date movie, a family movie, a movie marathon with the girls or just plain staying-at-home-on-a-Friday-night-and-needing-something-to-watch. This movie is definitely up on my list of favorite romantic-comedies.",Life as We Know It
45,bjones,Worth the ticket price,7,7 July 2011,"I saw this film with someone I care about; the theory being that happiness shared is happiness multiplied. It was a lot of fun. Like a lot of comedies, this certainly isn't brain surgery; or rocket science either for that matter. But it does touch on some very real, human subjects about life, relationships and families. In that way it is sometimes as much of a drama as a comedy. Both sides of that coin are more than average entertainment.The story is set in Atlanta, but it could be in any modern day urban environment. The two central characters, named Holly Berenson and Eric Messer, are ably portrayed by Katherine Heigl and Josh Duhamel. The plot is about throwing two people with opposite personalities together in order to take over the care of their best friend's baby after they are killed. They begin with an adversarial relationship from the start and we get to watch how their relationship evolves as they are forced to work together to take care of the ever adorable baby. The story - perhaps inadvertently - makes a strong case for arranged marriages but, at the same time, also makes a lot of good points on the subject of the importance and value of families.The production quality is above average throughout, having a slick, almost too polished Hollywood look and feel to it. I wondered who the maid was.The two leads certainly make the film, delivering above average performances and fitting the whole idea of the story as well as any two people could. I especially enjoyed Ms. Heigl's performance. She brought individuality, tenderness and real emotion to what could have been a stereotyped character. In the end I found myself rooting for them to survive.I also bears mentioning that the supporting cast is quite excellent. The most noticeable were Josh Lucas who was charming, Faizon Love and Melissa McCarthy; both suitably funny . . . especially Love. Which is as good a word as any to end this.By Bruce L.

OK we have had similar plots of orphan children being left with single mums etc so the plot isn't knew, however, teaming up these two who actually hated each other on sight after a failed blind date was going to be fun. Yes it was sad, and I cried, but I laughed so much as there are some really funny moments like seeing the motor bike travelling across the road without a rider and then omg the bus was priceless and yes funny oh and so many other funny bits.

Holly and Eric are given the responsibility to raise small baby Sophie after their best friends perish in a horrible car crash. Problem is, they can't stand each other. Thing is, this is a bad romantic comedy, which means their unwanted roles will only be a disguised blessing where they will find true love in one another. See where I'm going yet?This premise will sooner or later take us to a scene where small baby Sophie has unloaded on her diaper. Holly and Eric must change it for the greater good. But, they haven't done this before, so they are required to make faces that show their disapproval for, you know, poop. And of course, poop will somehow find its way on places where it's not supposed to be.Oh. In one of the movie's earlier scenes, some marijuana is confiscated. In bad romantic comedies, no marijuana remains unused. Later on, it's in the hands of Holly and Eric, and they use the sweet and innocent art of baking to consume it. Soon enough, the two of them are, I guess, having fun.Read more here: http://localmoviereview.com/life-as-we-know-it-movie- review/",Life as We Know It

Probably nothing remotely close to what happens in this movie (NO SPOILERS), but the cast and crew do a great job of taking a close look at parenting from a variety of perspectives and through a comic overlay of the would-be romance between the wonderful co-stars. Here are these two very successful professionals, caught up in their own very different routines, confounded suddenly by the hardship of losing their friends, the reality that THEY are actually the best choices as guardians to young Sophie (NO SPOILERS). As most parents and guardians can tell you, no amount of prior training or experience can make you the perfect parent but things come around eventually if you share enough love and dedication to the young person/people in your care.

This movie doesn't make it.The entire premise of the movie is that two people who can't stand each other would agree to take on the responsibility of raising a kid for parents who never bothered to tell them they were appointed as guardians.

Katherine Heigl and Josh Duhamel star as two people who hate each other - ever since a couple mutual friends arranged a blind date, which went horribly. However, when those friends die, Heigl and Duhamel's characters are jointly left with their baby. There is naturally a bit of friction. Both characters have to mature, to try and get along, and to try and raise the baby.The story is handled quite well. Just remember that it's an adult romantic comedy, and that it's not suitable for children. The story's well-scripted, and the acting was fine. The film had plenty of drama. But it also had LOTS of comedy - real laughs comedy, most of the time.

52,stephanlinsenhoff,"Holly ""... if you promise ...",7,23 November 2014,"... I never have to see him again."" Before the starting credits roll the introduction. A by their friends arranged blind date for Holly and Eric Messer that stops before it starts in Hollys small car. Both despise each other, angry that they agreed to this blind date. Not love at first sight, a movie title, but disdain at first sight: following the curve of Hollywood. The triad of forced togetherness, subtle interest, transformation to - what else: love. Predictable. Only the details are different. Always different? Not new either: a baby child is the reason of their warlike struggle. The child's parents die in a car accident and Holly and Eric are, without knowing it, as their friends will says, appointed to be Sophies guardians. For the child's sake they have to move into their house. Pure disgust that transforms according the credo of Hollywood to acceptance and, what else: eventually love. Can it be worse and bad as it starts. Hardly. The only way is not downward but the turn upwards. Eventually both realize not only to look but see each other what is behind. Not only look but see each other. Behind society, behind the family and our pretending: behind these obstacles is the real Holly and Eric. So much more interesting that love is as possibility possible. Did their friend know this, chosen them for their task? Of course had Sophie's parents not in mind their love affair. This they had to take care themselves.Why all these predictable films? We know what happens and how it ends, slightly different in each movie. Mirroring and recognized by looking. Seldom seeing us as we know what happens and how it ends. Hollywoods contract. The first date - disdain, not love at first sight. Then the working-through to come behind the fence where it is I myself. Then, when everything is done and the shining prince on his white horse is ready to come: the happy ending reward. After the 115 minutes we return to daily life. Some ten minutes before everything seems to go the wrong way with the stand-in-hero Sam (it is calculated: the last tension everything before the real happy end; he appeared before the starting credits.The title 'Life as we know it' is what the movie wants.

53,MatthewLong23,decent entertaining film,7,17 October 2010,"This movie was actually a lot better then I thought it would be. It has a lot of heart and humour in it, from what would be a horrible situation to be in. It tells the story about Holly and Messer, who meet in 2007 on a blind date and it goes horribly wrong. They are both great friends of the couple who set them up and always seem to see each other through their friends events. When they find out their friends have passed away in a car accident, they are told that their friends wanted them to take care of the baby if anything were to happen to them. This is a shock to them but they decide to live together in their old house, so that they grant the wishes of their friends. Throughout the movie you see them, trying to raise the baby with often very funny results. It's a very sad premise but the humour does not make this movie depressing. I am curious to see if anything like this would happen in real life, with 2 friends who do not know each other well would raise a baby together for the sake of the child. Katherine Heigl plays a typical role here, of an overstressed woman who is unlucky in love and Josh Duhamel plays a guy with no responsibilities who ends up growing up in the end. Overall a fun movie to watch and will probably make you cry a bit",Life as We Know It

Katherine Heigl does a good job being Katherine Heigl with her usual blend of vulnerable and cattiness, and Josh Duhamel just plays ""a guy"", a mostly self-centered skirt-chaser, so he probably didn't really have to work too hard, but it was heart-warming to watch his character evolve as he spent more time with the kid.

Katherine Heigl's and Josh Duhamel's characters proved that even after so many hardships and disappointments, life can end up so happy and full of great memories. I love the fact that both main characters hated each other during a long part of the movie, but then eventually fell in love.

57,Brandon_Walker_Robinson,You and your better half will be getting your money's worth,5,6 October 2010,"This was a good combination of a movie which contained clichéd plot structure but strayed away from being too run-of-the mill for this kind of film. In other words, it got to the places that you would expect but it took a different route than you might expect. Josh Duhamel and Katherine Heigl were good eye candy throughout the movie, and the baby (like most) was absolutely adorable. The filming schedule must have been pretty spread out to let her grow probably as much as a year older (progressively), as the film itself jumps through its seasons similar to how Juno did. In fact, one thing really annoyed about this and I'm going to throw it out there right now... we all know that the NBA doesn't run through the summer, so why does this movie show the NBA running through the summer? I know there are summer leagues but this wasn't that. Anyway, just irritated me a bit.There were many characters in this movie that had to help with the story's stability, but they were also in there for the minute giggles and frankly I could have done without most of them. Like I said with ""cliché"" moments, if you've seen one movie with these characters you've seen them all. Josh Lucas was the only person with a half-decent supporting role IMO.This movie was somewhat divided; I don't mean this just in the sense that things start to go well then they don't then they kind of do again, but I mean in terms of focus. The first half is very baby-centric, and the latter half pertains a lot more to Duhamel and Heigl, where the baby is obviously used as a device to connect and/or separate the two. Said first half is what I really loved about the movie as I just love babies and it dealt more with internal resolutions, but it was cute enough to keep me interested anyway.This movie works well with a female crowd, and it would help if you brought just one more along with you. Bring your wife, girlfriend, date... whoever if you plan on seeing it. For what it's worth, I enjoyed it with my company. The 6 out of 10 is almost as much as you can get out of me with this kind of movie. In all seriousness, a 6 is good... a 2 obviously is not, and this movie is not a 2. On a final side note, I love how Pearl Jam got a song in this movie. Haven't heard them in one since Eddie Vedder's original soundtrack in Into the Wild.",Life as We Know It

Life isn't simple, doesn't always go as expected, and requires a bit of effort. This film seemed to capture a wide variety of experiences and faced them with poignancy and humor.I truly was expecting it to be all fluff, or very silly, and I didn't expect the film to tell the story as well as it did.

At that time it was 11% and I definitely wouldn't dare watch it if I'd known. The other day I watched it again and loved it just as much as the first time. Rotten Tomatoes is giving it a slightly higher percentage of rot today: 28%. Wow. It looks like the critics really hated this movie, whereas the viewers - quite the opposite. And I'm in the latter group. This IS life as we know it, and that's what I liked. The critics clearly are all childless, and they must be miserable people with low self-esteem because they would complain about silly stuff, for example, that Josh Duhamel is too good-looking to play this unexpected dad here. Well, hello, Josh is a real person, who happens to be gorgeous, and in real life with his wife Fergie they do have a baby and no one seems to be whining about the fact that Josh is changing diapers and dealing with his kid's vomit, so. It's not his fault that he was born like that, is it? And do we want to see an ugly guy in a romantic comedy? Duh. I like the fact that the story is really fleshed out. We get to see how it might work, and how the characters fall for each other and get to understand that they are a family. The screenwriter wasn't just trying to get from A to Z and to tick off everything on their list of what goes into a romantic comedy. This is a comedy but also a drama so you don't just see cheese all the time. All characters, even the minor ones, have good parts, they have something interesting or funny to say, so the main two characters aren't acting in isolation from everything and everyone else. That was cool, it made it more realistic and authentic. Other reviewers mentioned Duhamel and Heigl's chemistry and I must say this is the first thing that strikes you about this movie. They really do make a great couple. The script helps a lot, of course, but the chemistry is what they put into the movie themselves, and they are what really makes it worth watching. They work so good together that they make you totally root for them. And you kinda know that they must get together in the end but at the same time you're interested in the journey too. I give it 8 out of 10 stars on a romance scale. As a movie in general it does have its flaws, it's far from being a masterpiece. But as a romantic comedy, this is a very solid, enjoyable movie that is funny and warm. It shows you why some things are worth a sacrifice sometimes, and that's good. Raising a baby takes a huge effort and we all hate our kids sometimes, we hate our lives changing so much, and yes, marriage may seem like prison.

I'd like to see one conspiracy movie about this propagandizing conspiracy promoting homosexuality in the film industry and media.) The movie was sweet and enjoyable as a romantic comedy. The movie never convinced me that deceased couple had a truly close relationship to the singles to which they gave their baby and it seemed strange having an open homosexual male couple fully incorporated into the neighborhood in the ""buckle of the Bible belt"".

But seriously, I'm a parent and raising children is more likely to drive two lovebirds apart, even in the most ideal circumstances. On top of that, you've got a guy who actually leaves his parenting partner AND the baby that he had built a relationship with for a job promotion! Call me unforgiving but that move would leave me, as a woman and mother, completely hollowed out. Sure, he came back but not before making the choice to walk out and leave Holly and Sophie to manage on their own.

69,mdtscoates,Moview Review: Life As We Know It - A Pleasant Romantic Comedy,7,30 September 2010,"Humorous, contemplative, heart-felt, enjoyable, and tugs a little at your heart strings. These are the words I would use to describe Life As We Know It, a new romantic comedy starring Katherine Heigl and Josh Duhamel. The story is about 2 friends of a married couple that inherit their baby girl when they die in a tragic car accident shortly after the baby's first birthday.Although the movie storyline and ending are predictable, I felt myself getting caught up in the characters and story in spite of the predictability. I was thoroughly entertained during the movie, from the beginning set up of the main characters mutual disdain for each other through the end where we witness the completed circle of their roller coaster year at the little girl's second birthday.Of course we have the typical very attractive lead characters, chef/cafe owner Holly Berenson (Heigl) and sports TV technician Eric Messer (Duhamel). They had great chemistry together, and were able to pull off their scenes well. Holly's love interest Dr. Sam (Josh Lucas) brings the typical complication to the romantic comedy genre, and of course the audience thinks he is a great guy, but we're always rooting for the unlikely outcome that perhaps doesn't have much basis in reality.Minor characters of the nosy friendly neighbor, a gay couple raising a child, the Child Protective Services worker and a couple of others bring some fresh humor to the mix, keeping the lead characters, as well as the audience on their toes.A truly memorable moment at this Tempe screening, was when I and the entire audience couldn't help but laugh when they put up a picture of Phoenix that was obviously a cut and paste job of several notable parts of the area, next to a sign saying ""Phoenix, Downtown"" just to make sure we knew where it was supposed to be! There are plenty of memorable moments including the new guardians trying to get the baby to eat the homemade organic food of the professional chef, the toddler's first steps, and the realistic arguments. And a couple great quotes like, ""She's making the poop face"", ""Yes honey, I'm your mommy"", and my personal favorite, ""Having somebody help you doesn't mean you failed, it just means you're not in it alone."" Movie was about 2 hours, which seemed a bit long for a comedy, but I was entertained enough to not notice the time.I give it 7/10 stars",Life as We Know It

Said couple perish in an accident twenty minutes in...plot point one...and their will leaves the paid-for house to at-odds godparents Holly (Heigl) and Eric (Duhamel). They fight, they make up, they clean poop that apparently smells very, very ugly, they fight, they make-up, they do all the things Hollywood writers think are cute but are actually so clichéd you want to scream at the screen. Add some icky music and songs throughout, suspend all believability, and it's life as Hollywood knows it.Katherine Heigl proves in this film that she should have stayed on TV, because she is not a movie star. Maybe it's the material, but didn't we see her do this shtick before? Josh Duhamel is believable in spite of the material he's given to work with. Maybe it's baby guilt that keeps him around, because Heigl plays such a convincing shrew he'd have to be a masochist to do otherwise. Loved the Thanksgiving meal Heigl created prior to her final spat with Duhamel. It ends with her walking out of the kitchen perfectly coiffed and dressed in heels, no less, with this designer, golden brown turkey on a platter. Utterly unrealistic, and as phony as just about everything in this turkey of a film.Later, after still another moment of introspection, Miss Heigl finally sees the light, and our leads get together once again. Only in Hollywood. Why would anyone living a real life even care about these imaginary characters and their superficial lives?",Life as We Know It
72,Murder-Meatball,"I do not know why, but I love it!",7,3 November 2013,"I really should not like this movie as much as I do, but I can't help it. From every single angle this is just another solid, formula rom-com. I usually put such movies about 5-6 stars if they are good, but for some odd reason this one really, really worked for me so an 8 it is! If you like rom-coms, this is your move; if you do not, you would probably not love it – but to me at least it had something extra that hit all those bulls-eyes in my heart despite what my head was telling me. The acting is good and they sell this slightly odd set up and development impressively well. You know the drill: warm, funny, emotional and a cosy ending.

73,taybe130,A predictable life,5,5 January 2011,"A typical clichéd rom-com with a little drama thrown in. ""Life as we know it"" is pretty much a predictable insipid film about two successful people having to raise a baby under one roof.There was nothing interesting about their lives other that the constant bickering which arises just for amusement. I REALLY REALLY tried to laugh but the jokes were just terrible. Oh yeah! Poo is not funny in any way. How many times do they have to repeat the poo scene.I have to admit the social worker who checks up on them offers the best laughs. It's subtle and hilarious. If they could only work that in the rest of the film it would've been more entertaining and less yawn inducing.Recommendation: Rent it but don't expect any surprises.",Life as We Know It

In fact I think almost every scene with the baby was in the trailer, certainly least all the funny ones. The rest of the movie is a standard ""hate each other at the beginning"" romantic comedy, the kind Ms. Heigl always seems to end up in. Do I need a spoiler tag to say, you can guess where it's going to end up?There were definitely funny moments that weren't all in the trailer, so overall, it was a fun movie to watch. My wife was crying at the end so it succeeded on that front. The ""neighbor"" characters were a little grating, but the social worker character was my favorite. Overall, a decent enough 90 minutes of my life.",Life as We Know It
77,dorian06,Interesting from a sociological stand-point,5,12 April 2011,"As far as romantic comedies go, this is neither the worst nor the best that I've been forced to watch. Surprisingly the vast majority of the jokes in this film are actually decently funny, but the plot is mundane and silly. Why I'm writing this review, however, is because there is an aspect of this movie that is completely novel, one which I both respect and abhor. Of any romantic comedy which I've seen, this film is interesting from a sociological stand-point in that it is unabashedly honest about what women actually want and how they function and feel about relationships. Most movies of this kind have the soft guy who cries with her and shares his feelings and then dies and she's left alone blah blah blah, romeo and Juliet types of love. In this one the guy is a promiscuous lady's man(tramp) and an immature jerk who treats women like tissues, she's a prude and a home-body and through a ridiculous turn of events they both become the caretakers of a baby and are forced to live together (it's a cheap substitute for them symbolically just having a baby and frankly a very very unbelievable set-up, but what kind of film are we watching here?). What's interesting is how this all plays-out. While she gets to keep everything in her life exactly as it is (plus one baby), he has to lose his independence, his promiscuous ways, and is generally castrated and put into this father role. When he revolts from this (don't worry I won't give anything away) he's framed as the self-centered one and treated accordingly. Now I'm not saying that some of the issues explored in this film are or aren't true, or how things should play out. All I'm saying is that this is the first movie aimed at a largely female audience that I have ever watched which is so brutally honest about what women want and how they think relationships should work. The type of man the lead character chooses, what is expected of both of them in this new situation, how she reacts to episodes in the film that negatively or positively affect him or her, it's all a very accurate depiction of how women feel. Now this leads to my split opinion on this movie - 1. I respect it for this honesty, to lose all the Hollywood trappings and left-over chivalric, courtly notions that are no longer relevant to our society and relationships is very truthful, but on the other hand 2. The movie shows a completely biased view of these things. The man's side of any event that occurs is never balanced with the woman's, if anything it is demonized. the man is a caricature of men, a mix between what women want from a man and how they think all men truly act. It makes me worry that a generation of young girls will see this film and think that it's okay to always feel these ways, demand all these things, and expect a man to comply as easily as and in the designated manner that this one does. Ergo my mixed feelings on this film, part of me respects it's honesty while the other part of me is disappointed at how much the film caters to a one-sided perspective. For men out there being forced to watch this by loved ones, know that of any romantic comedy it is quite bearable, but also keep an eye-out for the messages it conveys, you might learn a thing or two about your significant other.",Life as We Know It

79,karlcharlotte-1,Pamperama,6,10 October 2010,"Life as We Know It / Rated PG-13 for sex, language, drugs, dirty diapers A blind date with two very mismatched people leads to complications. The people are Katherine Heigl, a cute bakery/restaurant owner and Josh Duhamel a beer drinking, sports loving hunk of a guy who likes to womanize and jog. The people who set up their date are their respective best friends. The BF's get married and have a child. A cute baby named Sophie. The BF's then meet the grim reaper and leave the kid to the baker and the drinker. More complications ensue. Lots more. They decide to raise the baby while living at odds in the dead BF's home in Atlanta, GA in order to raise the cute little Sophie. The predictable events that are almost completely given away in the film's trailers all occur right on schedule. Even if you haven't seen the trailer you can pretty well guess the events correctly from what I have just told you. LAWKT is a pleasant if very predictable comedy with more comedy than expected. The movie runs a trifle long at 112 minutes and a good 20 minutes could have easily disappeared without notice or harm to the storyline. Since most of the plot issues have come from many other movies they have pretty much relegated this movie to a ""date film"" with heavy ""chick"" film overtones. The cute scenes with Sophie are easily the best part of the movie. Sophie is played by an adorable set of acting Triplets known as Alexis, Brynn and Brooke Clagett. They are really great and look a lot alike. I could not tell them apart. If you can please tell me how you did it. They appear to have no prior acting experience. A lot like the Wayans Bros. in any of their movies. The scenes are actually filmed in and around Atlanta GA. Do not confuse this city with Vancouver BC. Or vice-versa. As a date movie this one is pretty good. The two main stars do a decent job in their Odd Couple roles as opposites destined for true love. The ever busy Josh Lucas turns up as the Doctor and love interest rival for KH. This movie will look pretty much the same on DVD as it does on the big screen. At least 70% of the scenes appear to be inside the home where the 3 Sophie's and her adopted parents are attempting to cope with her feeding, pooping and just plain looking cute. Pamper anyone?

But firstly the casting for this movie is phenomenal. I've always had a soft spot for Katherine Heigl movies and yet again she smashes it out the park with her character. She plays her complex yet simple at the same time: she is funny, bubbly and goofy but also caring and emotional. A big surprise for me in this movie is Josh Duhamel. I always remembered him as Lennox from Transformers but he's actually really funny in this movie and like Heigl's character he has an emotional side that shows in some scenes and hits you hard.Anyway Lets get onto the plot.. Its told well and makes complete sense. It all revolves around the two main characters (Heigl and Duhamel) adopting a baby girl after her parents/main characters best friends die in a car accident. And I will admit some scenes made me laugh and one scene in particular made me cry.. which is unusual for me so it definitely pulled my heart strings.My final thought ]s on this movie are go and watch it.

In fact, this is far from a light hearted and cuddly comedy we have all come to expect. The film carries a serious yet subtle undertone throughout about two people and the measure of their loyalty to themselves and their friends.There are some laugh out loud moments and even a few tear jerkers. Don't get me wrong this film is not flawless but if it is a quiet night in with a bottle of wine they don't come much better than this.A plausible script with strong performances from Heigl and Duhamel.",Life as We Know It

I really liked Josh Duhamels role in the film, the guy was such a goof,and an ass for most of the movie. I kind of saw myself in him minus the part about being a total idiot. Katherine Heigl is smoking and I liked her character to in this movie. The relationship between the two of them was kind of believable and not over the top.

88,shelley-mansfield,A Very Real Romantic Comedy with Heart,10,13 November 2010,"I began writing a novel on a similar (but not identical) topic in 1981 when my two children were aged 1 and 3 years. At that time no-one wrote romances where the main characters were single and had to raise other people's children. So I decided to have a go at it. From my own writing experience (more active in the past few years) I am able to appreciate the thought that has gone into the screenplay of ""Life As We Know It"" and the talent of the Director and actors who have brought it to the screen and made it so 'real'.From the point of view of a writer, I was prepared to view the script critically. But I have to say it came up trumps. The lead-in to the story right from the start was absolutely brilliant. The plot was well constructed, believable, heartfelt, and entertaining. It combined family themes, drama, humour, and romance in equal measure. Characters were well developed. There were a dozen or so of them woven into the story, all different, humorous, and endearing in their own way.A very big plus for this movie is that the baby is one of the characters and not just a little person who hovers somewhere in the background. I saw this movie with three other women friends ranging in age from 50 to 61. We are all currently immersed in the 'baby' experience with each other's grand children and, thus, related so well to this movie. I believed the conflicts experienced by Katherine Heigl and Josh Duhamel's characters. I loved the affection between them that we (the audience) could see, even though the characters couldn't always see it themselves.The main (and support) actors all had their roles down pat. The other Josh (Josh Lucas) played a really lovable guy; it was great to see him again (previously remembered as that adorable southerner in ""Sweet Home Alabama""). Both of the Josh's are certainly eye candy for us girls, and it's more than just their looks - it's in their facial expressions; the way they allow us to see inside the character they are portraying, so we fall a little bit in love with their sensitivity and their humour for a while.As for Katherine Heigl, this is another of her memorable roles - right up there with ""27 Dresses"" and ""The Ugly Truth""; in fact, this one has now become my favourite, because of the added dimension this role required of her.I've never cried so much in a movie before, but mine were as much tears of happiness (brought on by the baby's antics, expressions, and development) as they were about the story's sad undercurrent.The comedy, drama, and romance of ""Life As We Know It"" had me at 'hello'. I left the cinema thinking, 'I wish it wasn't over; I want to see it all over again.' This will definitely be included in my DVD collection. I might even take my 'hubby' to see it before it stops screening.",Life as We Know It

This in turn causes an emotional breakdown in the local police precinct where she is joined by Eric (the other friend of the couple). I also thought the comedic timing was great as well with the chemistry within the cast. This was truly a film which held my attention. I laughed, I cried, I wanted more. The situation at hand was of two opposite people that have nothing in common; are abruptly placed as the legal guardians of their friends child, after the couple perish in an automobile accident. Soon after Holly and Eric Messer move into their friends home to make an attempt at raising the child. Throughout the film they show the difficult burden of raising a child before one truly knows they are prepared for such a step. The film concludes with a bond having formed over the three main characters Holly, Eric, and the little baby left in their care. This is a film that many should take the time to see and enjoy. The story shows how against the odds of tragedy two people can grow up and discover possibilities within themselves. The possibility to care for and further another human life.",Life as We Know It

But then again I'm one of those who start crying as soon as anyone on screen does. When I was not crying though, it was hilarious.Many are complaining about the ending be predictable, which is completely ridiculous. It is.

This movie is a comedy / drama / romantic comedy and appeals to everyone from teenagers to older adults (whether you like chick flicks or not). Teenagers can laugh at plenty jokes and enjoy the likes and looks of Katherine Heigl, Josh Duhamel & Josh Lucas... while on the other hand, adults can truly enjoy and relate to the natural bond that develops between Heigl and Duhamel.Overall the acting wasn't superb, but definitely good (especially for a comedy!). The chemistry between Heigl and Duhamel flows smoothly throughout the entire film and is enjoyable to watch. There were plenty of extremely entertaining characters in the movie that made it at times, impossible to stop laughing minutes on end. There were also a couple of sincere scenes that people can become emotionally attached to, as some viewers cried.While this movie does not take you on an emotional roller coaster and is quite predictable, it does not take too much away from the humor or entertainment value of the film. Guys who don't like chick flicks will find this movie funny while women who love chick flicks will easily see this fit their taste. Not to many films can accomplish this.In conclusion, I totally enjoyed this movie and will definitely purchase on DVD to watch again. I thought it was filled with lots of laughs, joy and if you're the type of person, tears. Don't let the predictability of the movie deter you from seeing it! This movie is comical to everyone and will surely entertain you. 8/10 stars for being a truly funny movie, but a little too predictable at times with an occasional slow scene.",Life as We Know It

Movie never slows down and flows like a river with a touch of fun and romance in a young couples life with a sudden baby's arrival. Nice movie to watch with your loved one. Worth watching..!! I am a better romantic comedy movie fan and found this much colourful than everything else with the unique storyline. Well done with that. I give it 7 out of 10 for nice acting from Katherine Heigl and Josh Duhamel, and for a better script writing and Directing.",Life as We Know It
103,dyesb,"""Life As We Know It"" Review",9,23 January 2011,"I was thoroughly surprised to find how much I enjoyed ""Life As We Know It"". I laughed and cried, and then I laughed and cried some more. The combination of tragedy, love and humor was the best in a long time. They somehow managed to take a perfectly tragic story and give it an unbelievably happy ending. It was the typical ""chick flick"" - bad guy meets good girl and they come together in the end. However, it was the on screen chemistry of Katherine Heigl and Josh Duhamel as well as the every day mishaps of life that made this movie so enjoyable.A few weeks after watching this film I watched the 2009 movie ""The Ugly Truth"" and was disappointed to find that it was almost the exact same storyline in which Heigl was also the lead. I did however prefer ""Life As We Know It"". It contained better acting, better humor, and was easier to relate to. Although if you enjoy romantic comedies as much as I do, you will most certainly enjoy both.",Life as We Know It
104,anscorp-agrion,You'll surely fall in love...with the movie,8,10 February 2011,"Aptly categorized as Romantic-Comedy, this movie cant stop you from expressing your feelings in every scene. Till the end it binds you, having laughter, joy, care and tears at the right moments. You would really want to curl up on your chair and words like 'awww', 'omg', 'how sweet'...just escape from your mouth unknowingly. You suddenly realize the importance of people you love and the void which pops up when they are no more, which makes you want to love them even more.The plot staring with a fight, landing unexpectedly in a situation which isn't on the checklist for like 5 years and the way the actors sail through finally falling in love is simply worth watching...Watch out for the baby too, you would be completely drawn to her and wish, you had one like her making a smile naturally come on the face when she is around...so pretty, so beautiful and a born actor. And readings completely do injustice to the movie, the plot and most of all the precious baby... so don't get eluded by them.Happy watching!!!",Life as We Know It
105,user-197-753128,"cute couple and cozy family (spoiler contained, be careful if you wanna read it, thanks ^^)",9,11 December 2011,"At first I watch this movie for Josh Duhamel, but after watching it I realized that it is not only the actors or actresses make the movie great, but also the story line, the lovely relationship and, and everything in this movie. Being in a relationship is hard, but relationship like Holly and Messer is even harder. They did not like each other at first, actually they kind of loathed each other. But as time went by, for Soph's sake, there was something joyful but not explainable generated. It is love, but it is also more than love. It is not just the sort of ""I love you and you love me"" thing, it is about the whole family, it is the kind of love full of responsibility. I'd like to call Sophie a Cupid, because she is exactly the one who brings Holly and Messer together. Amy is right, these guys just make a cute couple. Lovers are supposed to be like this, I mean solving problems together with some lovely fights that can only bring the lovers even tighter. Life is not always delighting, sometimes we need the right person to help us cope with all the problems, because that's all what love is about.",Life as We Know It
106,divingchamp,Life as We Know It,8,29 November 2015,"I bought this film unsure and skeptical of the enjoyment I would have while watching it. Moments into the movie, however, I discovered these feelings were completely unwarranted.This dramatic-comedy of sorts was an impeccable combination of happiness, sadness, guilt, insecurity, and self-discovery. I found myself clenching my side in pain from laughter, drying my tear-filled eyes, and cringing from embarrassment. It is true that this movie is painfully unrealistic in many defining scenes, but that is the beauty of drama and/or comedy. I did not order a documentary -- I ordered a film whose main purpose was to elicit both forgotten and familiar emotions from within me -- and that it did, without doubt. So, in short, I am very pleased with Life as We Know It, and I recommend it to anyone reading this review.",Life as We Know It

Didn't expect much, but while a little predictable, I found myself genuinely liking it. I thought it had a healthy ""rawness"" to it, and had a feel-good yet realistic message.",Life as We Know It
