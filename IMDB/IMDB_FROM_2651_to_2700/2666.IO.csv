0,Leofwine_draca,Style over substance,3,26 January 2019,"IO is another Netflix-produced post-apocalypse movie; they seem to be ten a penny these days yet many of them are only so-so and this is such a film. It starts off very much as THE LAST WOMAN ON EARTH, with man's constant polluting of our planet leading to the very air becoming toxic; everyone else has decamped to space. After a bit of soul searching, THE HURT LOCKER's Anthony Mackie shows up but instead of the thriller plot promised from the trailer we get endless soul searching and pretentious dialogue about mythology and the like. There's no faulting the cinematography or the performances, but this style-over-substance effort is crying out for a real story.",IO
1,SnoopyStyle,a real grind,2,31 January 2019,"Earth's environment is collapsing and most of the population has left for a colony on the Jupiter moon Io. Sam (Margaret Qualley) is one of the last human on Earth. She's a scientist trying to adapt to the new poisonous atmosphere. She is joined by Micah (Anthony Mackie) who travels by balloon as the last shuttle to Io is set to lift off.This is a slow moving Netflix sci-fi movie which keeps grinding and grinding slowly on. I couldn't help be distracted by other media usage while watching the movie. After an intriguing world is laid out, nothing happens. It's a road trip with a balloon. While the scenery is nice, there is only a weak romance trying to spice up the story. Just when nothing is happening, the characters put on breathing masks and they turn into Bane. It's an infuriating turn which only accentuates the movie's weakness.",IO
2,claudio_carvalho,The Last Woman on Earth,4,19 February 2019,"In the future, the atmosphere of Earth becomes toxic destroying the civilizations. There is an exodus of the survivors that leave the planet to a space station on the gravity of the moon of Jupiter Io. The scientist Henry Walden (Danny Huston) and his daughter Samantha ""Sam"" Walden (Margaret Qualley) stay behind researching a means to save Earth from dying.
Sam is researching bees expecting them to survive in the atmosphere to pollinize the plants. She thinks in the possibility of leaving Earth on the last shuttle to Io to meet her boyfriend Elon that has left Earth to live in the station. Out of the blue, there is a storm that destroys her camping and research. Soon a balloon lands and the pilot Micah (Anthony Mackie) asks for Dr. Walden, but Sam explains that her father is not in the camp but researching the nearby field. Micah decides to wait for him and on the next day, Sam confesses that her father died. He convinces her to travel in his balloon to the shuttle but soon they learn the launching place changed and Micah does not have enough helium to reach the spot. Meanwhile Sam learns that Elon was assigned to a ten-year voyage to Alpha Centauri and they will never see each other again. What will Sam do?""Io"" is a low budget film with an interesting premise and good performances. However the storyline is too short and the pace is too slow, making the movie boring in many moments. In addition, there is no chemistry between the gorgeous Margaret Qualley and the Afro-American Anthony Mackie. My vote is four.Title (Brazil): Not Available",IO
3,nogodnomasters,People can change,6,29 January 2019,"The earth has become toxic as life perishes. Cities have become dead zones. 100 ships leave Earth to orbit Jupiter's moon Io and use its resources to live. They are getting ready to jump to the nearest star in a ten year trip.Sam (Margaret Qualley ) remained behind and lives alone in a self sustaining unit, attempting to raise bees that can survive the environment. Her father (Danny Huston) is a renowned scientist who believes man can adapt and survive. Micah (Anthony Mackie) arrives in a helium balloon to transport them to the last ships off of earth.Not too bad for a two man play. Film reminded me of ""Here Alone"" which I though was a tad better. Slow moving science fiction with zero action. No one eating potatoes. Film is about hope...but not for us.Guide: 1 F-bomb. Implied sex. No nudity. Misnamed film.",IO
4,kosmasp,Slow Burner,6,19 January 2021,"Another one where the we seemingly have destroyed or at least made our planet not habitable. Humans, right? Of course that doesn't mean there is not hope for at least parts of humanity to survive. Be it here at some places or even better on a different planet alltogether.To convince the viewers that there is hope, you do need good actors. And you get two of them in this movie. So while this is obviously contained (no pun intended), it also is quite expanded by the way the actors convey their struggle. Just don't expect this to be flashy or fast paced!",IO
5,Sleepin_Dragon,Deep and meaningful.,7,3 April 2020,"I understand some of the frustrations with this movie, largely because of the trailer, and the fact that it was advertised to me as a horror thriller, far from it, it's a meaningful story about the end of life as we know it, one woman's challenge, and her handling of change when a man appears.Very visual, it has some poignant scenes, I particularly liked the decayed and rotten streets and buildings, they looked incredible.There are multiple messages here, I appreciate that in amongst the many negative ones, there is one that shines through the whole way through, human spirit.Tragic beauty, 7/10.",IO

7,Aaron1375,"Pretentious, totally crap science and boring!",2,24 January 2019,"Yes, this film suffers from serious issues as it looks like it might have a good thing going by its description. Unfortunately, we are treated to another apocalypse film brought to us by Netflix, home to that sort of thing. We had Bird Box which we knew what was going on, we had Into the Forest where we had the vague apocalypse and we have this one where we sort of know what is going on, but we are bored to tears! At least Bird Box and Into the Forest were somewhat interesting, this one was just two locations, a lot of mundane conversation and a predictable romance forming.The earth is now uninhabitable due to ammonia in the air. Most people have fled to a space station near a moon on Saturn or Jupiter (whatever, not like it's important) called IO. Forget about that though, it has virtually nothing to do with said movie and is instead about a bad actress walking around and trying to figure a way to continue leaving on earth despite the ammonia. Apparently, the higher you are the more air there is, but seeing as how ammonia is lighter than air it should be the most dangerous zone is one of the many flaws in this film along with there is no oxygen in ammonia. Well, a man comes, and wants to see this girl's father who is obviously dead, but they wait to surprise us even though anyone with two functioning brain cells can see it coming, and romance sparks even though the lead girl has all the charisma of a piece of paper. The guy has a balloon and wants to take her to a space ship to go to the space station by the moon this film is named for, but in the end more long drawn out conversations ensue, no tension is built and the film peters out like a whimpering dog.The film had potential had they tried to add some sort of threat to the situation. I kept expecting them to get in the balloon and maybe run afoul of a storm, but no, nothing happens! My wife picked this one and even she got bored with it. I was hoping for mutant insects are something, anything to spice the film up and by the end so was she! The chemistry is nonexistent and there is nothing really interesting going on here.So, another Netflix original that disappoints. It truly is the station of hits and misses, not that it has hit big yet. The two I like most that I have seen so far are The Ritual and Bird Box and I only gave each of those a seven. This one is like a film that starts and does not go anywhere at all. Just watching people going about their usual day with nothing really arising to challenge anything other than the prospect of actually getting to that space station by the moon this film is named after, but has nothing to do with the story! Last Woman on Earth's Mundane Existence would have been a better title, but I guess it would have been a bit lengthy.",IO
8,robfollower,Io; is a slow burn . Pays the viewer off emotionally well after the credits roll,8,27 January 2019,"Yes; this is all dialog without much action action. That was the point; to delve into some philosophical thinking . Its great. Not a movie for those with an iq of 75 .
'IO' is a theme of Isolation and Loneliness. Post-apocalyptic psychological drama, focusing on human relationships This film is an excellent character study . It absolutely will not be pleasing to people who want high-tech, fancy FX, big budget excitement. This movie is a ***Slow Burn ***. And I loved it . The plot appears, to the casual viewer to be fairly straight-forward and simple.Except it's not, and I'm still trying to figure it out. It's foundation lies in the poem by Yeats, ""Leda and the Swan,"" an understanding of Greek mythology, and to some extent, the Trojan War. ""And Agamemnon dead,"" is a *key* line, spoken more than once through out the film .
Under the dismal veil of a post-apocalyptic earth, the movie focuses on the importance of art, of culture, of history and what the wold would be with out it.
If you like to think, ponder and ask what if, why, how and for what purpose?And who are willing to delve into some philosophical thinking, I'd recommend this movie. You'll find 'IO' enjoyable. 'IO' is a slow burn . It Pays the viewer off emotionally well after the credits roll.",IO
9,peterp-450-298716,The movie is as boring as any environmental debate of today.,4,23 February 2020,"Sam, we have to leave this place.
Sooner or later you'll have to.""IO"" will certainly be an orgasmic experience for global environmentalists and defeatists. Supporters of global protest movements about global warming and the destruction of our balanced eco-system will certainly use this film as an example to reinforce their apocalyptic disaster scenarios. Can you already imagine it? Such a television program where they put a microphone under the nose of such an environmental adept? You can bet that comments such as ""You see. Any idea what misery we'll get into if we don't intervene now?"" will be flung at the interviewer. In my humble opinion, all this is a storm in a glass of water (And no, global warming didn't cause that storm). I blame it on the natural evolution that our planet is undergoing. An evolution in cycles in which we as humans only speed up the process because of our polluting behavior. Soit. I should stick to just one particular thing I'm good at. And that's to write down a review of the movie in question. Short and concise: the film is as boring as any environmental debate of today.For those who didn't know yet, ""IO"" shows us for the umpteenth time a deserted, uninhabitable planet Earth. This concept has been used to a great extent in multiple films with a different cause each time. Either it's because of a zombie outbreak like in ""World War Z"" and similar zombie movies. Or it's prehistoric creatures like in ""The Silence"" that cause a global slaughter. And let's not forget aliens? They appear all the time to plunder our blue planet because they themselves are without resources. Viruses, impulses via mobile telephones, an innocent text message, a computer virus or simply a world war. An enormous number of causes have already been used to create chaos with an extinct planet as a result.Here in ""IO"", it's toxic fumes that cause the population to die en masse. Choking and blood transforming into a black liquid. Scientists claim the reason is an unexpected change in atmospheric composition. Smart people with common sense realize that it's only Mother Earth who is thoroughly sick and tired of us and tries to get us off this planet with a well-aimed ecological kick in the butt. The result is a massive exodus to IO, a planet floating around somewhere near Jupiter. But that doesn't apply to teenage girl Sam (Margaret Qualley) who stayed behind on Mother Earth, living in a house somewhere on a mountain where the toxic fumes can't reach. When she looks over the valley, this smothering smog hangs like fog in the valley. Even a storm cannot blow these toxic fumes over the ridge. What the storm surely did, was blowing away a bee colony, necessary for the scientific research Sam and her father, who initiated this research and apparently didn't survive the disaster, were doing. Or he went up in smoke. I cannot judge what this scientific research actually meant or if it made sense. That's probably due to my limited intelligence.All in all, the beginning of the film wasn't bad. Sam wearing an oxygen mask, traveling through the deserted streets of some American city with the help of a quad (equipped with a trailer). Images of a dead city and horribly dark underground corridors where rainwater drips from the ceiling. And the realization that her visiting time is limited to the content of the oxygen bottles. A miscalculation and she falls prey to the toxic fumes. Exciting. Captivating. But at the same time, it's not groundbreaking. Even when Micah (Anthony ""Falcon"" Mackie) arrives in a Jules Verne-like balloon, it doesn't get much more fascinating. What follows is a conflict between these two main characters. Sam wants to continue her father's life's work and prove that life on Earth could be possible in the future. Micah wants to board the last spaceship that leaves for IO but needs some extra help. When the romantic get-together comes into play, I immediately thought of ""Z for Zachariah"". A similar film that starts interesting but is characterized by a general dullness and slowness.The two main characters weren't the problem. Margaret Qualley is a good-looking appearance and shows in a solid way how determined the character Sam is. Only the decisions she made were a bit implausible. Anthony Mackie manages to play the unsympathetic balloonist with a self-control problem effortlessly. The script was too nihilistic for me. The pace was irritatingly low. And the story itself was extremely boring. Many technically perfect still lifes. Lots of musing and breaks full of drama. Even the hopeful ending with a mythological-religious message couldn't raise the level. Well, ""IO"" was a bit of a disappointment for me. I didn't expect a ""Lucas Arts"" kind of movie where everything ""explodes and blasts and bleeps"". But in terms of dullness, this Netflix Original still beats many competitors.You can watch ""IO"" on Netflix now!More reviews here: movie-freak.be",IO
10,mhorg2018,Where's the zero rating?,1,30 January 2019,"This could have been a decent movie if the writers would have put a little brain power to use. Not only is it boring and senseless (as others have pointed out, IO is a tiny little thing, Mars is closer and likely easier to colonize, was it that IO just sounded cooler? If that was the decision behind this, Ganymede is a much cooler name). Much of this makes little to no sense. How come the main character and later her companion, can breath in certain areas and not others? Where was the SFX budget? Earth didn't look too polluted to me. If this was trying to be a message film like the abysmal green remake of The Day The Earth Stood Still, it failed there too. Just a crummy movie all around. Boring and senseless is no way to make a movie.",IO
11,MadamWarden,So so.. .,5,20 March 2019,"Not science fiction, not a love story but I guess thought provoking enough to keep me interested to the end without too much phone distraction.
It is a film about hope and optimism conquering fear and pessimism. Slow burning but not heavy handed. Ok acting and some good dialogue.
Overall ok.",IO
12,juliankennedy23,To boring to hate,3,25 January 2019,"Io: 3 out of 10: Pollution renders Earth virtually uninhabitable as the remaining population flees to Jupiter's Moon Io. One shuttle to Jupiter is left and Margaret Qualley has to decide if she will be on it or stay behind to help save the earth. A fellow procrastinator (Anthony Mackie) shows up in a hot air balloon to take her with him to catch the shuttle.And on to the questions.Are you going to quote Roger Ebert? Why yes I am ""no good movie features a hot-air balloon,"" I think that speaks for itself.So what is this movie like? It is a combination of ""The Martian"" and Vincent Price's The Last Man on Earth.Oh, but doesn't that sound cool? You would think but The Martian took place (spoiler alert) on Mars and The Last Man on Earth had all those vampire creatures attacking every night. Plus those movies starred Matt Damon and Vincent Price respectfully while this film stars Andie Mcdowell's daughter.But there have to be some neat action scenes? No there are not. Sure they go into the dead zone wearing oxygen masks and ""oh no the oxygen is getting low better change the tank"" but it is like a diving movie with no sharks and no treasure... and for that matter no coral and no fish... heck, it just has fall foliage and an abandoned library with on the nose statues of Greek myths and quotes pertinent to the story. Nothing actually happens.I mean Anthony Mackie shows up that brings the excitement yes? Anthony Mackie is a decent actor but if he does not bring the excitement when he is flying around in a Marvel movie he certainly isn't bringing it here. He and Qualley have zero chemistry together for two people that are basically the last people on earth.Well if it is called Io at least they go to Jupiter at some point yes? Ha, no. If I were to title this movie it would be Indie Platform Walking Simulator the movie. This film shares a lot in common with those horrible cheap video games with poor graphics, muted grey colors, poor or non-existent gameplay and then they try to browbeat you with an unsubtle message about disability, depression or cancer to guilt you into buying it on Steam cause your last game had a cheerleader armed with a chainsaw fighting zombies.So you would rather watch a chainsaw-wielding cheerleader battle zombies movie? Well yes of course. But what I would have liked to see in this film is the characters interact outside of canned speech. Throw a curveball, have an erotic sex scene, have somebody drop a coffee cup. Do something. Minimalism doesn't have to mean a lack of conflict or passion. A windstorm and finding a bee isn't cutting it. Don't be afraid that by entertaining you will lose whatever cred you were going for.",IO
13,markthomassintek,Avoid,3,18 March 2021,"REVIEW - IOI've mentioned here previously that if a film doesn't hold my interest I tend to fall asleep and as an example I use the recent remake of Pet Cemetery, but now I have another film to refer to.On Facebook I follow a page called Dust which shows short Sci Fi films, why am I mentioning this, simply because this film probably would have been tolerant if it were 8 minutes in length but IO was and is 1 hour and 22 minutes too long.Basically no story, nothing happens and when at school I was taught that a story had a beginning a middle and an end and that it should have a protagonist or subject which causes suspense or some interest, unfortunately this has none of this and just literally do yourself a favour don't watch and if you do just fall asleep.I can't give a description of the story here because there simply isn't one.Avoid!Rating 3 out of 10",IO

17,TheTruthofItIs,IO is yet another Leftist anti-fantasy,1,5 February 2019,"""IO"" is Hollywood at its preachy worst. First, Earth is doomed due to ""human nature"". Our protagonist is a ""strong woman"" because white men are out of favor now. And that leads to interracial romancing since a black man is all that's left for her. Finally, the glacially slow plot all takes place on Earth, there is no set on IO, there is no sci-fi really at all. It's just a sloooooow, scenic Lifetime/Oxygen women's fantasy excursion.

19,phenomynouss,I don't get bored by movies easily but this was boring,1,10 April 2020,"I hate the idea of dismissing movies as ""boring"" for being slow-burn or methodical or quiet. But this movie is just flat-out boring.
It is a classic example of having an amazing background world to explore from or to hint at via the main story, while the main story itself is so barren and empty that the whole movie is a complete waste.
If this was intended to be some manner of slow-building love story between the two protagonists, it failed miserably because neither protagonist is interesting enough to sustain an entire movie. There's little to nothing that they even do or talk about with each other and none of the experiments being undertaken by Sam are fleshed out enough for us to understand what the purpose is and what is being accomplished.
The amount of scarcity in this film in terms of acting, writing, dialogue, story, even cinematography, makes it feel like the entire movie has a flattened affect. There's nothing to sustain any energy in this film. Even the science behind anything in the film is unexplained or unclear enough for non-biologists to follow.At best, this is a 50 page novella padded out to a fill a novel, and there's not even any impressive camerawork or CG or models or brief nudity to entice anyone to keep watching.",IO

21,Java_Joe,"Dull, plodding and incredibly stupid.",1,18 January 2019,"I'm either really overthinking this movie or the people that wrote it really had no freaking idea what they were talking about. Personally I think it's the latter and they chose Io because it sounded cool.I have no problem with the Earth getting so polluted and toxic that we have to leave. It's just nothing is really explained. And then why Io of all places? Not only is Mars closer but it's larger but it's less toxic than Io is. A moon that is being squeezed so hard by Jupiter that there are massive volanoes shooting out molten basalt as well as sulfur dioxide. Some blasts are so powerful they literally shoot out some 500km into space. And for some reason all of humanity, that didn't die, wound up there?The rest plays off like some movie of the week from the 70's. It's tired, cliche and just not interesting.And then the lead, who really can't act I might add, winds up being able to breathe at the end. Okay. So either she somehow ""adapted"" to the new environment or it's just more lazy writing. My money is on the latter.I get it. Netflix is really trying to stretch their creative muscles and become a real broadcast and production service. We're just going to have to go through a lot of dross before we find the true gems.",IO

One scientist stayed behind to try to figure something out with her dad and her own research. Then some fella who wanted revenge on her dad came to town and they fall in love some reason.

24,PyroSikTh,A Non-Experience,5,24 February 2019,"IO follows the story of Sam, a young scientist who's one of the last survivors remaining on an Earth far too toxic to live on. She survives on a mountaintop where the toxic atmosphere doesn't quite reach, studying colonies of bees in order to tap into some way of adapting to the new environment. The rest of humanity has left, making home on a space station orbiting Jupiter's moon Io, and looking further afield to colonise worlds beyond our solar system. Sam is kept in the loop via a boyfriend on the Io colony, who tells her she has four days to get to the last shuttle leaving Earth before she's left entirely alone. Then a helium balloon comes crashing in with Micah, looking to confront Sam's father, before they decide to make their way to the shuttle together.While that feels like some hefty plot, that's literally it. There's nothing else to it. The first half an hour is just Sam surviving by herself, collecting samples, studying bees, and injecting untested vaccinations into her body. A storm comes in and destroys everything, and determined science-Sam turns into depressed moping-Sam. Perfectly acceptable character development, but dull to watch.Once Micah appears and they get their short drama out the way, we literally watch them for another half an hour as they wait for the wind to change direction. They're waiting. We're waiting. Everyone's just waiting. Sam loses her contact with Io, there's a super awkward romance sub-plot that just doesn't feel right, and oh no Sam's father was dead the whole time (not a spoiler, it's painfully obvious as soon as the movie starts).Once the waiting is over, they finally decide to start their journey, and Sam decides to risk everything to visit an art museum. I mean I get it, this is her last chance to see these art exhibits before it's lost forever, but really? Now? You had four days to drive down there and see it, why would you attempt to squeeze it in mere hours before the last shuttle ever leaves Earth for good and no-one ever comes back? Without spoiling it the movie's final moments are just as poetic as they are nonsensical, and the credits roll without you feeling nearly as inspired or emotionally rocked as the movie suggests you should be.But I can't really say it was a bad movie. Nothing really happens in its entire runtime, but I can't say I was particularly bored. There's very little excitement or tension, but that's not really what the movie's going for. The romance sub-plot lacks any semblance of chemistry, and Margaret Qualley just glazes through the entire thing, but Anthony Mackie is great, their talks about mythology and philosophy feel like the movie's trying to take a stab at some deeper subtext, and as non-revelatory as the twist was, it definitely had a lot of ramifications for Micah as a character. The concept is sound even if the science to explain it is shaky, and the cinematography is captivating.IO is not a great movie by any stretch of the imagination, but it's not a shambles either. It needed a better leading actress to carry the movie, it needed a little more urgency in it's race to get to the shuttle, and the middle dragged just a little too much. I certainly wouldn't find myself watching it again, but I'm not left particularly disappointed either. In all I give IO an okay 5/10.",IO

27,jamiedarlow-37510,'Human nature was once originaly one. And we were whole. And the desire and pursuit of the whole... is called love.',6,11 April 2020,"An interesting sci-fi drama that has unexpectedly romantic sensibilities! Sam (Margaret Qualley) is a scientist who has stayed on Earth after the majority of the human race has travelled into space to find a new home. The Earth is dying and she is determined to find a cure. After having spent a long time in isolation, she meets a stranger named Micah (Anthony Mackie) who has travelled to her in search of a Doctor. That's as much as can say without giving too much more away. It's a bit of a slow burner and admittedly I wasn't fully engaged in it until Mackie shows up. He's really good here bringing another side to him outside of the Marvel universe and also has a great chemistry with Qualley. The romance that blossoms in the film does feel a little too quick and not enough time is spent on it to validate its authenticity but nevertheless, it is a film that brought its surprises and visually is really beautiful. The slow pans over misty, barron landscapes really puts you in the middle of the world in its last days. Overall, worth a watch if you're after a calmer view of the apocalypse without explosions and huge events but a depiction of nature turning against humanity to defend itself",IO

There are only three actors and it's overall a very small scale movie that has no spectacle and action, nor mind bending twists really.I first thought that the acting would be somewhat lacking, but they pulled it off pretty nicely. It was interesting to see Margaret Qualley acting after only seeing her in the Kenzo ad.I'm sure there are lot's of illogicalities, but the atmosphere is pretty nice here. There are lot's of small details that either hit home or not. It's quite a ""cozy"" movie to watch. After living on a deserted planet in who knows what conditions, who wouldn't enjoy a comfy couch and a delicious set of fresh veggies. I felt the characters, altho the love story part was a bit so so. Altho again, who wouldn't crave for human touch after living alone for quite some time.I also really liked the ending. I felt exactly the same as Sam when she went through the museum. Why would one want to leave all that behind if there is any hope. Perfect in my opinion.",IO

She is playing a nerdy scientist but her robotic monotone bores holes into your skull. Judging by her bio on IMDB, this actress is quite busy but it's hard to see why; she doesn't have any inflection, personality or ability to engender compassion from the audience. It doesn't help that the dialog is wordy and not really that interesting. Good try but this director needs to find a human touch and better script to take advantage of his artistic eye.",IO

You could simply overlay a different Action Soundtrack to emphasize the beats as they set out on the road, find the supplies they need, find the big secret (never that big a secret) and more.But instead of playing like a disaster movie, the movie deliberately has a tone appropriate to lonely folks after the fall of the earth.

I for one am thoroughly tired of it.That aside, it doesn't really matter in this case, because the rest of this... umm... movie doesn't actually bother to do anything with the ""we murdered Gaia with jumble mumble badstuff"" premise.Really, just when you think something must be about to happen, it doesn't.Our lead actress (hair nice and clean, as it would be) simply stands and stares, blank faced. Or walks and stares, empty eyed. Occasionally she runs, rarely to any effect or point. Once or twice, she screws up her face, presumably to convey some sort of emotion. It's not clear what, and, exhausted, she rapidly reverts to Resting Blank Face.A valid question might be: what reason are we given to care about her? The script never bothers to answer it. Playing the young white ewe to an old black ram never made Desdemona a worthwhile character.The plot is initially delivered in voice over exposition. Even when other characters appear, most scenes feature long, barren pauses, the very blankest of blank states, and a few banal words delivered with absolutely flat intonation.Is this intended to be profound?

64,Marc_Action,Another Post-Apocalyptic Film From Nextflix,5,20 January 2019,"Is Netflix trying to capitalize on the success of Bird Box? Probably. Is IO worth your time? Well, let's see. In this one, Sam Walden (Margaret Qualley) is stranded on a post-apocalyptic Earth after most of the population has fled to Jupiter's moon IO. She has a nice little set up (if you can call it that) on the compounds of a massive ground-based satellite where the air is still breathable. It is revealed that the compound was previously ran by her departed father, Dr. Henry Walden (Danny Huston). All the animals are dead by the way, but Sam still manages to produce fresh vegetables a la Matt Damon in the Martian. Come to think of it, early on anyway, the entire plot of IO appears to be lifted from the Martian. They even have a scene in IO where our main character uses plastic and duct tape to seal up an entrance during a storm. Lord! It was ludicrous when Matt Damon did it.Anyway, the movie doesn't pick up (if you can say that) until our only other main character, Micah (Anthony Mackie), literally falls from the sky in a metal capsule attached to a hot air balloon. Luckily for the audience this doesn't take too long into the film as watching Qualley's character plod around solo on an ATV gets old quick.So, is it good? Well, the overall plot, while not all that original, definitely has potential. However, the little-known director, Jonathan Helpert, struggles to keep the film engaging. This is understandable given Helpert's inexperience and Netflix making a director/casting change on the project midway through production. It also doesn't help that we only have two visible characters for much of IO. The other two characters coming in the form of email messages to Elon, Sam's boyfriend (no, not Elon Musk), and a brief appearance of Dr. Henry Walden via hallucination.For one thing, the characters just aren't all that interesting to carry IO.
This is compounded by Qualley's limited acting range. On the other hand, Mackie does a better job as the mysterious and reserved wanderer who drops in for an extended stay. However, it's not enough to overcome Qualley's dull acting and a plot that is equally monotonous. I will say that Mackie is an underrated and underused actor in my opinion, given his Julliard and Broadway roots.Another thing of note: the cinematography is decent enough but surprisingly, for this to be a post-apocalyptic Sci-Fi movie, there's hardly any special effects or action here to counter the above-mentioned negatives.So, was it better than Bird Box? I actually rated both 5 stars, but for some reason, Bird Box was much more entertaining. In the end, it doesn't really matter. Having been released so close behind Bird Box, IO for now will ride on the successful coattail of the former movie. Eventually though, IO will be much less memorable.",IO

So very glad I did!Although it starts quite slow, strange and unclear; but the amusement keeps developing with almost every minute of the entire movie. There is a strong message in the story about how powerful life is. Regardless of all the disasters humans have brought to this world and every living form on it, there is always this inexplicable motive called ""Hope"" to find a better world. Even if hope is not presented by a human awareness it still exits in the human nature, coded into every living cell in his body.Shortly: If we can't change ourselves to adapt well in this world, the world will have to change us in the way it sees fit, and no matter how much does the process costs.I don't remember a similar idea being beautifully put in a science fiction movie before - and yes This Is A Sci-Fi Movie, one of the 1st class! The idea was perhaps presented in other movies but in a shockingly ugly form, but in Io, it is fascinating.The brilliancy in the directing is beyond words and I really want to watch it again in order to absorb all those perfect scenes.Now is it underrated because it has serious scientific faults such as Geo means Earth but not anything else?

71,svtcobra331,Post Apocalyptic Despair/Hope,9,23 January 2019,"Firstly, this movie is not about science and doesn't really qualify as science fiction. Anyone who trashes the movie for scientific inaccuracies is intellectually tedious similar to those special people who deride Star Trek because ""there's no gravity in space"" and ""there's no such thing as a transporter"".They just don't ""get"" storytelling.This movie, IO, is not a youtube instructional video on surviving in an ammonia atmosphere. It is the story about hope/perseverance.
The story of hope needs to be told in a setting of despair, and these days an audience can relate to the apocalypse story. In this case Earth's atmosphere has become unstable and all humans who were able to do so boarded a rocket to Jupiter's moon Io. Meanwhile an unknown number of scientists have remained on Earth in the hope of finding a fix, or at least learning what they can.
Our story is set with one isolated scientist. The movie sets the tone with lots of blue tones, muted voices, and really puts the viewer in a state of despair. When a movie can push you into an emotion, it is accomplishing something.
As the story progresses the viewer discovers that the character's life is not all bad, and that she is more than a scientist that is coldly collecting and analyzing data. She has maintained her humanity via interest in art exhibitions and literature. This is the essence of a well-told apocalypse tale: that humanity is more than just surviving.This movie is dialog-intensive, the dialog being well-written and performed. The acting was absolutely spot-on. All involved should be proud of this movie.An interesting comparison to this movie is the old Gregory Peck film ""On The Beach"", which was the most profoundly depressing movie EVER. In that film, the world was coming to an end (more atmospheric problems) so everyone's Big Idea was to choose how to die. Viewers like me wanted to smack some sense into the characters, admonishing them ""dudes, you've got months to live, figure out a way to survive"".
This movie resolves the flaw in that movie: humanity HAS survived. The only remaining question is what is the best way to survive. Watching this movie was like riding a surfboard called hope in a giant wave of despair- always being a step or two ahead of failure.",IO

IO takes us to a bleak and slow aftermath of catastrophic events, stripping away big action. This leaves us with just our emotions on an Earth that is kaput.That's the point. It's about how two people who have just met, would react and cope with a world that isn't friendly to human life anymore. That's what the movie wants to offer us. And it raises its stakes very slowly and surely.The performances are not flawless. Yet I found both actors endearing. The music isn't great but fits well. The film feels quite long. It also misses some smart coloring that would have made it more alien and thus believable.Ultimately it's a story of a woman and a man in a bleak setting, with cool questions in the background, that feels like a smart short.

75,LorenBieg,"Patiently told, character-driven Sci-Fi Indie Film Delivers Compelling Drama",9,20 January 2019,"IO may have a few scientific issues, but delivers thought-provoking drama based on an interesting premise and solid film-making.Sam, the daughter of a prominent scientist, is performing scientific research from an Enclave on the hills above an abandoned city that lays in a toxic cloud resulting from an environmental catastrophe that his driven the population of Earth to Jupiter's moon IO. The last exodus shuttle for IO is leaving soon when Micah, another of Earth's very few remaining inhabitants, arrives at the Enclave. The result is a character drama in which secrets are told, agendas are revealed, and well-drawn characters struggle with the pain of leaving our home planet forever and what it means to them.I loved this film. But, I understand why it may not be for everyone. If you like films like Another Earth, I Origins, Predestination, or any indie Sci Fi film with a small cast and a high concept, you will be able to enjoy this movie. It doesn't deliver a fast plot with high tech or action. But, the people are believable and the situation compelling.The universe of IO is bleak and dreamy. When Sam explores the toxic city performing research, the deadly environment has a spooky quality that still exudes the humanity of its creators. The dialog explores some deep questions anchored in mythology and philosophy that provides food for conversation afterwards. Acting and directing are solid in a script that presents some storytelling challenges because of the smallness of the cast and the need to establish several backstories. The score is sparse, but appropriately brooding with some standout moments of striking beauty. Anthony Mackie is as strong as ever. But, the soul of the film is Margaret Qualley and her smart, capable, introspective portrayal of Sam.Overlook the negative reviews here, try to open your mind, let IO unfold at its own pace and I think you will not be disappointed.",IO

But what has happened to suspending your sense of disbelief? Are we not meant ever to do that these days? Quite a few reviewers here have set a high bar for scientific accuracy this time.The premise is that a heavier than air pollutant cloud has poisoned Earth to the extent that almost every human survivor has left - evacuated to a colony on Io - the moon of Jupiter. Almost everyone has gone... But not quite. Sam (Margaret Qualley) is still here, living in a mountain-top observatory, apparently with her father, although he doesn't seem to be around so much. There may be others.The film starts with Sam down in ""the Zone"" where she has to wear an oxygen mask and can only stay a few hours. Loneliness has played some tricks on her and left her with a perhaps rather pretentious obsession with mythology. You might also see some echos of the Tempest.The action of the film is fairly slow and a little dreamlike, but in places the cinematography is nice and I've seen films that are a lot less realistic.

77,filmsploitation,Far From groundbreaking....,6,22 January 2019,"Phil's Quick Capsule Review:
IO isn't exactly a ground breaking science fiction film. Think a reverse 'The Martian' and you get a vague idea of the story. That said considering Netflix' recent journeys into the genre IO is a freakin' masterpiece! Anthony Mackie and Margaret Qualley do a good job but the film is almost so low key that you've forgotten it moments after it finishes. So far from essential but it passes the time well...Best Bit: The ending I guessBuy, Stream, Avoid: Stream (Netflix)If You Liked this Try: The Martian, Sunshine, Twelve Monkeys",IO

83,yoyopa,Reviewed by people expecting Battle LA,10,28 January 2019,"I have to say, I really appreciate what Netflix is doing. We wouldn't have any films that felt...dare I say... fresh, If it weren't for streaming services like Netflix.All we would have is comic book movie after comic book movie followed by a Dwayne Johnson movie followed by a Kevin Hart movie followed by a comic book movie with Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart being too fast and too furious.I really really enjoyed this film. It was a quiet, intimate sci fi character study and I almost felt like I needed to see a film like this. I've been watching so much ""shoot em up"" action stuff lately, it was kind of making me sick.IO really is a beautiful film, very well acted by Anthony Mackie and Margaret Qualley.I had a little free time recently to relax and catch up on some streaming... I watched Punisher S2 and the movie Close w Noomi Rapace... both featured angsty, pouty faced, whiny, instagramable CW type teens who form unlikely bonds with their tough as nails counterparts. Both had varying results -- the former was almost unwatchable and I found myself skipping entire scenes -- The latter wasn't so bad but still had a moment or two where I wished said teen had no lines.I bring this up because when I saw Margaret Qualley, I thought I was in for more of this. Thankfully I was wrong! Qualley's character is full of depth and very well rounded... she's no child but in fact the hope for an entire planet. Qualley does so much even when she isn't speaking and brings so much heart to the film... I really loved the character and the performance.I would seriously ignore the negative reviews... alot of these people clearly went in expecting some high octane action sci fi. That's not what this is. Who cares about the exact science?!? THATS NOT THE POINT! Watch for the story, for the characters, and for the performances.Really well done to everyone involved. Thanks Netflix.",IO
84,Ameliex,Could have been amazing,1,17 November 2020,"When I saw the trailer, I thought WOW, this will be an excellent movie. I can't wait to see it.
When I saw it, after approx 15min I thought to myself '' WTH is this''.
I got SO SO disappointed. This movie could have been amazing.
I thought this movie would be something similar to ''Martian''. Of course not exactly the same, but something similar to that.
But oh boy was I wrong. So wrong.
The script doesn't make sense. The storyline is weird and out of order. There are many boring scenes. Nothing exciting happens. Seems the story never takes off or something. It ends up being flat.
After approx 15min, I thought ''When will this movie end''.
Damn, this movie could have been so good. I had high hopes for this movie. I ignored all the negative reviews and thought perhaps this is good and the other folks are wrong.
Well, all the negative reviews are correct.
I know I keep saying this, but this movie could have been made WAY BETTER.

85,piggulu,The only struggle is maintaining your attention,3,29 January 2019,"As tablebythegym's review mentions, you'd be hard-pressed to not pull out your phone or focus on something else as the movie plods along with little to keep interest. You could make a run to McD's without losing anything.It does start out interesting with the woman surviving alone in a somewhat inhospitable environment, but after the man arrives it devolves into only idle chit-chat and philosophical/mythological quotes that don't really offer any deep insight. Like others have pointed out, the trailer is entirely misleading as to what this film entails. There's no tension or actual drama, no urgency in the characters' predicament, no adventure, and no sense of accomplishment.What it should've been was the 2 characters meeting by chance, and finding ways to survive until they learn of the impending shuttle to get them off the planet and the struggle to get there in time. Sure, it might've been a little cliche, but at least it might not be so stale like this. Instead, it's like viewing a single painting at a museum for 1.5 hours straight.",IO

88,vandrist,Very original and realistic,7,18 January 2019,"Since We are Marshall, I haven't seen Anthony Mackie deliver a performance of this magnitude. From someone who's not usually a lead character, I would say the argument is out that he may be able to carry a film. Margaret Qualley as well has proved that she is a force to be reckoned with. I'm very excited in the future of these to actors.This is an original sci fi that doesn't drag on and force things to develop, it kind of lets the script and the special effects do what they are supposed to do. I'm starting to warm up to Netflix movies, and if they keep putting out stuff like this, then we are in for many more surprises.",IO
89,DasBobsWorld,Should I stay or Should I go,4,5 March 2019,"Man, I love me some fictional science! I can convince myself to watch any sci-fi based movie and still have hopes that it'll be good. So, I was super intrigued by IO because sometimes I get in a mood where I want to watch slow burn, end of the earth kind of stuff. Watching humanity take that last grasp at the straw of life is fun! IO seemed to promise that. A promise that did not deliver.IO is about a woman who was left on Earth with her father, who has since passed away, to try to single-handedly change the effects of global warming, and toxic air. The rest of the population barring a few others has left and lives on a space colony near IO around Jupiter. After a storm destroys her dad's bee experiment a stranger shows up and they must decide if they are to leave the world for the colony or be swallowed up by the toxicity.When IO starts our heroine is taking dangerous trips into the toxic air to conduct experiments on the life she finds there. Mostly insects and things that seem to be adapting to the air. We then learn of her father's belief that man can adapt to live on the planet while healing it. I actually quite enjoy this part. The slow burn quiet desperation of a girl not only trying to make her father's dream a reality but also trying to save the world. It had some heft to it, and a movie about the next step in humankind needs that emotional heft. Of course, once Anthony Mackie shows up, it starts to lose that. Not because of the character himself, but because of the change in the direction of the film. He has his own reason for being there, but the movie then turns into awkward exchanges and an even more awkward romance. Also, it turns our smart, and capable heroine into a one-note, should I follow one boyfriend or the other character and that just kind of drains anything interesting out of the rest of the movie.IO had potential, it really did. But, a boring script that seemed to lose its way and some weird choices by the main character, just leave it a mediocre watching experience.",IO
90,dwaynemayo60,Stop calling these movies Sci-Fi,2,19 January 2019,"This movie should have been called ""idiot dies on a moutain"". It is not scifi, it's another stupid character study. Please stop calling these movies scifi. it's more like fantasy or magic really as far as the science is concerned. Gee let's put a worker bee in a poisonous environment and maybe magically it won't die. Let's just forget that the queen is the one that passes on mutations to the hive. Oh and let's put poison on our skin that leaves bumps and that will magically mutate us to survive the new poisonous environment.

91,toddcha,Surprisingly dull and boring,4,10 August 2019,"There is no excitement at all and I didn't see any point in this movie. If 'having a hope' is the main theme then I think you can skip to the last 10 minutes because the rest does not accumulate all the tension. In fact the whole movie is fregmented. Not saying the script is not well written, I am saying the consequence/results have no connection to the prior plots. Some reviews said it has no head nor tail. I say it's just pieces of stories connected together by one single incidence: the earth is inhabitable. In other words, it just a compile of some random things and I don't see any strong connection, leading me to feel nothing about this movie. Considering the important of main theme (I guess), the movie is not well told. Therefore, it only gave me a plain and boring impression instead of a stronger impression on ""saving what we have now"" which supposed to be the intention of the director and writers.

93,kupukupumu,Better than IMDB Rating,7,20 January 2019,"After reading some reviews here, I am tempted to write my own review that maybe will not be read.To start with, I have to say that I agree with most reviews and even clicked the Helpful icon there, however I do believe this movie should be rated higher than 5.As for the BAD parts, I do agree as a sci-fi moviue, a lot of things in this movie made me frowned. Other than scientific exacts that have been mentioned, there are just many impossible simple stuffs from scientific view, i.e., how people could quickly launch so many people to live in space (not all people have the mean), why people think it is easier to launch people to space than fight the issue on earth, if the earth is so polluted, why there are greens and flowers everywhere in the polluted zone, how a single girl can be self sufficient in everything for so long, etc. One does not need to be a scientist to fault these. But most scifis are like that.But the GOOD parts made this movie worths watching. First, of course is the concept. Secondly is the acting. Thirdly, the storytelling runs very smooth, there is no unnecessarily scene. The runtime is just perfect. Lastly, the ending, while pretty very clear, is still open to own interpretation.In short, I think the movie deserves such low rating.Thanks for reading.",IO

It is, like most say, is a slow burner with virtually no action but it projects and provokes thoughts and feelings.

There is a fantastic and interesting world which we never quite get to explore. But that's the point, nobody can!In some ways this film reminds me of the incredible, post apocalyptic masterpiece, The Road. It's slow, but it never feels like it. The film ended before I ever needed any progression. Margaret Qualley is perfect. Incredible casting, she seems to perfectly embody her character. Even her mannerisms seem so, right. Anthony Mackie is a little bit over the top, and it's the relationship between the two that perhaps needed a little more development to understand.The last half 40 minutes suffers from a lack of serious threat. I never really felt the characters were in danger.Overall I really enjoyed IO. Really confused why so many hate it. But then again, this is debuting on Netflix.

One is on a mission to get to the last exodus flight that will go to a new enriched colony; while the other character has some undying and ridiculous commitment to a desolate and dry earth. The movie was slow at times. The backdrop, desert scenes and landscapes were shot beautifully and made up for the slow pace. Anthony Mackie is a great actor and his solid skills helped to keep me from turning the film off. The way Anthony played his character made me want to hang on to see what his journey would reveal and ultimately decide. I watched the film till the end and glad I did.

102,novacasa42,Very badly misjudged,7,27 January 2019,"I.O is a bold attempt at a fascinating and complex premise, despite all the bad reviews it had I feel like this film was very badly misjudged, there were some justified arguments for being bad mainly in the Science part of the Sci-fi because this film pays no respect what so ever to science, but beath all of that and if one looks very closely, there's something there to be admired, mainly how it unfolded and acted, Margaret Qualley the actress that plays Sam delivers on a steady and constant pace which I really appreciated as her acting really captured the loneliness she was in, the plot didn't do get any favors but she worked with what she had and I think she was the glue that held this film from falling apart, having saying said that, I feel the need to say that I really liked it, and here's my reasons, first of all, I didn't see it as a big scale sci-fi that would adhere to the rules of science, this was more on the fantasy part but it wasn't bad by all means, it felt fluid, granted it was a bit bland at times but it really held its own I'd say, especially considering how limited the story is.This premise is infinitely complex, a lot of amazing writers and directors presented their work on it and the majority failed miserably, what we should take from that is the fact this wasn't trying to be epic, not even close, it was a simple, and as crazy at it sounds very enjoyable.",IO

104,bramstayer,I wanted to like this film and still it was boring. Hard no from me.,4,12 February 2019,"I love these actors & though the words dystopian future have become so ubiquitous in film summaries that SO many go out of their way to have supernatural, extra- terrestrial, or brutal political reasons for our extinction event. The real and most likely (less sexy) cause will be the pollution of 20 billion people just doing what humans do to ruin our own home and trigger the final apocalypse and I HOPED that made this rather original. Or maybe clever with a new spin?
To present the now death throes of our Earth being inhabited by 2 whole folks was kinda a bit too ridiculous knowing what it would take to leave the earth & all the polical crap...we would have like 8 shuttles built before we all starve LOL (of course that was just the trailer)... theres lots of slowpokes in gasmasks watching real housewives reruns before the last trip off Plasic Smoothies Seas Planet blasts off.... BUT A GUY WITH A big Balloon is all we need for the very last one that is leaving in exactly 4 days! And there is no bus service. (Yet enough water for abundance of greenhouse grown food.) Time for any neglected kids who outlived all species of birds and sealife to make a decision. And THIS is where it all started to lose oxygen for me. Sorry.
We dont get details in many things but limited ones in the beginning about the insects and larvae samples that can breathe ammonia..mkay. Kinda a common issue with the whole film is it goes one way and style for a bit then switches another- like they had a different director each day.
In between the soup and crackers of meeting a new buddy, the brave young daughter of an earth first type demagogish guy, whose bad decisions are regrettable far too late, we get lots of Plato and TS Elliot quotes etc that seem really forced even in a slowed down conversation. And they are all very slow. It also felt like it also had duelling dialogue writers. The movie could be great with this tempo if it had something to say that wasn't so pretentious and sad. 'Life and the connection of our other half etc are all that matter' only lead to suicidal thoughts? Im not giving any details that will spoil it. People who love this kinda of slower movie MAY enjoy the whole thing together. However in the parts where I had to pause to go do something, I FORGOT I had the movie on. Never a good sign.

She (SAM) stays in earth doing her research at her father's research place where Micah comes to see her dad and take her with him to the last shuttle off the planet, the REST IS HISTORY - HOPE.. and i also did like the shots in the Museum of ART where she got attracted by a painting by Paul Cezanne - LEDA & the SWAN and Micah (former teacher) explains to her the story of LEDA and the Swan ( which represents Zeus) and they gave birth to Helen of Troy ,a woman considered to be the most beautiful on Earth.

125,Grismar,Just not a lot here,4,4 February 2019,"This movie invites you to contemplate it and think of why it's good, because it doesn't succeed in being good all by itself.The themes are heavy and this is ""yet another last survivors of a dying planet"" story, except that I feel we get to see the planet right after all the interesting characters have left or died and we're made to watch the extras in their final hours.The conclusion to the story is likely to be considered ambiguous, but given the somewhat dumb premise and illogical plot points, perhaps it should be taken literally after all - which would bump the whole thing down even more, as this is a total deus ex machina, hinging on a plot point only introduced moments before the actual end.Given the title of the movie, I feel even the oblique mythology references missed a massive opportunity. They could have added a really nice layer with some minimal plot adjustments - imagine the main character as Io and her transformation a ruse by the all-mother to keep her away from the manipulative people of Jupiter who create and ruin all.The points it gets are for visual design and the acting, because I don't blame the actors for having no script to work with.

Netflix is quickly becoming synonymous with low-grade, cheap trash; it's clearly a company where quantity trumps quality.The makers of this schlock didn't get anything right: bad story (of an otherwise important problem), bad editing / pacing, absurd pseudo-science, bad title, bad acting, etc. Several other 1-star reviews point out major problems.I could only watch the first ~20 minutes - I had to give up after that - but I can confidently say that the actress (Sam) is totally devoid of any acting skill and should be doing something else.What some reviewers claim is a ""slow and thoughtful work of art"" is really just a boring, incompetent piece of Netflix garbage.Avoid at all cost. 0 out of 10.",IO

129,cavemould,a lot of salty reviews,6,21 January 2019,"I suspect the salty reviews are from American teens who expect funny one-liners and Michael Bay explosions every 15 seconds.i'm not giving this movie more than a 6 because I would have preferred a little more science as to how it was the protagonist was able to survive in the end, and I would have like to see a few more characters make a bit more of an effort to stay. They sort of hinted that they she was doing some kind of adaptation experiments, but nothing more than that.I thought the movie was good though. A bit like Wall-E in a sense. Humans have messed the place up, and buggered off elsewhere to find new and exciting places to mess up.This movie isn't a movie about the beginning of the end as so many disaster movies are. Its a movie about the beginning of a new chapter after the end. It explores the idea of facing the depressingly hopeless scale of what has been lost.It actually didn't need all the pseudo-science at the start. You can just skip past it, because it isn't what the movie is about. They could have cut that whole bit at the start and just said something generic like ""thanks to pollution, the environment changed and the world is uninhabitable to humans. The last ones who survived now live in a colony in the solar system."" that would have been enough actually to let the audience fill in the blanks.This movie is a movie that simply explores the ideas of what does it mean to be a human and moving forward carrying the weight of everything that has been lost.I find the idea that humans would travel 4 light years to try and set up home on another planet, but not stick around and simply adapt to a messed up climate, unrealistic and unlikely. This was really just a clumsy story device to make a comparative argument as to whether you should give up and walk away from something that you had monumentally mucked up, or whether you should try and fix it , no matter what. It may have been more believable if the other colony had been on Mars, which would at least have a chance of having a reasonably sized human colony on it.I think its more likely that there would be domes, and power stations, and tunnels , and indoor farms and all kinds of other off-world colony things, right here on Earth, even if the atmosphere was unbreathable to humans. It would be like colonising another planet, but without having to transport all the stuff first. It would be a lot easier, actually.",IO

137,CriticalRaccoon,A Pretty Waste Of Time,2,6 February 2020,"Style over substance can only get you so far. Style with no substance gets you nowhere.IO is one of the countless film-of-the-week that Netflix put out last year. I almost watched it back then due to it's trailer looking neat, but something triggered my alarm bells. A post-apocalyptic film starring only two actors with no excitement in the trailer that sat around for ~2 years before release? A film that's original stars and director were replaced just before filming? The new director (Jonathan Helpert) has mostly only done short films before? This is sure to be ... fun?I only caved because star Margaret Qualley was in Once Upon A Time In Hollywood, she was amazing in it, and I wanted to see what she'd done in a lead role. I regret that choice.Some time after the environmental apocalypse where Earth's atmosphere became toxic at low altitudes, Sam Walden (Margaret Qualley) is one of the few people remaining on the planet. She lives alone on a mountain above the deadly air, and spends her time trying to breed a queen bee resistant to the pollution that can clean the air by pollinating plants. She has a boyfriend who lives on a space station near Jupiter's moon Io and is told that soon the last shuttle evacuating survivors is going to depart. Just then a man named Micah (Anthony Mackie) arrives via helium balloon demanding to see Sam's (dead) father who has been sending messages of hope to the world. The two talk, talk, talk, bond, etc until Sam is forced to confront her own life's choices.First and foremost, IO is a slow burn. It attempts to bring you into this apocalyptic world by making you languish in it with our characters. IO likes to take its time and let the viewer get brought into a scene by trying to evoke a gritty, muted, and almost depressing cinematographic style. It does draw you into this world through the visuals. I admit I was fascinated by this almost hypnotic presentation of survival, even if it's not exactly a unique one. It reminds me of moments of The Road or even the more action-orientated Oblivion. Honestly the cinematography is the best part of IO and perhaps the only reason I'd ever recommend it.Sadly this slow burn comes with barely a singe. IO is protracted and hollow to a fault. Where other methodical films like Silence use their stagnation to help you delve into character and theme, IO does nothing with its emptiness. As we get dragged along, watching Sam essentially repeat the same day over and over as her experiments prove fruitless, one can't help but feel like her and our time could be put to better use. IO has an ambition to be something thoughtful, and perhaps in a more condensed form it could convey that more acutely, but as presented the film does accidentally evoke the exact same despair that is experienced by its two leads as we wait for something, anything to happen.I sat there in front of my computer screen, a beer in hand, and just feel sorry for the actors in this movie. They deserved better. I'll give credit to Margaret Qualley as Sam in that she acted like she didn't care while playing a person that didn't care. Sam's crisis in living a monotonous, isolated life while all but giving up on hope is interesting, but she isn't compelling. Anthony Mackie's Micah would usually be the agent by which Sam would realize her self-imposed isolation is slowly killing her - that is if Micah didn't seem annoyed that Sam exists. Micah is the thing that moves the plot forward, but he does so by dragging Sam along; Sam just doesn't want change and seems resigned to a lonely, slow death. I was just waiting for someone else to pop up, some interesting character to bring some joy or drama to this movie - but no, we're stuck with two actors who act like they don't want to be there. Goody gumdrops.Throughout my entire viewing of IO I kept returning to a single thought: ""I bet the people behind this thought they were making something far more profound."" IO is the opposite end of the spectrum from films such as the recent Black Christmas remake where the message was beaten over your head repeatedly to the point of farce. IO is a film with a message but just doesn't know how to convey it at all. When looking up this film I found some early press release that called it a post-apocolyptic, coming-of-age environmentalist science fiction movie and boy did they miss the ball on all of that. It wants to be a deep, philosophical look at human interaction and our relationship with the world around us, but just comes across as a forgettable environmentalist version of I Am Legend.After I finished the movie, though, my thoughts switched to another thing: did what I watch make any sense? I remember the opening narration talking about how Earth was evacuated and the survivors escaped to our already existing space station around Io ... so I guess the film takes place around 2070? If that was the case, then why did the technology look mundane by even today's standards? Well, I guess mankind can master the stars but lacks the ability to genetically engineer an ammonia-breathing bee - or maybe they realized breeding a single queen bee is pointless given you'd need a few billion of them to even make a dent. I again think back to far better films that, while also being flawed in a lot of ways, could at least entertain.Now to stand on one of my personal pet-peeve soapboxes: can movies like this stop having the actors who clearly have no chemistry and visibly hate each other end up in bed?! Sam is socially challenged due to her longtime isolation and Qualley does convey this to her credit, and Mackie's Micah does literally look like he does not want to sleep with her ... but of course he does. Oh and at the time Qualley was 21-22-years-old (being able to pass for 17 easily) and Mackie was 38, so the 'romance' had that level of awkwardness added on top. That scene made me uncomfortable, the actors acted like they didn't want to film it, and the end result of this embarrassing tryst is more laughable than laudable.IO is bland, boring and impossible to recommend seeing on a platform that features countless better uses of your time. It attempts to provoke but all it does is numb. Io is neither enlightening or entertaining. The things that IO is trying to convey aren't difficult to understand, but the film lacks the vision to tell it. Even if it is well shot, all you will think about during IO's (thankfully) short runtime is how many better films it takes elements from that you could be watching instead.",IO

148,Watcher42,Missed opportunity,4,19 January 2019,"I didn't dislike this film despite my 4/10 rating. I just couldn't find a reason to give it anything higher.There's a a few ideas that are interesting here, but they are not explored to any extent. I assume because they wanted to keep this as a small, low budget piece.The idea of people living in the mountains to get above the pollution is good. The idea of people travelling between camps using helium / hot air balloons is cool. The idea of trying to find a way to adapt to the pollution is interesting enough. The idea of people leaving earth to try and make a home in the stars works to an extent.Unfortunately, all the interesting ideas are skimmed over or ignored in favour of a slow paced, meandering story that goes nowhere and says very little.I think this is a pleasant enough film if you suspend your disbelief, and try and immerse yourself in the ideas instead of what little story there is. If you go in looking for plot holes, scientific accuracy, or a load of action you will be disappointed.I liked the performances of the leads. Sam's character is clearly very intelligent and capable, but her occasional lapses of focus hint at her isolation having taken a toll on her state of mind (which might play in to some of the decisions she makes). Micah's character is a bit superficial, and they could have played on the motives for his journey more, but Mackie did a decent job with the material he was given.A huge missed opportunity, but worth a look if you like the ideas it hints at.",IO

The notion is that we brought on the end of times ourselves - other than that, the vehicle for doom is unimportant (but it is the general trashing of our biosphere and not global warming, per se).The ending could surely be anticipated although the writers, director and Margaret Qualley maintained doubt (will she or won't she? And what is that she will or won't? And what about him?) through to the closing scene; there were a few different directions it could have gone. I thought Qualley did a spectacular job on what is, essentially a one-and-a-half hander for 90 minutes.As all the 1 star reviewers point out, it is not a fast paced story; but I certainly didn't find it boring.

188,UncleLongHair2,"Sexy nerd movie, ironically with bad science",7,29 January 2019,"This movie is a slow-paced character drama, or, alternately a long ""bottle episode"" with basically two characters mostly in one location. There isn't a lot of action and most of the plot hangs on one decision being made by the main character. The dialogue is a bit flowery, with actual quotes from Plato and other classic authors. A lot of people are going to call this movie dull but some will be fascinated by the psychology and subtleties and mash-up of intellectualism and romance.Margaret Qualley plays an ""accidentally attractive"" young female nerdy scientist (replete with cute mathematical and molecular tattoos) dedicated to furthering her father's research to save the Earth which is a somewhat undefined state of apocalypse. I thought her acting was quite good as she portrayed a hopelessly conflicted and lonely but somehow winsome character.I won't spoil the story but it revolves around a somewhat bizarre love triangle including the longest of long distance relationships and a young woman torn between her dedication to her father, her long-distance affair and the attractive man right in front of her.Unfortunately (and supremely ironically) the movie hinges on tragic and completely absurd errors in science that any layperson can identify, so strange to have a movie with lots of scientific meaning and content that is nowhere close to reality.Nonetheless I enjoyed the movie maybe because I'm a sucker for bottled romance and young intellectuals.",IO

She is practically the only one who still believes in it. Almost all human beings have moved to Io, the satellite of Jupiter, with a view to colonising one of the nearest habitable planets. Will she give in and board the last ship leaving for the Jovian satellite, or will she continue to have faith in the possibility of saving Earth?Described in this way, the film looks very interesting and promising, but ultimately disappoints. How so? Not because of the figurative part, which succeeds in evocatively recreating the contrast between the cities, submerged in clouds of poisonous gases, and the plateaus, rising above the poisoned air and where life somehow manages to continue. Not because of the music, a lyrical symphonism that fits well with the narrative atmosphere. And not because of the slowness and lack of significant episodes that bored many viewers of this film (but which, in certain contexts, can be tolerated). No, the weakest part of the film certainly concerns the overly stereotyped characters and a certain excessive trivialisation of environmentalist morals, as well as a certain pretentiousness in the cultural references (Plato and love, Cézanne and beauty: concepts addressed in a somewhat superficial way). It's a pity, because the authors could have made a much better film out of it, playing their cards better, above all by writing better that character who dreams of being able to give back to the Earth, which we have ruined, its original wonderful aspect.",IO

We would either be living in spacesuits or entirely indoors in which case why not do that on earth? Or we would have to terraform the new place to meet our needs in which case again why not do that to the earth? It will always be easier to fix the earth than a totally foreign environment. And that doesn't even take into account the extreme difficulty of space travel.Environmental damage is a lousy reason for humans to leave earth. What would make sense is overcrowding.

At least it's a bit closer and less hazardous.And why do these kind of movies always have the same stupid plot holes: the woman is presumably in her mid-20's and she has never seen the world ""from before"", as she says it, so where do they get their gasoline for the rovers? How does she fill her oxygen tanks without proper tools to pressurize it in it? Why is the oxygen present only high up at the mountains? Where does it come from? Trees somehow managed to transform - what ever the toxic in the air is - into oxygen? Also where does the guy get his helium for his hot air balloon, which is huge? Then they go to ""the zone"" and find a place where they just so happen to find abundance of helium. Yet, it's never explained, or even shown, what this place is and why it has so much helium.This is a great example of a pretentious movie: it tries to be very intelligent with it's actionless and simple dialogues. There are several references to some mythologies and art, as if they had some sort of connection to the movie's ""story"". The makers have no idea how evolution and adaptation works, to which those ""intelligent"" references presumably are connected. There's even a small romance thrown in, that's just totally out of the place and stupid. The ending is very anti-climatic and just makes you realize you wasted 90 minutes of your life for nothing.In short:
It's a boring movie that tries to be very intelligent with it's vague references to human connection, love, mythologies and arts. It's filled with plot holes and there's just nothing real in this movie. Definitely not worth a watch.One of the other review summarized it pretty well: This movie would have been good, if it was squeezed to a 8-minute short film.",IO

There was no chemistry between the characters.

So I'm not gonna comment on that since there are plenty of comments explaining scientific errors. Here is what I didn't like. First 2 minutes of the movie you see her walking around with her gas mask since there are high levels of radiation. She doesn't wanna get sick of course. And than she starts picking up things and doing stuff with her BARE hands. I don't know that much about radiation maybe it can be in a way that it only affects body if breathed in or consumed. But then why is the first thing she does when she commes home rinse her self with water. She showers herself still in her clothes. But is that really necessary if she's not gonna get contaminated touching radioactive things?
Movie is SO SLOW oh my god. You wait an entire movie for things to start heating up, but they don't. I could literally describe this movie in three sentences. 1.They stay at home 97% of the movie. 2.Last 20 minutes they go to get helium and visit museum. 3.She almost kills herself but survives who knows how.
And that part when she is at the museum and they are in a HURRY and she starts reading that poem?? Whyy? What is the point? CaN YoU eXplAin iT?? I think you can talk and walk at the same time, right? Those scenes at the museum are supposed to be the climax of the movie I guess but they did nothing but annoy me. And at the end she has kid of course.

It's like playing an indie game who doesn't try to impress with expensive graphics, and instead imparts a mood that feels... different. The actors are great, ethereal Margaret Qualley and intense Anthony Mackie both give more depth to their characters than the rather minimalist script warrants. There are some blatant scientific bloopers, my personal favourite would have to be ""ammonium as the main oxygen source"".

Will it get so bad that humanity might not survive and have to leave the planet? Maybe. Will this create lots of problems? Sure. And... will the Earth and ecosystem actually have the ability to slowly adapt, recover to new conditions? Maybe. Humans might also have this ability. That is not a new concept.According to the movie plot - the point is.... I guess, despite all odds, a human adapted to the new conditions and maybe that can result in the human race continuing on Earth. Good to know. And... modern art is important.

If you can suspend your disbelief for 2 hours it's not a bad bit of dialogue between the two main characters. It kept our attention, we did not fall asleep lol. Sort of nice ending I guess? You really need to overlook a lot of problems with the timeline though.
If her father and mother were around before the atmosphere changed, how long after did they have their daughter? She is portayed as around 20? When Micah comes in he talks about being there long before it happened but he is what in his 30s? So this guy knows her Dad, has a wife and kids, 20 years passes and he is still 35? If Sam was born after the Ammonia heavy atmosphere began maybe she is able to adapt to the new atmosphere but why did the bees dies from one little storm passing through? Yet she goes right into the heart of the ammonia and has no problems breathing? When they go to the city it looks like the city has been dead for hundreds of years. She is 20 and was born of a father who was around before the atmosphere changed. The city would not look that bad yet. How did Micah survive all that time not on top of a mountain away from the air but no one else does? Not one other? Here's a biggie they don't even try to explain, I'm not thinking a satellite to collect geothermal energy orbiting a distant planet is going to have much space in it to live for even one person let alone thousands and enough to start a colony 4 light years away?

I find these things to be huge directing/writing errors.I thought the actors did well with what they had to work with and I like them both.And as far as the end goes, I was very surprised and disappointed. The earth did not heal because the flame was still purple. She somehow adapted with no scientific explanation whatsoever. That truly was the nail in the coffin for this film. Ending a slow thought provoking movie like this with a random unexplained, and scientifically impossible miracle is absolutely and completely a total creative failure for the writer and director and honestly, they should be ashamed of themselves.",IO

So if we have urgency why is the pacing like it is in slow motion and the acting is so slow and drawn out.

327,abcdefgg,I can't believe such a low rating!,10,24 October 2019,"Yes, this movie is slow and possibly overdrawn, yes not much happens throughout, but still!
First of all, does nobody here know and appreciate the wonderful Margaret Qualley from the hit show The Leftovers? We need more young, stunning actresses like her who only ever choose quality and different projects to showcase their talent in! Most of her movies here on Imdb have low ratings which are totally unwarranted (ok, the one with bill camp was pretty useless...).
She reminded me Margot Robbie in Z for Zacharia, the difference being the latter went on to do Suicide squad, bleah!
Secondly, this is intelligent well thought out science fiction for a change. Yes, the apocalypse is an abused theme but here they are actually rooting for planet Earth, they are trying to adapt and remain, which is an unusual angle. I've read the excellent post detailing many scientific inaccuracies, but still, to an uneducated watcher (i do have a degree in engineering btw, so more educated than most watchers probably), this film appears refreshingly well-written and well documented. The issues about biology, evolution and trying to repopulate the planet with bee colonies are well presented, if probably unrealistic. The overarching theme of human connection, survivors guilt and the dangers of hope are also very important and used more as a subtext than a source for drama (for example, it would appear the mackie character wanted to kill the guru scientist? but he was already dead, which was pretty clear early on, so no big conflict).
The only cheesy thing about this movie would be, for me, the finale, in which not only she's able to breath heavily polluted air (thanks to the bee punctures? i didn't understand that bit, since the bees themselves weren't immune) but of course she also got pregnant after one magic night with a total stranger, who in these conditions would probably be sterile...

In these days where news media ""professionals"" don't take the time to do real journalism and research a story before printing it we can't expect film makers to do any research before writing a script and filming it.
Scientists can somehow build rockets and colonize IO but they can't extract oxygen from the world's oceans that are two parts hydrogen and one part oxygen (H2O). That's just the beginning of scientific flaws in this film.
Slow paced low budget movies are not necessarily bad. Take Napoleon Dynamite for example. But this is a slow movie with no entertainment value.
Andie MacDowell is a sweetheart and a good actress. I expected more from her daughter. Every scene in this film looks like she is auditioning for a college film.
Is this the new generation of film makers? Mankind is evil and distructive. An independent 24 year old female scientist could have saved the planet as an ultimate SJW if men did not ruin it so bad.

#2 they could have met other survivors, some being scientists helping earths recovery, and been reassured there was more human life on earth, and earths life was being restored enough for humanity to regrow. Then have Sam keep Micah on earth to help rebuild it together.
Either way the movie should have ended with Sam, and Micah starting a winderful life together, and yet the writers screwed that up.
Also by adding a better ending, they could have extended the shorten 89 minute movie to a extra 15-20 minutes. I usually don't write reviews, but I'm a fan of sci-fi/fantasy/adventure, and though even with my changes it still wouldn't have been a huge hit, but it's ratings would have gone up 7.5-8.0 easily.
I guess easier way to say it, they should have kept their own script, but add a little Martian, or Passengers to bits thru out the movie, and it specially needed it's type of ending.
Oh well, hard to find really good and new sci-fi/adventure/Fantasy movies anymore.

I love my post apocalyptic movies, new plot lines even if the acting is bad catch my interest. Sadly, this movie just bored me from the start. It's full of unnecessary scenes extended to add time, where you sit and wonder why it's even needed. They didn't add feeling or awe, they didn't reveal any sort of plot point, it was just lots of staring at scenery, rooms or the two main actors doing absolutely nothing noteworthy.The initial premise was interesting, until it settled in how unlikely it was for a movie trying to base things very soundly on science. Just didn't sit as plausible with me.The romance part was ridiculous as well, and I also wonder how the main character and her interstellar love interest even got to truly know each other if she was born and raised only on Earth, as this was never fully explained. Maybe he lived there too, and went to IO later? No clue. It was never really touched upon that I saw, although I won't be watching again to check on this.The whole thing was just frustrating, and I ended up hitting the 10 second fast forward to get past those lengthy pointless scenes that showed us nothing. The ending was 100% ridiculous as well, it made no sense if you really think about the scope of everything, and that probably ticked me off the most. For a scientific main character, I doubt she'd hold to a thought process like that if she was really considering all factors.Best part of the movie was the scenery outside.

The daughter, Sam, carried on her father's experiments with bees, long after his death, and even tried to keep alive his memory by playing recordings of his voice over shortwave radio. Eventually another scientist arrives at her outpost asking to speak to her dad. She lies, to the visitor, Micah, and tells him that the doctor is ""conducting research in the field, and is sometimes gone for days at a time..."" Of course the truth eventually comes out, and we learn a little more about Micah's past, and how Sam's parents died as well.
Other reviewers have panned this movie, as ""plodding"" and definitely one that ""would have you checking your phone."" Another reviewer even compared it to his girlfriend telling the most boring 90 minute story ever -I feel very bad for that shallow, shallow person's s/o.
This movie uses old story telling techniques such as rising action, character development, dialogue, foreshadowing, and allusions. There are no car chases, or zombies, or mutant dogs. Nothing blows up.

Literally nothing, that's it. Nothing. Ever. Happens. The pacing I this movie is absolute garbage. The movie starts with our protagonist I don't even remember her name so I'm just gonna say ""her""
So the movie starts with her in the world with some suit on that keeps the toxic air out because apparently there's something wrong with the air in earth that made all the humans leave.

Anyway he comes looking for her father, she says he's in the mountains somewhere. So he decides to wait for her. And the movie almost makes us feel like we're also waiting two days. NOTHING HAPPENS! After like two days he finds out he's dead! SHOCKER!! Not. Really. So he decides to take her to a a shuttle that will take them to a space station where people live now. In his balloon... now once they decide this I thought the movie would actually start to pick up, it doesn't. the entire movie from this point on is them waiting for the wind to change so they can actually leave. Let me repeat that. The entire movie is them waiting to leave. This whole movie is just the main characters waiting for one reason or another. And while they're waiting, she seduces him?! Out of freaking nowhere. and he says ""no I can't"" and she then Replies "" we have to"" why? WHY DO YOU HAVE TO? can someone please explain to me anything about the plot? and then it cuts over to them looking through a telescope. Yup the scene just cuts away and we don't even know happened. Like maybe they were trying to make us wonder what happened in that scene. But there were better ways to make us as an audience invested. then something happens and he tells her that her father told him and other people to stay, and that his wife was sick and she was gonna die. So he kept the food he had left for himself. And let his wife die. Legit his wife just died like less than a week ago. And that's when he heard the radio thing and came to her base. And that because he let his wife die, he's gonna save her to redeem himself or somthing.
Yea I'm sure your wife appreciates you starving her to death and then having sex with some random girl you met two days ago. God I really hate this movie. Anyway so then he wakes up the Next morning and finds out the shuttle location that's supposed to bring them to other humans changes and they don't have enough helium to get there. So she brings them somewhere where there's a lot of helium. Like seriously this movie is just finding the dumbest plot points. So now they have helium and when they are FINALLY about to leave... get this, she decides to go look at an art museum. Has she shown interest in art at all In this movie before you may ask? No. She hasn't. Also the planet is trying to murder you and your looking at art? Anyway Then the dude from avengers finds her at the museum cause y'know he just knew she'd be there even though she NEVER talked about art before. So now they start talking about art. And she starts talking about dreams she has about how she's walking around without a helmet on. Like I have dreams I can throw like Tom Brady. Can I actually?? NO I CAN'T. So then..get this. She takes off her helmet and she's FINE! Ok so like why did the humans leave when they could just take off they're helmets? It's not like she made something that she's used to make her immune. She's not even special she's just a weird human girl with daddy issues. So anyway she takes off her helmet and she's all fine and dandy. And while she's taking it off she tells him that if she's survives, to tell people to come back to earth.
May I ask this one more time?!?! WHY DID HUMANS LEAVE??? WHAT WAS THE POINT? Alright so anyway The last scene of the movie is her narrating a message to the dude from avengers while he's at the space station. Telling him that THEY miss him. ""They"" Her and her baby. Can anyone guess who's kid that is??? DING DING DING!! You got it! It's the dude from the avengers kid. What's disfuncional family. So yea That's how it ends with him in space. and her and her child just fine without helmets on.There's some other stupid stuff that happens that really has no effect on the plot.1/10 was really bad!",IO

If they do a sequal I really think Elon should have a bigger part.All the sky shots were interesting. Every time they wanted the audience to know time have passed a sky appeared on screen. They were quite pretty though!And the scene where they kissed. OMG I mean I was having trouble to breath because it was so much cringe. She really gave it to him though,""trust me"", ""its okey"", ""we must"". Then I presume they had sex, but nothing really indicates they had it.But the best moment in the movie was when Elon sent her a message telling her he was going out in space, again. And there are some shots of her lookig sad.

Was she not aware she might be robbed, killed or raped? How was this otherwise admirably self-reliant character so stupidly passive about this man? She had a plan for everything but this.

And although this movie had a more or less applicable theme to life these days, it really lacked any depth to keep viewers into it. Hence this review.",IO

I should have listened to all of these on-point reviews about how awful IO is. Totally boring and uninteresting, with wooden and poor acting performances. Anthony Mackie was listed as an Exec Producer -- perhaps that is how they got at least a B-lister to appear in the film? Margaret Qualley was uniformly bad, making her mom Andie MacDowell look accomplished in comparison!I recently watched another Netflix sci fi movie called Titan. That also had many problems and really fell apart at the end, but at least it was slightly more watchable than this effort. It was a struggle to get to the end of IO, but after investing an hour, I felt compelled to stick it through for another 30 min to the end. Its saving grace is that it is short, because if it had been 2.5 hours in length, I would have cut my losses at the one hour mark.",IO

And you get emoting behind a gas mask? You can't create dialogue free drama when you cover up the actors faces as well. It was just dull.

496,tablebythegym,Good Concept Bad Execution,5,18 January 2019,"Although the concept is highly unrealistic, as climate change doesn't make the air poison (don't worry its just turning the ocean into acid), the concept is seemingly original and interesting. I saw the trailer and was intrigued enough to watch. I realized halfway through that this was going to be a pull-out-your-phone kind of movie. There are long stretches where you can look away for thirty minutes and not miss a single thing. There is little suspense in the story and the characters don't act like the movie established they should. There are action scenes that somehow put me to sleep. The costumes, scenery, and visuals are interesting to look at, but nothing to write home about. There are some comical moments where you can see an immaculate lawn or green vegetation in an area that it is established would be impossible.The actors are decent, but don't have much to work with. It feels like the director was yelling, ""more monotone, less passion!"" The script is plodding and full of unnecessary mythology references that will go over most peoples heads and even having knowledge of the stories they were referencing I don't know how it applies. Either it is very complicated or so simple that I am overthinking it. I don't like to throw around the word 'pretentious' a lot, but this is certainly that at times. It is hard to explain without spoilers, but by around 2/3rds in people will understand what I mean.All in all not a horrible movie, but not a good one. I feel with better direction and a more meaty script it could have fallen into a nice spot of an intriguing watch. It also has a very shove-climate-change-down-your-throat kind of attitude that even as someone who believes the scientists on climate change feels forced. The music is really good, but doesn't save it. This movie falls with a lot of Netflix movies into decent but disappointing.",IO

It's really long. No real action for me. Little suspense but really... it's just because you dont know anything about the characters.
Dialogs are awkward and the interactions skip from AWKWARD to BEST FRIENDS to AWKWARD AGAIN without any transition. I could literal time stamp every single mood between the characters without any trouble.
A lot of mythology references that are completely useless.
The visuals tho are amazing. But it feels more like a 96minutes art work then a movie.
The characters have really no emotion other then sad, mad and neutral. It's like a movie with two Bella Swan (is that her name?) from Twilight.

¡ Warning ! Spoilers Ahead ¡ Warning !This is not an action movie, it is a mood movie and that mood is one of dreamlike reflection. The characters, both of them, spend the whole movie chatting with one another. Okay, there's more than two characters and they do do a little more than talk. There is the main character Sam Walden and then there's Micah the second character. Sam's scientist father Dr. Henry Walden is a mostly unseen presence through-out the film as is Sam's putative boyfriend/pen pal Elon. There are also a couple of voices on the radio whom we never see (one of them is automated) and an old recording of a TV host interviewing Dr Walden. There is also Lucy the pig, the bees, and at the end there is the boy. There is also the presence, the hope, of Exodus.This film has a timelessness to it. We know it's set in the future, but how far into the future? We don't know. How long after the present day and before the events of the film did the Earth turn on us? When did the first of the Exodus ships launch for IO? How long from the first ship to this final Exodus ship? Specific measures of time are only mentioned during the broadcasts about the final Exodus launch. This should impart a sense of urgency to our pair of lost souls, yet somehow it does not. Sure, Micah gets angry a couple of times because the wind is blowing the wrong way for them to take off*. Despite this he still seems resigned to wait.What of Sam?
Through-out the film Sam is motionless, lost in a dreamlike state of denial, loss, and isolation. She is in an endless loop, caught between a living a damned existence and a hopeless fantasy of living, of no longer being alone. A dream of looking out over the ocean, the wind blowing freely through her hair.What of Micah?
What will Micah report when he arrives at Exodus? That Sam is alive and breathing in the toxic atmosphere that no one can breathe? Or will he report that Sam died in his arms with a strange, contented smile on her lips, as if in the midst of a happy dream? Her forever-hopeful dream of a life, a future, of no longer being alone. A dream that has been slowly revealed through-out the film.What of the Bees, the marks on Sam's ribs and Lucy?
Dr Henry Walden and Sam seem to be heavily invested in the bees, in adapting them to the toxic environment. Was it just an experiment that Sam obsessed over because it was all she had left? Could the marks on Sam's ribs be bee stings or some kind of antitoxin made from a queen bee? Did Sam give herself one more injection from that final adapted queen bee that Micah found? Is that why she was ready to take her mask off? Lucy the pig, Sam was rather evasive about how Lucy died. Did they take her into the toxic atmosphere too many times or for too long a time? Did she become fully acclimated and ran away or was she unable to return to the clean air after becoming accustomed to breathing the tainted air?What of the Sam's dream and the boy?
It is a boy, not a baby we see in the final scene. Are we expected to believe that Sam gave birth, alone, in a toxic environment? Is this perhaps just Sam's dream, finally revealed to us completely. Her final dream as she died in Micah's arms no longer alone.*I'm not an aeronaut and I'm sure it's far more complicated than I'm presenting it, but I thought that balloonists controlled their direction by changing altitude until they found an air stream headed it the right direction.",IO
536,tommy-trull,Last People on Earth,8,7 February 2019,"Jonathan Helpert's IO tells the story of a young scientist (Margaret Qualley) carrying on her father's work on a ruined Earth, whose surviving inhabitants have abandoned it for sanctuary on Io, a moon of Jupiter. She maintains a long-distance relationship with her boyfriend (Tom Payne), who is now on Io. One day, a balloon descends from the sky carrying a man named Micah (Anthony Mackie), who is the first human she's seen in a long while.This film is deliberately slow and meditative, more intent on exploring its themes than in plot. The first act examines the inner and outer states of a single character, and in the second act, two characters. Only in its third act are we given a sense of purpose and mission. Mythology, adaptability, inheritance, obligation, and human connection are the film's main concerns as it tells the story of how those who look to the past and those who look to the future coexist with one another.As this movie places so much emphasis on the achievements of the classical Greeks, giving intellectual time to Plato along with elements from Hellenistic mythology, I find it interesting that the screenwriters (of which there are at least three) subvert Aristotle's dramatic theory by giving more attention to character than to plot. That's not to say that the film is not engaging -Qualley's and Mackie's performances are largely quite good. But the lack of conflict from scene to scene did allow my mind to wander to other production elements in the film's many open spaces.The dialogue throughout allowed for a fair amount of subtext, which is always a plus. In certain places, however - mainly during passages where the characters spoke of or even recited passages from classical literature - the dialogue was sufficiently stilted that I felt yanked out of the story. There were also elements of Mackie's performance that left me a little cold. In the beginning, especially, his character evinces little more than a scowl. And in two places, the sexual politics of the film would be considered (in some circles, at least) problematic: a character makes a pass at someone, that person rejects them, and yet the original character persists until they get what they want; and the story of Leda and the Swan, which is a crucial thematic component of the third act, glosses over an important part of that story.All that said, I did enjoy this movie. In the face of our hopes for a technological solution to climate change, the question of what we are willing to sacrifice in order to preserve our own history is an important one, and that is where I feel the film was most successful.",IO

I read the other reviews. I'm sorry to burst some people's bubbles, the movie is not slow.
It is however on a tone different from most of the movies made today. Unlike the action packed low on text wham bam thank you mam style that instead of speech you get punchlines, this movie is supposed to get you think, the long pauses are made to get you to reflect on the situation, and the talks are not simple one sentences, they try to be more than that.
And here is where it misses the point.. Some of the dialogue simply does not follow through.. Some of the secrets you're supposed to be surprised by are totally clear from the start.
I think the idea was good, but the execution overlooked many things. Especially when you deal with science you need to be believable..
I think the pace is good, the setting is good. The actors act well. I think it misses on story points, logic, and a bottom line that makes the movie complete, the kind that makes u feel like u didn't lose precious time while watching this and were left empty.",IO

If you knew how much renewable ammonia is used globally for energy that is being caught in our planets growing thickness of our CO2 atmospheric cloud could diminish the Earths O2 air quality to irreversible depletion-regionally-given climate change weather patterns. I found this story to show us what is in store for depleting natures ecological resources that keeps human life from going extinct. A lonely and regretableness of nature's blessings-honey bees as the symbol.Being a steward of the Earth is our responsibility as my take away from this exceptional depiction of what awaits future generations given the religious denial of escalating severe weather patterns of historic proportions.

Even sending Mika with a message that SHE can breathe (doesn't mean everyone would be able to) it would take years and years for anyone to make it back to earth, even if they believed the word of one man. Then they plopped a little Mika child at the end (pointless) and I just thought you selfish woman raising a child there who would never know anyone other than his mother.I expected there at least to be a little action, maybe some baddies trying to steal supplies from them, and I definitely expected st least some space travel.Annoyed, wasted of time",IO
569,fredcrou,Rediculous and pointless,2,28 January 2019,"The concept of the movie is amazing. Humans fled to the stars for new life and search for a new planet; not novelty, but good nonetheless. That is the only good thing about this movie.The most ridiculous aspect is the script. At best it looks like the work of a high school student making first attempts at a script. I do not mind some inconsistencies in the movies (they are movies after all) but this title is based only on extreme silliness!1. The earth's atmosphere changed consistency and it got unbreathable: this is hugest plothole. How on earth noone noticed the gradual change of the composition. How on earth noone did anything to change it. The way it was proposed is as if the ""event (lets call it that way)"" happened overnight. Just saying that we humans did it is not brainer dear writer. Use some skills and explain a bit.
2. The protagonist is extremely annoying. The way she behaves is irrational and extremely bonkers. Right before the time to prepare their balloon to escape to the last shuttle leaving earth, she decided to go to an art museum, and chill for some time. I understand the sentiment; but she had more than a few years to actually go there! Instead she goes on the last minute, risking her partners life! And then she decides to stay on earth on her own, with a child, dooming the child to an eternity of loneliness. Bravo.
3. Another idiotic part is that oxygen stays put in one area. Enough said.
4. Humans cannot survive in toxic atmosphere right. But through evolution, we can do it. Without even following from one generation to another. Nope. All at the same time. Biologically impossible otherwise if she adapted to one atmosphere how she could still breathe oxygen. It makes no sense.The production values of the movie are good, very good cinematography I agree. Visually very pleasing. But with the lack of a proper script, and somewhat boring acting from the protagonists, expect to fall asleep from boredom; or get angry over the stupidness that is depicted.",IO

I almost feel that Netflix should be embarrassed to show this film under their banner as it shows no good qualities of blockbusters nowadays. Such as the length, 2 hours seems to be a good line.

Jesus, I mean come on, this movie gave me more to think about then all the other action packed Apocalypse movies or tv shows I've seen (and I've seen a TON). It's not a movie just about hope you silly people. It's a movie about loss and hope at the same time. Or perhaps, depending on how you see the ending, it was simply all loss.

I get it. I do. The movie has achieved a huge scope, literally beyond the stars and beyond our time, from limited locations and three YES THREE actors. Well two if you discount the cameo. The miraculous is enshrined in the ordinary. The absolute bedrock centre of the narrative for me involved a discussion about corn, beans, and butternut squash. It was sublime. The plants help each other symbiotically to exist. This was what was wrong with the world and led people t leave it in a vast exodus. This is what can heal the broken world again from the roots up, literally. Any writer and I mean any, that can take a discussion about raised bed gardening and make it the fulcrum of a character arc deserves some praise if only from weirdies like me. The dilemma of leaving behind all we think of as civilised, the lingering question in our minds that a brave new world will turn out to have the same demons because we are the common denominator, and the nature of love itself as defined in the classics, all combine to give a journey that challenges our river-deep emotions and core.

Typical Hollywood over emotiveness and drama was wonderfully absent. The male lead also portrayed his anger and sadness and loss without violence and with an inherent respect for life and women.

Which is exactly what any trailer should do. By now anyone should know that trailers often overhype a movie. I have this movie a chance...and was somewhat skeptical.As many have stated this movie is really bad when it comes to science. I do not mind at all if a movie shows things that are not possible in our world. But I expect it to make sense in it's fiction. Even more so if the movie plays on Earth. In that case I do expect it to be at least loosely true to science.I cannot decide if the actors are bad or if the script is bad or maybe the director. Who knows. But most of the dialogues were boring.They wasted so much time on things that didn't add anything to the movie. But when things should take a long time they're pretty much instantly done (Not to spoiler anything but whoever watches the movie will get it).At least I got to see some nice shots of nature. Not many but at least some.I read reviews stating that this is not a movie for low IQ people. Well I'd say less knowledge(not that that has anything to do with IQ) surely helps you to enjoy all the bad things. After all ""Ignorance is bliss"".Probably the best thing is the ending. Which is the sole reason that I'm giving it 3 stars. I kinda like endings that leave room for interpretation. On that note I am kinda surprised that so many reviews take the ending as real.Anyways I would not recommend this movie to anyone. Netflix should really up their game with their originals.",IO

727,quiggsmcghee,Not even pseudoscience fantasy.,1,20 January 2019,"I forced myself to finish this movie in order to feel okay about writing a review; however, I really wanted to step away after the first major factual inaccuracies presented themselves in the first 5 minutes. As an environmental engineer, I feel more than qualified to comment on these inaccuracies. I'll outline several of them from throughout the movie for you here:1) ""... to harvest geothermal energy from other planets."" (00:01:20)
The prefix ""geo"" is defined as ""relating to the Earth""; therefore, ""geothermal energy"" refers exclusively to thermal energy from the Earth. You cannot ""harvest geothermal energy from other planets"" anymore than you can harvest solar energy from a lightbulb.2) ""Sample 181B. Drawn from the sediment strata, should confirm or disconfirm the presence of bacterium able to use ammonium as a main oxygen source."" (00:04:46)
This quote contains two errors, so I will refer to them as ""2a"" and ""2b"".
2a) Ammonium consists of only Nitrogen and Hydrogen, so it could never be a ""main oxygen source"". In the unlikely case that by ""ammonium"" the writers were implying ""ammonium oxide"", it would be within the realms of a science fiction piece to make this claim. However, the fact that this is an isolated use of the term ""ammonium"" in the movie (the writers prefer ""ammonia"" in every other case, which actually is a different chemical compound), along with a later inaccuracy I will address, make the loose inference of ""ammonium"" to ""ammonium oxide"" very unlikely. What's more is that it is not a new concept that bacteria exist which can respire in such conditions. In fact, we have known that they exist for a long time and rely on them in many ways. I will mention this later on as well.
2b) In this quote, the singular ""bacterium"" is used in the plural sense. It's interesting that the writers were even familiar with the singular form when ""bacteria"" is colloquially used in the singular sense, and ""bacterium"" is almost exclusive to scientific literature and dialogue where it is always used in reference to a single bacterium or singular strain of bacteria. Later in the movie, another character makes the opposite but more forgivable mistake when he says, ""Was it a bacteria?"" (01:15:46)3) ""Anaerobic reproduction in a water-striding insect colony."" (00:08:56)
To my knowledge, there is no such phenomenon referred to as ""anaerobic reproduction"". That is not to say that this is impossible or does not exist. Let me explain. Anaerobic simply refers to processes which occur in the absence of a common electron accepter (e.g., nitrate, sulfate, or oxygen). Many organisms, such as anaerobic bacteria, do in fact reproduce in these conditions. However, this is not referred to as ""anaerobic reproduction"" because neither anaerobic nor aerobic conditions lend themselves to a specific type of reproduction. More than likely, the writers actually meant ""anaerobic respiration"". This makes sense in light of the ""scientific"" premise of the movie, which is the struggle of life on earth to adapt to an atmosphere contaminated with ammonia and implicitly low oxygen. The reference to anaerobic conditions also discredits the notion that the writers implied ""ammonium oxide"" when using the term ""ammonium"".4) ""We filter our drinking water through sand and charcoal. It's all it needs."" (00:26:55)
Assuming the water is contaminated with ammonia (like the air), sand and charcoal would do nothing to purify it. In wastewater treatment, where ammonia removal is a necessary process, nitrifying bacteria are used to nitrify ammonia. That is, they ultimately convert the ammonia to nitrate, hydrogen and water. This is a very complicated, multi-step process that involves balancing pH, dissolved oxygen and biochemical oxygen demand to achieve the desired effect. Had the writers suggested that Sam harvested nitrifying bacteria (likely quite common on an ammonia-rich Earth) and used them to treat her water, this would have been within the realms of a science fiction piece. But sand and charcoal would do nothing for ammonia.5) ""It's only cloudy like that because of the charcoal."" (00:26:49)
Charcoal filtration removes particles from contaminated water through adsorption. Most household filters use activated charcoal to improve the aesthetic qualities of their water (look, taste and smell). Implying that the charcoal would actually discolor the water is a major inaccuracy, since it would in fact do the opposite. Now, if the process actually added charcoal to the water instead of filtering the water through the charcoal, this would discolor it, but it would do nothing to filter the water. However, I doubt that is the implication when the ""treated"" water has a light brown hue. Charcoal would have turned the water gray or black, depending on the amount added.6) ""You'd think they could live up high like us."" (00:30:27)
This quote implies that the surviving humans were able to escape the contaminated air by living at a higher elevation. However, ammonia is lighter than air, meaning the ammonia concentration would likely be higher at an increased elevation, not lower.7) Throughout the movie, Sam regularly monitors the air quality by sustaining a flame and observing its color. In the movie, a purple flame is supposed to represent contaminated air, whereas a yellow/orange flame represents clean air. When ammonia burns in the presence of oxygen, the flame is actually yellow, not purple. But let's look at this a little deeper. Ammonia has a flammable range of 15 - 28%. This means that ammonia will not ignite at a concentration of less than 15% volume of air or a concentration higher than 28% volume of air. According to the CDC, ammonia is ""immediately dangerous to life or health"" at just 300 ppm, which is just 0.03% volume of air. A concentration of 15% (150,000 ppm) or higher would not just be damaging to the eyes, nostrils and lungs, but also to the skin. The character would need to wear a fully-enclosed, airtight suit to protect herself against harm.I understand that science fiction writers are not scientists, but the premise behind science fiction is to provide a somewhat plausible scenario that is at least loosely based on some scientific truth. Even fantasy pieces, which delve into realms far beyond the scope of even pseudoscience, do not attempt to rewrite or misrepresent well-known, established scientific fact without some sort of explanation (even if it's something as ludicrous as dolphins that suddenly bound from the ocean into deep space because of their sentience and connections to other-worldly beings).It's quite disappointing to think that so much money and effort could be put into a movie on the part of writers, producers, actors, videographers, and visual effects specialists (to name a few) and yet they didn't think to have somebody with at least the qualifications of a middle school science teacher read over the screenplay.",IO

The main character, Sam, was on a quest to genetically alter bees to breathe on earth after humanity was driven from the planet by a changed atmosphere. Her experimenting with herself in the same way is established then she meets a guy. After the worst days of her life, where a storm ravaged her camp, destroyed her life's work, and the last possible shuttle off Earth was moved to a location they can't reach, they discover the last experiment was a success. Sam talks about how the virgin queen was a failure. They get to know each VERY well shortly after that.

Of course the pacing is slow. . .For Sam (played brilliantly by Margaret Qualley--a perfect science nerd with secret fierce passion), time has essentially stopped unless she's able to continue her father's work to show how mutant species can provide evidence that life on earth can continue without humanity. The fragility of her life alone--the way a single storm can almost ruin hope--is arresting. Equally arresting is the chemistry between Sam and Micah (Antony Mackey)--fabulous casting.

The story focuses on Sam, the daughter of the seemingly only scientist that held up hope that there is no reason to leave the Earth. Mostly everyone took a rocket ship to Io. Sam stayed behind to conduct experiments to see if any surviving life forms are adapting.
One day a man comes out of the sky in a balloon. Micah wants to catch the last shuttle off Earth.
For the next hour, they converse, debate and discuss the plan to leave the Earth as the stakes grow higher and obstacles are placed in the way of our protagonists.
Finally, the climactic third act gives us a resolution and then an endowment.
You might appreciate the slow, plodding, deliberate plot with as much action as a cake baking. If you do you'll find the climax satisfactory. Otherwise, if you like your sci-fi in the vein of Alien, Terminator, or Armageddon don't bother with this flick.
On the other hand if you're looking for an intellectual treatise on global warming, environmentalism, and man's role in nature you might be left wanting for more.

The thing peole need to remember is that movies are 1) an escape; entertainment, 2) a way to explore subjects and ideas and, 3) not meant to be picked apart and analyzed scientifically. If we wanted a completely scientifically accurate film, it'd either be panned as too dry, too bleak, or too boring. This movie had an interesting concept and, yeah, it could have been completely ridiculous in less capable hands, but they kept it low key and didn't focus solely on the science of it, but the emotion of it; the feelings of giving up our home in search of another.

For example Sam can carry enough oxigen for the ride even though she pretends she can't. Why don't you just improvise something that can hold more oxigen tanks? Why are you so stupid? And who is this Elon? Sam acts like he is the love of her life even though we are never properly introduced to him and who is her dad? Again we are not properly introduced to her dad and that means one thing. Both Elon and her dad are stupid plot devices to create a non solid dramatic past. And why did Sam and the black guy kiss?

812,itsrycee,Willing Suspension of Disbelief,6,19 January 2019,"Most of the reviews on here tend to complain about the fact that the movie is slow which, for the most part, is accurate. However, that type of film appeals to an entirely different audience. I watched this film while tired as something that looked slow but interesting, and I got exactly what I was looking for.We're taken on a journey with our main character throughout her daily life. After the film plays with the idea of her father still being present for sometime, we come to the realization that he is not and that before this epiphany, Sam was alone in the world. Her only companion was Elon who was on Io.The film had a rough start, I felt, and at first it was difficult for me to continue. However, with the introduction of Micah, the story progressed quite nicely. He provided a bit of color to an otherwise static experience thusfar with our character Sam.There was also some gorgeous cinematography in the film and most of the shots were quite nice.Finally, most of the complaints I see are in reference to the ending which I actually found to be quite effective. If nothing else, the ending is a representation of human nature. She ends up taking off her mask to discover that she can breathe. Now, I don't think this is some ""adaptation"", but rather showing how we often live in fear simply based off preconceived notions of how things are.The final scene on the beach was fantastic and powerful. In it, our character Sam has had a child. My first thought here took me back to the virgin queen bee Micah and Sam discovered earlier in the movie. I believe the film is trying symbolize Sam being that bee and ushering in a new age for humans on Earth.I don't see there being a sequel to this movie, however, which might not be such a bad thing. If Micah was to travel to Io (and if upon arriving there, was able to find anyone willing to return to Earth), I feel as though that would introduce either too many or too few Sci-Fi elements into the storyline as we've experienced it.For a one-off film, it was enjoyable to watch and is certainly worth the hour and a half should you have it to spare.",IO
813,theholycornholio,The meme Big Chungus has a better plot than this,2,23 January 2019,"I wanted this movie to be something else, at least enjoyable, which it was not. The cast is inconsistent. Good at times but all-in-all very underwhelming, which is especially problematic if there are at most 5 different people with spoken lines in the whole movie.As another reviewer pointed out, scientifically, this movie makes no sense. And yeah it's pseudoscience and sci-fi and usually stuff that's unrealistic doesn't bother me - like a lot of anime and other survival/thriller movies of this genre. I think the problem is that this movie doesn't take any liberties to express that it's in a different ""universe"", but instead nestles itself as a time-line that the viewer lives in. So it tries to be scientific and realistic in this sense, but butchers a handful of key concepts. It's hard to take this movie serious (which I think is the intent of it) with all of the fallacies regarding Ammonium.Lastly, the plot. There is no plot. Literally the description on Netflix is all there is to this. Nothing that subverts expectations happens, so this makes for a very, very boring movie. If it was an hour and change then the plot would have worked better. The majority of the movie is pretentious, but high-level, filler and attempts at philosphical banter - or scenes following the characters walking around or doing mundane actions. I don't know, a lot of movies do this well, but this particular movie is just quite boring. Visually and audially, this movie isn't stunning, it's dull. Which does fit the tone of the film. However, because everything else is dull as well (writing, plot), these don't mix to offer anything substantial. All in all, I don't recommend this film, it's not good. This movie could have been good, but it missed basically all of the marks that makes a film likeable hence the negative score.And of course OF COURSE the mysterious engineer boyfriend on the space colony is named Elon... It just seems shallow and an attempt at being ""relatable"" and ""ooooh futuristic but also something that could happen soon"". This character name choice cannot possibly be a coincidence either. As you can tell, it irked me, and while a very minor detail, furthers my point that this movie tries to be in the viewer's ""universe"".

829,ssgokur-61394,Not what I expected,5,20 January 2019,"I confess I was lured in by the trailer and I was fairly excited to watch this movie at the onset. This was due in part to Netflix's recent track record of making pretty good movies/tv shows so I dived right in. This feeling of euphoria quickly dissipated as I continued to watch. Let me explain.This movie is a hodgepodge of various themes, concepts or ideas which don't really work. This movie loosely sets up the rules of engagement from the opening scene. The Earth has become uninhabitable and mankind has fled to seek refuge on one of Jupiter's moons IO, A small number of people have decided to stay behind clinging to life so to speak out of stubbornness or faith. Chief among them is the main character and we are taken through the paces of her typical day. We see her communicating with the aptly named Elon who fled Earth with the rest of mankind. Midway through we discover that she is in fact not the last survivor on Earth because we Netflix seemingly believes we have not been treated to this trope enough. Mackie is okay in this movie but he doesn't have a lot to work with and I guess he needs to pass the time until the Marvel cheques clear. I didn't sense any real chemistry between the two leads but we are to buy that they share an intimate night together on the heels of Sam, the female lead, finding out that Elon is not waiting around for her and is instead volunteering for an exploration mission because the million of miles between them wasn't enough as is :S. Mackie's character is revealed to be a teacher and he ensnares her with tales of Greek Mythology. After all that was being set up and all the exposition about love the movie does a 180 in its final moments and ends abruptly. This movie was akin to a lot of foreplay with no climax. Was the final scene supposed to be taken literally??? Did she really have sex with a stranger who she knew for 5 mins and got pregnant for him??? Why bring a child into that situation??? If it's not to be taken literally and she's dead then what's the overarching message we are to take from it. The movie would've made more sense if she experienced a type of catharsis where she finally gave up on trying to prove her father right and seeking to reconnect with her other half. It would've paralleled the Symposium story that was relayed earlier by Mackie's character. What's the connection to the title of the movie???
All in all, this movie had promise but it was let down in its execution. It tried to be a jack of all trades but essentially was a master of none. You can skip this one.",IO

Might not be one of the action driven kinds but the actors do a fine job and the plot is quite intereting. Even if it is not very scientific. I also like the scenery and the setup. And also the end.

You should have hired for science consulting a high school science teach, or even a good high school student, because:
Ammonia (NH3) can never be a source of Oxygen (O2) except you do pretty wild nuclear fusion.geothermal energy only exists on earth. To harvest it and to sent is back to earth you would spent much more energy than to harvest .. earth's geothermal energy.

836,ambrdrive,Still a better love story than Twilight,3,20 January 2019,"OK while waiting for all the scientific things to blast through I end up watching a bad love-thingy movie.
Beginning of the movie really got my hopes up that it's gonne be a The Martian like story. Following with Sam's habitable enclave filled up the part explaining how she survives on earth starting to make the movie a 9/10.
However, everything after that just goes into a huge pitfall. The meaning of the introduction gets completely nullified since it turns out to be a love story. The plot ""make the earth habitable again"" almost never picks up again, it just turns into ""how much do you give up for your love?""
Well, let's put all the science away. Is it still a good love story? Nope. It sucks pretty hard.
The ending? Sucks even more.
Don't watch it. Or just watch like ... the first 30 minutes? Then turn it off. Trust me.
3/10 because of the well made introduction.
And the acting was quite OK for a low-budget movie.
Oh, and beautiful landscapes.
Besides that? Crap.",IO
837,melbatoast-61033,I think maybe a lot of viewers are missing the point? Or maybe I am.,8,21 January 2019,"So, this movie has gotten pretty lukewarm-to-chilly reviews. Apparently people find it boring, and the opening narration which ""explains"" what happened to the Earth to cause most humans to flee in Exodus ships to Io, the moon of Jupiter, is scientifically and logically improbable, if I'm being kind. But no review I've seen so far touches on what I got out of the movie, which is this:Scientists predicted something terrible would happen, but they were too late and couldn't do anything about it.Notably, it isn't global warming but an ""unexplained atmospheric event"" that turns the earth poisonous to life. In other words, not only were scientists ineffectual, they were crying wolf about the wrong thing.More importantly, and this theme was reiterated a number of times and was key to the story, scientists were arrogant to imagine they know anything or could predict anything or in fact understand anything at all. (About midway through the movie, the entirety of the protagonist's (and her father's before her) life's work in science is wiped out utterly by a freak storm. She writes to her beau on Io that everything is gone and all their work is meaningless. She restates this in different ways later on. Science has no purpose.)Somehow, though, her greenhouse and living quarters (and ATVs) survive intact. It's significantly only her scientific work that disappears overnight.Qualley and Mackie are clearly meant to be Adam and Eve. Mackie's character describes this concept (looking for your other half) by quoting Plato, but that story is very similar to the story of the creation of Eve, just less misogynistic. (They also discuss Leda and the Swan, and that painting is a repeated motif.)The primary struggle in the movie is internal to Qualley's character, and it is one of faith vs. evidence-based science. She wants to believe the Earth can heal itself, and that life will flourish there again, despite logic-based characters (Mackie and her off-world beau) urging her to give up her faith. (Note: her faith is not ever described as religious, and I'm not sure they ever use the word faith, and I think they might have only used God once and not directly in this context.)The ultimate resolution is essentially that God doesn't make mistakes. Nothing humans can do affects the conditions on Earth, but when Qualley's character ultimately chooses faith and stays behind when the last Exodus (note the name) ship leaves Earth, she is able to miraculously breathe the atmosphere. She later bears a child and they walk on the beach on a new Earth, where life has begun again.The protagonist's encampment, which is a rare spot where the air is relatively safe to breathe-is up high above the ""flood"" of poisonous air, in some unspecified mountains, which I will choose to call the Mountains of Ararat.So, in my opinion, the vague ""science"" and illogical setup in the narration at the beginning was entirely deliberate, and not lazy writing at all. They might as well have said, ""God sent a flood, and those who could escaped on an ark."" Which is basically what they did say-it was purely symbolic.Now, call me crazy, but the messaging in this movie seems REALLY VERY CLEAR. And yet, I'm super impressed by how it's not explicit in its objectives.Aside: I actually really liked the movie. It's my kind of quiet, post-apoc, interpersonal drama, and Mackie was pretty fantastic. The writing was strong, and clear, and concise, and I liked the characters. So, am I nuts to put this read on it?",IO

839,feathrie,You can get something beautiful out of this movie,7,22 January 2019,"We all like or dislike movies depending on our expectations, preferences, and knowledge, as much as the perceived quality of the acting, the photography and the story, among others. I believe that a movie is more than the science or the accuracy of the details, and that you can get something out of it as long as you keep an open mind.In spite of the inaccuracies and the continuity mistakes I saw, I enjoyed how this film made me feel. This is the first time I was able to connect with a story in a way that let see myself as if I had to leave Earth for good to go and live (and most likely die) in a space station. I felt pain for those lives lost and the immense legacy of all kinds of amazing art that had to be abandoned; I felt sadness for not being able to see the ocean or the mountains ever again and the anxiety of an uncertain future. The experience became way more real than with other movies.Some say the movie is slow. The same was said about The English Patient. I think that happens when the intention is to move you emotionally--as opposed to appeal to your intellect-- by giving you time to absorb the situation. Whether that's true or not may not matter to you, but I tell you that this film got my attention until the end and I'm happy I watched it.May Earth live forever!",IO

It would be a good short film. But as if we know from the very beginning what might happen and storytelling does not give us something different ,it felt too long .
Sam's character is weird in the film ,as I have said ,it would have been meaningful if mother earth motif was there but again the film fails to explore that, to dive deep enough to express that .
