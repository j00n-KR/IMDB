0,SnoopyStyle,Nice dark mood but too obvious and too many little problems,5,1 January 2014,"This starts in 1983 St Jovite, young Martin Asher (Paul Dano) viciously kills a man. After the opening credit, the movie goes to today in Montreal. The police have Costa (Ethan Hawke) in custody who says he's witnessed a murder that bares a striking resemblance to the one earlier. Olivier Martinez is one of the cops who suspects Costa is hiding something. FBI special agent Illeana Scott (Angelina Jolie) is brought in to profile. They eventually settle on another suspect played by Kiefer Sutherland.The opening made a mistake. It's not clear enough that the first murder happened in the past. Flashing the dates for 2 seconds is not enough. I missed it, and I couldn't figure out the start at the first viewing. Paul Dano bears no resemblance to Ethan Hawke. So it was hard to figure out why the audience is given clues that Ethan Hawke is the killer.And there are a lot of little mistakes. Angelina Jolie is trying too hard to be that quirky FBI profiler type with the far away stare. There are too many clues, and too many obvious clues. There is good mood being put down, but there are too many little problems to overlook.",Taking Lives
1,claudio_carvalho,Reasonable Thriller With Many Plot Points,7,23 December 2004,"The special FBI agent Illeana Scott (Angeline Jolie) is called by the Montreal police force to help in the investigation of a serial killer, who destroys the faces and takes the hands off his victims. Montreal Police Inspector Leclair (Tchéky Karyo) has met Illeana in Quantico along six months, and is aware that she can help detectives Duval (Jean-Hugh Anglade) and Paquette (Oliver Martinez) in their investigation. The artist James McKeen Costa (Ethan Hawke) is found with a victim in a park, and claims that he saw the killer. He gives a hint to the police through a sketch of the killer's face, and is protected by Illeana and the Canadian team force against any revenge of the assassin. ""Taking Lives"" is a very reasonable thriller, having many plot points, but being predictable with no innovations, and very similar to ""Seven"", ""The Silence of the Lambs"", ""The Bone Collector"", ""Resurrection"" and other ""tales"" of serial killers. There is a great manipulation of the viewer with one specific scene, when Illeana returns to Washington and which was also included in the deleted scenes (only with more details), but the last twist saves the movie. Further, the character of Illeana is overrated as a special agent sent to another country, being very fragile in many moments. Although having this great flaw in the script, the cast is excellent and the story is not bad, and in the end it is a good entertainment. The soundtrack of Phillip Glass, with the beautiful song ""Bad"" of the U2, is another good attraction. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Roubando Vidas"" (""Stealing Lives"")",Taking Lives
2,gavin6942,Somewhat Disappointing,6,20 January 2015,"An FBI profiler is called in by French Canadian police to catch a serial killer who takes on the identity of each new victim.What a great cast, including a more mainstream role for Gena Rowlands, who steals every scene she is in. We also have a relatively young Angelina Jolie and Ethan Hawke in one of his stronger roles (far predating his Oscar nomination for ""Boyhood"").Unfortunately, the film starts strong but then slows down, becomes plodding and predictable. Some have called it just another average thriller, and that is more or less what it is. Neither great nor terrible, but ultimately forgettable.",Taking Lives
3,jboothmillard,Taking Lives,3,20 December 2009,"From director D.J. Caruso (Disturbia), I had heard about about this film from the leading actress, and the opinion of a character in The Lenny Henry Show, so I decided to see what I'd think. Basically successful Special Agent FBI profiler Illeana Scott (Razzie nominated Angelina Jolie) is in Quebec to help the law enforcement in Montreal to help catch a serial killer who has been on the loose for years. As the seemingly random victims are identified, they find out that they were claimed to be living because the killer has been living their lives, with their ID and stuff. Illeana, with fellow detectives Paquette (Olivier Martinez) and Duval (Jean-Hugues Anglade) initially suspect the suspect was Hart (Kiefer Sutherland), before he was killed in a big car explosion. Then they find key witness James Costa (Ethan Hawke) who may have known the killer, and he manages to have a small fling with Illeana. She is very upset when she finds out it is him (duh!), and she isn't afraid to have him caught and killed. Then it moves to nine months later, where she appears to be pregnant, and Costa has been watching her since, but when he is eventually defeated, she reveals it was all a set up to catch him, quite a good one. Also starring Tchéky Karyo as Leclair, Gena Rowlands as Mrs. Asher and Paul Dano as Young Asher. Jolie is quite underused, she only gets a few decent moments, including her obvious sex scene, and the support of Hawke and Sutherland doesn't help much either, a disappointing psychological thriller. Adequate!",Taking Lives
4,ccthemovieman-1,"Entertaining, But Too Easy To Solve",6,21 August 2006,"This was a so-so serial killer movie with good and bad marks. The good marks were mainly for keeping the viewer's interest. You don't fall asleep watching this film. Angeline Jolie looks as good as I've ever seen her, facially and figure-wise.The film loses marks for an easy-to-solve story, some credibility gaps especially later in the movie and too small a part for Keifer Sutherland to get third billing. He has a very short role in here, hardly worth billing which was a bit disappointing.Also, the French accents by Jean-Hgues Anglade and Tcheky Karyo were hard for me to understand, forcing me to put on the English subtitles.",Taking Lives
5,rmax304823,Caution -- Serial Killer at Work.,3,19 September 2006,"The Canadian film industry has an illustrious history of producing subsidized documentaries and rather slow, thoughtful commercial movies. This one doesn't fit the mold.The killer offs one victim after another and assumes their identities because he can't bear the fact that his Mom preferred his twin and he can't stand being himself. (Got that?) Angelina Jolie is Illeana, an FBI agent and friend of someone on the Montreal police force who is asked to help out in the case.There has been a witness to the latest murder, a scared young man who is an artist, Ethan Hawke. Jolie falls for him. The police use him as bait to trap the killer. I'm not sure how that arrangement developed because I found myself a little confused on a few points, this one included. No matter. The man everyone believes to be the murderer, Kiefer Southerland, has about ten minutes of screen time, two of which he spends dead. Case solved, right? So Jolie and Hawke are free to consummate their mutual attraction. They do it in a raw scene in which it is unclear whether Hawke is consuming Jolie or the other way around.But -- hold on. For some reason, and I say this only because this is another point that left me bemused and wondering if my synapses had shorted out, Hawke reveals himself as the murderer and traps his mother (Gena Rowlands) in an empty elevator. ""All I ever wanted was your love,"" he tells her tenderly just before he slaughters her and saws her head off.Jolie is fired from the FBI for ""egregious poor judgment"" and retires to an isolated and thoroughly desolate farm house outside of Carlisle, Pennsylvania. She appears to be preposterously pregnant with Hawke's child. Well, when a babe lives alone and helpless and a killer out there is interested in her, we know what will develop. The last ten climactic minutes turn into a woman-in-jep movie. Hawke shows up, throws Jolie around, and finally stabs her in her swollen belly with a pair of scissors. She promptly pulls them out and plunges the scissors into his heart. As Hawke is standing there looking puzzled at his protruding scissors, she reveals that she's not pregnant at all. It's just a foam rubber bladder or something. The whole thing was a trap set by Jolie and the police to catch Hawke. There's no explanation of why she needed the scissors when Jolie, the actress, could have simply vaporized her attacker with her sexual heat.It's interesting to listen to what Philip Glass, my man, does with the score for an ordinary serial-killer flick. He stretches every ligament to suit his fulgurating minimalism to the demands of trash. A hand reaches out of the darkness and claps Jolie on the shoulder and the act is accompanied by a loud dissonant crash.Jolie is magnetic. Not just because of her collagenated lips or her huge, knowing eyes, but because she's a presence whenever she's on screen, which is most of the time. Yet I can't think of a single outstanding performance from her, or an exceptional film that she's ever appeared in. I wish she'd get more demanding material.Ethan Hawke is uninteresting. My judgment about these things is perforce humble but he doesn't seem handsome, and his acting is no better than adequate. And, my God, if this movie needs ANYTHING, it needs a great villain to make up for the ordinariness of the script and the other characters.It's well photographed and good use is made of locations, and the supporting cast is pretty good. The opening scenes are nicely done too.But the credits. How did this fad ever get started? Crudely typed letters jiggle on the screen, alternating with shots of a few words from a newspaper headline, and there is this loud, scratchy, metallic, buzzing, jangling music, as if recorded in a lumber mill, to set your nerves on edge in a cheap sort of way.I don't know. Is it possible to see just one serial killer flick too many?",Taking Lives

7,moonspinner55,Poor taste mars otherwise dumb-fun thriller...,5,31 January 2008,"Angelina Jolie as a special agent with the F.B.I. investigating serial murderer case in Eastern Canada, involving a killer who takes on the identities of each of his victims, usually drifters he befriends in bus stations and train stops. Adaptation of Michael Pye's novel is full of ridiculous moments (including the pre-credits opening, which involves three broke-down vehicles and two dead bodies, all scored to songs by U2 and the Clash!). Jolie gets paired with two local police detectives who are evidently playing a game of 'good cop-bad cop'--one is congenial and the other is belligerent and rude, at one point even slapping Angie across the face. Kiefer Sutherland and Gena Rowlands have facetious roles, but Ethan Hawke (as a witness to one of the killings) is gaunt and wild-eyed, giving one of the twitchiest performances in memory. Once he locks lips with Jolie, one can't help but to roll his eyes over this overbaked, derivative scenario, which director D.J. Caruso keeps plugging with inexplicable close-ups of everything (he's prop crazy). The film has a few jolts, and Jolie is pretty if awfully stoic (at one point, when a body falls out of an opening, she barely reacts). Still, the predictably suspicious finale has some over-the-top violence which doesn't quite play--even if Caruso is winking, his lack of taste coats the final product with a sour residue. ** from ****",Taking Lives
8,blanche-2,Derivative thriller,7,9 May 2008,"The good news is that ""Taking Lives"" isn't as bad as the reviews on this board would have you believe; the bad news is that there isn't much about it that's a) unpredictable or b) new. It sports a fine cast of Angelina Jolie, Ethan Hawke, Gena Rowlands, Kiefer Sutherland, Tchéky Karyo, Jean-Hugues Anglade and Oliver Martinez. Sutherland and Rowlands, however, are completely wasted.The film begins in the '60s with a brutal murder and then jumps to the present. An FBI profiler (Jolie) is out to nab a serial killer in Montreal who takes on the identity of his victim. A witness to one of the killings, an art gallery owner (Hawke) is cleared of suspicion. While under special protection by the police, he falls for Jolie. A woman (Gena Rowlands) comes forward, claiming to have seen her dead son, which leads the investigation to the true identity of the killer.As others have pointed out, it's fairly derivative stuff. The filmmakers would have been better off delving more into Jolie's character - a beautiful, unmarried woman who wears a wedding ring to keep the men away and sits in her bath staring at autopsy photos and also pastes them around her bed so she can study them. Jolie gives us the inability to read the profiler but the script doesn't offer much else.There are a couple of Swiss-cheese sized holes in this film, but mentioning them would give away the plot. For all of its lack of originality, ""Taking Lives"" offers some suspenseful moments and some good acting.",Taking Lives
9,Quinoa1984,"better than expected, though it's fine to wait for TV (save for one scene for the guys)",7,24 June 2008,"Taking Lives is a slightly more-than-competently made thriller that keeps one tied into the story even as it goes on to its inevitable TWIST (in caps!) It's done with a minimal amount of flash and over-pizazz with a visual style (believe me, around this time with serial killer flicks they got stale quick with directors going for the look that could make you have a conniption fit- Suspect Zero is an example). And it's a good star vehicle for stars Angelina Jolie and Ethan Hawke (and Keifer Sutherland if one remembers he's in the movie). They deliver their star power for a plot that should be stale- and without some little clever tricks with the dialog and somehow making the characters believable it would be- but has the good knack of a little change at the start: it's about a killer that assumes the identities of the ones he kills.Not a bad hook, and for the longest while it functions pretty well as a solid cat-and-mouse thriller. This being said, and also saying that the performances are strong and the final twist, for all its ""GOTCHA-ness"", is pretty clever as far as making it kind of twisted, it's nothing that needs to be bought right off the shelf. If it weren't for one fantastic sex scene (this and the unedited one from Original Sin reveal how good a handle Jolie has on ""doing it"" on camera), it would be surely something that's purely worth a TV viewing late at night on TNT or other. Luckily, if you do come across it on TV, it's not too boring, and it fills up the screen as best a movie in the tradition of (if not rip-off of) Se7en can hope to do. It's fun, in its strange way.",Taking Lives
10,edwagreen,Taking Lives is So Predictable **1/2,6,3 June 2006,"Interesting but very predictable film regarding a serial killer, who takes the identities of his victims, since he wants to keep forgetting his own real-life.Angelina Jolie is the cop in hot pursuit and Ethan Hawke, may very well be the art dealer who witnessed one of the beatings.Kiefer Sutherland is in a brief role as the supposed killer. It's hard to believe that the great actress, Gena Rowlands, would take this part. She usually has much better material to work with.My former junior high school students could have easily figured out who the killer was. Entertaining, but give us more food for thought!",Taking Lives
11,BandSAboutMovies,Americanized giallo,4,8 September 2021,"While not perfectly a fit into the giallo, Taking Lives does have a heroine who gets involved with the killer, a Phillip Glass score and the changing identity of the killer having a central part of the story.D. J. Caruso has some interesting films like Disturbia and The Salton Sea to his credit - we'll ignore I Am Number Four and XXX: Return of Xander Cage - and this time, he's telling the story of Martin Asher, a serial killer who assumes the identity of life of each victim he kills.FBI Agent Illeana Scott (Angelina Jolie) has traveled to Montreal to get treated poorly by male cops and help solve the case. She soon discovers that Martin felt unloved and in the shadow of a twin brother, whose death pushed him into madness. In the childhood home of the killer, she finds a passageway that reveals Martin's special room, a place in which she's attacked by someone who runs before she can catch him. Her only lead comes from art dealer James Costa (Ethan Hawke), who was a witness to Asher's last murder. And, as these things happen, the two engage in naked investigative action while surrounded by murder photos and James bleeding everywhere from stitches he needed after his latest run-in with Asher.It's not all that simple, of course.Wait - where's Kiefer Sutherland? Well, he has around three minutes of screen time in this. He still got billed third, so the real star of this movie is his agent.Taking Lives is fine for an American thriller. The ending has some nice twists and Gena Rowlands is great in her small role. For a movie with four writers (there was a lot of script doctoring), you may expect a bit more, though.",Taking Lives
12,Coventry,"Still collecting bones, Angelina?",3,30 April 2007,"In this weak and very disappointing ""supernatural"" thriller, ravishing beauty Angelina Jolie pretty much repeats the role she played in ""The Bone Collector"", even though she clearly wanted this film to be more successful and maybe even able to compete with the real big boys like ""Seven"" and ""Silence of the Lambs"". This is a mediocre-at-best thriller, lacking surprise and genuine shocks, while the screenplay dedicates too much valuable time focusing on Angelina Jolie's tremendous good looks and her character's emotionally troubled persona. The opening sequence, however, is actually very moody and promising as it depicts two male teenagers on the road, fleeing away from their lives at home. They have a banal car accident on the way and, instead of helping his dying friend, Martin Asher kills him and mysteriously walks away singing. The peculiar prologue is stylishly shot and atmospheric, but unfortunately the film lowers in quality immediately after the credits. Many years later, the Canadian city of Montréal is terrorized by a serial killer whose modus operandi is complex enough for the local police department to ask the help of the acclaimed American profiler Illeana Scott (Jolie). Even though the script makes no real reference of her character being supernaturally gifted, she's the type of weirdo who lies in murder victims' graves and instantly becomes able to tell what color the killer's socks were when he committed the murder. She quickly suspects the serial killer to be some sort of shape-shifter, capable of literally stealing the identities of his/her victims. She then hooks up with the key witness (Ethan Hawke) and undergoes a truck-load of sexual harassment jokes from her reluctant Canadian co-workers. ""Taking Lives"" is sadly too reminiscent to multiple episodes of ""The X-Files"" as well as to ""Kiss the Girls"" and the aforementioned ""The Bone Collector"". Personally, I'm pretty fed up with thrillers dealing about super-intelligent FBI-profilers who are never wrong and nearly always anticipate the responses and actions of the fellow characters. Also, director D.J. Caruso strictly and obediently follows the rules of ethically correct mainstream thrillers, meaning there are no shocking images of violence or controversial themes. Heck, even the obligatory sex sequences are insufferably tame and unexciting! In case you've seen your share of supernatural thrillers and/or TV-shows, the 'mystery' is also fairly easy to predict and even though the final denouement is more or less inventive, it still definitely lacks the power to impress you. Angelina Jolie is a terrific actress, but this isn't her type of role and she doesn't nearly get enough helpful feedback from her co-stars. Ethan Hawke seems very uninterested (even though he has the honor of sharing the bed with Jolie), Tchéky Karyo & Jean-Hughes Anglade act on automatic pilot and Kiefer Sutherland's contribution to the film is hardly even worth mentioning. ""Taking Lives"" is watchable of course, thanks to the fancy production values, but still I'm glad I patiently awaited for it to air on TV and not spend any money on a rental.",Taking Lives
13,michaelRokeefe,When is a life not worth taking?,6,8 April 2005,"D.J. Caruso directs this chilling thriller. Montreal detectives working on a homicide investigation reluctantly ask for the help of an FBI profiler, Special Agent Illeana Scott(Angelina Jolie) to keep a cold case from getting any colder. It is suspected that a cunning serial killer is assuming the lives of his victims. An eye witness (Ethan Hawke)bungles the help he has offered. Agent Scott with her honed skills is very close to making a positive I.D. of the serial killer; but finds herself in an emotional entanglement that causes her to doubt her own instincts.Of course there is the obligatory Jolie nude scene. (I most certainly am not complaining). Her character seems a bit smug at times; but this must be a product of her work ethic. Hawke manages to put chills up your spine. Kiefer Sutherland and Gena Rowlands help round out the cast. Olivier Martinez is pretty obnoxious...his character is really not needed anyway. My favorite scene is when Hawke pins Jolie to the wall and heated lust takes over. And beware of a quick surprise that will have you jumping from your seat. Right when you want something to happen...it does. Some may think the pace is a bit slow, but it sets the atmosphere. Sans Jolie would be losing most of the movie.",Taking Lives

J. Caruso.Illeana Scott is a special agent with the FBI who has a reputation for using offbeat methods, but also boasts a strong record as a criminal profiler. Scott is called in by a former Quantico colleague to assist two Canadian police detectives, Paquette and Duval, who are on the trail of a serial killer who has been doing business in and around Montreal for close to two decades. The murderer has a history of assimilating many aspects of the lives of his victims after he kills them, but there's been a witness to his most recent crime. Art gallery owner James Costa saw the killer during an assault, and now finds himself working as an only marginally willing decoy for Scott. As Scott and Costa follow the killer's trail, they find themselves becoming attracted to one another, which is not necessarily a comfort to Scott as she finds her quarry moving closer and closer.While it doesn't rank with such grim classics as The Silence of the Lambs and Seven, D.J. Caruso's Taking Lives offers similarly heavy atmosphere, beginning well before fizzling into absurdity.It is a stylish, but predictable thriller where the plot trades in several familiar tropes of the serial-killer genre and the only thrills are offered by the sensuous Angelina Jolie.

15,jotix100,Watching pictures in bed,7,6 April 2005,"As police thrillers go, ""Taking Lives"" does not bring anything new to the genre. However, this is a film that will take the viewer into the mind of a serial killer. Director D. J. Caruso gives us to a fun ride that while not totally original, it will not disappoint the people that stay with the story until the end.Angelina Jolie, as Illeana Scott, is not as intense as in other films, but her scenes with Costa, played with great panache be Ethan Hawke, will reveal more about this woman than we have previously seen of her. Ms. Jolie is a beautiful woman to feast ones eyes on. Her agent Scott will not disappoint her avid followers.Ethan Hawke plays the pivotal role of Costa. Mr. Hawke's contribution to the film is enormous. Playing against Ms. Jolie, this actor clearly demonstrates why he is one of the most interesting personalities working in movies today.Unfortunately not much is left for Olivier Martinez, Jean Hughes Anglade and Tcheky Karyo to do. They play Canadian detectives, but obviously they are doing thankless jobs. Also Gena Rowlands is seen briefly in the film.See this film with an open mind as it will reward the viewer in unexpected ways.",Taking Lives
16,Hey_Sweden,"Not bad, but we've seen most of this stuff before.",6,21 July 2019,"Angelina Jolie is well cast as Illeana Scott, an FBI profiler who's adept at figuring out serial killers and their m.o.'s & motivations. She's called in as a specialist when Montreal police realize that they have a serial killer on their hands. One thing that the detectives seem to have going for them is an eyewitness, art dealer James Costa (Ethan Hawke), who saw the psycho in action. But Illeana ultimately compromises her abilities, and the progress of the case, by becoming sexually involved with Costa.One would like to enjoy this mainstream thriller more than they actually do. Part of the problem is that, even by this point, over a decade ago, we'd already seen numerous other cop vs. psycho movies with dark tones. But this movie is eventually done in by being much too predictable and obvious. It doesn't take a high IQ to figure it all out. The attraction between Scott and Costa is one mildly fresh wrinkle, leading to a passionate bout of lovemaking in a hotel room decorated with macabre photos.The characters help to keep it watchable. The international cast also includes Kiefer Sutherland (one of this movies' biggest crimes is making a thorough waste of his talents; he's barely in the thing), Gena Rowlands, Tcheky Karyo, Jean-Hugues Anglade, and Olivier Martinez. A young Paul Dano can be seen in the opening pre-credits sequence. Jolie is fine, playing a more mousy and feminine variation on her tough cop in ""The Bone Collector"" (just one of the other Hollywood features in this vein).Screen story and screenplay concocted by Jon Bokenkamp, based (I'm guessing loosely?) on a novel by Michael Pye, which one might assume was at least more nuanced than a routine (albeit quite sexy and violent) thriller such as this one.Overall, it's passable, but there are better features of this ilk out there.

18,CinemaSerf,Taking liberties with our brains...,5,7 December 2020,"Angelina Jolie does her best here and Ethan Hawke injects just a touch of menace but otherwise it's a rather far-fetched crime thriller set in Montreal. ""Martin Asher"" leaves his home and by systematically killing men as he ages - and assuming their identities - has left quite a trail of corpses over almost twenty years before FBI profiler Jolie is drafted in to try and help them get to the bottom of it all. The acting is ok, by and large, but a few ""guest appearances"" from Kiefer Sutherland, Gena Rowlands and probably the briefest of roles in his career for Justin Chatwin, can't really develop the rather dreary writing nor give it much sparkle as we lumber towards an ending that is just plain daft. In theory, the story is complex and has enough about it to keep us guessing, but the overall execution is flat and proves pretty uninteresting after about ten minutes.

I would watch her knit a sweater for 109 minutes and consider it a productive use of my time. I got more that that in the extra six minutes that is included in the Unrated version! I knew there was something creepy about young Asher, but even I was surprised when he moved into action. Then it turned into a serial killer hunt much as Kathy Reichs would have written in her novels, not her show currently on TV.I had my suspicions about Costa (Ethan Hawke) and knew there was something that was going to happen after he and Jolie had that glorious six minutes.The ending was brilliant and satisfying.

Now, he's suddenly leaving a trace, because... er... well, if he didn't, there wouldn't be a movie, and I wouldn't be wishing I could get the last 103 minutes of my life back. No, really, there appears to be no real reason or explanation for it(and it's far from the only thing in this). Anyway, a couple of supermodels emitting distracting accents are joined by a female FBI agent(Jolie, because she's hot and guarantees butts in seats... and she does make an effort to act, foiled by the tame writing that especially does disservice to the aspect of characters), an obsessive detective with mad deductive skillz. This upsets the local cops, since that'll stir up some conflict, and even if that isn't resolved, it'll be a good element, right? This is leave-your-brain-at-the-door ""entertainment"". I'm getting a distinct bad feeling about director Caruso... while I've only watched these two of his works, I Am Number Four was equally pretty but empty. Oh, no mistake about it... this is well-produced from a purely technical stand-point. It's filmed nicely and edited tightly. However, if you have any kind of expectation of a mystery that it should reward the viewer for paying attention(rather than directly contradict its own clues, and put all its effort into building up its red herrings so that we cease to question them, using misdirection like a common stage magician), and that it isn't, in fact, just about stringing the audience along. Early on, you find out that the twists in this are just that the flick does everything it can to make you think one thing, then reveals the opposite to be true, even if that strains credulity, and with the rewind button backing you up in it holding up to scrutiny. Why bother crafting something of quality? They already got your four bucks. If this is coming off as someone bitter they didn't figure it out, I will freely admit that I tend to have a bad track record on solving these... that doesn't bother me in the least. I simply have low tolerance for mainstream pictures thinking little of our intelligence. If that doesn't bother you, then you may enjoy this. And peace be with that. There is some disturbing, bloody, violent and/or gory content, strong language and a little graphic sexuality and female nudity in this.

21,neil-476,Distracted,7,11 December 2011,"Let's get the review out of the way first. This is an OK crime thriller - moderate action, moderately twisty, moderate performances. It passes the time adequately.There is a scene towards the end where Ethan Hawke calls on Angelina Jolie at her apartment at night. She answers, wearing only a nightie, and two minds have but a single thought. They fall back into her room (her apartment seems to consist of only a bedroom, into which the main door opens), and start an embrace which rapidly becomes more passionate. He opens her nightie, she lifts her leg up, and jigginess ensues (curiously, without him appearing to undo his trousers). My missus and me, we're sitting there shouting, ""Shut the bloody door!"", absolutely aghast at the fact that the entire population of the apartment block is almost certainly gathered at the still open doorway, wishing they'd be quieter, but not having the heart to say so until they finish.So what did I learn from this film? I learnt that you should shut your apartment door before engaging in horizontal jogging, even if it is with Angelina Jolie.",Taking Lives
22,Uriah43,A Decent Combination of Mystery and Suspense,6,17 August 2017,"This movie essentially begins with an FBI agent by the name of ""Illeana Scott"" (Angelina Jolie) coming to Canada to help out in an unusual homicide which appears to be connected to several similar cases for almost 20 years. Although there is limited evidence available the case gets a major boost when a woman named ""Ms. Asher"" (Gena Rowlands) reports that she believes she saw her son ""Martin Asher"" (initially played by Paul Dano) who was dead and buried 19 years earlier. Upon exhuming the body they discover that it doesn't belong to Martin and so he now becomes a lead suspect. What they fail to fully appreciate, however, is his extraordinary ability to socially blend into his environment and cleverly cover his tracks-and this makes him even more dangerous and difficult to apprehend. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that, although I am not a big fan of Angelina Jolie, I thought she performed rather well in this particular role and certainly didn't deserve a ""Razzie"" nomination. But then, I didn't think Halle Berry deserved it for her role as ""Catwoman"" that year either and this leads me to believe that the entire awards committee is possibly motivated more by personal considerations than anything substantive. But that's just my opinion. Regardless, this film had a decent combination of mystery and suspense which I enjoyed and because of that I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",Taking Lives
23,ferguson-6,Strike the pose,5,25 March 2004,"Greetings again from the darkness.  TV director Caruso proves he is not ready for the big screen with this very average psychological thriller that is really neither psychological nor thrilling.  Angelina Jolie spends the entire movie striking poses as if on a modeling job rather than acting.  And what a waste of Kiefer Sutherland's talents.  He and the far less talented Ethan Hawke should have switched roles and then, with some doctoring of the screenplay, we might have had a movie.  Instead, this predictable waste of an idea devotes most of its time to the little cat and mouse game between Jolie and Hawke.  Who cares if they sleep together?  The crime solving should have been the story.  It is nice to see Gena Rowlands in a much too brief role as the killer's mother.  She brings some class to this very ordinary movie.",Taking Lives
24,anaconda-40658,Taking Valuable Time.,3,22 May 2015,"Taking Lives (2004): Dir: D.J. Caruso / Cast: Angelina Jolie, Ethan Hawke, Gena Rowlands, Kiefer Sutherland, Olivier Martinez: Disappointing thriller about identity. It opens in 1983 where the killer first strikes causing an accident and consuming the identity of the victim. The case builds over the years with male victims with their face smashed in with their identity stolen. Gena Rowlands is cast as a woman who believes that it is her surviving twin son whom she hasn't had contact with for years. Angelina Jolie plays a profile expert on serial killers who is to assist in the case. Here is a thriller satisfied in jerking viewers around with its totally obvious revelations. Director D.J. Caruso brings style to the material but even his flashy lead fails to ignite life into this charade of shame. Prior to this he directed a lot of television that may very well be better than the material he deals with here. Jolie is suppose to be seen as this brilliant expert but the ending she plans out is total bull, and screwing the male lead is too cliché. Ethan Hawke is an an art dealer questioned by police but he is basically there to share the sack with Jolie. Gena Rowlands is seen briefly but who gives a crap, and Kiefer Sutherland is too obvious and we don't care about that either. Typical thriller that doesn't serve as an analysis. No, it serves as a total waste of time that is taking our lives when we plunk down and watch it. Score: 3 / 10",Taking Lives
25,The_Void,"Taking Stuff, from other films",6,3 April 2006,"There are a lot of these crime thrillers about. Some, such as Copycat and Insomnia, offer a surprisingly good time; but more often than not, these films are a lot more like Murder by Numbers and The Bone Collector, and unfortunately; Taking Lives is like the latter. That being said, the film certainly isn't all bad; and definitely does have its moments. The plot has little regard for consistency or logic, as it constantly switches gears and throws in any number of events that are clearly there for dramatic effect and haven't been thought out properly. The film is an obvious derivative of successful nineties thriller, 'Seven' and some scenes, such as the entry into the murderer's home have been taken wholesale from the superior movie. The plot has a lot of elements, but we principally follow FBI agent Illeana Scott as she travels to Montreal in order to help their police force with a case that involves a serial killer who, not content to simply murder his victims, takes their identity and lives their lives for a period before moving onto his next victim.The cinematography is dark and glossy, and sleazy settings mean that it's always a lot like Fincher's earlier flick. The pace of the film is poorly paced, as sometimes it's fast and furious, while at other times it's very dull. At almost an hour and fifty minutes, the film is too long; and a better editing job is definitely in order. The final half hour is of particular note for being poorly judged. It's far too slow, and means that rather than being memorable; the conclusion is tepid and disorientated. The first twist can be seen coming a mile off, and the way that it is revealed disregards logic for dramatic effect. The final twist doesn't work well either, as everything is far too convenient. It seems that in their effort to outdo all the other films in its class, the writers have forgotten that for dramatic effect to work, it needs to make sense. The acting is good enough, and it's obvious why the dark and mysterious Angelina Jolie was cast in the lead. Ethan Hawke, who I seem to like more every time I see him, is good; while Kiefer Sutherland is given nothing at all to do. On the whole, this is worth a watch if you've got nothing better to do; but there are better films that are like 'Taking Lives', than Taking Lives.",Taking Lives

But it's just not as good as some classics in the genre. You almost immediately figure out who the killer is without them telling you and that's a bit of a bummer. There are a couple of twists after they try to mislead you but everyone that watches a lot of serial killer movies will see it coming. Nevertheless Taking Lives is still enjoyable to watch. Angelina Jolie is a beautiful woman and a good actress as well, so what's more to ask. Ethan Hawke plays his role like we are used to. The rest of the cast are also good, nothing to complain about. Taking Lives is certainly a good enough movie to have a nice evening in front of the big screen. Not the best in his genre but it doesn't really matter, it's still good enough to me.",Taking Lives

Angelina Jolie,(Illeana), played a Special Agent for the FBI and assisted the Canadian Police Department with a series of killings and a few cold cases that were never solved. The story starts off with the killer starting a new life and it is quite shocking just how he plans to destroy another human being. Ethan Hawke, (Costa) gave an outstanding performance with Illeana, in trying to assist her with a painting he thought might look like the killer, as he owed an Art Gallery in the city. It was a big surprise to see Kiefer Sutherland(Hart) play a rather small role, or cameo appearance and really had very little to say or do in this film. Angelina Jolie does show off some of her private parts and was quite hot and bothered with Costa. Nice entertaining film and a great story.",Taking Lives

I just waited an hour to see the movie end in a predictable way. And yet the end was so bad that I can't even call it predictable.OK, this movie has great actors in it. The idea behind it should have been solid and the personality of the killer and his intentions should have made this movie bearable at least. But no. The cast is way underacted, with great faces like Tcheky Karyo, Kiefer Sutherland and Olivier Martinez having minuscule roles. The killer is barely sketched, shown only by his actions, like someone completely uninterested in the story is seeing it. The way the movie is filmed shows that someone tried to create an atmosphere, but the attempt is completely misplaced.The overall feeling is that someone stumbled onto a script, did it without actually caring about it and asked the people making the movie to film it like it's something special.

30,=G=,For Jolie fans only,6,17 August 2004,"""Taking Lives"" sticks Jolie front and center as a cool, loner FBI Special Agent with a past who travels to Montreal where she becomes involved with a bunch of French cops, a serial killer case, and Ethan Hawk, who seems poorly cast in his role as the love interest, among other things, in a relationship almost completely devoid of chemistry. The film oozes gloom and doom ambiance,  manages some action, some sex/nudity, and lots of less than engrossing concocted drama with a twist at the end. Sutherland is in the film for a heartbeat and Rowlands for a couple of heartbeats as the camera pours over Jolie ad nauseam. With poor critical reviews and a cool reception from the public, ""Taking Lives"" seems to have fared best with females, presumably owing to its strong ""girl power"" bent.

32,Buddy-51,undistinguished thriller,4,9 January 2005,"""Taking Lives"" is a standard-issue, run-of-the-mill thriller about a serial killer and the FBI agent determined to capture him. When bodies start piling up in the Montreal area, the agent - an expert in serial killer profiling - is brought in to assist the local authorities in finding the culprit. The perpetrator's modus operandi is to target men roughly his own age and build, murder them in cold blood, then assume their identities. Once he grows tired of living their lives, he proceeds to his next victim. Ethan Hawke plays a man who's witnessed the most recent of the killings and who may now be next in line on the man's hit list.""Taking Lives"" sticks pretty much within the confines of its overworked genre. We have the disgruntled local cop who resents interference from a hotshot outsider; the prime suspect who turns out to be just another of the killer's many victims; and the double twist resolution which really isn't all that hard to see coming twenty minutes or so into the movie. Jolie gives her usual wooden performance as the FBI agent, barely managing to register a single convincing emotion throughout the course of the film. Hawke does his best with the material, though there really isn't much he can do with it apart from going through the motions, which he does reasonably well. Gena Rowlands and Keefer Sutherland are also on hand to lend their talents, but since their roles are fairly miniscule, they don't have much of a chance to display their wares as actors.Although watchable, ""Taking Lives"" feels like a weak-spined, half-hearted effort in an already played-out genre. It is an instantly forgettable film.",Taking Lives
33,Lejink,Jolie obvious thriller,4,4 September 2011,"As as been said by others, this film is certainly derivative in the plotting department drawing most obviously on ""Psycho"", ""The Silence Of The Lambs"" and ""Se7en"", but isn't in the class of any of those chillers, despite its big-name cast. Angelina Jolie hardly seems credible as the ""married to the job"" FBI investigator brought on board by Canadian cops trying to track down a serial killer who mutilated his victims and then takes over their lives until his next attack. She has a strange line in ""method investigation"", immersing herself in the murder scenes and pictures to get into the head of the perpetrator. Within a few minutes screen time, she's unravelled this series killer's M.O. and whole C.V. and yet she's still not bright enough to see the wood for the trees as she gets closer to the actual killer. More than typically for this genre of film, the long arm of coincidence reaches deep and by the time the double twist has occurred, all cohesion and consistency has evaporated. There's an obligatory car chase scene (amazing how these FBI agents can all drive like James Bond) and presumably because it's a Jolie film, a fairly strong sex-scene where she unbelievably compromises whole case. I wasn't taken with La Jolie's acting. She seems devoid of emotional range and plays her part almost in one key. Ethan Hawke however gets to chew on the scenery a bit as the nervy artist central to the plot while Keifer Sutherland gets only a little more screen time than his uncredited part in ""Phone Box"". The way the final climactic scene plays out is utterly incredible and defies belief even if it does conveniently tie up the loose ends. The direction I found to be fairly routine for thus type of movie, flashy but empty I'd say. I was interested to see that Philip Glass composed the main background music, which s pretty much everywhere but must admit it didn't grab me as much I'd expected. In summary, a contrived, clichéd, and weakly acted modern-day thriller.",Taking Lives

Sure, there is is nothing extraordinary here, the film is not a masterpiece, but then not every film in the genre can be 'Silence of the Lambs'. Montreal and Quebec-City provide some good filming locations, and look different than the usual North=American movies background, bringing some European flavor.

35,MLDinTN,Angelina is so much better than this,5,29 March 2005,"Angelina Jolie is one of my favs even though she's been in some stinkers lately. This is your basic cliché ridden serial killer film with a twist you can see coming a mile away. Jolie plays an expert serial killer profiler who goes to Canada to work on a case. Just an example of how cliché filled this film was, she realizes there is a hidden door behind a chester just by holding her hand out and feeling a slight draft. As if! And some how, with almost no clues she figures out the killer is stealing people's identities and pieces together his murders over the years even though they were never previously linked. How smart can those Canadian police be? There was one good scene in which a hand goes through a mattress to surprise the person on top. I didn't know the killer had super human strength like Jason. Jolie also has another of her unnecessary nude scenes. And I'm not sure what all the fuss was about by having Oliver Martinez in this because he plays the generic detective that could have been played by anyone. He doesn't even make a move on Jolie. Ethan Hawk was OK but he still played it over the top to the point it was unrealistic. And at the end with the scissor scene, it was easy to guess what was going to happen there. And once again, it was very unrealistic at the end when it's over and Jolie calmly calls the other detective just to say it's over. I mean she wasn't so smart that she nearly got strangled to death but is so nonchalant after.FINAL VERDICT: Not very good. The plot is over the top.

In My opinion she is one of the best current actresses! The film is very good. Its thrilling with some drama and horror thrown in and some action for good measure.

It's a ""film noir"" in the mood of BC or Seven. As the story tracks a psychopath, be warned that you will see tensed scenes. So, the leading character (here's Angelina Jolie) must be very strong to help the audience follow her in this mad world. As usual, Angelina proves her act, because we all feel indeed secure. The setting, Montréal and Québec, gives something fresh. In addition, the director is talented to give a gloomy atmosphere (dark rooms, close ups of eyes). It reminds me of the best moments of the X-Files. Finally, there are two scenes where I have jumped of my couch, and one scene where I thought ""It's impossible. How they dare to shoot this?"".So when you got those reactions in front of a ""film noir"", you can conclude it's a good one.",Taking Lives

And Mrs. Asher(Gena Rowlands) happens to be the victim of her own son. Fooled and distraught by letting her guard down, Illeana had one more trick up her sleeve, and it worked perfectly. I think her ""termination"" must have been a ruse. So in the long run, working with the Canadian law enforcement was a success despite losing one in the process. After learning that Hart(Kiefer Sutherland) was a conman, he was killed in the wreck that Illeana thought, Asher had killed him too before the other lawman. So Asher faked his fear during the chase.

We see two young in their teenage years or early twenties meet on the train. One buys a car and he pushes the other guy into an incoming car. This creates a car accident. The murderer seemed like a lost disheveled guy and the murdered guy had a temper and tried to look cool. This murderer grows up to be a serial killer, taking the identities of those he murders. This accident takes place in the 80s and the serial killer in this film is named Martin Asher.I found the acting to be average in this film. Martin Asher's acting when he was James Costa was a bit too frivolous and not realistic in my opinion. The actors all sound like they are reading from a script and I can imitate their facial expressions myself. The film takes place in Quebec, mostly in Montreal. We see Canadian railway trains, Canadian landscapes and buildings, and French Canadians. I enjoyed this film as it is not too, too scary and gruesome. The dead bodies look good enough for films but they don't repulse the viewer, which I personally prefer.Illeana, played by Angelina Jolie, is an FBI agent who is brought into a case of capturing a serial killer twenty years later. The authorities who are looking for her find her lying on the ground. Her body looks amazing in this film - slim and she is athletic. One particular officer is not happy they bring in someone from the outside. He speaks in French as they eat breakfast, making ""titty jokes"". He jokes with the other man about the man's ex-wife and her tits. Something about an underwater sport. Later when this officer makes a rude comment regarding Illeana in French, Illeana gets their attention when she speaks in French. She smartly replies about their ""titty jokes"" and walks away.She questions James Costa who is an art dealer. She enters the room with elegance, her face is so feminine and she is very womanly. She is extremely observant and watches every movement and the camera zooms into her eyes and every flicker.James draws out a sketch of the killer he saw using a multicoloured pencil. Illeana and another officer go to the suspect's apartment. Illeana looks so cool walking into the apartment warily and pointing her gun. They find a dead body.Martin Asher's mother named Rebecca is interviewed by Illeana. Illeana is respectful but professional and gives simple replies. Illeana suspects Rebecca is hiding something and sees the tassel on a bookshelf. Illeana looks for anything that is not ""normal"" in everyone's behaviour and she can see that Rebecca is cautious after hiding a photograph.Illeana watches James and sits in the bar waiting for him. James knows he is being watched by officers and it is not a coincidence that Illeana is there with him. Illeana gives him her phone number and there seems to be a romance starting up.James is used in a sting operation. He sits at a club with secret authorities around him. There is loud music and drinks with most people sitting. He sees a napkin asking for him to go to the washroom and this washroom gives a modern glow of blue lights. The officer finds him and escorts him out as they do not think their suspect is coming.Illeana confides in a senior officer on having favourable feelings for James and should leave the case. The officer replies that Illeana has plenty of guys ask her out and it has not distracted her.James is going to Toronto and the male officer goes to escort him safely. I kept thinking how dumb the officer was to not keep an eye on James the entire time...not wait for him outside at the car. This ends up in a car chase with Illeana speeding on a bridge.James goes to Illeana's hotel room where she is only wearing a bathrobe. Just a warning - James pulls down a side to reveal her right breast with a nipple. They proceed to make passionate love with kissing first and then sex on the bed. Illeana wakes up to find blood on her cheek only to discover it is just from the popped stitches on James's arm. While they were making love, the officer comes to Illeana's hotel to speak to her. He is in the lobby and reception tells him she has a ""do not disturb"" indication. He figures she is having sex with the art dealer.The passionate lovers are in the hospital where they eye each other and smile knowingly when the stitcher mentions the popped stitches. Illeana looks beautiful with her hair down, long and straight.Rebecca, the mom, cannot identify the body so Illeana realizes that Asher must be alive. James meets his mother in the elevator where it is revealed he is the real Martin Asher and kills his own mother.Illeana finds Martin Asher bloody with his dead mom when the elevator doors open. Illeana is overcome with shock as she realizes in horror she trusted the wrong man. The two other officers runs to look for Asher.Asher escapes and the officers burst into Asher's old home with art supplies. The officer who dislikes Illeana being brought into the case makes a comment about letting her into the case to have sex with him.Asher escapes the police who are looking for him and calls Illeana. He taunts her, describing her hotel room last night and how the best thing was he was able to come in her. He also mentions how they are the same and calls her beautiful. Her room had gruesome pictures of crime scenes so this definitely confirms that it is him who made love with Illeana. Poor Illeana felt disgusted realizing she had sex with a serial killer. The FBI fires Illeana after admitting she had consensual sex with Martin Asher.Seven months later, Illeana is supposedly pregnant with Asher's twins. She is living alone in Carlisle, Pennsylvania in a farmhouse. She is supposedly having boys and we see two cribs. Martin Asher appears in the farmhouse and Illeana gasps in shock. Asher is wearing glasses and looks decent. Asher gets angry when Illeana says the babies are James Costa's, not Martin Asher's. She reaches for the gun under the table but Asher took it and knows about the other hidden guns around the home. He tells Illeana they can start over and live as a family but Illeana rejects the idea. He ends up stabbing her belly with the scissors, stating she cannot have those babies. Illeana uses the same scissors to kill Martin Asher and removes the prosthetic pregnant belly. She is not pregnant, the belly was fake and she throws it on the ground. She tells Asher that the past months have been a plan and she calls Leclair to inform him that the ordeal is over.",Taking Lives

45,Chris_Docker,Top notch talent doesn't quite notch up top notch entertainment,6,5 May 2004,"There's nothing particularly bad about Taking Lives - at least if there was a cement mixer somewhere to fill in the plot holes. In many ways it's an above average thriller about a serial killer being hunted by lovely FBI agent Angelina Jolie, who manages to be far more alluring than any FBI agent has the right to be. There's several shocks worthy of making you jump out of your seat, a generous and tasty smattering of gruesome body parts, a car chase, explosion and some nudity. It's main flaw perhaps is that it goes on far too long, and our suspension of disbelief is teetering too precariously for comfort. The basic premise is that the serial killer escapes detection by taking on the identity of his victims. We get some very brief overview shots suggesting how he maybe achieves this from a technical point of view, but when the expected twist at the end outstays its welcome in a very extended coda involving Jolie saving the day by 'dazzling insight' into the killer's mind that soon looks too much like a writer's fantasy: it is then that we start asking ourselves if the main plot was actually believable. Entertaining enough if your expectations aren't too high, but one does wonder when Angelina Jolie is going to take on roles worthy of her not inconsiderable acting ability after this.",Taking Lives
46,yusufpiskin,A hit and miss affair..,6,14 March 2020,"D.J. Caruso's ""Taking Lives"" is a watchable but listless thriller that starts off with a bang and quickly descends into melancholy mediocrity. Revolving around the hunt for a killer known for taking the identities of his victims, the film, refreshingly, boasts a woman protagonist; beyond that, however, the film sticks to well-worn formula.Beginning with a stylish and rattling prologue, the thriller soon settles into the routine machinations of serial killer mystery-dramas. The cast, including Angelina Jolie and Ethan Hawke, is solid and generates respectable star-wattage but is not done any favors by a dour and limited script. Its darkness feels derivative, and the film, overall, is rarely able to offer any stand-out moments.A hit and miss affair, ""Taking Lives"" rates as a strictly middle-of-the-pack crime thriller. Sometimes compelling, sometimes lackluster, the film is not without its strengths, but it has too few of them to impress.",Taking Lives
47,drownnnsoda,Frightening Thriller With A Sadly Predictable Twist.,6,12 August 2007,"""Taking Lives"" centers on a strange FBI agent named Illeana Scott (Angelina Jolie), who uses odd methods to help solve her cases. But she finds herself wrapped up in a terrifying mystery involving a serial killer who is murdering citizens of Montreal, Canada, and stealing their identities as he goes along. Illeana begins to work with a man, Costa (Ethan Hawke), who witnessed one of the killer's murders, and is also contacted by the killer's mother (Gena Rowlands), who knows what her son is. As more victims are discovered and Illeana goes deeper into the case, she finds herself dangerously close to the elusive, psychotic serial killer.Based on a novel but apparently quite different from, ""Taking Lives"" is a pretty scary thriller that has its ups and downs. There are loads of crime thrillers out there, many of them quite similar to this, so it's hard to find diversity in this type of sub-genre. ""Taking Lives"" isn't much of an exception because it borrows a lot from other films of its type and uses set-ups and scenarios that we have seen before, but it does have some worthy style and substance to offer amidst the similarities it shares with other films. The storyline of a serial killer stealing people's identities is scary in and of itself, so I found the basic plot to be pretty sinister. True crime intrigues me, and these types of crime/horror/thrillers are exactly my cup of tea, so I wasn't too disappointed with this movie, although I can see why some would be.Despite it being unoriginal at times, I was really impressed with the cinematography in this film. It's appropriately dark, gloomy, and the entire film looks very glossy and nice. Good locations and nice set construction add to the film's energy, as does the amazing backdrop of Montreal for the story to unfold in front of. There are also some really tense scenes and a couple of very frightening moments that caught me off guard. However, another downfall is the predictability of the largest plot twist in the movie - I knew almost instantly what it was going to be, so I was sorely disappointed with that element of it all. Then again, in order to fix this and hide the secret in a better manner, the entire script would've had to be reworked, so this movie would have been fairly different. I have to admit that the final scene was well-done and dramatic though, and that scissor stabbing had me squirming in my seat.Angelina Jolie plays our lead in another role that she seems to be typecast in (""The Bone Collector"" being an example of this), but she does well with the character. She's a fine actress and she doesn't really disappoint me, but I'd say she's typecast. Ethan Hawke plays Costa, and he's a great actor, but unfortunately he and Jolie have little to no chemistry. Kiefer Sutherland, Olivier Martinez, and Gena Rowlands make for a good supporting cast, so overall I have no gripes in the acting department besides Jolie's and Hawke's lack of chemistry together, which was also pretty unfortunate.Overall, ""Taking Lives"" isn't necessarily a bad movie. In fact, it's pretty good, but some predictability issues really hurt it. It's entertaining though, serves some good atmosphere and some pretty darn scary moments, and the acting is pretty impressive. The script is where the movie has it's core problems, but if you can get past the predictability factor, this is an above-average crime thriller that you'll likely find enjoyable. I like movies of this type, so I wasn't too disappointed. Worth a rental if you ask me. I'd give it a pretty solid 6/10.",Taking Lives

Yes, the premise we have seen before. The quirky, noble detective, the inscrutable characters, the back story. Jolie is lovely, and fun to watch. Olivier Martinez (after an interesting performance in Adrian Lyne's ""Unfaithful"") is believable as the sardonic detective, contemptuous of Jolie/a woman detective. Kiefer Sutherland did not really have enough of a part, and there are several twists and turns where the movie may keep you watching, but the story becomes convoluted. Ethan Hawke is believable. Gena Rowlands as the killer's mother is sympathetic, but does not have enough screen time.The sets are interesting, Quebec and its surroundings. The problem is, we have seen this theme many times: ""Silence of the Lambs""; and its sequel ""Hannibal"", and the prequel, ""Manhunter"" and ""Red Dragon"". While Jolie's performance is very good, one cannot help but compare the character to Clarice Starling in Silence.

52,rbverhoef,"Has its moment, but not enough to be a good thriller",5,19 April 2005,"'Taking Lives' is tricky in its casting. The first suspect of multiple murders is a character played by Ethan Hawke since he was found above a dead body, but the film also stars the obvious suspect Kiefer Sutherland. Two other familiar actors, at least their faces, are played by Olivier Martinez ('Unfaithful') and Tchéky Karyo ('The Patriot'). Since the audience will probably recognize their faces they are potential killers; in a lot of thrillers it simply works like that. So we have at least four possible killers and still the film manages to feel constantly predictable which is too bad since there are some interesting things here, besides the smart casting.The opening sequences belong to the best of the film. The killer is introduced in such an unexpected way I was hoping the film could live up to these great first moments. Unfortunately it did not, but there are other moments in the film that come close. The film is set in Canada and for reasons I do not understand the police there needs help from FBI Agent Illeana Scott (Angelina Jolie), the only character who is definitely not the killer. The Canadian detectives are the Martinez-character, who can not stand her, the Karyo-character and a third played by Jean-Hugues Anglade, who is helpful to Scott. Like I said, Hawke is found above a body but becomes a possible victim soon after that, the moment where Kieferland is introduced.I should say no more, although there is no way you can figure this film out before the film wants you to. The problem is, we expect certain things while the film plays and minutes later we find out we were right. That the film is better than it should be comes from some good moments, from the way the filmmakers make implausibilities plausible through good film-making, and from the actors, especially Hawke who is one of the more natural actors out there. 'Taking Lives' is the kind of film you should watch expecting nothing and it will turn out to be pretty entertaining. In my opinion the ending is the worst thing from this film, but who really cares when you are already at that point?",Taking Lives
53,AudioFileZ,"Watchable, but not a genre standout in plot, acting, or atmosphere.",5,6 August 2006,"This movie is really about a 5. It starts out dark and interesting as we are introduced to a teenager who seems so conscience-free that he is able to kill a peer with the same enjoyment most his age play a video game. This could be a very interesting character. That promise is clouded immediately when we fast forward to him as a late 30's artist played by Ethan Hawke. The vast, yet almost innocent lack of conscience apparent in young Asher is replaced by Costa who is in full control of his faculties and knows that his actions are immoral. Basically I wish our story had stayed with the young ""no-name"" version of Asher/Dano instead of Hawke's character who was just evil with no real character complexity to draw this viewer in.As the movie develops there seem to be holes along due to the story's premise not holding up under the required scrutiny of an aspiring serious crime story. The bleak Canadian weather, the dreary cinematography, and the lack of comic relief quite effectively provide a good backdrop if only the story and characters had really gelled more. I mean Angelina Jolie is going to have to put in better than an Academy Award performance each time or all we'll see is, well, Angelina Jolie. Suffice to say this movie or her performance is not Academy Award material.With the above caveats noted, this movie is watchable to the point I watched it twice to be certain it was not better than I had first thought. I gave it three months between times so I would be able to not have vivid preconceived notions. I mean the worst thing is to not pick up all the small cues, devices, and complexities of a good film noir story and pan it due to one's lack of understanding. I believe I haven't done that and I'll stand by my rating of 5 out of 10.

56,rosscinema,Yet another serial killer film,5,26 April 2005,"Let me see, since ""Silence of the Lambs"" how many of these have we all seen since 1991? I ask that because I literally have lost count and it also dawns on me that it wasn't that long ago when there wasn't a genre of serial killer films. We'll, there are so many of these made now that it indeed became a genre of it's own. This is the latest and while it's not really what I would call a terrible film it is one that fails to impress on any level. Story is about an American FBI agent named Illeana Scott (Angelina Jolie) who heads to Montreal, Canada to help the local authorities catch the newest serial killer that's been running amok and stealing his victims identities.*****SPOILER ALERT***** Scott checks all the clues at the crime scenes and starts to develop a pattern until one day she talks to a woman named Mrs. Asher (Gena Rowlands) who informs everyone that she saw her son that was supposed to have been killed years earlier. The body is exhumed out of the grave and it proves that it is not her son but another bit of luck goes their way when the killer strikes again and there's a witness. An artist and gallery owner named Costa (Ethan Hawke) agrees to help and gives a sketch of what he looks like and even puts a wire on in case he comes back, which he does. After a high speed chase the police consider the case closed when the so-called killer is dead but it turns out that Costa himself is the real killer which shocks and surprises Scott because she has just slept with him.This is directed by D.J. Caruso who made the film ""The Salton Sea"" and in that he showed a good visual style which is carried over to this effort as well. Caruso is slowly building a career out of directing action cop drama's (mostly in television) and while this isn't a very good film it's still a good looking one that shows he has promise. What probably hurts this effort the most is the fact that audiences have all seen so many of these ""tracking the serial killer"" films to the point that it's impossible to be shocked or overly intrigued by them. This film contains some of the (now) familiar traits that we have grown accustomed to seeing such as the agent being a loner with commitment problems and the Chief telling her ""We need you to get inside his head"" and of course the obligatory high speed car chase. There is one part of this film that I still have not figured out (excuse my ignorance) and it's the scene where the intruder comes out from under the bed. Can someone please explain who that is and why their hiding in Mrs. Asher's home? This film isn't what I would call a total misfire and I didn't mind too much of the casting of Jolie in the lead because this premise is so familiar that audiences need someone like her to at least try and breath some new life into the story. This definitely doesn't offer anything unique to viewers and I think studios should really think twice before they green light another one of these films or at the very least hold out until a script comes along that can really add something special to the genre.",Taking Lives

You know, when it's not a scary movie you're not expecting to have a shock. But when Illeana was checking some house and one dead body dropped from the roof, my heart pumped very hard. The director really knows how to get you. Also, when Illeana is checking Mrs. Asher's house and she lies in the bed, all of a sudden someone hugs her from underneath and scares the life out of me.The plot is plausible enough, the story is well developed, and we never know who is the real psychopath until the end of the movie.

It reminds me about all real life relationship problems and worst case scenarios like rape, divorce, homicides and suicides related to relationship problems. So much focus is put into hot girl that this movie lost its way. I could witness also scenes or possible scenes of being naive, immature, and of competition. Who will get hot girl, why she rejects everybody, how can I get such girls etc. Another bad thing is unrealistic story, as if culprit or police prepared unrealisticly too much and in advance for each other, letting their job affect their lives without real need.

64,mentalcritic,Was I meant to be intrigued?,4,17 October 2004,"Spare a thought for Angelina Jolie when you view this exercise in making as little effort as is needed. Obviously, with the publicity that is attached with the Tomb Raider films, she has a strong need to establish herself as being capable of playing something other than a video game character. Taking Lives could have been a step in the right direction on paper, but it is ultimately so basic and minimal that the viewer doesn't really have anything to be excited about.Jolie plays a forensics expert who works for the FBI. Tchéky Karyo gets a rather uninspiring turn as the Canadian police captain who solicits her help in solving a particularly bothersome case. The case in question involves the murder of numerous individuals whose identities are then stolen. Hence the title. It seems that the boorish characterisations that the American film industry directs towards the French are now also being directed at the Canadians, for you will never meet police officers who are more uncooperative while given less motivation. Apparently, the filmmakers also thought using French police sirens would somehow make it clearer to the viewer that we're viewing a story that takes place in French Canada. Like the use of a veteran actor from the French film industry (even if he is actually Turkish) didn't clue us in on that.In the end, the film falls flat because it only does the bare minimum required to meet basic Hollywood standards. Here, you have a fairly standard serial killer being hunted by very standard heroes, with not a unique variation in sight. The characters are so memorable that a mere day after watching them in action, I am struggling to think of a characteristic that separates any of the principal cast from the support. Really, it's all so bland that I cannot even remember any of the big climactic moments. You can stop reading now if you want to find out about this for yourself.A great example of the storytelling in Taking Lives comes when the hero reveals that she was faking being pregnant in order to lure the killer to her. Previously, we are told that she has been fired from the FBI for supposed professional misconduct, in spite of the fact that the man who impregnated her was part of a case that had just been officially closed. After said man puts a knife into her belly, and we get the first case of a fake stomach bump being used like armour, we're left wondering if this means the FBI firing thing was simply a ruse to lure said killer out of hiding. Ancillary ideas such as this, which would benefit the film slightly if they were explained, are simply left hanging.The one reason to bother with the film is a shot of Angelina Jolie semi-naked. Brief though this moment is, it represents a rare instance where the film gives the audience something extra. The problem is that the other 106 minutes of the film are so flat that sitting through the film in order to see this one scene feels similar to downloading a fifteen second porn flick using a fifty-six kilobaud modem. All that hunting and waiting feels very inadequately rewarded. Exactly why this mild dross was rated MA by the OFLC still boggles my imagination.I gave Taking Lives a four out of ten.

65,hall895,Starts out bad and keeps getting worse,2,7 August 2011,"Taking Lives is a movie which likes to think it's a lot smarter than it actually is. It wants to keep you guessing but at this it fails miserably. The story takes twists and turns to try to throw you off track but nobody with a couple of functioning brain cells is going to be fooled. The movie's twists leave gaping plot holes all over the place which I suppose the filmmakers are hoping you'll be too dumb to notice. Right from the opening credits it's obvious they're going for a Se7en vibe. If emulating Se7en was the goal there perhaps may be no more pathetically failed of an endeavor in the history of humankind.So what's the story? Well, there's a killing in Montreal and the local authorities immediately decide they can't handle it and need to call in an American FBI profiler. Doesn't say much for Canadian law enforcement. I suppose this profiler, this expert the Canadians desperately need, will be an old, wise, hardened veteran. Well, no actually. This expert profiler will be Angelina Jolie. Well, that's one way to contrive to get a hot chick into your movie. One of the Canadian cops understandably resents Profiler Barbie's presence. Well at least I think he does as the character is played by Olivier Martinez who speaks with a largely incomprehensible accent. That actually might be a good thing though because all the dialogue in this movie that you can understand is laughably bad. The acting is generally terrible. Jolie's wooden, Ethan Hawke seems woefully out of his element, Martinez mumbles through the whole thing and the supporting cast adds nothing. The film goes this way and that, getting progressively dumber and less believable as it goes along. Kiefer Sutherland shows up for two minutes with a ""What am I doing in this god-awful movie?"" look on his face. When you think the movie's finally blessedly over they drag it out some more, throwing some more ridiculous nonsense at you. Can this thing just end already?

I mean, come on, wasn't everybody convinced from minute 10 and forward that Hawke actually was the killer? We all have seen too many similar movies not to think that way...But I can overcome that cliché storyline, if it wasn't for the many inconsistencies, mistakes and downright stupid twists and turns the movie has. Let me explore just a few (I know I'm not the first one to point them out, but I can't let the makers get away with it):The scene in the basement. How the hell did Hawke wind up there? How did he get under the bed. And then, how did he manage to put his hands through the bed (mind you), then getting up in time to kick Jolie's ass (so to speak).Then there's the scene in which everybody thinks Hart (Kiefer Sutherland) is the killer, coming to a cop-invaded art gallery show to apparently kill Hawke. Does this sound like the smart and low-profile guy they were after? Does this fit into the profile? Uhm, I guess... not!Another scene: Hawke killing his mother. How did he know on which floor she was? How did he know when she would get in the elevator? How could he know Jolie wasn't coming with her? The answers to these questions, of course, are: He didn't. He didn't. He couldn't.The worst part though are the last 20 minutes or so (and if I read more of the comments on this page, I'm not alone). It's just so silly and stupid... It would probably rank top 10 in my list of worst endings.In short, a shaky and clichéd first 60 minutes, followed by a terrible last half an hour.

Cops in particular call in their status and THEN move.7. During a pursuit, the occupant of a car is CLEARLY holding a heavy-caliber revolver pointed at the driver, but the actual weapon, as seen both before and after the pursuit, is actually a semiautomatic.I could go on and on, but this is just a dumb and insulting movie. The actors contribute to the whole mess by mugging their way through a bunch of police and criminal stereotypes.Not worth the two hours it take to watch.",Taking Lives
71,lawprof,Male Serial Killer Again Outclassed by Sassy Beautiful Gal Cop,6,21 March 2004,"I wonder how castratingly humiliating it must be for real serial killers, virtually all male, to sit through one movie after the other in which their carefully constructed machinations fall apart through the brilliance and courage of gorgeous female detectives.A few weeks ago it was Ashley Judd in ""Twisted.""  Set against San Francisco's magnificent urban scenery, this smart homicide cop bested the killer-slowly enough of course to insure a feature of normal length.  Now we have Angelina Jolie with Montreal as a backdrop hunting for a man who decades earlier killed a traveling companion and assumed his identity. Desiring change - who but the terminally boring doesn't? - he occasionally kills to assume yet another identity. As with all celluloid serial slayers the murders are colorfully gruesome.Montreal can't solve the crime so they borrow FBI Special Agent Illeana Scott.  Her credentials aren't fully specified but she seems to be a Wonderprofiler (not an actual civil service title).  She joins the wisecracking-in-French local cops and assumes her right to function as their partner (she's armed from the get-go, something that a Canadian police department would not allow an American law enforcement officer to do).Well, it's a complicated story and like others in this genre it's one-sided: serial killers are bad, cops who pursue them are good.The suspect's mom is Gena Rowlands and she adds a touch of acting class to this entertaining but muddled film.  Any guy who takes up serial homicide probably had mommy issues as a kid.Angelina Jolie is in turn both tough and vulnerable.  She's beautiful and, as my fourteen-year-old son noted, the director couldn't get by without ""the obligatory nude sex bit.""  By the way, credit goes to the makeup crew for covering up Jolie's tattoos, the increasingly universal body art of younger women.Okay, choosing between female screen cops to have a fantasy romance with, Judd is way ahead of Jolie.  She's sharper and acts much better, at least in this kind of role.  ""Taking Lives"" pleasantly killed a couple of hours on a cold afternoon-that's enough for it to merit a rating of6/10.",Taking Lives

Anjoline Jolie was very good in her part and Ethan Hawke was good as well.  Although there was a lot of violence in this movie I enjoyed it immensely.  I suggest that you go see this unusual mystery movie, and you will enjoy it.  Well worth the price of admission.

75,charchuk,"Mediocre, predictable thriller",5,23 August 2006,"An entirely mediocre thriller that relies mainly on jump scares and implausible twists to build suspense. The opening sequence, before the credits, is quite intriguing, but it only leads into a poorly written, poorly acted, Se7en rip-off. Still, despite some truly bad acting and some terrible dialogue, the suspense does build throughout the film, and the story gradually grows with it, until it becomes at least interesting, if overtly familiar and predictable. The first twist at the end is easily guessable, but makes for a very graphic scene in an elevator. The final twist is actually quite shocking when you first see it, but really doesn't make a whole lot of sense when you think about it. It certainly ends the movie with a bang, though.The only actor here who seems to rise above the material is Kiefer Sutherland, and he's barely in the film, which is too bad. Angelina Jolie is fine until her sex scene, where she acts like a porn star. Ethan Hawke is decent until the end, when he's just plain bad. And all of the French actors are pretty bad. There are a few scary scenes, mostly due to the aforementioned jump scares, and the story becomes somewhat interesting, but there are too many plot holes, too many inconsistencies for the end twists to make much sense at all.

77,christian123,For Angelina Jolie's fans only,4,21 November 2004,"Angelina Jolie plays Special Agent Illeana Scott, an FBI profiler brought to Quebec to solve the mysteries of a serial killer that assumes the identities of his victims. Working with the disagreeable Quebec police force, Illeana must protect a witness, who is the killer's next potential victim (Ethan Hawke), but their relationship becomes more personal forcing her to question her priorities.The worst thing a thriller can be is predictable and that's exactly what Taking Lives is, predictable. It was still a decent thriller with some tense moments but the ending is quite obvious. The only reason I rated this film above a five is because of Angelina Jolie. I think she's a terrific actress and she does the best here with a lousy script. She's very convincing and just a treat to watch on screen. If only the rest of the film was as good. It starts off decently enough with a very scary opening. Then it takes a familiar path and everything becomes by the numbers. There was actually one twist that did take me by surprise. It's just too bad that the rest of the film couldn't be like that.The other performances are quite good and they help keep things moving. Olivier Martinez and Gena Rowlands both give good performances. Kiefer Sutherland was in the movie for about five minutes yet he gets top billing. It's a little silly to hype him up when he actually didn't do anything. The only performance I didn't really like was from Ethan Hawke. He was so unconvincing and so easy to figure out. D.J. Caruso directs and he does a decent job. He isn't that great at creating suspense but he does offer a few chilling and tense moments. There was potential with this project and they really dropped the ball. It could have been a good, stylish thriller but it ends up being a mediocre one. In the end, this film is really just for Angelina Jolie's fans and there are better thrillers out there. Rating 6/10",Taking Lives

79,reb-warrior,"Mildly Entertaining Thriller, But Don't Expect Any Surprises",6,4 January 2014,"It WAS predictable. I pretty much ""knew it"" from the beginning. But it's kind of like watching one of those true-life murder docu shows. You know whom the killer is, but it's still interesting enough to see how it plays out. It starts out with a damn good prologue. It's 20 years earlier and the serial killer's first killing is shown as is his modus operandi.All the actors did a decent job with their performances. Jolie's character was cliché as the weird(eccentric) profiler, but she did the best she could with the role. There were a couple of really bad red herrings. I mean did the writers really think the viewers would fall for that? There were plot-holes and some unexplained things that I wanted to know. Such as Asher's(the serial killer) recent run-in with his mother, and the plans he made after that. Is that what egged him on the path he took? And Asher's mother(Gena Rowlands) telling the police how dangerous he was? She last saw him as a teenager. She tells Illeana(Jolie) he was violent, but in her first interview with the police she makes him sound really creepy scary dangerous. I wanted her to elaborate on what exactly happened.The ending goes way out there. Did laws and police conduct go out the window, and what happened was premeditated? I don't have a complete problem with this, but I think some flashbacks at the end or maybe during the closing credits(which would have been artsy too) to show how everything was planned out would have been enlightening. They did do a few brief flashbacks earlier in the story after Illeana(Jolie) realizes the truth, so it's not like it would have been out of place. There's just not enough here that satisfied me for the last seven months that went by in the story. The specific ending itself, you may find it either stupid or puzzling. Or both! I found it puzzling, which in turn made it a bit stupid. If only there were more explanation, then it might have been a really cool ending.All in all, I would say that it was mildly entertaining thriller, but don't expect any surprises. 6/10",Taking Lives

I thought from the title (never having read anything about it, or even seeing a preview) that it was going to be some demonic weird, psycho movie. So, I never watched it. But, I finally gave it a chance. Man, was I wrong! It was an amazing movie, and I would gladly see it again anytime, even in the near future.Angelino Jolie was good in her role, but the real prize in the whole piece, was Ethan Hawke. He is without a doubt an amazing character actor, and good looking to boot! His role in the film, is perfect, and does an outstanding job convincing not only Jolie of his situations, but the audience as well.The movie certainly keeps you guessing, which is what I like, but once you think you've cracked the code...you're totally wrong! The movie just keeps getting more and more deep in confusion. But, in a good way.There is a lot of gore and blood, so if you have a sensitive stomach, this might not be the best film for you. But, if you can get past those parts, you're in for a real treat.

82,tburke85,Taking Lives Entertaining But Predictable,6,19 June 2009,"Taking Lives is entertaining but predictable from director D.J. Caruso whose admirable in making this thriller but there are flaws that weigh it down. Angelina Jolie and Ethan Hawke are good as the two leads. Oliver Martinez, Tcheky Karyo, Jean-Hugh Anglade, and Gena Rowlands are effective as the supporting characters but they lack screen time and development because most of the focus is on Jolie. Kiefer Sutherland is solid in a brief extended appearance before being written out of the movie rather quickly. The rest of the cast are okay in their roles but no one stands out. The movie does have a little suspense but it doesn't pay off because the eventual twist I sort of saw coming. There's a little action including a chase that's well executed but the movie could've used more of it. If there was more suspense, action, character development, and a different twist besides the one they went with the film would've have been that bad. Taking Lives starts off decent but after a while it becomes kind of obvious who the killer is and after the reveal there's no more suspense. The pacing was a little slow at times which didn't help either. Lucikly Caruos kept the running time down to 103 minutes so it's not a total waste of time. Overall despite it's flaws Taking Lives is an okay thriller with a little suspense, action, and solid performances by the cast who make this movie worth watching at least once but after it's over you can't help but feel a little disappointed.",Taking Lives

However I can go on and continue to degrade this film but at least it does it-self a favour buy getting into the action very quickly and not dragging along . The soon to be new Mrs.Jolie-Pitt done a good job of playing a clairvoyant type cop though I felt Jhonny Depps uncanny ability in From Hell was much better , the plot was an interesting idea that attracted me to the film in the first place but it was a shame that it was not really executed to the the point where this could of been such a great movie . Kiefer Sunderland had a small part to play in it but at least he made the most of it along with Jean-Hughes Aglande who I enjoyed watching again UNLIKE bloody Ethan Hawke who is just wayyyyyyyyyyy to weaselly and well just crap at acting and also the ever annoying Oliver Martienz .

85,dschmeding,Now that is a bad movie,3,21 December 2007,"This movie is really weak... I wonder if Angelina Jolie is ashamed of this dirty spot in her history. Its hard to say if the totally stupid and thrown in sex scene, the Extremities-Style shower scene or her breakdown after finding headless mama is more ridiculous and over acted. But looking at the script I guess somebody liked to push things to a point where they get annoying. The movie sure had its positive sides but I can't get the impression out of my head that I have seen each and every scene of it before. Now here they were thrown in a blender and the occasional gore doesn't fit the Hollywood clichéd smart female FBI detective and far fetched plot twists. Throw Seven and Silence of the lambs together and subtract the dark and disturbing feeling and you get something like Taking lives. The movie is so hard trying to achieve its means it is destined to fail. You can't just show some photos of corpses to make you movie gritty and disturbing when the rest regurgitates every single Hollywood cliché. The never ending master plan of our super smart and sexy FBI agent Joli in the end of this extremely stretched movie is among the most ridiculous I can imagine, at least if you leave total trash aside for comparison.

86,Michael Fargo,Wearing out one's welcome,7,9 September 2019,"What Hitchcock mastered was when to wind things up and deliver the package to the audience. ""Taking Lives"" is a well acted, beautifully photographed and expertly cut thriller that makes a grievous error in the final quarter of the film by heading off in a completely unnecessary and unbelievable direction. Would Clarice Starling bed Hannibal Lecter? Well, okay she did but it was in the less--awful--sequel. But she never would have in ""Silence of the Lambs.""While that's an interesting topic in and of itself, i.e., why investigators are attracted to their jobs and maybe even their targets, it's introduced too late and we've got too many other fish to fry already.As well, that particular turn in the film distracts us from unraveling what's already pretty complex in who is who and what is what to whom (much less why). And Angelina Jolie makes a career error in going along with a pretty racy scene that takes us completely out of the movie, a classic example of ""gratuitous.""But along the way, there are some great scares and a reasonably challenging mystery that's involving even if the opening credits (fantastic by the way) give us more information than the following screenplay.It all holds up even if rickety and ultimately unsatisfying.

I had to blink and make sure I wasn't watching ""24"". Also, it took me a while to get whether this movie was supposed to be set in Montreal, or Paris. This is not as bad as it could have been, but it is still severely limited. There are some good scares, but they are all derivative, or would that be ""an homage"", to Silence Of The Lambs and Nightmare On Elmstreet.

88,blakiepeterson,An Implausible But Engaging Serial Killer Thriller,6,21 July 2015,"I like Angelina Jolie. Something about her (possibly her fiery eyes, her sensuous lips always slightly curved into a subtle smirk) diffuses with self-assured sexiness that makes her a leading lady who doesn't have to do much to convince us that she's a smart, sanguine toughie always sitting above everyone else. Even in meandering material like ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider"", we're enraptured by her magnificence, which luminously finds itself at new heights with the blazing personality that becomes her.A film like ""Taking Lives"" is the kind that Jolie does best: a thriller without much of a brain but seems to be better just because Jolie is there. In every heroine role she's ever had, she's appeared strong and courageous, gutsier than the men around her and more adroit than the doubters who pine against her. In hindsight, ""Taking Lives"" is the type of film most likely to be played during a ""Lifetime"" serial killer movie marathon special event — but like the majority of suspense movies that repeat on ""Lifetime"", there's a sort of compulsively watchable energy about ""Taking Lives"", not hugely ambitious but not dumb enough to make us feel bad about enjoying ourselves. It's throwaway, but at least we're having fun, right? In ""Taking Lives"", Jolie portrays Illeana Scott, an FBI agent brought into Montreal to help apprehend Martin Asher, a murderer who gets his kicks by stealing the identities of his victims after he grotesquely kills them. Scott is a profiler of the highest common denominator, with an unconventional skill set; her new co-workers have a hard time taking her seriously, an understatement considering she greets them for the first time lying with a smile in an open grave, later on showing that she best understands the people she's investigating by squatting in weird positions in the areas they committed their crime. But she's not faux spunky like an embittered Temperance Brennan. We are immediately taken with her.The killer's streak is hindered when James Costa (Ethan Hawke) is brought in for questioning. Costa, a local art dealer, happened to be at the right place at the right time and witnessed Asher partaking in one of his heinous crimes. Lucky for the detectives, he as a good eye and great artistic ability: he is able to draw a near perfect, detailed sketch of the murderer. Problems arise, though, when Scott, slipping out of her reserved knowingness, develops feelings for the witness.""Taking Lives"" moves along as a good, maybe even great, serial killer movie until it abruptly reaches a twist ending either predictable or implausible — I'm not sure which adjective is a better descriptor. While you might be guessing who the murderer is way ahead of time, however, you won't have much of an idea how they're going to catch him, and since the climax of the movie is outrageously over-the-top (and one could say satisfying), the preposterousness not only is forgiven — it's also accepted as part of the insane plot, which threatens to fly off the rails but remains engaging against all odds. And anyway, you can't put down ""Taking Lives"" for being ludicrous while turning around and calling ""Dressed to Kill"" ludicrous but saying it's OK because it's stylish. No. No.The film has since become a forgotten fossil of the 2000s, but don't pass it off as an average blockbuster that never was. Jolie is as entrancing as ever, Hawke a plausible normal-guy-caught-in-a-bad-situation, Rowlands a shifty-eyed marvel as Asher's paranoid mother. ""Taking Lives"" is perhaps more fattening than I would like to admit, but I don't mind dumbfounding thriller fun, as long as I'm kept on my toes and the atmosphere's decent. Here, you've got everything. What more could you want?",Taking Lives

92,Ronin47,"Lame, lame, lame (*)",1,28 March 2004,"Of all the lame, ""Silence Of The Lambs"" rip-offs I've seen, ""Taking Lives"" may be the worst. I was actually looking forward to this one because of its trailer, which was one of the best edited trailers I've seen in a long time. But since most of these movies suck, it was a disappointment but not a surprise. After a moderately interesting opening scene (which involves what is presumably the killer's first murder, when he was a teenager), ""Taking Lives"" heads quickly and steadily downhill into outright suckiness.
Angelina Jolie (as gorgeous as ever) plays Illeana, an FBI profiler who of course has ""brilliant"" and ""unconventional"" methods for tracking down killers. The puzzlingly good cast also includes Ethan Hawke as a witness, Kiefer Sutherland as a ""sinister"" suspect (since he's so ""sinister"" he must be the killer, right?), Tcheky Karyo and Olivier Martinez as cops, and most bizarre of all, the classy Gena Rowlands as the killer's mother.
Basically, the killer in this film is so utterly, laughably easy to identify right from the beginning that it's downright pathetic. Making it even worse is the fact that the film is so completely sure it's got you fooled, by throwing some of the worst and most obvious red herrings ever at you.
On top of that, ""Taking Lives"" is boring, silly (thanks to a completely ridiculous sex scene that seems to be spliced in from a late-night Cinemax movie), devoid of any excitement or suspense, and ugly (the whole thing looks a dull, sickly green). I still like Angelina Jolie, but man, she needs a new agent. Ethan Hawke is almost always good, but his performance here is gratingly awful. The other performances are so slight they aren't even worth mentioning.
And I'm disappointed that it's directed by D.J. Caruso, whose unique style made ""The Salton Sea"" such a kick. ""Taking Lives"" has no style whatsoever.

93,Barky44,"Good, creepy, solid thriller",8,28 March 2004,"Taking Lives is the story of a serial killer who murders loners and usurps their identities for a time before moving on to the next victim. The story centers around an FBI agent (Angelina Jolie) as she tracks the killer down.I enjoyed this movie. It has the characteristic gore required for such films, but done in a far different way and in a manner that actually contributes to the plot, not just for the sheer shock value. It has the characteristic plot turns and twists designed to keep you guessing, but for the most part they are well thought out and not just gags from over-clever writers. And it does have a rather solid ending. Too many of these ""keep you guessing"" thrillers disappoint you in the end, this one doesn't.Angelina Jolie is very solid in this role, redeeming her in my eyes after her stints in the horrible Lara Croft films. The supporting cast is good as well. Ethan Hawke (who plays a man believed to be the next victim) is less believable in his own role, sometimes he plays the character so obviously exaggerated it loses it's substance. This ""obviousness"" keeps me from giving it a 10, I can only give it an 8.I am glad to finally have a film actually set in Canada with Canadian characters and locales, and not simply filmed there to save money.",Taking Lives
94,rcavellero,JUST ANOTHER NOTCH IN THE END OF JOLIE'S CINEMATIC SUICIDE,5,24 March 2004,"I wanna start this review off with a positive comment. It could have been worse. I'm not sure how reassuring that is to you but this film is not a prime example of good or even mediocre filmmaking. Though it does have some suprisingly scary moments it lacks any type of suspense, originality, creativity, story growth or charachter development. The acting is somewhat passable for what the actors have to work with. But watching this film I completely felt that it was very contirved. And that I was watching a hundred other movies I had seen multiple times.  With all it's burdening cliches, horrid score, and amateur direction the film still remains watchable some passable way.  There's a comfort in watching a film that you know exactly where it's going. Now let's get down to what it's about Angelina Jolie stars unbelievably as an expert FBI agent hired to track down a serial killer who kills men his age and takes their identities. Their is of course a witness who she becomes romantically involved with.  From the first frames of the film, you know who the killer is. It doesn't seem they try to hide it all that much.  With the exception of a new supposedly suspicious charachter that enters in the second half. Who is utterly predictable that you discount his prescence right away.  Although the film doesn't achieve being a total complete turkey even with it's absurdly ignorant conclusion that looks more alternate than fitting.  However, the films small charms lie in it's ability to be insepidly predictable accompanied by some fine surely suprising scares. All in all I would have to say I wouldn't even reccomend this film for a rental but if your that hard up to watch a Jolie flick take pleasure in knowing she does offer an awkward sex scene where she is topless but the person who she is with remains unrobbed. In conlusion skip it. And rent a less awkward film instead of another notch in Jolie's cinematic suicide.",Taking Lives
95,Renaldo Matlin,It took 100 minutes of my life!,6,18 March 2004,"I just came back from seeing this at a press screening in Oslo, Norway and being that it had not opened anywhere I could watch it without having heard any rumors on whether it was any good or bad. I myself fancy a good serial-killer movie - heck, even mediocre serial-killers can be fun (such as ""Bone Daddy"" and ""The Glimmer Man""), as long as they don't act to smart for their own good, which is the case of ""Taking Lives"".The premise is definitely good, the location is beautiful (Montreal) and a quick look at the cast-list should make any moviebuff's mouth water (with supporting players like Tchéky Karyo, Kiefer Sutherland and Gena Rowlands). Also, Academy Award winner Angelina Jolie should be able to handle any part, sadly it turns out this is leagues below her previous encounter with a serial-killer (""The Bone Collector""). She does however show her world-class breasts in a steamy sex-scene so some might say it wasn't a complete waste of film (I have no shame).At first I thought the major problem wasn't with ""Taking Lives"" itself, but with me. Had I seen so many movies that I could see every move coming a mile away, even though they tried to play it smart right up to the very end? Was I so full of images from twist-laden thrillers that I could reason myself to what the writers had in mind, or is ""Taking Lives"" more obvious and conventional than some might be led to believe? The answer is probably all of the above, but as I gave the fresh user comments in here a quick glance I realized I wasn't alone: ""Taking Lives"" IS goofy, it is lame, it is plain boring at times, it manages to take a good premise, a stellar cast, a professional crew and churn out something that makes the Steven Seagal-movie ""Glimmer Man"" look great in comparison. There is only one thing worse than a conventional thriller and that's a conventional thriller who THINKS it is all smart and original. To someone who has seen a fair share of thrillers in his or her life the whole movie is an insult and a complete waste of time, to a not-so-regular-movie-goer (or ""normal people with a social life"" as they are called) ""Taking Lives"" might be an OK and entertaining ride. I will say this: it DOES have one good scare that made me jump in my seat during the first 45 minutes, and for a little while I really thought this could be going places. Sadly I was mistaken.And lets get back to that cast and to popular French actor Olivier Martinez who is completely wasted in a thankless role. His part of an utter detestable police detective who doesn't do anything productive except hang around complaining about Jolie's involvement in the investigation really tops itself when he at one point even hits her in the face! Naturally one would expect to find a cliché like the disgruntled cop in a mediocre thriller, but you would hope they would at least try to give him some character. Thankfully his much greater countryman Tchéky Karyo is around, albeit even he seems somewhat lost in this mumbo jumbo, or maybe it is just the plot and the way it focuses to much on Jolie and way too little on the fascinating case of a serial killer stealing victims identities. I'm sure the book was much better, as is the case with 99 percent of books dramatized for the big screen, but from what I have learned from it's readers online the book is barely recognizable in this let-down of a movie.To end on a more positive note: I will give the director a nod for showing confidence and casting Ethan Hawke in a dramatic part unlike most things he has done before. With ""Training Day"" Hawke showed everyone what an underrated actor he was and he follows up in ""Taking Lives"". Hawke is also an accomplished author (read his critically acclaimed novel ""Ash Wednesday"" and find out), and I guess after this he will know better than to ever let any of his writings near the hands of Hollywood-producers run amuck.""Taking Lives"" is the kind of movie where you go into the theatre thinking ""this can be fun"" and leave with a look that says ""OK, disappointed!!!""But the sun is shining and spring is in the air so I'll be nice and give it 4 out of 10...",Taking Lives
96,Panterken,"Gritty, Creepy and Dark murder-mystery thriller. A guaranteed good time !",7,5 December 2007,"I feel obliged to write this comment after recently watching the film again and finding out the IMDb score.'Taking Lives' is a crime-thriller reminiscent of The Bone Collector, Along Came A Spider, From Hell, and all those other late '90's murder-mystery thrillers. It's not a one of a kind film, but I think that if you can get past the unoriginality element of this film, you'll find this thoroughly enjoyable.What makes this film so good that it surpasses most in it's specific genre (murder-mystery thriller) is the very creepy intense atmosphere. I think Glass' score fits very well in every scene and the whole film overall is very gritty, dark and creepy due to the acting and cinematography. You can definitely tell this movie was based on a novel, so I think the adaptation to screen went pretty well. I haven't read the book but I can tell that a lot of dialog was used straight out of the book and some scenes are just too novel-y to be written by screenplay writers. Films based on novels are often excellent and this one proves that again.It's not award-worthy in any way, but I had one hell of a good time watching it. I'm sure you will to. After all, isn't that all we expect from these kinds of thrillers...entertainment!",Taking Lives
97,jamiecostelo58,A good enough thriller,6,16 December 2006,"Taking Lives centres around FBI agent Illeana Scott tracking down the killer who assumes his/hers victims identities. I was pleasantly surprised by Angelina Jole's portrayal as Scott; she acts out her role with great style.I rather enjoyed this movie. It contains many twists and turns made to keep you guessing, and also a rather solid ending. These cat-and-mouse thrillers always seem to work, and Taking Lives should not disappoint in that respect.The supporting cast act out their roles coherently too although Ethan Hawke was perhaps a little too exaggerating in his part. But special praise should go to Olivier Martinez; a particularly strong and believable performance from the Frenchman.Taking Lives is a nail-biting thriller with an interesting storyline that should keep most film-goers entertained. However, the film does suffer from having perhaps a few too many over-the-top and exaggerated scenes that were really unnecessary; this is what lets it down to a degree. 6/10",Taking Lives

100,DeuceWild_77,"Visually appealing with some well shot scenes and jump scares, but lacks of a coherent screenplay and a better editing...",6,20 April 2018,"""Taking Lives"" was made in a time that audiences were getting tired of those psychological / crime thrillers with a twist ending that have reached their zenith in the past decade with movies like ""The Silence of the Lambs"" ('91); ""Knight Moves"" ('92); ""Basic Instinct"" ('92); ""Traces of Red"" ('92); ""Copycat"" ('95); ""Se7en"" ('95); ""Kiss the Girls"" ('97); ""The Bone Collector"" ('99); ""Resurrection"" ('99) or ""The Crimson Rivers"" ('00) among lots of others. Some went successful with Academy Awards' nominations and wins (""The Silence of the Lambs""), others became cult favorites' from both critics and audiences (""Se7en""), and others, although they were good, disappeared into obscurity (""Knight Moves""), but the genre, inevitably, became over-saturated and the lack of a clever screenwriting, new plot ideas & gimmicks for it to work, it turned somewhat predictable in a way of ""been there, done that"".""Taking Lives"" was the second motion picture for the associate producer turned director, D.J. Caruso, which his first movie, the indie ""The Salton Sea"", was critically very well received, even if it flopped at the Box Office and only achieved cult movie status later on the rental circuit. Like the predecessor, ""Taking Lives"" displays a stylish visual from a director that have an eye to compose shots, a skill to stage sequences and a cleverness to introduce some cool gimmicks (like the shot of two identical cagebirds in Gena Rowlands' house, before she reveals to Angelina Jolie's character the existence of her apparently deceased, twin sons), but unfortunely, the writing to the screen is below par and the editing is a bit messy, especially in the third act where the movie feels in a urge to finish, compressing the plot structure into pieces and removing all the logic along the way, therefore confusing the viewer.There's several things that doesn't make sense in the overall story, either in the characters' actions and reactions, like Olivier Martinez looking for Angie in the hotel in a rather suspicious manner that went nowhere (it was for the audience to believe that was him who was lurking under the bed when Angie's entered into the secret room in Gena Rowlands' house ? It makes absolute no sense by the end of the film...), also the contrived plot device in the elevator scene and the moment ""deus ex machina"" at the climax, which was so implausible that is beyond laughable.Every attempt to a character driven storytelling falls flat, there's a motif why Angie's character looks and acts so apathetic / morose / melancholic, but was left in the cutting room floor together with other key scenes that could have enriched the whole experience, giving the movie a more suspenseful tone and gloomy mood, instead of a 'flashy"" pace to please the Generation Y (those scenes can be seen in the ""deleted scenes"" section of the DVD).The talented cast are the second best thing about the movie, after its elegant visuals, but even they can't do much against a silly screenplay and a poorly direction from Caruso, which was more concerned in about how the movie will look, than coherence of the plot and the performances of his actors': Angelina Jolie in ""The Bone Collector"" mode, sleepwalks through her role with only a couple of facial expressions, she could have done better, even with her obvious limitations as an actress; Ethan Hawke never was a great actor to begin with, his usual over-the-top hammy acting can be a distraction, but here he nails the two sides of his character and it kind of worked; Kiefer Sutherland, although being the third billed in the opening credits, he only had about 3 minutes of screentime, but his casting was important to fill a big name actor into the 'red herring' plot device, his work here reminds a lot of his role in Joel Schumacher's ""Phone Booth"" ('02) and Gena Rowlands is always a class act and a pleasure to watch her perform, even in a small role.The international French actors, Olivier Martinez, from ""Unfaithful"" ('02) & ""S.W.A.T."" ('03); Jean-Hugues Anglade, from ""La Femme Nikita"" ('90) & ""Killing Zoe"" ('94) and Tchéky Karyo, from ""La Femme Nikita"" ('90), ""Bad Boys"" ('95) & ""The Patriot"" ('00), complete the cast, giving their best in an underdeveloped and stereotyped characters.
Freaky looking Paul Dano makes here an early appearance on the screen as the young psychopath.In short, ""Taking Lives"" was a step backwards after the previous ""The Salton Sea"", the director should have noted the discrepancy and implausibility of the screenplay before filming it, because being aesthetically appealing and skilfully staged isn't it all, if the movie seriously lacks common sense...",Taking Lives
101,clydestuff,Lara Croft as FBI profiler Ileana,6,27 July 2004,"For those of you have seen films like In the Cut or Twisted you probably know that both films were half-baked attempts at some sort of pseudo-psychology suspense thrillers dealing with serial killers.  They offered little in the way of thrills or suspense, and spent a lot of time on what is suppose to have been the psychological aspect.  What that means is that you had to insert tooth picks to keep your eyelids from drooping halfway through the tedious storyline.  Taking Lives takes another stab at the genre, and its story is about as screwy as those two films, but I liked it anyway.  Much of the reason could be because the over psycho-analyzing is kept to a minimum and the heroine, Ileana (Angeline Jolie), doesn't have the mental hang-ups that burdened Meg Ryan and Ashley Judd in the aforementioned films.  That enables Director D. J. Caruso and writer Jon Bokenkamp to keep things moving at a rapid clip so that we do get a few real thrills and some genuine moments of suspense along the way and so that you won't stop to think too often about the Looney-tunes type.  And for this kind of film, that's about all one can ask for.Ileana is an FBI profiler called in by the French Canadian police to help them solve a murder case where a victim's face is disfigured by being smashed to bits until it's unrecognizable.  Why are the Canadian police asking an FBI agent for help you may ask?  Shame on you,   you're not supposed to ask questions like that in a film like this so just accept it and move on.  It doesn't take Ileana long to figure out that they are dealing with a serial killer, something you'll already know unless you were late getting into your theater seat from spreading too much butter around on your popcorn.  So we know, and Ileana knows, which puts all of us one up on the Canadian police department that isn't exactly willing to accept that fact until another body pops up with a face that's another candidate for reconstructive surgery.  This time however, there's a witness to the crime, an art dealer named Costa (Ethan Hawke) who was giving mouth to mouth to the victim when the police showed up.  Of course that also makes Costa suspect number one, I suppose because the police think it's a little odd for someone to be giving mouth to mouth to a victim that doesn't have a mouth left to give mouth to mouth to.As it turns out, it doesn't take Ileana long to clear Costa and to decide that Costa is in fact not the killer, but is being stalked by the killer. That's why she was called in because she is an ace at that sort of thing. There are a few plot twists, here and there, none plausible but entertaining just the same.  Gena Rowlands is thrown in to the mix as the wicked Mother who tormented one of her twin sons who were supposed to be dead but may or may not be the killer.  And everything careens down the suspense thriller runaway till we get to the final plot twist at the end.   And that's about all you need to know in regards to the plot, less you start asking questions like the one in paragraph two.  A lot of what makes this work of course can be attributed to Jolie, Director Caruso, and to some degree writer Bokenkamp.   It would have been easy for them to give us one of those tormented souls with a satchel full of cuckoo personality traits but she stays pretty much in character as to what an FBI should or should not be doing, well at least most of the time.  Obviously she is attracted to Costa, but that attraction never weighs down her investigation or the script and that's a big plus.  Rowlands is sufficiently haughty as Mrs. Asher, and she chews up the scenery fairly well in her brief scenes.  Olivier' Martinez, John-Hugues Anglade, and Tcheky Karyo play the French Police.  Martinez and Karyo don't think too highly of Ileana, but are kept in place by their boss Duval (Anglade).  And thankfully none of them are written as just being dumb cops who are there just so we can see how much better Ileana is.  Oh yeah, Keifer Sutherland is lurking about too, but you'll have to see the film to find out why.The plot holes and plot contrivances are many, as that seems to go with the territory these days.  The fact is though that Taking Lives offers enough of everything else that if you're willing to give it a pass on those things, you may just be able to enjoy it enough to let it get by.  I had enough fun with it to do just that, and when any film gets me to suspend my disbelief long enough to have a little fun,  I have no choice but to give it my grade which for Taking Lives is a B-.",Taking Lives
102,FrankBooth_DeLarge,"...And Now, our Silence of the Lambs wanna be of the year",5,20 February 2005,"That would be Taking Lives. It is just another thriller with a very predictable plot and follows a cliché of serial killer movies. The best serial killer movies are Silence of the Lambs, Se7en, and Manhunter. Taking Lives tries its hardest to become as good as those, but it doesn't.Even though I didn't like this movie very much, my all time favorite actress Angelina Jolie is in it. She proves to be great eye candy.She is the only real good acting in this. Ethan Hawke, who was great in Dead Poet's Society, is just boring in this movie. Kiefer Sutherland does make an appearance in this, but it is rather brief. Everyone else just doesn't do their part.Most of the elements of a serial killer movie are in this, but it is very predictable. The reason I didn't like this as much was because it wasn't shocking and it wasn't as well made as other serial killer movies. It wasn't very interesting or engrossing either. I still can't believe that some critics compared this to Silence of the Lambs. If you want to see what a real quality thriller is, then rent Silence of the Lambs or Fargo, or any other thriller that is good.This is violent for those of you who only watch movies to see that type of thing. There are disturbing images, scenes of graphic violence, and a brief sex scene with nudity of Angelina Jolie.

I'm glad I did.Apart from starring Angelina Jolie, who I have the utmost admiration for, not just as an actress but as an all-round wonderful person, the action was ""ordinary"" with Keifer Sutherland taking a very minor part.It is difficult to review this movie without including spoilers and to do that would be somewhat pointless because there are so many twists and turns. Maybe the smarter viewers saw them coming but, personally, I had no idea with the result that I was on the edge of my nice comfortable La-z-boy for much of the movie.Whilst I was pretty confident that the guilty one would get his due deserts in the end, almost right up to the last minute, I was fooled (you'll see what I mean).

It is getting so that Ethan Hawke's name is no longer a guarantee of some sort of quality, and that worries me. On his behalf.The thriller is the genre above all other genres that depends desperately on some kind of logic. We can deal with stories not being told lineally. Very few of them leave you with a lasting impression, but I appreciate the ambitions involved. Not here. The reason 'Taking Lives' sinks is its excruciatingly rotten writing. The behavior of all the protagonists is psychologically implausible to say the least, the conduct of the detectives gratingly unprofessional, their investigation so amazingly shoddy that it defies description.

The befriended guy gets out to change the tire. While he is doing so a truck is head towards them on the highway. The other team looks at the truck and just as it is about to pass them, the teen shoves the tirechanger in front of the truck. The truck hits the tirechanger and crashes. The teen first checks that the trucker is dead then goes back to the tirechanger to ensure he is dead too. He stirs and the teen finishes the job by smashing him in the face with a stone. I was watching this and asking, what? We are next shown that is several years later and a series of grisly serial killings are being investigated by Angelina Jolie. One of the key suspects is Ethan Hawke, who claims to have seen the killer and is worried that he will be the next victim. Anglelina believes him using psychological reasoning.The rest of the movie goes along with Hawke being used as bait for the killer, while Jolie gets a psychological portrait. The killer is one who kills similar looking loner guys and then assumes their identities. He repeats this each time he gets bored with the life he is leading.I don't want to give away the rest of the story because just about anything would be a spoiler, except the director seemed to make you think everything was wrapped up about halfway through the movie. Realizing the the film still has close to an hour left the audience can figure out that this is just a ruse.

106,xavrush89,Unpleasant and Predictable. What bet did Gena Rowlands lose?,3,6 April 2005,"This thriller is formulaic all the way. After the fifteen minutes when you figure out ""whodunit,"" you can decide for yourself if you want to find out how it unfolds. Lets just say Clarice Starling has no competition to worry about at the FBI. Angelina Jolie's bears more resemblance to a brunette version of Daphne from Scooby Doo than the pro originated by Jodie Foster--especially when giddily staring into the eyes of ""homme fatale"" Ethan Hawke. There are very few moments that you won't see coming until the end, and by then the surprise or two they saved hardly seem worth it.I have to add a note about how utterly annoying Olivier Martinez is as Jolie's colleague. I blame director D.J. Caruso for allowing both he and Hawke to over-emote to the point of nausea, but Martinez especially shows an acting range somewhere at the Keanu Reeves level. He's blown whatever career spike he got from the movie, Unfaithful. Maybe Gena Rowlands saw Caruso's far better film, The Salton Sea, and that's why she agreed to take part in this mess. There is a love scene connected with the plot, but the way it is filmed is a turnoff, especially for the gals (or gay guys).Angelina Jolie's acting is wasted on the script.

Martinez gives one of the worst, most wooden performances I have ever seen, his mangled English, is often indecipherable, the guy sounds as if he's learned his lines by rote and doesn't understand what he's saying. The fact that the cops communicate with each other in English(even when Jolie isn't present) is laughable, (but then it wouldn't do to have too much subtitled dialogue in a Hollywood movie would it). There is a tacky gratuitous and unconvincing sex scene and a decapitation thrown in to spice things up and the finally, the most hilariously BAD ending I've seen in a long while.

108,garyvanhorn,"A serial killer movie that attempts, and fails, to keep you guessing.",5,15 May 2011,"As with most mediocre Hollywood fare I found myself reminded of similar films that were done better while watching Taking Lives. In this case the better film is The Talented Mr. Ripley. Both films feature a serial killer, or would be serial killer, that can take on the traits of others and effectively hide themselves in plain sight. Where The Talented Mr. Ripley shines and Taking Lives does not, is in the exploration of the killer and his transformations from identity to identity.Taking Lives takes place in Montreal, Quebec, Canada where a murder has taken place in which the victim's hands were severed and his face smashed into unrecognizable pulp. Apparently this is too much for the local police to handle; enter special agent Illeana Scott (Angelina Jolie). A curious and astute audience might wonder why local Canadian police are receiving assistance from an American FBI agent. Curious as you might be you never do find out, just go with it. Soon after Scott joins the investigation, Costa (Ethan Hawke) informs the police that he interrupted the killer's latest work and can draw a sketch and the hunt for the killer begins in earnest.What follows is a fairly typical story littered with suspicion, misdirection, and chase scenes. The thing that is lacking in the film is the thing that gives it an interesting premise, the fact that the killer not only takes the lives of his victims in a mortal sense, he also literally takes their lives and lives them because the killer cannot stand himself and longs to be someone, anyone else. We never get to see this happen, we just have to take the movie's back story as gospel. Even when the killer is revealed to be someone we are very familiar with from the film, he doesn't change a bit, still the same character we met during his first scene.

Taking Lives Started out promising with some solid acting Angelina Jolie seemed like she would be at least OK and maybe even dependable for once to give a good performance but, too many plot twists for the sake of plot twists and some confusing plot holes caused this movie to steer off coarse.Angelina Jolie's character starts off as a competent FBI Profiler but, after awhile starts to defy logic and common sense by making some very absurd and foolish decisions that someone in her professional position just would not do.Ethan Hawke was annoying and his acting was mediocre. Kiefer Sutherland must have had some time off in between shooting his Series 24 so he could be up an easy paycheck in this glorified cameo. D.J Caruso's direction was stylish and skilled so I actually do think he has a real future. The movie was atmospheric yet the plot went from nearly originally to predictable and pedestrian swiftly. I didn't think it would reinvent the genre but, it certainly did let me down to a degree in the end. Cliché French detectives as supporting characters did not help. Too bad this movie began as being somewhat innovative and turned into a conventional and formulaic movie about cops trying to apprehend a serial killer type of suspense movie that we have seen many times before.Not a horrible movie but, it goes down the tubes rapidly as the movie progresses to an ending that wasn't bad and was a slight surprise but, I was not blown away by it.Rent this if you're really bored because it is fairly watchable and mildly entertaining but, otherwise don't go out of your way.

Ethan Hawke fares even worse in the movie's most clichéd and predictable role. Kiefer Sutherland is completely wasted and any actor in Hollywood could have played his role with no dropoff in quality. And a handful of Canadian police all seem like they could have been interesting characters...if anybody had bothered to write them any parts.There have been so many smart thrillers written over the years, and so many ALMOST smart thrillers a step behind them, that all the mood and charisma in the world simply can't overcome this sort of sloppy, mailed in effort by a studio out to make a quick buck.

Nothing else kept me in the theater except that for most of the movie, in the back of my head I kept saying, it's not like they're trying to make a bad piece that only has box office appeal. This movie has a few jerkers if you're into scary stuff, but even then they are old tricks. So many movies use the shaky camera in the poorly lit empty house trick. If they place the camera behind the character, you get the impression that (s)he is being followed. That makes more than one appearance in this movie.The constant rain got on my nerves. At least the whole thing is not set at night. I live in a desert. We are lucky if we get a 1/2 inch of rain in a month but this movie had me thinking ""Enough already"". Yet another over-used trick. Of course the protaganist is a beautiful woman with big breasts. Enter Angelina Jolie. I have nothing against her but she has got to stop doing such garbage. Her costars don't sink but none of them rise to the challenge of creating characters.The ending is like the U2 song that plays at the beginning and end: random, 'because it's popular' and unfitting.

Too bad the scene was over 10 minutes into the film.Angelina who I think is normally a talented actress is AWFUL in this.

There, in an elaborate, confusing plot ""switch,"" he plans to ""give"" his (real) identity to an innocent patsy whom he would then frame and kill. He's forced to improvise when a new sheriff (Angelina Jolie) rides into town. That wouldn't be a bad premise. Very complicated (a few thick accents didn't help), Jolie is good (and tres jolie), Hawkes pretty good.

This just makes no sense, it's obvious that they're French. Worse than that though, I wish that they had picked someone other than Jolie; the woman simply cannot act. Even Ethan Hawke was too busy gagging on the pedestrian script to be able to save her.But by far the worst problem was the boredom. Once it became obvious that the script was shot full of holes it was no longer enjoyable to watch and the end didn't come soon enough. There simply isn't anything new here.There was literally no character development, just mere hints acting as explanation for a particular character's actions. The villain of the piece really had no purpose other than to kill people; sure he's a psychopath, but I want to know why.Kiefer Sutherland, by the way, was completely wasted.

E) she did not study anything at FBI because she does not know that psychopath can pretend having human emotions and reactions like the one that Ethan showed when he saw the rope.

But the format was tired out long ago. Taking Lives is the story of a serial killer who takes the identities of the people he kills. FBI agent, Angelina Jolie is brought in to help the local police department identify the killer.Although this type of movie has been done time and time again, it has been done in quite a different way this time. The level of blood and gore is quite significant, but isn't thrown in your face, it actually complements the plot and makes the movie itself very visually impressive.The acting talent on show isn't too bad. Jolie and Sutherland particularly stand out, complementing the characters they are portraying. On the other hand I found that Ethan Hawke's acting is a little overdone at times. He tends to over-dramatise everything to the point of humour. This did only become apparent on my second viewing though so it shouldn't really affect first time viewers.Story-wise I found that Taking Lives is really just like an elongated episode of CSI but nevertheless I was hooked from beginning to end and I felt completely satisfied by the time the closing credits were rolling.http://www.theundeadcritic.tk/",Taking Lives

136,espenshade55,"Good idea, terrible, awful, atrocious, monstrosity of an ending",3,4 April 2005,"They obviously had a great idea going into production of this film. How can you make a bad movie about a serial killer that kills people and takes there identities and follow the woman that is on the case and how she finally brings him down. Well, they managed to do that with this formulaic, boring film with a tacked on ending.Don't get me wrong, it did have its entertaining moments but there certainly weren't enough to save this film. It is appalling that the script came out appearing so haphazard and unbelievable after it went through so many rewrites by so many different people.The performances weren't particularly strong in this film. Angelina Jolie hasn't given us much to be impressed with in a very long time, and the supporting cast wasn't much better.As for the ending. Lets just put it this way, the second you are watching a movie and they rule the guy out right off the bat and say that he couldn't have done it, he did it. You knew that Ethan Hawk was the killer from six minutes into the film. There were no surprises.As followed is the bad crime thriller formula for Hollywood: Large breasted cop gets on a murder case, the killer gets introduced, they don't know it the killer (we aren't supposed to either but anyone with half a brain figures it out), killer toys with large breasted cop for a long time without her knowing it, inevitably the killer and the large breasted cop have sex (this is used to get the teenage men in to see the film despite the bad reviews its bound to get), then the cop finds out that her love interest is the killer, she gets over it in thirty seconds flat and eventually kills him. This is how they make money, this is how they probably did make money on this film, unfortunately it had no artistic appeal.I wouldn't recommend waisting your time on this one. I know that I'll have a lot of guys that I went to high school with disagree with me on what I'm about to say next but I'll say it any way.

Such is the case with Taking Lives where the movie offers up talent the likes of Jollie and Sutherland. You have to wonder why they did these movies, perhaps as a favor to someone in the industry, certainly not to bolster their resumes. Movies about serial killers are often fun to watch and usually have twists and turns which keep viewers on the edge of their seats. In the case of Taking Lives, everything is all too predictable and cookie cutter, with the game of cat and mouse being played out by law enforcement and perp.

140,annoman,An exhibit of humdrum clichés and predictable twists,4,7 November 2007,"D.J. Caruso's makeover of Michael Pye's novel of the same title is one that should have never been madeor at least not in the manner it was. Originally a thriller about a serial killer named Martin Asher (who'd been stealing the lives and identities of his victims ever since his presumed death at age 16), the film version of 'Taking Lives' never reaches the suspense  or thrills  that it intended. Angelina Jolie gives a performance as petty as her character (an FBI profiler named Illeana Scott, who is assigned to help a Montreal investigative unit track Asher), though does so in the company of equally trivial bids by acting veterans Ethan Hawke (who plays James Costa, an independent artist and eyewitness to Asher's most recent murder), Oliver Martinez (one of the detectives on the case), and Kiefer Sutherland (as the suspected killer). However, the real killer in (or of, I should say) this film is its incoherently adapted screenplay (which, by the way, took a team of four script doctors to finalize), which is made more unpleasant by the messy, inconsistent and unstylish direction of Caruso (whose 2007 release, 'Disturbia', is anything but). 'Taking Lives' is a prime example of a Hollywood misfire and a showy exhibit of humdrum clichés, predictable twists, and poor career choices by otherwise great actors.",Taking Lives
141,FargoUT,A brief review with minor plot spoilers,6,15 March 2004,"This well-acted psychological drama bears no resemblance to ""Seven"" or ""Copycat"", although the title credits would hint to otherwise.  Stylishly directed by D.J. Caruso (""The Salton Sea""), ""Taking Lives"" dives full on into the psychological aspects of identity.  However, despite the timeliness of the film given our real world problems with identity theft, the story's plot holes drags down the proceedings.FBI agent Illeana Scott (Angelina Jolie) is called up to Quebec to help in an investigation of a possible serial killer.  The case has spanned nearly twenty years, with the first murder depicted in the film's early moments.
The investigation is cracked open when a sole witness to a murder comes forward.  James Costa (Ethan Hawke) claims to have witnessed and interrupted the killer during one of his murders.  Soon thereafter, it becomes apparent that Costa is now being pursued by the murderer.All of this is handled in a most unusual manner.  With excellent cinematography, Caruso revels in the forensic and quirky mannerisms of Illeana (credit to Jolie for fully involving herself in the character). Her eyes dart back and forth, scanning everything for any detail.  Using simple techniques of observation and instinct, she can quickly notice anything which might help her case.  The camera captures everything in a graceful manner, quite unusual for this kind of film.  Worthy of notice is a chase on foot through crowded streets, which attains a sense of surreality without drawing needless attention to itself.Credit must be given to the screenplay, which smartly crafts Jolie's character into a full-fledged, rational woman.  When feelings arise between herself and Costa, she asks to be removed from the case so her judgment may not be clouded.  However, the screenplay also takes serious missteps, leaving many gaping plot holes and questions unanswered.
Whatever the script lacks, thankfully, is made up for by an excellent cast (particularly Jolie, Hawke, and Martinez) and creative direction by Caruso. There are no surprise twists in this film--if you've seen any serial killer movie, you'll quickly figure out who the killer is well before the characters do.  There are, however, some surprises to be had, particularly in the final five minutes.  There is a scene of shocking violence just before credits roll which caused our preview audience to scream in horror. Even I, desensitized to most movie violence, recoiled in shock.
While the screenplay leaves much to be desired and Philip Glass's score is disappointing, ""Taking Lives"" is a generally entertaining, scary movie which gets under your skin and may possibly leave you finding it hard to fall asleep at night.Out of 4 Stars: *** (3 Stars)*On a sidenote, this film contains one of the all-time best ""jump scares"" in film history.

She uses her unconventional and intuitive mind to get into the mind of the cunning killer, hopefully to uncover his identity. Working meticulously under the eyes of the scoffing French-speaking detectives, she finds that the killer has been not only brutally murdering his victims, he is also stealing their identities, using their credit cards, and even going as far as living in the dead victim's homes.Her uncanny abilities alienate her from the traditional detective underlings who jealously resent her interference.  She has a deep passion for her work, unlike the other detectives sneering at the sidelines.  However, when an unexpected romantic interest takes over, she begins to doubt her objectivity and her instincts.  This is when her world begins to unravel.The trail becomes twisted, full of suspense, red herrings, and numerous surprises.  A suspect, (Keifer Sutherland) leads Scott into a hair-raising chase and dead end.  A witness to one of the murders, James Costa (Ethan Hawke), is haunting as he describes the act of the cold-blooded killing. Scott's cool and collected demeanor never betrays her true feelings as Costa weaves his tale of horror.  The killer's mother, Mrs. Asher (Gena Rowlands), is chilling as she later recounts to Scott the twisted childhood that formed the evil monster her son has become.  The beat of the movie, driven by director D.J. Caruso, never lets you rest. Even the leisurely scenes leave you on the edge of your seat with anticipation and dread of the next move.  Yet, at the same time, the energy of the film leaves you impatient for the next scene to emerge.  The plot weaves its way through the Canadian capital with unexpected scenarios that are both unnerving of your equilibrium and fascinating at the same time. The surprise ending is totally unexpected and consists of several surprises within each revelation.  This is a brilliantly conceived and well-executed piece of cinematic production, and enhanced by the superb acting by the cast.  Well-done Mr. Caruso.",Taking Lives

But SE7EN it ain't...",7,15 April 2004,"Despite my love of Angelina Jolie, I must say that Taking Lives wasted a lot of good opportunity.Given that they invented an entirely new lead character, we can't really compare this to the book, so let's look at it as a movie of it's own right.Jolie plays Illeana Scott, a somewhat strange FBI agent who is called up to Canada to investigate the grisly murders of several young men, all whom have had their identities stolen by the killer. New to the scene is witness James Costa, Ethan Hawke, who soon grows to have an attachment to Scott.At turns formulaic and down right rip off (the credits are far too similar to be called a homage to SE7EN), Taking Lives is a very enjoyable piece of work.Beautifully shot, the film wallows in its moods. It knows that it can be creepy, but it wears it out on its sleeves.Angelina is on top form as Scott, although its a shame that the movie does stoop to the need for quick-sex-scene-with-unnecessary-titty-shot.Ethan Hawke is bearable as Costa, although he and Jolie have very little chemistry.Other players, Olivier Martinez, Gena Rowlands, Tcheky Karyo and Jean Hughes-Angalade are also quite good.The film does have its highs: excellent cinematography, creepy sinister mood, two fantastic adrenaline-jump moments that I never saw coming. But it also has one FATAL flaw, and that is that anyone who has seen any piece of film or television before will be able to guess who the killer is.

Let me say up front that I am a huge fan of Angelina Jolie and I think she brings a great depth to more or less all the characters she plays (with the obvious exclusion of Lara Croft). Here I got the feeling that she was more or less sleep walking through the movie until the point at which she realises that she has slept with the killer. Here I completely bought into her genuine sense of shock at her own ineptitude and lack of judgement.This is a ""by the numbers"" thriller which tries hard to throw you off the scent but ultimately fails. I think that is because Ethan Hawke is dreadfully mis-cast and you just don't warm to the guy or his character from the off. It is also a stretch to think that Illeana (Jolie) would fall for him hook line and sinker as he just doesn't carry the charisma that the task would need.Overall, this film does not serve up the required shocks to drag it into a higher rating but it does have two effective moments. The first one on the mattress; if you've seen the movie you'll know what I mean, and the other is the ""slap"" scene - genuinely shocking.This is a movie that tries hard.

151,jack.hunter,Unbelievably poor!,3,6 September 2004,I was absolutely astounded at how bad this film was. There was hardly a scene in the movie that seems credible. Character development? There is none. Reasonable motivation? None here pal. Believable plot situations? Zero. At least in the gratuitous sex scene you would have thought they would have shut the front door to the apartment. Not in this turkey. How does it happen that a heavy equipment operator digs up a body and then later the grave is completely intact with exact measurements? If you have the misfortune of seeing this you will know what I mean. I was afraid I was in trouble 10 minutes into the film with the first ridiculously set up murder but had hopes the rest of the film would make more sense. No such luck. It only gets worse. This movie is so full of flaws you could write a book on them. Obviously this was made to make a quick buck off gratuitous gore and sex. A total waste of time.,Taking Lives

Horrendous soundtrack. Components of the movie fit together like a five year-old in a men's suit. Jolie was a bad casting decision. Waste of acting talent in more than one peripheral character. The whole movie was awkward.Not worth talking about clichés and plot holes, because I really don't feel like writing a lengthy essay. The film does nothing to motivate me to actually want to pick apart and analyze these things...The parts which salvaged the movie for me were...mostly Ethan Hawke's performance during the latter part of the movie, even though it wasn't the greatest acting job I've ever seen.The movie wasn't interesting enough to keep me actively involved in the details of the plot, so the movie mildly surprised me with a couple of plot twists. It also had a couple of scenes that jolted me awake with things popping out of nowhere. Also, the beginning sequence was quite good. Of course, it was pretty much downhill from there, but there were some ups along with the downs.Cinematography was pretty decent...am I grasping for straws here? You know the movie's bad when one of the special features of the DVD are ""gag reels"". Anyway, if thrillers are your cup of tea, then this movie may be worth spending 1 hour and 40 minutes watching.

DO NOT READ BEFORE YOU SEE IT!!!When it comes down to it, Taking Lives, another entry into the serial killer thriller genre, is just that. However, the whopper of an ending involving Angelina Jolie's faking of a pregnancy made an otherwise routine thriller worth recommending... but just barely.After the opening ten minutes in which a road tripper meets his demise (in an ugly car accident), we find years later, an art gallery owner played by Ethan Hawke claims to have witnessed a homicide. Jolie, for her part, does a good job as the FBI profiler sent in to help the detectives investigate the series of crimes. Predictably, the detective played by Olivier Martinez is the one whose doubts about Jolie are confirmed when things take a bad turn.As for the requisite midway-through-the-movie plot twist, Kiefer Sutherland provides for the movie what proves to be a red herring (he's not the killer) which was not worth wasting time for the hiatus from his TV series ""24"".In a long story short, Taking Lives doesn't hold a candle to Silence of the Lambs, still the best movie of the serial killer thriller genre.",Taking Lives

The killer however picks his targets because they will not be missed and then he can assume their identity without raising any suspicion. The movie would like you to believe that it is Kiefer Sutherland, but why would he continue to stalk a man who has become under police surveillance, he would not which makes it abundantly clear that Ethen Hawke is the killer and the rest of the movie just drags and drags. Also why would an FBI agent be fired for sleeping with someone after they think the case is closed which makes the entire last scene of the movie totally predictable. There is however a good shot of Angelina Jolies boobs which is definitely worth the stars, so this is a two star movie with a good boob shot.

How does he get a driver's license, or a bank account?In the first of his murders, when he shoves an acquaintance in front of a truck on a smooth roadway, why does the vehicle fly into the air and somersault to destruction?Why does the killer's mother have photos of her son only as a child but not as a teenager?Why does somebody you owe money to lurk about in the shadows but not meet you face to face until the plot requires it?Why does a kidnap victim with a gun at his head drive at high speed through a city instead of switching off the ignition?Why does a cop who is supposed to be guarding a potential victim wait out in the street next to a taxi?And finally, why does Angelina Jolie get into the sack with sexless Ethan Hawke when Olivier Martinez is on hand?The good thing about DVD's, of course, is that one can watch the last third of the film at 1.5 speed, with on screen subtitles, to the final contrived and unbelievable climax.Better still, give up movies and read a book.",Taking Lives

Look for the plot-points (actually, how can you miss them? they're formulaic and clichéd) The third act makes the whole story have no sense whatsoever, not to mention that it has the typical ""I'll explain how I did it so the audience might feel the rip-off a little less"" sequence with predictable flashbacks that make no sense at all, the writer of this thing probably started writing this one from Act 1, then trying to make a justification for his script on Act 3 in a lousy, lousy way.

Sound familiar yet???She is summoned to Montreal... which is actually Quebec City... and is actually populated by French cops who are helpless to stop a killer that is leaving them clues and odd witnesses all over the place.  She ofcourse figures out the ""pattern"" in the first half hour or so and then spins her wheels for the next hour and a half, getting herself into one obvious jam after another.  The killer is killing people and then living their lives. Gee I bet this all ties back to his mom not loving him.  And I am not even getting near the patented twist ending.This last complaint might be a bit of a spoiler, so don't read on if you want to experience the badness yourself, just know the Jolie nude scene is needless and yet the highlight of the movie. A very disappointing follow up to ""The Salton Sea."" (go rent that for a good crime flick)
To me the most glaring and annoying plot-whole of the film is that, they set up the killer's mother who has not seen him since he was a boy, but can instantly recognize her son's eyes. Then they have a suspect/witness in custody. But the genius fbi agent never bothers to show dear old mommy dearest a picture of the man. I mean come on.  This is just a bad flick.

The mood is creepy and has lots of jump-in-your-seat moments. Dead, decayed bodies abound and the effects are great. The characters are also extremely good if slightly contrived. Seeing Angelina having sex is, as always, welcome.My only problem was the plot in the final act.Everything was good up until the final set of twists began. Part of the problem was I saw that twists were coming (although perhaps not that particular set, but I still didn't buy them, especially the very last one). But the bigger problem was it tries to be overly clever and drifts into inane...However, if you don't dislike the final twists like I did, I think you'll end up really enjoying it.

He moves from one victim to the next until the police start to join the dots and the FBI send an agent up to Montreal, Canada, to help out the local police.FBI agent, Illeana, (Angelina Jolie) is a talented profiler and she soon realises what is happening but neither she nor the Montreal detectives have any idea who the killer might be. That is, until Costa, an art dealer, (Ethan Hawke) pronounces himself the witness to the latest murder. He even draws a sketch of the murderer. And the mother of a son who she thought died years ago comes in and reports that she has seen her son alive and he was and is very dangerous. Now the detectives are on the trail of the killer and it looks like the killer is after Costa who is used as bait.It's a bit graphic so if you are offended by nasty photos, you might want to give this a miss. I just think it's all a load of ketchup. And this movie has a lovely twist at the end - a nice sting in the tail.The director is D. J. Caruso (I immediately thought Miami CSI, but no, not him).

She is an excellent actress, well unless the American movie academy gives Oscars to terrible actors.. Someone else mentioned Ashley Judd as being a better actress than Jolie. That is laughable!! Don't confuse your attraction for Judd with acting ability!! OK so you know I think Jolie is a great actress, and having said that, this movie stinks.. Reasons?1. If after a few minutes you don't ""get it"" then with all due respect, your IQ is most likely under 100.2. Nothing new here, same old same old.

Most of the film plays it by the numbers, with several red herrings  and some sexual tension between the two leads thrown in for fun. The cast is rounded out with good actors, Tcheky Karyo and Olivier Martinez as the Montreal cops conducting the investigation and Gena Rowlands as the killer's mother, who comes to the police after recognizing her son and realizing he is still alive after all these years.

The opening credits for starters were a complete Se7en rip off. Not to mention the end scene where there's a certain box (yes a box), that is being filmed in such a way to make you think the ending will also be identical to Se7en.Honestly, I cringed numerous times. I tend to sit back and take a movie for what it is, appreciating full well there's likely to be goofs and characters don't usually act in a realistic way.

The movie had a beautiful style, with creative shots and a dark feeling. It was dissapointing to have watched the movie and see that it was missing some interesting scenes viewed in the trailer which I thought was well done as well.

The gratuitous shots of Angelina Jolie's mammary organs only cheapened the production.  While the acting was fine, and the locales interesting (so rare for an American production to film in Québéc), the ending was just too ridiculous and predictable.

175,stonedonkies,Crashes and burns just before reaching the landing strip,4,28 March 2005,"Yes, there are spoilers in here. Believe me, you're not missing much by reading this review and skipping the film. If you're a fan of Jolie, it's fun to watch, because she's quite attractive and gets naked. After the sex scene, though, I recommend stopping the film there. So why have I written such a long-winded review? Because Jolie and Hawke are typically compelling reasons to see a film, and I must explain why, in this case, it's not worth it. They do fine in their roles but are be betrayed by poor and confusing film-making.Of all the movies I've seen, I've never stopped watching so far in, due to an unbelievably stupid plot triple combo punch of plot twists and bizarre film technique. It's actually a rat's nest of problems that don't appear until the end of the film. Thematically, Sutherland's actual role spins him around in the end, into a cheesy and underdeveloped plot point.Secondly, the car chase. There is a VERY CLEAR shot of the passenger holding a gun to the driver's head, before they get to the bridge. It is presumed to be Hawke driving and Sutherland pointing the gun at his head. This is shot from the objective point of view (POV). Just a camera following the car chase. But this scene is replayed from Jolie's POV, in a recall flashback, after she discovers who the killer is, and we see Hawke in the driver's seat the whole way--with Sutherland shot to death before he even entered the vehicle. It is not possible on any terms for the viewer to see the passenger with a gun, viewed from an objective POV, then see a subjective POV that makes the previous objective POV *impossible*. The objective POV in film-making is inherently incapable of lying. The director can and will lead you astray with ambiguous cinematography, but the shot of the passenger holding the gun to the driver's head was completely UNambiguous. So it's either incompetent cinematography or incompetent storytelling. Or both! It got really difficult to tell, or care, once I got to the clincher. Furthermore, the twist of Sutherland being dead before the chase began wasn't the trouble.Before Jolie found out that Hawke was the killer, she had sex with him. (In another betrayal of form, the director doesn't let the protagonist piece it together on her own--she finds him literally red-handed, standing over his mother's dead body in an elevator. She doesn't have her piece-it-together flashback until AFTER she's found Hawke in the elevator. To me, this reveals either further incompetence and ignorance, or shows how little respect and/or knowledge the creators have for suspense thrillers, the audience, and for Jolie in particular--a nice piece of meat who's willing to show some skin for the camera. In this genre, it's paramount that the investigator uncovers the truth, rather than stumbling almost randomly upon the killer in the act. You could argue that the director went this route because he assumed most of the audience had figured this out by now, but the flow of suspense keeps Hawke's role marginally but clearly in doubt, and the sudden deflation of Jolie's investigatory momentum is, regardless, decidedly against genre.) Anyways, we have the killer's big escape, and then we skip ahead several months. She's lost her job, on account of boning the killer, she lives in some barren, snowy town, in an out-of-the-way house...and she's PREGNANT. She KEPT the BABY.Now, maybe she was just using some prop to fool Hawke into coming to her or whatever, and she isn't really pregnant. But you know, after seeing the badly done car chase, the manner of of the killer's identity being revealed, etc. I couldn't bring myself to watch the movie any longer. That's right--I don't know how it ends. The film asked too much of my suspension of disbelief, and this is coming from a life-long fan of all things science-fiction. I felt like I'd wasted the last hour and a half or so of my life, and you probably will too if you somehow get roped into seeing this bewilderingly piece. The most compelling mystery this film provided was wondering if it was the result of cynical contempt, depressing incompetence--or both. Jolie's presence becomes the only thing that makes it watchable.",Taking Lives

It is not that the storyline was done on the rush and have plot holes. It is more that the movie finds itself kept between two ideas unable to decide which one it should follow. The first one is the conventional thriller which is made of pieces of puzzle to follow that a psychopath left behind because of his own megalomania and for the pleasure of the viewer to understand before the main agent of the movie does. The second is an original approach that consists to enhance the link and even fascination that exists between the bright agent and the killer to its paroxysm to try to play with the viewer on his conception of what is bad and what is right (Hannibal).

The second time I watched it cracks showed plot holes were found and it did began to appear like an obvious ""cheap"" low budget film that appeared as if it was thrown together last minute. I still enjoyed watching it but It definently isn't a great movie and can get pretty lame sometimes. So don't expect an amazing captivating thriller like Se7en.
Some questions I have that I see as plot holes
Who was the guy under the bed? Why was he under the bed?
Why was that cop tying ""little people"" out of things - the same thing that the ""killer"" was doing
Why was Angelina lying in a grave?
Things like this maybe were to thrown in because they needed to add another aspect to the film but eh it didn't really work and by the time we saw the cop tying the little people about 10 seconds later we saw that Ethan was the murderer.
From the interrogation room scene on I really hoped that Ethan Hawke wasn't the killer and that there would be some plot twist to shock us and make us go ""WOW didn't see that coming!"" But no it was very predictable and it did ultimately let the film down.
There wasn't much to the film overall really it's just another thriller with nothing special or different but in saying that I don't think it deserves its punishing 22% on Rotten Tomatoes. Don't pay attention to that ""score"" Yes the film was predictable, yes it was cheap and lame Sometimes but it was still entertaining enough to be able to enjoy it. If your looking for a thriller give this one a try but don't think to hard it's definently one where you think ""oh it's too obvious for Ethan Hawke to be the killer"" but it actually turns out to be him.
With cheap fill ins such as the whole twins aspect I feel is a bit of a cop out that didn't really need to be included yes it showed that he was neglected as a child and always grew up in his brothers spotlight but I feel like every movie like this is starting to use that having twins story line and frankly I find it lame.
""Taking Lives"" was nothing special but it wasn't a failure as some reviews have said.

Firstly we are in a really dark movie including a young man really wacko who has psychotic troubles and wanna take people's life (Taking lives), then you have Angelina Jolie (divine) who is a profiler helping a colleague in this dark affair. And how a big surprise when i saw 3 frenchies in an American movie joking in french about Angelina Jolie! The movie is acting in three times, first you have the killer's youth, then the inquiry and finally the ""after inquiry"" which is really really good. The movie is a really good trhiller handling perfectly the Jolie/Hawk couple with a big climax at the end.

186,SwishCrane441,Hard 8?,8,10 November 2011,"Now this film is based on a very predictable premise at least for me, others well may be able to appreciate the surprise factor.This film is one of those movies where the opening scenes are a treat to watch. Watching Paul Dano(There Will Be Blood) and Justin Chatwin(Invisible) on screen together is bound to make you sit through the whole running time as they possibly are the best duo of upcoming and rising stars but again that's just me.Calling upon Jolie in the film right away makes you wonder if the Canadian police that incompetent? & it is only one thing I am talking about here. The director seems to be in a rush, in a hurry to execute the sex scene I believe, speaking of which it is quite frankly the most steamiest scenes ever. I am not a very big fan of Jolie and couldn't understand what's the big deal until now. Not only she acted well, she looked gorgeous as a cop as well as stunningly courageous. Ethan Hawke is likable as Costa. Rest of the cast, i guess is OK. Not much to do anyways.The major drawback I felt was the film lacked depth behind the concept of "" Taking Lives "" - killer taking on the identity of the murder victims. I mean it is immensely underdeveloped. If they had focused more on killings rather than soulless investigations it had been gruesome, gritty and dark. Let us be honest, not everyone can pull off a Se7en.Having said the aforementioned points I'd rate it an 8, not a hard 8.

There are some pretty exciting scenes, and without revealing too much, probably the best jump-scare I've ever experienced in any film. The soundtrack is pretty good, any film that opens with U2 then follows it up with The Clash is a winner in my eyes. Overall, a good thriller but pretty run of the mill.

There is a consensus, but it is hard to define what's wrong with this near-miss which you'd like to like, but just can't quite... Yes, unless you're eager to see Miss Jolie overexposed there is no redeeming aspect of spending the time watching this mis-fire of a movie. Too bad, because it could'a would'a been pretty OK with a little more thoughtful editing of the screenplay. The holes in this plot are way too numerous & obvious to list (plus would be considered SPOILERS by anyone who watches it in spite of all these negative reviews.) The one that really killed it for us was having the female lead (supposedly a very intelligent & professional top FBI agent) literally jump on the male lead, having never so much as touched each other - not even a kiss - nor generating any believable chemistry/tension between the characters. (Is that supposed to make it ""hot?' Thumbs down.) Plus, if she was so good, she'd have known the truth about him already & never gone there. By that point it was already obvious to US... The mostly indiscernible muttering of the French-Canadien English-speaking policemen didn't help either. Looking for a REAL good thriller? 'Seven' is obvious, 'Fargo' is another. Want a fairly taut cop drama with lots of believable character interest? The largely overlooked 'Falling Down' is excellent. No gratuitous gore & overexposed starlets, though.

I rent enough movies that I wonder why many were ever filmed. I found Taking Lives pretty enjoyable. I found the action/violence enjoyable. I liked the twists. Perhaps I just watched the movie and enjoyed what happened vs trying to figure out what is going to happen. I like Angelina and Ethan Hawkes performance. The love scene was hot, though slightly gratuitous(and not nearly long enough). The Canadian characters and their attitudes were more annoying than they should be. Some of their dialogue was difficult to understand, though if you played it back, you realize you didn't miss much.****** Possible Spoiler********* Kiefer Sutherland was a wasted role for what little screen time that he was given and what minimal development his character was given. Gena Rowlands performance was mediocre and another character hardly worth having in the film.Overall, I would recommend the film",Taking Lives
192,spire65,cliche and without substance,5,28 March 2004,"I went into this movie expecting some originality, but alas, I was sorely mistaken.  It has 2 twists in it, one which is very predictable.  The plot is quite shallow, and the whole movie tries to rest on a few things: Angelina Jolie, Angelina Jolie losing her shirt, and the one, not extremely obvious, twist in the movie.  Under no circumstances should this be your first choice of movies to go see at the theaters; only see it if you are a movie fanatic, like myself, and have already seen all the other movies available.

It lacks momentum and feels fabricated out of disjointed parts rather than keeping the flow and sucking you, as a movie like this should do. Above that, the french dialect almost everyone is speaking affords a lot of concentration, an effort that doesn't pay off however. There are only a few meaningful dialogues, most of them between Angelina Jolie and Eathon Hawk. They are the only characters who are given enough meat to call their on screen presence a relationship - unfortunately Eathan Hawk joins the cast only after about 30 minutes; and an important dialogue that sheds light on who Angelina Jolies character is, a dialogue that awakes interest and meaning to her, comes even later. It's those two actors i give the 4.5 stars to; the story, though neat idea, would need reassembling. Let's hope for a non-directors cut. Afterthought: Lighting, Camera, Settings, these all are interesting. It would have been nice to learn early on, that we're in France - or is it Canada?",Taking Lives

It wasn't really suspenseful, it wasn't really scary, it was just entertaining. One the movies flaws was that it moved was to slow. The first five minutes of the movie are pretty cool, but after that, it takes awhile to really get into the movie. The best part of the movie is probably the last half hour of the movie. During that time, everything thing in the movie comes together and you just say wow, why didn't I guess this an hour ago. The ending to the movie is great. Don't let the R or unrated rating fool you, you are not going to be in for a gore fest, even though I think the movie needed a bit more. The one thing the movie does have going for it is the story.

Angelina Jolie is her usual ""out-there"" character: an FBI agent assisting in a case in Canada. Ethan Hawke plays an artist who witnesses a crime committed by the serial killer being investigated. Also among the cast are local French-Canadian police officers. This movie keeps you guessing. The characters are wonderful. Greatly consider watching this movie.",Taking Lives

the characters tend not to go into to much depth about each other, for instant Angelina Jolies character wears a weddin ring yet says she is not married this isnt explained. saying this we do see a great deal of emotion for her character, she plays the role well and has a stunning performance throughout the film. the only character that we get some real insight into is that of the killer, we dont really learn why he does what he does but it is said to be in some relationship problem he had with his mother (isnt that always the case?)

197,Scooby52,Its own worst enemy,4,4 September 2013,"D.J. Caruso knows how to craft a good film. His debut feature, The Salton Sea, was a sordid but gritty look into the drug underworld. For at least the first half of Taking Lives, he does a great job too, setting us up with tightly paced serial killer thriller with a haunting scope. Angelina Jolie does a reasonable job in the lead and more importantly is nice eye candy. Sadly, it doesn't take long for the film to fall apart after a promising opening.I don't feel the need to get into the plot, that's there in the IMDb summary. So basically without revealing any actual plot twists there are two main problems with this film. The first is that it's VERY predictable, even if you don't get the twist straight away, there comes a point in the film where there is no choice for the viewer to see the inevitable twist before it actually comes. And once that point comes along it's a downhill slope for the remainder of the film.The second problem is, even if the twist is obvious, that is no excuse for failing to tie up loose ends and fill up plot holes. In this film there's too many unanswered questions that the film-makers don't even attempt to address. It's an insult to the audience to simply expect them to forget about certain facts introduced to the story early on in the piece and the film cheats so often too, only showing what they want you to show, because the that's the only way the story can hold up. Overall a film that starts off so well, but ultimately disappoints and assumes it's audience has an I.Q. of less than 65.",Taking Lives

I cannot understand why he is in this movie, because a larger role would have been better. Maybe as a Canadian cop. And Hawke is in my opinion a very good choice. After I saw Gothika and gave it good reviews, I have to reconsider that review in favor of this one. In my opinion, the plot has a lot of great changes, the public is fooled alot of times, and screams are all over. Screams of disgust, of disbelieve, of horror,... Boy, this movie makes you sweat in your seat. My girlfriend hided alot of times under her jacket, and missed all the fun. The cinematography is okay, but makes me think of Seven and the Bone Collector sometimes. Introduction of the characters is also good. Everyone gets his moment of appearance. And this makes the movie interesting, because you KNOW that Sutherland has to come into the plot yet. And that makes the whole experience for the public surprising.

There are so many twists and turns thrown at you that none of them make any sense and the story is basically straight on and direct. My biggest problem with this movie is why would the Montreal police ask for help from the FBI? Doesn't Canada have their own federal police? Jolie's character is a poorly defined Clarice Starling who has no Anthony Hopkins to play off.

Long on style, short on substance, ""Taking Lives"" amounts to little more than a chance for Ethan Hawke and Angelina Jolie to pose for an hour and forty-five minutes. Given the short time length, this movie still drags on forever. I pity anyone who actually shelled out $10.00 at the local multiplex to see this film. I would recommend against renting the video or DVD and don't watch it unless there's absolutely nothing else on television. The camera-work is occasionally interesting and is the only redeeming quality of this mess.

At first when I started watching I thought that maybe it would be in a similar vein to Se7en with its serial killer gore and (attempted) intricate plot line, but no. If you can call it a spoiler it was plainly obvious who the killer was as soon as Ethan Hawke appeared, and the rest of the movie was just a Columbo-style front row seat to see how and if Jolie's character would ever work it out! The characters bar none were awful, its a shame that Keifer Sutherland wasn't in a more central role, what a waste, and the ending, well that was the most cringe-worthy tacked on purposeless finale I have ever watched.

204,johnqadamsiii,Weak and predictable,4,10 April 2005,"The whole story in this film, like all too many of its genre these days, is entirely structured around deceiving the viewer as to who the killer really is in the end. Basically we are given two possibilities. The movie goes out of its way to portray one as likely and the other unlikely. Then at the end we are thrown a loop, and the plot, which seemingly hinged upon one set of protagonist relationships, turns out to be false. At this point the movie becomes a let down and our worst fears are made true. Because it was an attempt to trick the audience, the likely scenario turned-upside-down becomes something of an unrealistic contrived premise. It is unfortunate that the movie did not attempt to offer a third kind of alternative as to the outcome. Angelina Jolie and Ethan Hawke's performances were both good. And the singular thing that I found interesting was the romantic relationship that was being established in the film. However, like most thrillers today, the movie has little room for romance (or intricate meaning). The moral we are left with apparently is that you never can truly know who you can trust, even with those whom you may have the deepest feelings for.

The plot is as good as any of this genre, with a good ending twist. Ethan Hawke gives a very good performance. The two detectives are quite good; Angelina does well except for the two moments mentioned previously.

Why? When I watch the movie I like to know how long it is. From the start, I thought that Ethan is a killer, but it was just a guess. After he was in the station as a witness, I thought it again, especially when Angelina said something about ""how serial killers acts and so on"", and it was completely wrong. They are intelligent, smart one, but also psychopaths and they are able to be the best actors in the world. I mention that I like to know length of the movie? Well, in this one,supposed serial killer was murdered and the movie had at least 45 minutes to play on screen and then I was completely sure that Ethan is a killer. Then last part, and I'm so pissed that I didn't predict that part, she is allegedly pregnant, and completely alone on some mountain, cabin in the forest, whatever, or in Serbian (""vukojebina""-you can't translate this one and it's not offensive word - middle of nowhere bur in a funny way) and that he appears again. Ok, predictable again, so I'm pissed that I didn't predict that part that her pregnancy is false ;) That's it.

The plot made sense although I would have liked more history, like some flashbacks for example. I really thought that Angelina Jolie did a great job portraying a character that I as the viewer trusted and felt as though I wanted to follow her story.

Within half an hour of the film's beginning, my date and I had figured out who the killer was.  We weren't positive mind you, just a guess, and we still thought that it could be an entertaining romp.  Not so.In the beginning, they hint at Angelina Jolie's character being similar to that of Sam on ""Profiler.""  A psychological profiler with a sixth sense that allows her to track and identify a killer.  It is implied that she is brought in because nobody else has been able to identify a serial killer who has been operating for many years.  She is a last resort.  So much for that!!It is disappointing that Hollywood rarely has a strong female figure who is unable to thwart the wiles of the overtly sexual male.  Similar to Jeff Bridges and Glenn Close in ""The Jagged Edge,"" Hawke's character has Jolie's character sliding off of her chair practically from the beginning.  Her character is quirky and odd and that would have been very entertaining if she could have actually managed to do anything extraordinary like solving the case she was hired to work on.The psychological thriller is my favorite genre of film, but I must admit that the truly good ones are few and far between.  My suggestion would be to resist the hype and wait until this one comes to video OR wait until it plays on your favorite movie channel.  This one is definitely NOT a ""must see.""",Taking Lives
217,WhoThrewThatMonkey,Intriguing FBI based 'who done it' with a twist,7,28 August 2015,"""A serial killer is on the road, killing and taking over lives of his victims. Time is ticking down before he claims his next victim and identity""Right from the beginning, I liked this movie. The two actors who we're introduced to are Justin Chatwin and Paul Dano. Dano would go onto to play a role in the 2013 film Prisoners in a very similar role while Chatwin would go on to ruin my CHILDHOOD!!! Uhhhumm. Excuse me.The introduction to this movie lulls you into a sense of comfort but then violently shifts you into how a majority of the rest of the film will be played out. Starts with two great actors, great music and a real sense of out in the wilderness with no one around. The opening credits has a very Se7en feel to it and the introduction and some of the settings and dialogue that comes up in the first third of the film is very reminiscent to Silence of the Lambs.Basic premise of the movie is Asher (Dano) kills people he watches and stalks and assumes their identity. He keeps jumping from person to person trying to leave his former life behind. Angelina Jolie plays an FBI agent who is brought in to help profile and catch the killer. Ethan Hawke plays a character who is brought in for questioning after he witnesses someone being killed. After the first half hour/45 minutes, the movie begins to lose some of it's luster in my opinion with me. I understand that it needs to progress and the plot needs to advance but placing your number one witness in a club to lure out a potential serial killer isn't the best idea.The movie's false ending (Yeah, you read that right. If you haven't picked up on the twist yet, you're not paying attention) culminates with what appears to be the killer kidnapping Hawke's character and leading cops on a high speed chase which ends in a car accident where the killer dies. Everything seems like it is cleared up and Angelina Jolie falls for the victim. At the hospital, the killer's mother comes to verify the body but says the the dead person isn't her son. Hawke then murders his mother in an elevator and escapes. That's right, Ethan Hawke was the killer all along.The movie really ends with Jolie being kicked out of the FBI, pregnant with Hawke's babies and living on her own in Pennsylvania. Hawke tracks her down to rekindle their romance but ultimately decides to try to kill Jolie. He stabs her in the stomach but finds out that she really isn't pregnant when she removes the scissors and stabs him with them. She tells him that the past 7 months had all been a ploy to get him to come back out of hiding.I really liked the first half hour or so of this movie. As I said above, it felt gritty and dirty and something you could accept as the next chapter in the Hannibal saga. I really like FBI profiler and in depth agent movies like this, Red Dragon and Mindhunters where killers motives are questioned and they try to find out why it's happening but also find the killer at the same time.Something that is almost as good as that is Angelina Jolie. I never really thought of her as super sexy or anything but this movie has pushed me over to the other side. I have been missing out on her sex appeal and it was top notch in this movie. Thinking almost the entire movie ""Man, she is super sexy"" and ""I'd definitely would want to get with her"" we are actually paid off and she a nude scene with her around 1 hour and 11 minutes in (You're welcome!)What I didn't like was the ending. By about 40 minutes left, if you hadn't already figured out the ending for the most part, it is thrown right in your face. I didn't really like that they put a face on who you thought could be the killer. By casting Keifer Sutherland in a role where it looked like he was the killer and to do it so early in the movie cut out some of the intrigue. I loved not knowing who the killer could be. Asher took on so many identities he could be anyone. They even still played with this at the very end when the French Canadian Cop had that stick in his mouth and took it out seemingly to tie it in a fashion like Jolie found in Asher's mothers house.I felt like the ending should have been abrupt and left us shocked. Instead, it happened, then explained itself, then let that marinate and finally decided ""Ok, now here's the payoff"". In reality, we didn't need payoff. The Asher character was good because we 'didn't know' who it was and it could end up being anyone. He has for years been able to just slip in and out of lives without ever being caught and that's how I felt it should have ended. The actual ending is not bad and was even a good twist but in this movie, it didn't seem like it was needed.I'll say watch this movie if you're really into serial killer movies and like seeing their personality examined. Plus, you get boobs. Really hot and sexy boobs. Just saying.",Taking Lives

I'm not a big Ethan Hawke fan, so I was really surprised that I liked him in this as much as I did.  Had enough 'thriller' moments to make it work. The audience I was in gasped, jumped, screamed and laughed a lot.  So...it wasn't just me.  I'm learning not to listen to the reviews...or the number of stars a movie is rated. Everyone's opinion is different.  This movie didn't rate all that well with critics. Well, I'm not a critic...just a movie goer, and I loved it.  Well worth the money and time spent to see it.

They have awesome chemistry between them and you sense a strong sexual tension between them that begin within the first few minutes of their first encounter.

I will not give it way but the commercials and the fact that it has been done before kind of killed the suspends the movie tries to have. Angelina Jolie is a good actress but she needs to read her roles more carefully, and this movie is not one for her to remember. E than Hawke is fine as well, but I could not get into his character, and Kiefer Sutherland does a throwaway role that adds nothing to the movie at all. Olivler Martinez has the worst part in the entire movie, and he comes across as unlikable which is hard because it more of a script problem than a personality one. The movie feels like it was just put out there with any thought, and the whole dark scenery just makes the viewer depress with what they are seeing.

221,savestheday821,Um. It was alright.,7,17 August 2004,"Overview: Angelina Jolie stars as a hardass special agent investigating a string of murders in which the killer steals the identity of his victims. Hence the title. While it offers a few jumps (mostly arms popping out and grabbing you, much as could be found in a rural haunted house), Taking Lives is essentially formulatic and predictable. I watched it with two friends who are self-proclaimed wusses and even they only flinched twice.What's Good: The performances. Although the only Angelina Jolie film I actually liked was Girl, Interrupted, she's a decent actress who did well as usual. Martinez is cute as a French-Candadian FBI (or something similar) agent working on the case. And sue me -- because I seem to be the only person left on this earth that still likes Ethan Hawke. And despite how sure I was that I knew the 'twists' the entire time (I turned out to be right, mind you), there were a few moments of doubt. I'm usually pretty cynical of suspense and up to speed on things (Secret Window? Pshaw. I totally saw that coming.), there were a few red herrings I fell for. What's Bad: Did I mention how predictable it is? Also, the ending is totally unrealistic. There's a lot of holes in the 'plan', but I won't go into it for fear of spoilers.See It If: You like Angelina Jolie. You like Angelina Jolie naked. (i.e. you are male.)

If the intent was for this to be a who-done-it they failed miserably, if it was just an excuse to get Angelina Jolie half naked they succeeded. Even the ending was tired old stuff. Keifer Sutherland's character didn't fool anybody for a minute. I still don't get it why you have to put 10 lines in the review section, especially for movies a person just can't come up with enough things to say about it. I'm glad I never went to the theater to see this movie. My son bought the DVD for 9.99 and I don't think it's worth that. It should be in the 5.00 bins.",Taking Lives

I put the DVD on, in the process of putting on my thinking cap to figure out who the murderer is, but wait, I know who the killer is in the first 15 minutes. So, as the movie drags on, I hope maybe Kiefer will bring some light into the film, but he appears for maybe 2 minutes of the film. I'll give the film credit, the beginning is good, but the rest is no fun, because anyone with half a brain can see the killer right before their eyes in the first 1/2 hour of the film.

Like every other Hollywood thriller, that's all this one has to offer.Well, to be honest that's not all true - Ethan Hawke's nervousness rubbed on to me. He plays his part well. Other than that the acting is not bad, but nothing to mention really. Hawke's acting saves this film. He's the only reason I gave it more than a 5/10. I gave it seven.

Angelina Jolie's character is self-assured and dominant but the performance is too routine and obvious to be anything above average.
Ethan Hawke plays his part convincingly (unlike the police officers) and can take all the credit for making this film passable.

228,Jelliusbeanus,Pee Yew! (Spoiler Alert),2,3 January 2005,"The movie seemed to start off holding some promise, but after seeing the interrogation room scene, I had only one hope - that Ethan Hawkes character (Costa) was NOT the bad-guy; otherwise the whole movie would be trite. Turns out my hopes were going to be dashed. This is a prime example of how not to construct a thriller plot. When you start piling on the improbable events, eventually the spell of the film becomes broken and you are left just waiting for it to be over. I could drive a semi through the plot holes in this one. One of the worst offending elements of this film would have to be one of the most basic - Motivation. What is the purpose for the character to return to Montreal? The movie implies that the character kills people, and assumes their lives for several years, before moving on. Obviously, he hasn't been found out about yet - why try to set up Keifer Sutherlands character as the fall-guy? What if the special investigator had been a guy? What if Costa hadn't been left alone with the other inspector? What if Costa had been stopped before crashing the car on the bridge, with the corpse next to him with the fatal stomach wound? The only way his character could have succeeded to that point would have been if he could somehow predict the unpredictable, and that is why this film is so bad. The only thrills and chills here are trying to guess what idiotic event will be tacked on meaninglessly next - the end result was NEVER in question. If you want to see a film of this type done right, see Seven. I wouldn't waste your time on this one - here is two hours of my life I won't get back.",Taking Lives

I thought it too easy to figure out the twists and the who-dunnit in this film. The twists simply didn't seem twisted enough and some hints are just dead giveaways. The ""jump-sequences"" were very good, and Angelina Jolie is the perfect pick for a slightly odd profiler - a character that seems close to her real-life persona.

232,niall-14,"Good, but not Great",6,18 April 2004,"We'd seen the shorts for 'Taking Lives' back in March and decided that because Kiefer Sutherland was in it, an actor we both like, then it should be a good flick. Well, it was a good flick. Not a brilliant flick or one that would leave you wondering the why/what/when or where of the plot after you leave the cinema, but a good story nonetheless. Kiefer Sutherland didn't play a very big part at all, in fact, I'd probably have to say his part was marginally better than a cameo. Ethan Hawke, as the mercurial character, James Costa and Angelina Jolie, playing FBI special agent Illeana Scott, play the main character parts, and except for the end-play at the movies' end, Ethan Hawke plays his part well. Angelina Jolie, at least from this males perspective, suffers from the 'Lara Croft' syndrome, in that I kept trying to judge just how big, or small, her tits really were. I thought she played her part well, but missed a certain element of what I was expecting from her character, something I can't quite nail down. Maybe it has something to do with a quick comparison between her character and that of special agent Clarisse Starling, played by Jodie Foster in 'Silence of the Lambs', which I found myself performing about half-way through the movie. Unfair I know, but there you have it.Overall, the story was a good one and well played out by all concerned. It's a pity it was situated in French-speaking Canada, as, even though like most English speakers, I find the French accent smooth and alluring, when you're trying to understand important statements in a mystery murder thriller, being spoken by a Frenchman, it's bloody annoying to have to concentrate so damn hard on what's being said and missing the rest of the action in the scene.

235,skip_intro,Pretty dreadful,3,4 November 2004,"I usually research films before I rent them - so how the heck this one slipped through the net I'll never know.Funnily enough, the film I watched the evening before was 'Adaptation' with Nicolas Cage (recommended - I even bought the DVD). One of Adaptaton's themes dealt with how to write a screenplay without resorting to the usual Hollywood clichés and implausible plot lines. The Screenwriter Jon Bokenkamp and Director D.J. Caruso should, perhaps, have watched 'Adaptation' before putting pen to paper or exposing expensive film to light.The Director, D.J Caruso, hails predominantly from the land of T.V. (The Shield, Smallville, Dark Angel) and I think this shows in his work here - he romps from scene to scene like a rambunctious puppy. When Caruso feels as though the audience might be getting a little bored a sudden shock is delivered (remember Jaws; the head appearing in the boat? that sort of thing) or a car chase ensues; ending, of course, in the obligatory humungous explosion (how much petrol do these motorist fill their tanks with anyway?). The so called 'twist' is obvious to anyone familiar with this genre of film so don't second guess yourself - you will probably right first time.Don't be conned into letting the casting of Kiefer Sutherland sell this film to you. He is woefully underused and appears for for such a short a time and says so little that just about any actor could have played the part. Ethan Hawk, in my opinion, has yet to choose a decent film in which to display his apparent talents. Training day was a good film but Denzil Washington stole all of what little thunder Hawk possessed.Angelina Jolie would remain trapped in the metaphorical paper bag if her only method of escaped was to act her way out of it and the remainder of the cast were made up of a bunch of French Canadian actors of whom I heard nothing previously (apart from Tchéky Karyo - The Core (tripe)) and will probably here little of in the future.All-in-all this film is too dumb to be interesting to fans of the serial killer genre and too needlessly convoluted to simply sit back, disengage brain and watch.Opinions are like bumholes - everyone has one!",Taking Lives

I enjoyed the performance of every actor, without exception, and I was absorbed from beginning to end. Far from a weak or cliché plot, I felt that the writing was the perfectly understated vehicle for a virtuoso performance by a band of talented actors -- and that, I believe, is what this truly talented band delivered. Everyone seemed real, and made me care about them. No one was boring, and every moment moved the story along. If I have any criticism here, it is one that I do not believe Hollywood wants to respond to, and that is that everyone, the cops, the mother, the pathologist, hey even the corpses, is just too unnaturally good looking. By virtue of its execution, I feel that this film touches something real, and has meaning beyond the story that it tells...more meaning than many films that tell meaningful stories.

As with all serial killer movies I was frustrated that we don't focus more on the serial killer, on his thought processes and the details of what he does, which is almost always far more interesting than a Hollywood girl's search for him (even if it is Ms. Jolie).  Murder By Numbers presented the same issue.  Ethan Hawk was good but not fantastic.

But the larger issue is, since when is almost two hours of closeups of a succession of rotting corpses, along with loving views of the anguish of people being murdered, a night of entertainment at the movies? Didn't Ethan Hawke used to be a serious actor? Didn't he play Hamlet, for God's sake? Boy, when these people's careers go down the toilet, they really hit the sludge.",Taking Lives

However, after the Unrated Director's Cut was released-I was shocked by its sheer brutality.

The second time you watch said thriller films you unveil all sorts of plot holes. The third time you watch a thriller you wonder what it is your doing watching a 'bad' movie.This is no such thriller. Rather than purposely manipulate the audience with unneeded plot twists, ""Taking Lives"" makes all the necessary twists at the necessary times. The refreshing aspect of this movie is that its more involved in 'What is going to happen to the characters next' rather than 'What'll happen next'.Having such a character based film, the actors do a superb job. Angelina Jolie plays someone more vulnerable than Lara Croft or Mrs. Smith. While Ethan Hawke has much more depth to his character then expected from him.The only thing that bothered me in this movie was the Canadian setting of Montreal. Being Canadian, and having visited Quebec more times then I can count, the first viewing of 'Montreal' is the most famous picture of Quebec City. For Americans it would be like zooming in on the Statue of Liberty and the text reading ""Miami, Florida"".Then again it's nice to see a film shot in Canada.",Taking Lives

He plays his characters well and convincingly. Angelina Jolie impresses with her sex-appeal and with good but not excellent acting. The others were average in my opinion! The tension is always on the same (average) level. The story isn't that bad, but I think you can show it in a better and more exciting way. The movie starts promising but as I wrote before drop to a lower level. A sign that a movie is boring is, if you look at your watch and honestly I did it 2-3 times, when I watched that movie!

There are several scenes of her naked which is a partial bonus, although these scenes are pointless and are obviously added for the sake of it. She gives the impression of a really strong and competent WPC although it completely falls apart after 2 minutes. Ethan Hawke is really crap in this film - he is not a convincing serial killer and it is obvious from the beginning that he is the one. This is Kiefer Sufferlands worst role ever- and he's only in it for 30 seconds for the simply reason as to give another suspect for the crimes, when its clear that Hawke dunnit. Oliver Martinez is another Turkey, I could n't understand a word he said throughout the film, but did like the bit where he hits Angelina - believe me she deserves it for being such a cretin.I did not pay for this film I downloaded it, yet I still wish I hadn't wasted 15p on a blank DVDr or my time.

While watching the movie, I had always felt this sense of intrigue that kept me interested.I, like many others, discovered the twist from the very beginning. The fact that Hawke's character was not revealed right away allowed people to keep guessing, or at least continue to doubt themselves. Did it ever occur to anyone that it was purposefully done to make the obvious seem less obvious? I thought scenes such as the ""official"" plot twist, where it is laid out for the audience were well done, in both acting and suspense.However, note that I am not a picky person when it comes to enjoying movies. I enjoy movies that continue to keep me on my toes, which this did. It has been compared to movies such as Seven and other such things, saying it's nothing like it, and it's garbage in comparison.

Of particular note, Ethan Hawke's acting was extremely well done.  Kiefer Sutherland is good as always.  However, it had a very banal plot, and the last 25 minutes were *painfully* long and contrived.  Angelina Jolie's character was built up as a human with almost supernatural abilities and senses.

It's one thing to leave a subplot open-ended, thus creating some lingering suspense.

The plot is OK but has some holes that are only there to justify the nudity ( is that a bad thing i hear you ask LOL). I'm not sure if the overall effect of the film is spoilt by the violence being over done but in my opinion the film was better without it.

You develop a certain connection with the police officer that Angelina Jolie portraits and root for her start to finish.

The plot had numerous holes and wasn't entirely comprehendable at times.  I had figured out the ending to this movie in the first 10 minutes.  I was also bothered by several all too obvious 'coincidences' to several great thrillers from the past.  If you are a fan of ""Seven"" or any of the Hannibal Lector series, don't bother with this movie; you will only be angry at wasting the money.  The actors are very talented but seemed to be on auto-pilot in this flick.  The direction had some high and original points but they get overshadowed by the poor plot and scene structure.

After the night, the Special Agent finds out that the real murderer was no one else but the witness she had investigated. Unfortunately, the murderer escapes and goes to find other victims. The FBI Agent works undercover to find the murderer. She hides under the pretext that she has a baby from the psycho. The psycho comes finally at her home and tries to kill the fake baby and gets caught after a long fight between the Special Agent and him.The story is truly a masterpiece as the action is very well planned and the actors have a very good planned scenario.

273,Gristryne,Entertainingly predictable,3,12 April 2009,"I had enough of this one after the first teen minutes or so. The only reason I kept watching was because of my girlfriend, who was so fascinated about how bad the movie was, that she wouldn't allow me to give it up. And considering the potential of the story (which is actually quite good but gets ruined by a bad script), star actors, beautiful shooting locations and the presumable huge budget that comes with this kind of film, it really goes beyond my comprehension how one can fail so fatally as Caruso does here. Angelina Jolie does a good performance, but it does not even remotely weigh up for all the bad actors in this movie. One thing about her though, that kept me irritated throughout the whole movie, was that she wore so great makeup and stylish clothes that it reminded me more of a photo model than an agent of the FBI. I know that it's a common phenomena, especially for American films, that actors are so styled that it looks unrealistic. I'm European so maybe I have a harder time coping with this than does an American audience but seriously, this is too much. Ethan Hawke's character is similar to the one he plays in Great expectations, but this one is much less complex and Hawke gives an impression of being totally uninspired (which is understandable). This film is extremely bad and predictable. BUT, as is sometimes the case, that doesn't necessarily equal a wasted experience. See, this movie is bad more in a comic than boring way. I highly recommend it if you want to test your skills about bad serial killer movies and of knowing what will happen next. Because of that reason only, I give it 3/10.",Taking Lives

There is some gore but just shown briefly in scenes so it's not overwhelming.  Anticipation is through out the movie.  It makes your mind work out details to come to conclusions on who this person may really be. Agent Scott is a little creepy too.  You need to try and figure out who she is and what she is all about.

It took place in Canada probably because it was cheaper to shoot there, and the whole cheap subplot involving the love story feels tack on in order to move the dumb plot along to its very dumb end. Angelina Jolie is a great actress who should start looking more carefully at the scripts coming her way because this one was horrible. Ethan Hawke is another fine actor who should start looking at his scripts more carefully as well, and should gain some weight because he looked too skinny for his own good.

Indeed, a friend of mine who supplied the ticket had told me he read a favorable review that likened the movie to another thriller -- ""Silence of the Lambs.""

Perhaps, then, it was with expectations too high that I went in to see `Taking Lives,' but I have to testify having since watched it: DO NOT waste the two hours of your life on this tripe. For starters, the premise is about as believable as ""Face Off,"" and the acting by the movie's major stars is nothing that could be described as ""break through."" Throughout the entire movie I felt like Ethan and co. were just going through the motions (I will state for the record that I've never been particularly impressed by Angelina Jolie). Also, for being a ""thriller,"" the movie had way too many moments where the audience laughed instead of shrieked (trust me, these were not inserted at moments that were intended so for the purpose of relieving tension). Instead, there are too many ridiculous holes punched through the believability of the film, and accordingly, it loses credibility quickly, the ultimate coupe de grace being how contrived and obvious the final twists are (I won't spoil it for those still intent on going to see it). A friend of mine once remarked that the Ashley-Judd/Morgan Freeman thriller franchises were getting out of hand (he referred to them as ""Along Came Kiss the Girls""), and obviously Hollywood continues to churn out such garbage, only now without Freeman and Samuel Jackson on board instead. To wit, ""Taking Lives"" might as well be added to the collection of such worthless movies like those and that other awful Jolie-thriller, ""The Bone Collector.""

After sitting though it, I realized what a mistake it was. It was a sad and pathetic movie. One of the big problems I have is the predictability of the movie. I will try not to reveal any of them, but let's just say I had the entire movie figured out near the beginning of the movie. Also, the characters were very weakly written and the audience, including myself, lost interest in them quickly. Jolie's character started off like it may be interesting, but went in a totally opposite direction to the point where if she dies, I wouldn't care. Even the hopefuls, Hawke, Sutherland and Martinez, gave poor performances with the material given to them. The writer and director were going all different directions, and added pointless and predictable love scenes with Jolie and Hawke that were fast forwarded due to lack of interest.To all who haven't seen it, I say avoid this at all costs.

I am a Norwegian girl who loved Paul Franklin Dano! I like the end very good, when Illeana Scott (Angelina Jolie) is kill Martin Asher (Ethan Hawke). I hope that some of you can read this and answer.Iris. Who loved Paul Franklin Dano! And of course taking Lives. I hope that I can meet Paul Franklin Dano sometime. You have to director more good films DJ Caruso!",Taking Lives
290,hondy4,Confusing and unsatisfying.,2,15 July 2005,"What a confusing mess of a film. Not recommended.Angelina Jolie is horrendously miscast as an FBI expert who is helping in a Canadian serial killer hunt. The director has tried to add interest to her superficial and unemotional character by sweeping shots of her eating/bathing alone, with nothing but pictures of victims to keep her company. We do not find out why she does this.The ""psychology"" as to the killer's final motive is just as weak. No explanation is offered (as far as I recall; I may have dozed off) as to why the victims were mutilated. And when he's holed up in his mother's house - does his mother know? I chuckled at the Jolie-finds-secret-room-by-breeze-rustling-plant plot, which was lazily stolen from countless other films, e.g. Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.The romance scene with Jolie is laughable; it's about as sexy as a piece of damp cardboard, offering only to present the viewer with repeated images of her huge lips. These lips quickly become annoying during the progress of the film; I frequently found myself wondering whether her lips were designed to fit in 16:9 widescreen.Kiefer Sutherland is utterly utterly wasted. He makes a comically brief appearance, adding nothing to the plot whatsoever. And in the scenes he does make an appearance, he can only be described as looking bored.Oh - and the denouement. That has to be seen to be believed. Can anyone *begin* to explain this to me? Why, for heaven's sake, does Jolie take to living in a remote farmhouse, faking a pregnancy for 8 months, on the assumption that Hawke may be spying on her? Why not issue a manhunt for Hawke - let's face it, they have a pretty good indication of what he looks like.",Taking Lives
291,walkerelizabeth-34380,Tedious and derivative,1,17 October 2021,There are much better thrillers than this. Full of plot holes and mediocre acting (with the exception of Ethan Hawke who is a very interesting actor even in this silly film). Who ever thought the cartoonish Jolie is an actress must have confused constipated pouting with acting mysterious. Mister Sutherland has absolutely zero to do in this film. Better watch paint dry than this.,Taking Lives
292,peppydoggy,Taking Lives (-10 out of 10),1,8 April 2006,"This Angelina Jolie film was not worth the rental fee! I was not very impressed by this movie, even if I saw Jolie's chest. It was full of errors from the start, and I was bored halfway through the movie. It shuffled around like a drunk in the dark, and I thought the dialogue was pretty uninteresting. Gena Rowlands acting sounded pretty lame, in the few times we saw her. When I saw the trailer for the movie it did not look that bad, too bad it did not live up to the hype. It fell from the radar screen pretty fast, I wonder why? On Angelina's resume, I know this movie is not at the top of the list. Whatever they spent to make this clunker, sure was not worth the price, this is one movie they can send to the scrapyard! I sure wish I could put a minus 10 on this movie, as it sure is a waste of a good plastic to make it into a DVD! Angie must have needed the money, to be in this movie. My only wish, is that they bury this sad case of a movie. Angelina was a great actress, stuck in a bad movie.My comment to Angelina Jolie, read the script first!!!!!!!",Taking Lives
293,DiMo-28,Promising movie left me disappointed,6,20 January 2006,"After reviewing the cast and reading the summary, I thought that I was in for a good movie. The movie starts off well enough and draws you into the story. The plot moves well until about the midpoint of the film and then it starts slipping. You are left wondering why characters come to the conclusions that they come to and why they act they way that they do. The viewer is left to fill in too many blanks. This may be the only way the writer can keep the surprise at the end.The ""surprise"" may or may not be a surprise by the end of the movie for most viewers, but the viewer can certainly guess what is going when the movie doesn't end when the supposed serial killer is killed. The movie doesn't even feel close to being over. This kills any sort of surprise.The best part of the movie is a scene in which Illeana (Jolie) is searching the house basement of the serial killer's mother. She lies on a cot and the killer rips through the cot with his arms to grab her. Quite scary and unexpected.The worst part for me is the reasons given for why the serial killer became a killer. They don't seem harsh enough trauma to create a psycho serial killer. Again we are left to fill in some blanks.As for the acting, Ethan Hawke and Kiefer Sutherland do a great job with what they were given. Gena Rowlands is very convincing as the serial killer's mother and being somewhat spooky herself. Angelina Jolie gives an inconsistent performance, doing a nice job in some scenes and bad in others. In fact, Jolie kills the ""2nd surprise"" at the very end of the movie by her lackluster performance in the scene. The viewer can quickly figure out what is going on and is not surprised at all at the ending.There is enough here to make it worth watching. It isn't a bad movie, but it left me wanting more and feeling like I had missed something at the end.",Taking Lives
