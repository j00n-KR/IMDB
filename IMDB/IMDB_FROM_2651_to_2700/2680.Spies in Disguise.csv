0,SnoopyStyle,actually good,7,9 March 2020,Nerdy Walter Beckett (Tom Holland) made gadgets for his hero cop mom until her sacrifice. He spends his time making non-lethal gadgets for a secret spy organization. Super spy Lance Sterling (Will Smith) is angered by one of his devices and fires him on the spot. Lance wants things that go boom. Then Lance is accused of stealing and goes on the run to clear his name. The only person who can help is the nerd he fired earlier. Walter has a new secret potion and Lance takes it before being told that it would turn him into a pigeon.I was expecting worst but this is actually fun. Holland and Smith are a good duo. Smith is being a cartoon Smith which is the normal Smith. Holland is a nerdy kid. They're great together. Solid animation is from Blue Sky. I'm happy that the other birds don't talk but Lance can hear them. The last act does go on a bit too long. It's biggest mistake is probably the forgettable title. I'm looking straight at it and I still don't remember it. Call it James Bird. This is good for adults and probably fun for the kids.,Spies in Disguise
1,Horst_In_Translation,Nowhere near the best animated films of the year,4,21 January 2020,"""Spies in Disguise"" (or also ""Spies Undercover"") is an American animated movie mostly in the English language from 2019 that runs for approximately 100 minutes. First of all, I would like to say that I don't like the title at all and it is pretty uncreative because a spy is by definition in disguise. Never a good sign if a film already lacks attention to detail in the title only to create a mediocre rhyme. Many directors and writers worked on this film and I will spare you all the names because you can check out the list yourself if you care, but the one thing that unites almost all of them is that they are not super experienced or prolific. For example, the two directors have worked consistently in less influential positions, but for one of them it was the first directorial effort ever and for the other also only the second after a television short film. But the ones who are maybe more to blame than the directors here are the writers because the story never really peaks on a level that had me on the edge of my seat. So definitely a case of too many cooks spoiling the broth and they should have realized that they need to fix the film first before releasing it. Oh well, it is not all bad admittedly, so maybe it sounds a bit harsh, but I believe the weak and forgettable here is more frequent than the good-quality moments. By the way this film was inspired by another animated short film from actually many years ago, in which a secret agent is transformed into a pigeon. At least they gave credit to the writer of this one, maybe also to avoid legal action. Anyway, now let me talk a bit about this film here: It achieved two nominations at the Annies (animation Oscars) and another for its sound, so it is probably among the 20 most known animated features from 2019 you could say. But to me, it would probably only be somwhere around top50. It was not a particularly good watch. The first thing I actually thought when seeing the agent was that ""oh my he looks totally like Will Smith"", so I was not surprised at all to read that Smith lent him his voice. They clearly animated the character knowing Smith would be the voice actor. I certainly liked Smith more back in the day than today, also because of these questionable comments about how the Academy treats African-American actors, but let's not get any further into that. I cannot really say how good his voice acting here was anyway because I watched the German dub and that was fine. What I really liked from early on was that the film included really many James Bond references and some were fairly funny. Already the film's intro felt like basically an animated spoof version (because of the pigeons) of a real Bond intro. Of course also the fact that the antagonist has this artificial hand seemed like a trademark from a Bond film. Or when early on the good guy enters the room and we see so many gadgets being tested that very moment. It really felt like something between Bond and Q, for example the hat that is partially a razer blade in disguise (now there the words ""in disguise"" are appropriate). There is one reference even in which the more likable central character says ""Bond"" specifically and Smith's character even mocks Bond a little bit when he says that the great thing about being the world's most successful spy is that everybody knows your name. Well, remember how Bond keeps introducing himself with his trademark words? So I guess Lance is more (in)famous. By the way thinking of it, there is not one moment when he or the other guy are actually spies, so yeah that makes the title even worse than I perceived it earlier in my review (which was also already pretty bad).Another problem this film has is that it loses itself so many times in exaggerated action sequences that are explosions and nothing else basically and these also go for way too long. This was especially disappointing because I felt the film did not even need to do that because on other occasions away from these animated special effects, it was at least partially a good watch and had some creative inclusions. So maybe they simply should have kept it at 85 minutes and gone with a little more substance over style. Then again, some of the kids in my showing liked these, so maybe difficult for me to say and it is just subjective perception. The one moment I myself liked the most was really briefly before he is turned into a pigeon when the young guy says something like it is going to happen in 45 seconds and we see Smith's character's motionless face for like 30 seconds before he decides he has enough of this nonsense. That was genuinely funny and I wish there could have been more scenes like this. Really simple, still very effective. Apart from that, I was not sure if really any of the other characters were interesting enough here. The female agent (voiced by Rashida Jones from Parks and Recreation and most recently also a successful high-profile writer) was okay early on, but got more and more forgettable the longer the film went. I thought initially that she could end up as a love interest for the super agent, then maybe that she could become a love interest for the scientist, but neither happened eventually and that was the right decision. No love story needed here. Then again, I also felt that for example the female pigeon, who was clearly crushing on the agent (when he was a pigeon) could maybe (accidentally) get turned into a human and be super hot or so that Smith's character falls for her immediately. Did not happen either. But who knows, maybe some of these ideas actually come into effect if they ever make a sequel. I have a feeling that this film was not the final chapter yet to these characters. By the way, the young scientist dude is voiced by Tom Holland and he has his own history of course with superhero films as you probably all saw in the last few years. Let's not drift away now, but I actually want to say a bit more about his character here and while I like his looks, there were many aspects to his story (or I should say stories) that really did not work out well at all. The sob story with his mother was totally for the sake of it and so ineffective. Pixar would have turned this into emotional gold I am sure, but it just added nothing. What also added almost nothing for me was the idea about him being called a fool by everybody and how it impacted him emotionally. The film also came short there. And finally, why does he want the agent to stay in pigeon mode? That made no sense. In general, the two did not have the chemistry I would have liked them to have in order to carry this film to a level where I would call it a satisfying watch.So yeah, I am the last person who thinks/says that animated films are for kids only, but this one here is maybe really more for young audiences than for grown-ups, even if there are okay moments that I liked and laughed at. Or at least smiled at. Funnily these moments were nothing the kids laughed at. And then there were moments that nobody laughed at like ""50 Shades of Yay"". Come on, did you really go there? This is one of several moments that was not even funny from a cringe perspective, just a joke gone wrong completely and there were many of these. Visually, however we should not take for granted that it was a decent watch, only because this is almost always true when it comes to animated films these days. There are not many that feel flawed from the visual/technical perspective. There was one moment though that I really liked especially. Or two moments actually and that was when they were heading for the bad guy's hideout and we see these gigantic super rough waves there. This looked amazing, I cannot say otherwise. But even there when I was impressed for a moment, it was back to normal quickly afterwards because the film came short right away again from other perspectives. I am talking about these drones. Now when we see them, all thousand, show up behind the agent, this could have been a truly spectacularly hopeless moment for being outnumbered, but it feels so rushed and ineffective. Actually I hated almost all about the drones. We find out he stole this one, so where do the others come from. There are no reports about others being stolen, so he built them himself? That is not even possible because I mean he has no team or so. He is a solo fighter like the agent. By the way, this part about him becoming a team/duo player towards the end did not feel too convincing at all and this is a negative deal-breaker because it is maybe the biggest character development idea this film has. But back to the drones: There is also the scene when we have two of them go for the kid in the sea and they shoot him and he disappears off the radar, but of course we all know he is not dead. Which makes me question the early comment about the missing drone how it is really gritty and won't surrender before the target is dead. Speaking of death, I liked how the film was not scared to make references about characters dying and on one occasion, there is even one character pushed down into the abyss (not a bad guy) and he is probably dead. Kids these days can deal with stuff like that and that was a good decision regardless of the main antagonist being killed in the end or not. Let me add there that this decision to let him live was probably also directly linked to the idea of the scientist being anti-violence and anti-bloodshed, another plot reference that did not work out half as well as it could have. So much from this film feels just incredibly rushed. Overall, this is why I give it a thumbs-down. The comedy also was not high-quality enough frequently enough and some running gags like the glitter with cat pics did get old really quickly honestly. But yeah I don't know. Maybe people with a completely different approach to comedy and what they find funny will have a different perception. I still give it a thumbs-down overall, glad it never had a chance with the Oscars.",Spies in Disguise

3,kosmasp,This guys ... disguise?,8,15 July 2021,"Now I only saw the poster for this and never watched a trailer. And boy was I in for a surprise, that I reckon most are already aware of. But the movie lays it out from the start, when we see the inventor first and then the spy who has no love for doves.Well what an unlikely pairing you say? Yes, but also one of the best one can imagine too. And one that sparks and gives us almost endless humor too. Certain things don't make sense, others may be offensive to a certain degree or may be viewed so - but overall it is all done with a pure heart and for the purpose that the viewers will have fun watching this ... there are some themes that are more adult than others ... but kids will have fun no doubt.",Spies in Disguise
4,paul_haakonsen,Quite a nice surprise...,6,4 March 2020,"I have to admit that I wasn't really expecting much from the 2019 animated movie ""Spies In Disguise"", but I got to sit down and watch it with the family nonetheless.And now having seen it, I must say that ""Spies In Disguise"" was quite a nice surprise of a movie. It was as enjoyable and entertaining as it was nicely made and nicely animated. It had a good story and even better characters. And the story had enough action and comedy to keep me entertained through the entire course of the movie.As an animated movie, having a proper voice cast ensemble is a make or break, and they definitely had a good cast for this movie, and that must certainly added to the overall enjoyment of the story.Now, the art style was a bit odd for me, given the elongated heads and very long legs, but you quickly come to accept it and take it for as is.I mentioned the movie had good characters, but it was the animated birds that fully and wholeheartedly stole the spotlight. The bird sidekicks were so funny that you can watch the movie for them alone.If you enjoy animated movies, then you definitely should take the time to sit down and watch ""Spies In Disguise"". I am rating it a solid six out of ten stars. It offers something for young and adults alike.",Spies in Disguise

7,Pjtaylor-96-138044,What if James Bond... was a pigeon?,5,29 December 2019,"'Spies in Disguise (2019)' is totally unremarkable, really. It does exactly what its marketing promises; it delivers a beautifully rendered, high-flying adventure in under two hours. That's all it does though, settling for 'fine' in all of its aspects. I mean, it isn't bad. Perhaps those in its target audience will actually enjoy it, unfazed by its generic story. For me, however, it's absolutely uninspiring. It's constantly uninteresting, even if it's never exactly boring, and its cartoony slapstick doesn't make up for its by-the-numbers characters and plot. It also has an odd tone and overt, forced-in messaging - with a side of surprisingly crude humour, to boot. When it comes down to it, it just isn't particularly entertaining. It's fine, but that's about it. 5/10",Spies in Disguise
8,westsideschl,Wry Humor,8,12 April 2020,"Animation quality was generic, rather plain w/out much detail, almost 2-D, but it didn't distract from the storyline & actually fit in a stylistic sort of way.

13,leonblackwood,Has the potential to make a decent franchise! 5/10,5,20 August 2020,"Review:
This movie could have been in the same league as the Incredibles, but it seemed to go downhill as soon as Lance Sterling (Will Smith) became a pigeon. As the other pigeons didn't talk, which I think they should have because they stole the limelight, we had to put up with Walter's (Tom Holland) over-excited squeaky voice for most of the time, which became tedious after a while. There was also not much depth to the other characters, especially the main villain Killian (Ben Mendelsohn) who seemed to pop in and out of the film, and the ending was a big letdown. On the plus side, it's non-stop action from the beginning to the end, and there are a couple of amusing moments that were cleverly written, but the makers didn't take full advantage of having Will Smith in the lead. I did enjoy the funky soundtrack, supplied by Mark Ronson, and the animation, which looked very much like the Incredibles, was impressive but it didn't reach it's expectations. It's still a watchable film, which has the potential to make a decent franchise but it needs some younger, and more hip writers to push it out of the safe zone. Watchable!Round-Up:
This is the first major release for directors Nick Bruno and Troy Quane, who must have thought they won the lottery when they managed to get such a good cast, along with Mark Ronson in the sound department, for there movie debut. It seems like all of the animators are following the movie playbook when it comes to films in the genre because nothing has blown people's mind for a good couple of years. With huge budgets and the amount of time it takes to make animation movies, you would think that the studios would try and come up with something original. With that aside, this is still a watchable film, which is fun for the whole family, but it won't go down as an all-time classic.Budget: $100million
Worldwide Gross: $172millionGenre: Animation, Action, Adventure, Comedy, Family, Sci-Fi

14,SAMTHEBESTEST,A PACY RIDE WITH VISUAL EXTRAVANZA AND ENOUGH CONTENT !,6,24 December 2019,"SPIES IN DISGUISE REVIEW :-We have seen lots of spy films, most of them were thrilling, some were engaging, some had comedy touch and big turnaround moments in the Climax. But how many spy films have we seen in Animation that had comedy, engagement, thrill and enough dose of entertainment? Here comes, Spies in Disguise (2019) an American computer-animated spy comedy film produced by Blue Sky Studios and distributed by 20th Century Fox. Loosely based on Lucas Martell's 2009 animated short 'Pigeon Impossible'. Being disguise from it's title the film has disgusting theme but you have everything to enjoy because the crafting of the subject is done very smartly.Super spy Lance Sterling (Will Smith) and scientist Walter Beckett (Tom Holland) are almost exact opposites. Lance is smooth, suave and debonair. Walter is not. But what Walter lacks in social skills he makes up for in smarts and invention, creating the awesome gadgets Lance uses on his epic missions. But when events take an unexpected turn, Walter and Lance suddenly have to rely on each other in a whole new way. And if this odd couple can't learn to work as a team, the whole world is in peril. These 2 battle out a smart villain with thier tricks and their unity is the main course behind the success.As we know it is an Animated flick the acting scenerio cannot be reviewed but the voice cast is amazing. Will Smith, Tom Holland are brilliant alongside Rashida Jones, Ben Mendelsohn, Reba McEntire, Rachel Brosnahan, Karen Gillan, DJ Khaled and Masi Oka in supporting roles. Writing and the screenplay is highly engaging and believe it or not you don't even realise when those 100 minutes are gone. It is a pacy ride with visual extravanza and enough content. Dialogues are quite decent though, some of them are funny. Watching this film in 3D wasn't much impressive even though VFX are splendid as mentioned before.Spies in Disguise has a good story crafted with pacy screenplay and spectacular visuals. Director Troy Quane and Nick Bruno had an ordinary writing to showcase on screen but somehow they make it up as extraordinary stuff. They surely deserve a few words of appreciation for the execution, overall crafting and thier directorial skills. The attempt is praiseworthy, no doubts, but honestly the film and the content looked unnecessary. Anyways, it doesn't disappoint in that way if you are just looking for some entertainment in this Christmas Holidays especially if you are not an adult audience. Kids are gonna enjoy this fun ride for sure and either Sterling or Walter is going to find a place in their fantasy world.RATING- 6/10*",Spies in Disguise

Also shout out to Ben Mendelssohn as the villain robot hand. Perfect for a 007 inspired feature. Also, very cool hearing DJ Khalid's voice coming out of a character called sound.

This is an animated spy comedy that is pretty good-if you are into animated spy comedies. Will plays the world's greatest secret agent-not too secret, he sort of likes the fame-that has to go on the run from his agency after Ben, the bad guy, frames Will as a bad guy. Will has to prove his innocence and catch Ben, saving the world once again. Reba is Will's boss and Tom is the nerdy tech guy that partners up with Will to save the day. A little hiccup in Tom's science results in Will turning into a pigeon so he now has a handicap to work with in his pursuit of Ben. There is a lot of action and humor and it is based on Lucas Martell's 2009 computer animated short film called 'Pigeon:Impossible'.
It's rated ""PG"" for action, violence and some rude humor and has a running time of 1 hour & 42 minutes.
I liked it and can see myself buying it on DVD to show my grandkids.",Spies in Disguise

I had to watch it because I'm a huge Will Smith fan & he's my favourite actor but the movie would've been amazing if it was a spy adventure but with him as that spy character in his cool human form because he looked great. Tom Holland was annoying as the weird gangly super smart nerd that works for The Agency that Sterling does & i couldn't stand him especially as he's all about being ""Nice"" all the time & there's a reason why but it's still stupid & is said right by Lance Sterling himself when he says ""EVIL DOESN'T CARE IF YOU'RE NICE"" some of the truest words ever spoken in an animated film. The world is a dark place & evil people will kill you that's a fact so being nice is ridiculous even in a kids flick!!! Teaching kids to grow up & except crap.
The animation is excellent & again wasted on a silly story about a talking PIGEON!!!
Too silly & not really funny, a few laughs but the whole pigeon thing is too silly & Tom Holland is annoying.
Two stars for me, one for Will Smith & one for the animation",Spies in Disguise
22,aidanratesmovies,"A funny, but imperfect, spy adventure",9,8 April 2020,"With gorgeous animation, and at times some truly laugh out loud moments, Spies in Disguise may not land every punch, but it certainly wins its way trying. Will Smith and Tom Holland voice as the duo we are primarily focused on throughout the film, and I thought both did a rather impressive job. The situational humor is done quite well, and it truly uses its absurd situations in the best way possible. However, Will Smith's character is not a pigeon the entire film, which is bound to be obvious, but it's quite noticeable how the tone changes in scenes where he is not a pigeon and for the most part a lot more of them fall flat. There are plenty of tropes, cliches, and formulaic plot lines, but in total, none of them doom the film completely, but make it a bit frustrating to watch when there is such an original and unique story in so many other parts of the film. As said before, the animation is gorgeous and truly one of the best animated efforts in recent years, in terms of the animation itself. The script is nothing too impressive, but the story for the most part is pretty fun, even if it has somewhat of an issue dragging certain scenes out longer than needed. The film is quite funny when it isn't trying too hard, and truly earned some laugh out loud moments, as ridiculous as they were. My favorite character in the film was Jeff, a fat pigeon that lends a hand (or rather a wing) to Will Smith's character and friends, and truly earned a laugh out of me every time he appeared on screen. In the end, Spies in Disguise is not a total success, but as uneven as it may be at times, it makes up for its flaws with some great humor and animation.

23,questl-18592,Pigeon Power!,8,13 January 2020,"There's something great about going into a movie you expect nothing of only to love it. Spies in Disguise is quirky, goofy, not-taking-itself-seriously fun. The creativity here is really exceptional, which is vital in a spy movie that's heavy on the ridiculous gadgets and science.The animation is great, perfectly fitting the tone of the movie with cartoony realism. I really appreciated the aesthetics, the way everyone is seemingly made of rubber and yet they still get hurt and bruised when hit.So, creativity is on point, it looks great, but is it fun? Oh my god, yes. I gut laughed multiple times during this, I couldn't breath a couple of times I was laughing so hard. That is such a rare occurrence for me but I loved it!The reason this isn't rated higher is Will Smith. From the very first time his character spoke I wasn't feeling it. Will Smith just can't help being Will Smith and as he's talking all I can see is him, not the character. He's just being Will Smith. As a pigeon. Which is fun but not as fun as it could have been. Everyone else is spot on. Tom Holland is an unadulterated delight but Smith just... Bugged me.Still, I loved this. I can't wait to take this home and watch it again.

But not the way you would expect as Walter turns him into a pigeon but both need to rely upon each other as Lance needs to start acting like a team player, Walter must use his brains to help Lance as they must clear the spy's and later the geek's names as both are charged with treason.
And help defeat Killian the main villain played by Ben Mendelsohn that plays slimy villains really well who uses gadgets as well but for bad, unlike Walter who uses them for good as Killian and Lance both have a history and grudge with one another.
Cute movie and really proves team work with Smith and Holland. Kids will agree.",Spies in Disguise

The Commercial SyndromeThe VERDICT:Spies in Disguise had a lot of delays and to be honest, the movie does not shatter too many things when it comes to originality or that unique energy Disney does. This does not mean the film is bad though, and in fact it's quite enjoyable. Animation wise it's clean, bringing a design that matches the fun nature of the film, with comedy and adventure around every bin. And though much of the movie is a blur, the film succeeds to expand to other audience members and get some character development going, that fits in theme with the creative approach to the spy thriller. It's true the balance to silliness does veer off at times, and the villain needs some of that time to really get the full effect, but for the most part the movie's biggest limitation is not having that Disney spark and giving too much away in the trailers. Still, this film feels like a good theater run thanks to the fun adventure and special effects, especially if you have a little ones or a group to go with. If not, then please check this out and enjoy the fun ride.My scores are:Animation/Action/Adventure: 7.5
Movie Overall: 7.0",Spies in Disguise

30,bankofmarquis,Stong chemistry between Smith and Holland,7,7 December 2020,"Blue Sky Animation Studios has often been seen as the ""poor little sister"" in the animation game - behind Disney/Pixar and Dreamworks - and is often listed as the ""Ice Age"" studio. But, if you look into their filmography, you will see a solid mark of quality throughout.This studio has delivered solid animated outings with such fare as ROBOTS, HORTON HEARS A WHO, RIO and FERDINAND (along with the myriad of ICE AGE films) and their latest feature - 2019's SPIES IN DISGUISE - is no exception. I was pleasantly surprised by the fun, action, comedy and suspense of this film and was entertained throughout.Blue Sky, of course, IS the ""poor little sister"" to the ""Big 2"" and it shows in some of their casting choices. Where I thought vocal work was being done by Tina Fey and Holly Hunter, I soon discovered that it is Rachel Brosnahan and Reba Mcintyre - not shabby at all, but not quite the ""A"" team either (it's like you are listening to the Broadway replacement actors for the Original Cast).That is probably because they spent all of their casting money on the 2 leads - Will Smith and Tom Holland - and they are TERRIFIC together. Unlike Holland's lackluster (and lack of chemistry) turn with Chris Pratt in the PIXAR film ONWARD, Holland and Smith work well together in this film and I enjoyed their interactions with each other. Of course, Will Smith is in a league of his own when it comes to charming, cocky adventure hero with raw emotions and a soul - and that is EXACTLY what his character is and it works very, very well. Add to that Holland's riff on his Spiderman Peter Parker character - a scientific genius who is socially awkward and we have a fun duo to root for throughout this film.Other outstanding voice talents in this cast include Masi Oka (who's voice would be terrific in just about ANY animation film), Rashida Jones, Karen Gillen and the always good Ben Mendelsohn as the villain.Directors Nick Bruno (in his Directorial debut) and Troy Quane (in only his 2nd Animated outing) do a professional job keeping the plot moving, the fun brewing and the plot and action scenes simple and easy to follow (an easy thing to screw up) and this makes SPIES IN DISGUISE a very fun escape for an hour and 42 minutes.Letter Grade: B+7 1/2 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Spies in Disguise

39,elicopperman,Farewell to Blue Sky Studios,6,24 May 2021,"With the animation powerhouse Blue Sky Studios now officially being terminated, there will be no more future endeavors from the creative minds that brought the Ice Age franchise, Robots, Rio, The Peanuts Movie and a planned albeit scrapped Nimona movie to the big screen. So to look back on their efforts, it's best to acknowledge their final feature film, Spies in Disguise, a spy movie that transforms a top secret agent into a pigeon. While not the brightest premise to turn into a feature film, it is fascinating to see that such a bizarre concept could attract the likes of Will Smith and Tom Holland.Now as a spy movie, the film does follow many familiar tropes and cliches, and the filmmakers are clever enough to embrace them. As the film centers around pompous famed spy Lance Sterling (Smith) and socially awkward scientific genius Walter Beckett (Holland), one can already imagine how Lance turns into a pigeon from the start. The two main leads are slight twists on the usual common leads and sidekicks common in the James Bond movies and other spy cinematic adventures, except the sidekick is given just as much attention as the spy, if not more. Despite the pigeon gimmick, that is more sidelined compared to what the movie's really about, which is Walter's passion of doing good for the world by saving lives through his tech and scientific knowledge. Even if it means having to go through horrific obstacles, like the main antagonist Killian who will stop at nothing to destroy lives, the way the film communicates its message of utilizing technology for good and evil are fascinating contrasts between the spies and the damaged.That being said, given that this flick is more comedic and aimed at a family audience, a lot of the humor relies on Lance as a pigeon and the spy technology. Usually, the movie is at its funniest when the animators play around with the technology to allow for quite a lot of shocking slapstick, thus making the timing a lot snappier and more of a contrast from the more juvenile gross out gags. Also, aside from Lance, Walter and Killian, the remaining cast range from determined yet average to general ad ons. While Marcy Kappel is quite tough and fearless in her own right, her co-heads are pretty forgettable and just spew out the obvious, and even Sterling's superior Joy Jenkins is only used for giving orders and following a scene based on the context and nothing more. It's really saying how weak some of the humans are when random cartoony pigeons and Killian's evil drones have more personality. Then again, a supporting cast like Rashida Jones, Reba McEntire, Karen Gillan, DJ Khaled and Masi Oka do save the cast from being completely dull, so no harm no foul on the actors.If there's anyone who deserves all the credit for bringing the feature to life, it would have to be the technical crew. In addition to some very colorful art direction and well staged cinematography, the animators did their best with the characters in elevating the characters through specific acting and dynamic expressions. Even though the humans are a bit more stylized than the more pseudo realistic humans Blue Sky normally crafts, they do have a lot of appeal in the designs and features to give each character their own seperate look (although it might not be a coincidence that Lance and Walter look pretty similar to their actors). As mentioned before, not only are some of the action sequences often the funnier parts in the movie, but the brisk pacing and heightened special effects raise the stakes further and further as the tension comes up. It shows how in a movie as bizarre as this, the best way to pick up the momentum is through highly tense pacing every now and then, especially when you know who your audience is.Is this movie intended to please everyone? Of course not. However, Spies in Disguise remains an enjoyably silly albeit predictably witty spy movie that has just enough heart, humor, vocal talent and colorful animation to make for a pleasant experience. In recognizing that this is the final movie from an animation studio that built an audience from their childhoods onward, it's only a matter of time before anyone knows when Blue Sky is remembered fondly for their achievements in the longer run of animation history. Until then, we'll always have charming adventures like this to reminisce over what used to be.",Spies in Disguise

41,sweidman-28016,Cute Movie With Strong Messages,7,10 January 2020,"Spies in Disguise Review:Spies in Disguise is an animated film following super spy Lance Sterling (Will Smith) and scientist Walter Beckett (Tom Holland) who are almost exact opposites. Lance is smooth, suave and debonair. Walter is a nerdy science geek. But when events take an unexpected turn, this unlikely duo is forced to team up for the ultimate mission that will require an almost impossible disguise - transforming Lance into the brave, fierce, majestic pigeon. Walter and Lance suddenly have to work as a team, or the whole world is in peril. I wasn't sure what to make of this movie from the trailer. It either could've been bad or fine. When it came out, though, I actually wanted to see it and prioritized it. It's been over a week now since I saw it so this will be brief. I was pleasantly suprised with this movie. What surprised me most is the story. The message it brought was about doing good without violence. That was a strong part for me in the movie. The story, as expected, had many predictable moments like any animated movie aimed for children. Tom Holland and Will Smith did a great job with the voice acting. Their voices were animated and fun and just fit their characters very well. I felt more connected with Holland's character, Walter. He had a back story to help us feel for him and he mainly spread the message about violence. Obviously, Walter and Lance have differing opions on violence so that where the argument comes in. The animation and character designs were cool to me. They didn't need to be super detailed and they didn't do that, but did at the same time. I don't know how to explain it but that's the best I can do. Overall, good animation. The action sequences were pretty good. They mimic the classic James Bond vibe and add some comedy to it. I thought the humor was pretty good and aimed for all audiences and not just children. Spies in Disguise isn't the best animated movie of the year, but they make a good time out of it and bring a good message with it to spread kindness. Those are the main points I'd like to share. If you want a detailed review, talk to me.My Grade: B",Spies in Disguise

46,gavinp9,Fun family pleaser,7,4 January 2020,"'Spies in Disguise' is essentially a family-friendly James Bond, with the minor twist that the spy gets turned into a pigeon! It's got plenty of action and adventure for an animated film, with Lance (Smith) the super-spy fighting the Yakuza in one of the opening scenes. He's assisted by the weird gadget guy, Walter (Holland) as they're framed by the villain, Killian (Mendelsohn - great to hear his Aussie accent), who has a robotic hand, and are chased down by Marcy (Jones) from a FBI-like agency.It's a bit like 'Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs', in that Walter is an awkward inventor of weird and wonderful gadgets, but wants to make the world a better place and make them non-lethal, rather than just guns and bombs. This obviously clashes with Lance's views, especially when he's transformed into a pigeon via gene-editing (100% impossible). Hence, Will Smith spends most of the film voicing a pigeon, which is also where much of the humour comes from.There are quite a few funny moments, especially as pigeon-Lance inadvertently befriends other pigeons. It's mostly fun and fast-paced. The main thing I didn't like is that Spider-Man spent most of 'Far From Home' fighting drones in Venice, which is essentially what Tom Holland ends up doing here. I guess they're easy to have as disposable bad guys. Cool to hear some of the voices, but the film's heart comes from the friendship and teamwork formed by Lance and Walter, as well as the positive message that we're all weird in our own way - and that's a good thing.",Spies in Disguise

PG
director: Nick Bruno and Troy Quane
starring the voices of: Tom Holland,Will Smith,Karen Gillan,Rashida Jones,Mark Ronson,Dj Khaled etcoverall rating 81/100Spies in disguise is about a secret agent who is the best in his field. But is framed for stealing a weapon that can expose all the secret agents. So he must have the help of the tech inventor who doesn't want to harm anyone in order to save the identities of all the agents and save the world. Spies in disguise was a lot of fun and got slowly better. But did suffer from some narrative and screenplay flaws. Lets talk about this more in detail.First of all the films animation and action sequences were great. The film like a large majority of these kinds of movies this year had fantastic animation that was very pleasing to the eye. With Walters tech creations being very inventive and visually pleasing. And the action sequences were surprisingly entertaining and inventive. When Lance ( Will Smith) did what he did best especially in the beginning it was entertaining. With hard hitting action scenes and inventive ways of defeating the bad guys it kept you consistently entertained as well as other aspects.Next they did some interesting things with the plot and it was surprisingly very funny.
I thought that the whole dynamic of Lance changing from a human to a pidgeon was very interesting. And i had a lot of fun with the different situations they put him in as a bird as he learned how much he needed Walter and he could be a spy much easier. So i thought this was a really fun and creative plot choice from the screenwriters and director. Because of this dynamic the film was very funny. The film went all out with his humour with jokes coming at you all the time, and for the most part they landed. With Lance finding out the functions of a pidgeon being hilarious, and Walter and his gadgets were infectiously funny as well.However i do just have to say that not all the humour landed consistently throughout the film. The humour did fall flat sometimes which left it awkward to watch in a few instances mostly involving Lance and Walter. But then they instantly made you laugh again, so the comedic tone was not consistent and it was fairly jarring and clunky in scenes when there was humour that landed and humour that didn't.Next the film had great themes and likeable characters. The film had a great message about being weird and different being a good thing which was executed in a heartwarming way. Has there been films with similar messages yes, but spies in disguise still made it seem fresh and is a great message for todays society. Also all the characters were very likeable. Lance had this cool arrogance to him that made him very entertaining to watch, and he as his friendship with Walter became better so did he. And Walter was an extremely likeable character. Having him not having many friends really made you warm to his character. As his wacky inventions were a joy to watch. Also his view on how to deal with situations involving violence was interesting.However my final two negatives that bought the film down slightly was its under-usage of Lance in human form and how generic it was. I liked Lances character and his action sequences so much. That i would of personally preferred if he stayed as a human more in the first act to get more action scenes and how he works on the job. But i understood why they didn't, but i would of set out the first act slightly differently. And the film did have a generic formula despite doing different things with the visuals and characters. It was still the whole main character being framed, having to save himself and learn to be a better person. We have seen it all before this was just done in a slightly slicker package then others.My final two positives would be the great villain and the entertaining final act. The villain was delightfully evil. And they did a great job at making him really dislikable with his killing and actions towards likeable characters was great. And his accent and half burned face just made him look really cool. And the final act was great, When it was revealed the true goal of the villain and all the characters came together you couldn't help but feel excited about what was to come. And they didn't disappoint, with surprisingly dark moments as well as Lance embracing Walters ideas they ended the film on a high.Overall spies in disguise offers a funny,well animated and excellently voice acted piece of entertainment that doesn't offer anything new to the genre but still is a lot of fun.",Spies in Disguise

I was quite surprised how decently funny it was, too. When Will Smith's character turned into a pigeon, I was sure the film would nosedive with groan-worthy comedy, but there was an ample amount of satisfying visual gags to go along with it. The spins on spy genre films were fairly clever, too, all the way down to the stylish opening credits. This is probably the most effort I've seen Blue Sky put into a film. I was charmed and entertained through a majority of it. The characters do come straight out of an assembly line with backstories and ideologies that have been explored too many times to count. The villain is especially forgettable. The film's touches on the typical messages regarding ""teamwork"" and ""good vs. evil"", but nothing that resonates uniquely. It's more a treat for eyes, but sometimes that's okay.",Spies in Disguise
53,pinkarray,It's hard being a pigeon,4,28 December 2019,"The film is essentially a rip off of Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs with a tinge of Trigun mixed in there especially through the character of Walter. From his interaction with his mother about how he's getting bullied at school to the end where he is saved by birds and even had his hair up a la Flint Lockwood once. He even has a tinge of Vash the Stampede in him, with his pretentious morals about pacifism which ends up getting him hurt at times. He lacks the depth these two characters have and even the appeal. He seems quite pretentious and won't shut his mouth so I can sympathize with Lance's annoyance with him. I mean, the idea about pacifism is a good message to send in a kids movie but it got moralistic to the point where he'd either end up getting himself hurt at points where self-defensive violence was necessary or somehow fazing villians with his kittens and glitter whereas most villains wouldn't care about anything cute when they're trying to attack their victims. The only good characters in there are the secondary characters which are the girl and her partners that I forgot the names of but they didn't even get enough screentime to have any sort of depth. All of the characters overall are either two-dimensional or one-dimensional.Which brings me to how contrived this film is from its dialogue to its story to its characters. A lot of the dialogue was unnatural and talky especially through Walter, where at some points he even breaks the show, don't tell rule. There's even a bird who I can't remember the name of who somehow eats anything he sees. The film is full of cliches, the love at first sight relationship going on between Lovey and Lance (good thing that Lance didn't fall in love with her back), the character arc of the main character being seen as an outcast before he becomes a lovable, famous person, the relationship development of Walter and Lance and so on. Even a lot of the jokes were gross-out, some were funny though. Even the pacing of the story is way too fast, characters never die or get hurt very often, they're usually saved by some sort of plot armor, which means the tension is barely there.The film had some good ideas about pacifism, being weird and working together with somebody you don't have anything in common with but fails to execute these ideas due to its uninteresting characters. Now, I would've been okay with the pacifism moral if that was part of character development where he starts off as a weak person who doesn't want to hurt a fly but then learns that using self-defensive techniques when the situation calls for it are okay even if they are violent, but there's none of that there and honestly, it would've been better and more refreshing than the character development he has. I also liked the voice acting, especially with how Tom Holland and Will Smith play off each other and most of the animation is decent except there are some cartoony looney tunes antics that like I said in my Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs review doesn't go well with a CGI animated feature film. And Walter's Flint-like character design is also a minus.I don't see how this film is doing so decently with the audience. I give it a 4.8 out of 10. While I wasn't expecting much good out of this anyway, because it had a few good ideas, it was a very disappointing film that could've been decent if the characters and jokes were more original and compelling.. It's just a stupid film that younger kids will have a good time with but anyone ten years and over would probably be better off seeing Little Women instead. This was a very mediocre animated holiday film to close the decade and year off with. Honestly, My Spy looks better and I hope that is a better version of Spies in Disguise.",Spies in Disguise

Through a mistake, Sterling is turned into a pigeon which brings unforeseen benefits his mission to clear his name from the framing. The plot itself is all right but writing team Brad Copeland and Lloyd Taylor struggles with elevating the synopsis to something else than an average archetypical hero versus villain standoff. The villain (Mendelsohn) is driven by a very classical motive, revenge, as Sterling is responsible for the death of his former mates, and because of this he will not only take on his archenemy spy but the whole organization he represents, and possibly the world. It's a very traditional spy synopsis, with common plot devices and no surprises along the way. What ""Spies in Disguise"" has down its sleeve instead, is a tremendous amount of humor and amazing comedy moments. Smith and Holland excel in delivery, and on this note the writers should have some credit. While ""Spies in Disguise"" is a movie for all ages, the humor goes beyond that of most computer animated family films, with spot-on one liners, the right amount of innuendo, and, also, some action comedy moments. ""Spies in Disguise"" is surely in need of a bit more elaborate plot, but the basic synopsis still stand out and the comedy is a step up from similar movies, leaving this bird/spy flick as a highly entertaining movie nevertheless.",Spies in Disguise

60,MovieBuff11732,One Of The Better Kids Movies That Have Came Out In A While,8,6 January 2020,"Spies In Disguise is about a spy being accused of stealing tech. He runs away from the agency to meet this kid that made him into a pigeon. They then go through many challenges to show the agency that they are good and also stop the villain.Spies In Disguise wasn't anything special. It was an enjoyable film for families. There wasn't a lot of good family films that came out around the holidays. There was Cats but does anybody really want to go see that? There was Frozen 2 but that is almost out of theaters. This was really the only kids film that families could see over the break. There was a bunch of really good films but I wouldn't recommend those for families. I came out of the theater feeling how I thought I would feel. I had a good time watching the movie. Though my little brother next to me was getting a little board. That is probably the only problem I had with it. I think kids would get a little board in the second act. Besides that I think it was a solid family film. Although it might be a little intense for younger viewers. Although the animation was fantastic. I wonder if I should stop always saying it is good because it just looked so fluid and just good. There has been many films that look like this. The voice acting was great. They had a large cast of many talented actors. Will Smith starred and Tom Holland was the Co-Star. Besides that, all of the other actors were sort of just there. Ben Mendelsohn was the villain as normal but wasn't in the movie as much as you would think. Rashida Jones was also in it but didn't do much. This film had so much talent they didn't know what to do with all of it. It wasn't a problem, it was just something I noticed. The story besides the middle act was pretty fascinating. I didn't find my self drifting away from the story really at all.Overall, Spies In Disguise was a good family film that I would recommend to families.",Spies in Disguise

The now grown up child helps his spy friend by doing creating multiple pacifist gadgets like the inflatable hug, the glitter that cause the release of serotonin, an a fluid that make bodies like jelly when thrown at them.

Direction not exactly impeccable, but with a lot of interesting ideas, especially in the ""noisy"" scenes where you usually get confused, instead here everything is crystal clear and all in detail. Excellent mixture of humor and action, also due to the charisma of the Smith-Holland couple. Bad for some important in-depth background not told, especially for the poor characterization of villain, which is merely reduced to the redundant sector of pain-revenge, but nothing not passable.

Instead we see Tom Holland's character develop more in the movie as a lab gadget creator.Tom's gadgets were pretty awesome. His goal was to be less violent and more empathetic. After all taking a life will not change things. To be clear, this review is not meant to be political. It should not go that route.We deal with violence every day, we lose love ones when it happens. Wouldn't you want to protect them at all cost. I believe that's the message the movie delivers.I believe in team work.

Backed up by a tech-wonder kid, they take on a super villain in a buddy-buddy story for children.I found the plot to be utterly banal and tedious and the techie kid borders on nauseating, with his desire to hug the world and make spy weapons that save people instead of kill them.Will Smith is an OK lead but doesn't have much to lead in the first place. The writers have forgotten to give the characters in this movie any point or purpose.There's enough fast-paced nonsense to keep kids (under 10) entertained for its medium length duration and some giggles, if you're inclinded to enjoy its slapstick parts but parents beware: this is no Incredibles or Megamind.See it if you have to.",Spies in Disguise
67,trevorwomble,Actually not bad,7,5 January 2020,"After several duds of recent years for Will Smith I got dragged along to this film expecting another tedious overblown ego effort only aimed at children this time.Surprisingly I found this film to be quite amiable. Amusing and entertaining with a half decent script that everyone seemed to enjoy. It has nods to some other films, Men in Black and Mission Impossible in particular plus Tom Hollands voice casting works well with a couple of cryptic Spider-man saga nods thrown in for good measure.All in all this was quite watchable all round and just the right length. The animation is excellent too and Will Smith gently mocks his own ego to boot. A nice antidote to the overlong, overblown and over serious films currently doing the rounds.",Spies in Disguise

This is a really great animated spy movie. The writters knew what thet were doing with the humor and some of the parts of this film. Yes, the pigeon idea was a little lacking, but it is okay on a technical level. Unlike Cars 2, Spies in Disguise has both an interesting story and a strong moral for not only kids but for all audiences too. The characters are pretty likable and the action scenes are good. Compare to Cars 2, this movie has strong and clever humor that tells us that we all can do any clever forms of comedy.

I wouldn't say it's a movie for the tiniest toddlers because it's probably too scary for them, but adults and semi-adults will have great pleasure watching this. And there are actually some quite suspense to be found as well along with a not too obvious message about friendship and that lethal violence isn't always the best solution",Spies in Disguise

75,Clank_Zoka,Now This is The Blue Sky That I Know!,8,29 December 2019,"Blue Sky is back (Now under Disney's name) with their newest animated film, it's been two years since their last film Ferdinand, which I quite enjoyed even if it wasn't great, but now they are owned by Disney, I wasn't too sure how this upcoming animated film based on a short film will make any difference since they do release some unnecessary sequels to Ice Age, but I think with this new animated film with it's all star cast, who knows?.. maybe Blue Sky has finally made something different and something new to offer?, the short film the film is based on called ""Pigeon Mission"" is pretty decent as a student project, though I have seen better short films but it's pretty decent either way, well I saw the film yesterday, which is even stranger when it was released on Boxing Day......, how random?...., anyways I saw it and.... OH, MY, GOODNESS, Blue Sky has actually made a legit pretty good film and I don't mean as in eye candy or noise or just for the sake of money, no I mean a really funny, stylish, epic, creative, new and enjoyable animated feature, but it still has a few of Blue Sky's natural cliches, so let's talk about it.Lance Sterling (Will Smith) is considered as the world's greatest spy, he has style, charm, one liners and smooth moves, he can take out the bad guys just like that!, however there is this even bigger villain named Killian (Ben Mandelsohn) who wants to kill every agent in the world using his M-9 droids, however with the tech geek Walter Beckett (Tom Holland), Lance will have to use a spy to avoid by a team of agents who are on the hunt for him, so... he is turned into a pigeon, he now has to get used being a pigeon until Walter makes a antidote to make Lance human again, yeeeah, this does sound quite dumb and generic, it's basically a Emperor's New Groove sort of film where our hero has to go through being a animal throughout the entire film, so you can guess how this film will end up, it has so many predicable and cliched moments that make the plot feel unoriginal, not only that but sometimes the humour can try too hard with it's toilet humour that isn't all that funny, however.... with all that said, Troy Quine & Nick Bruno did put in a bit of effort with what they can do, they made the humour actually legit funny and clever, the film also makes fun of spy films in a silly but fun way, but it's also self-aware about what kind of film this is, it's also got so many action and creative scenes that there are too many to count from but they are very epic and interesting to watch, I was never bored or annoyed by it, the whole pigeon point of view for Lance is funny and amusing to see him suffer and somewhat enjoy his disguise form, making it silly but enjoyable to see, which is pretty refreshing and nice since most of Blue Sky's films are kind of all over the place and not all that funny, although it is dumb and makes no sense, the story does make up for it's unoriginal and pretty predictable plot, with it's clever parodies of other films, some self aware moments and with better heart, comedy and action, Spies in Disguise's story has a identity that can easily be recognised, but mainly thanks to it's directing and writing, the team at Blue Sky did the best they can with what they made and had fun with it.The animation from Blue Sky is still super strong and awesome!, like the plot, there is a certain style to this animation, it kind of has this Incredibles look to it by how obscure and cartoon the characters look, however that is a good thing because the characters are nicely designed and have this very cool look to them, especially Lance, Walter, Kimura, Killian and even the pigeons, it's also incredibly beautiful and the locations are very interesting, along with a lot of creative and super epic action scenes that know how to be cartoony yet stylish, when it comes to it's visual comedy, that can also get super funny and fun, lots of Walter's gadgets are pretty creative and awesome, while also being silly!, also the opening title sequence is so much like a Bond film with it's choice of colour and transition, usually Blue Sky's films are quite beautiful, but with this one, this one succeeds that part but it also a fresh new style that makes this stand out from the rest of their films, it's colourful, epic, stylish, colourful, humorous and a lot of fun to watch!, so I'm happy that Blue Sky's animation style has a fresh look that makes this film has a visual identity, making it one of the coolest spy films out there!.The characters are all memorable in how entertaining they are, unlike the last two Blue Sky films, they do balance the characters out decently, most of them getting the right amount of screen time, while others have fitting small roles, Lance Sterling is a pretty likeable and charming spy, he's super funny especially when he gets turned into a pigeon and trying to survive as one, I really enjoyed him and how he is portrayed, same can be said with Walter, he's pretty funny, helpful and at times can be relatable, the chemistry between the two is decent at best, it's pretty enjoyable but Sterling can be a bit unlikeable to Walter, the other characters are also fun and cool, like Killian, the big antagonist of the film who has a robo-hand, he's threatening, menacing and even has a cool design when he find out what his actual form is, i super enjoyed him, I'm glad he's not some dumb an stupid villain, he is very intelligent and villainous, Kimura (Masi Oka) is a funny and cool villain but he's not in the film for that long, Marcy (Rashida Jones) is cool and hilarious as the agent who is on the hunt for Sterling along with her two assistants Eyes (Karen Gillan) and Ears (DJ Khaled), they are not really villains as they do work for the same team as Lance, but later on..... yeah you can guess the rest, the pigeons that accompany Pigeon Lance and Walter are funny silent comic reliefs who are also helpful!, Lovey has a crush on Lance who hasn't got a thing for pigeons which is hilarious, Jeff is a cute big pigeon and Crazy Eyes is just bizarre and hilarious in how he will eat anything!, although I'll admit sometimes a few of these characters can be a bit unless like Joy Jenkins (Reba McEntire) and Wendy Beckett (Rachel Brosnahan) who only serve as plot elements, who do may somewhat of a big comeback and a reason for our two heroes to do this journey, the voice acting is what saves these characters from being weak and forgettable, I mean I liked all of these characters, but the voice acting is really what saves these characters from being generic, Will Smith is excellent as Lance Sterling, he has that signature charming, charisma and comedy that makes him enjoyable as this spy, Tom Holland just likes Peter Parker when he is the voice of Walter, maybe if he just did his actual accident then his American accent, that would of gave his character a new identity, Ben Mendelsohn as Killian is creepy, threatening, quiet and evil, Mendelsohn sounds like he's having a blast as yet another villain, Rashida Jones always does good comedy and charm whatever character she voices like with Marcy here, Masi Oka is pretty good as Kimura who has a nice threatening voice that fits his character quite well, as for Karen Gillan and DJ Khaled as Eyes and Ears, they also good but they sound like too much like their actual voices, sometimes it can get distracting when you recognise their voices a little too often, but either way, they are still pretty good, the characters know how to be funny, memorable and charming, they can be threatening or they can sometimes mock some other well known spy characters like with Lance, Kimura and Killian, but along with some pretty solid voice acting, the characters are fun, cool and enjoyable then they have any right to be.Theodore Sharpio's score is fantastic, it does have a very James Bond feel to it in terms of how it sounds, it is a excellent score, as for songs made for the film like ""Then There Were Two"" & ""Freak of Nature"" are pretty awesome and fitting songs for the movie made and sung by Mark Ronson.Well...... that was a nice surprise, a nice film to end off the 2010 decade and even the year but...... this might be one of the better Blue Sky films in a long time, okay it's not quite as great as Ice Age or the Peanuts Movie, but it's better then most of the Blue Sky films out there, Spies in Disguise is a nice, refreshing, super funny and action packed film from Blue Sky, it has a engaging story with lots of comedy and action that blends well together, the animation is stylish, creative and colourful, the characters are charming and memorable, the voice acting is top notch and it has great music provided, yes it's cliched and sometimes the humour can be a little gross,if you need a film to see for the whole family, take them to see this, forget Cats and Rise of Skywalker, go see this great family film..... I mean there is Jumanji: The Next Level, but this is better, well, I think Blue Sky might have a chance at making something better with their future now they are part of Disney, Spies in Disguise is a good start, so I hope for more awesome and great stuff from them!, but all I ask is.... PLEASE DON'T MAKE ANYMORE ICE AGE SEQUELS!, please make more films like this!, we need more films like this!, be like Spies in Disguise, don't be like Ice Age 5!.I'm going to give Spies in Disguise a 8.1/10.",Spies in Disguise

The two must now work together to bring down a powerful criminal named Killian (subtle name there right...)All in all I enjoyed this movie, but I don't think it'll stay on my mind for long. I like Will Smith and Tom Holland in a movie together. But spy movies are a dime a dozen these days, just like heist movies. This movie also has some predictable moments in it, the first one beginning (SPOILERS) in the opening scene when Walter is very young, and his mom's a cop, and she says ""I'll always have your back"", and I thought to myself ""ok, the moms gonna die and the movie will use that to have Walter and Lance have a bonding moment"" and all of that ends up happening. Some predictions didn't come true though, like the character Marcy; thought she'd be in league with the villain but she wasn't, which was nice. You also have fun with some of the other pigeons Sterling gets to know, they were funny too.I will say I liked a lot of the slapstick humour and a lot of the goofy gadgets this movie has, made for a lot of comedic moments. I'd recommend it for some laughs, go check it out.",Spies in Disguise

80,Otuoacheampong97,Intelligent but weak script,6,21 April 2020,"Spies in disguise is one of the most intelligent action packed animated films released in the last decade. The screenplay was written by Brad Copeland and directed by Troy Quane and Nick Bruno. The film stars Will Smith as the voice character of Lance Sterling a renowned spy in the American secret service. The antagonist in this film is Ben Mendelsohn starring in the role of Killian Robot-hand, who seeks revenge on the secret service. The film unfold the sequence of adventures that occurs as Lance Sterling races against time to stop Killian Robot-hand from eliminating all his fellow secret agents.The plot of the film reveals a young talented scientist Walter Beckett played by Tom Holland, as he tries to invent non-violent gadgets to deal with the persuing, invading and capturing of criminals.He graduates MIT at the age of 15 and had his calling by working in the high profile American Secret Service. Lance Sterling is not a fan of this non-violent ways of dealing with criminals. This results in the firing of Walter from the service. However, the tables are turned when Lance Sterling seeks help from Walter as a result of been pursued by his own agency thanks to a Killian Robot-hand's framing.The scientific intelligence of the film reaches a climax when Lance Sterling tranforms into a pigeon after drinking a Genetic Modification concotion in Walter's house. Lance Sterling is now a sadly, colorful, cute and twittering pigieon. Lance Sterling's does not like his new form but he must learn to be a pigieon in order to pursue Killian Robot-hand and bring him to justice.The film is set in different countries ranging from the cold mountains in Japan to the admirable city of Venice. This gives the film an international touch.
The screenplay is as intelligent as the directing which really exemplifies two brains at work.
The video effects in this film is exceptional, the animation is excellent especially the designing of cities.
Another laudable aspect of the film is the soundtrack which gives different feelings from emotions to actions.
However, I was not impressed with the dialogue and script of the film. Especially the partnership of Walter Beckett and Lance Sterling hangs on weak script. I remember Lance Sterling telling Walter Beckett how he couldn't have carried the mission without his help. But this only came after he was transformed back to human. Meanwhile he didnt like his pigeon form all along. And thus the film fails to answer the simple question that continues to bother me, Was Lance Sterling a better spy as a pigeon or as a human?In all Spies in disguise is a very intelligent film and simply appealing to audience. I expected much from the film but what I saw is good enough to compel me to urge all fans especially those of animated motions to give this film a try. It has all the giggles and laughter from start to end.",Spies in Disguise

When i saw this and saw he acted in this i almost turned of the movie, because a Will Smith movie these days means ur gonne see something not worth watching... but i gave it a chance. Before he turned into a pigeon I would have never watched this movie, the i am perfect attitude is going nowhere for me. But this movie was very entertaining. It never bored or scenes felt wrong.

It's what I expected and nothing else outside of that which ends up making a decent movie. That's really all I asked for and eventually what I got.Spies in Disguise is a decent spy movie that only exists to entertain its audience with a spy mission full of humor, action, and thrills one would expect. Granted, it didn't reach its full potential due to weak writing that delivered a basic and pretty formulaic story, pointless side plots, forgettably mediocre characters, and a bunch of overused cliches, but it still gets a pass thanks to amazing and well-crafted animation, exciting action scenes, a lot of great humor that's definitely worth a laugh, a modest soundtrack, and great voice acting from Will Smith and Tom Holland.My best recommendation would be that this is for major Will Smith fans, since they can get into the adventure easily with the lead star. Otherwise, this would depend on your thoughts of the concept of the film alone. And at the end of the day, I'm just happy the decade didn't end terribly.",Spies in Disguise

Not sure what the people who didn't like this were actually expecting? A perfect 10/10 on all fronts. Easily as good as Toy Story and Finding Nemo.

90,kmjnhh123,"Good Laugh, Pigeons Are Go",7,7 January 2020,"So as always with new animated films these days we have a good looking animation film with quirky character designs that always give you a chuckle, Will smith being the tall & lean spy in the film with Tom Holland being the nerdy kid in the film.As a 25 year old & my girlfriend being 24 we did enjoy this film even though it seemed it was more for kids but adults can still watch this, granted there was more child parts compared to slightly more serious parts, but not serious for a animation film if that makes sense, with these films you have got to let everything go & just enjoy a laugh, don't take it seriously.I liked the idea of them using pigeons as the main topic in this film because that has not been done before when it comes to using one as a spy, it makes for quite a few good jokes & story line to do with pigeons. It also shows how Will Smith has to overcome the pigeons traits yet he still has to save the world, but being a pigeon he has some advantages so it does make you laugh.The story its self is your usual good guy bad guy scenario, good guy has to beat a enemy & win, of course it simple because of the kids. But i do like the idea how the bad guy used drones for his army, it reminded me of Spiderman Far From Home, almost like they actually got the idea from that film.....I gave it a 7 as i like the idea with pigeons, i like Will Smith & i did laugh, but i won't rave about this film in the years to come.Age - 25

They keep up a great pase in the movie and I didn't feel bored, even at the slower scene because of the colors and animation in the movie kept the interest when the voice acting is slowed down.The theme between the two is that Will is an old School James Bond type agent who just want granates to be granates, where Tom Hollands charecter is more... alternative.A lot of the plot points are easy to guess, but how the plot and information is given fits with the situations and build up the characters.A good story with some great animation and voice acting.

125,zhenwenho,"Intriguing Concept But,",5,2 January 2020,"An intriguing concept but it's just enough to pass the time at the cinema.The movie delivers in regards of soundtrack, voice cast and in some regards, certain animation sequences. The humour within this movie takes affect when it starts pokes fun at modern day culture and manages to pull it off swiftly. By the looks of it, the movie aims to target the likes of children and young teens and probably would give the adults just an enjoyable movie. The movie also attempts to make certain edgy jokes to appeal to an older audience but other than that, it's a movie mainly made for well children and teenagers. The main message of the movie which is anti-war is also a heartwarming one which deserves some praise.However, besides all the initial glamour thrown at you within the first 10 minutes you would soon be immersed enough to look past it's initial facade. The movie suffers when it comes to the plot which is something we have seen over a hundred times in other movies and of course a villain that isn't just bland but one without any real motivation other than an event that has occurred in the past which doesn't really hit you as the villain is indeed a boring one.As a whole, I found myself enjoying the movie but with the given voice cast, the movie could've done a lot more.

The story sucked, and I was totally disconnected with the characters and palpatine coming back was stupid. Especially the way he died. I liked the first wonder woman.

135,kospeti,My disappointment is immeasurable,3,5 January 2020,"Judging by the trailer I thought that the movie was about Lance who is an amazing character with tons of one liners, a parody of common hero's, so adults would enjoy it aswell. I hoped that Walter would be a funny, sidekick with some weird ideas.Lance was really underwhelming, the movie tried super hard to put him into action, but he just could'nt do anything. Him being a peagon was supposed to be an ""upgrade"" as he would become ""invisible"", but he acts like that like once or twice the entire movie.Walter was super cringe, his creations instead of helping just ruined everything for Lance, and after all the pain Walter comes in and accidently deals with everything in 5 seconds.
That's probably the dumbest way to make action.As for the jokes and lines aimed at adults...
I remember only 1 occasion where it was trying, no more than a sick joke.The story had a huge mistake:
It had no villain. The villain was just sitting on a chair on his island the whole movie. He had no motivation but a fail from a long time ago, which the movie never explains.",Spies in Disguise

Overall a fun and crazy romp, and I liked how they avoided the villian giving some over-long back story. The non-violence aspect was done well too, but nobody accepted that there are real violent people that can't be overcome by glitter. It is great to inspire people to solve problems without explosions and weapons, but at least nod to some reality and allow for more than hugs and kittens as problem solving devices. Overall a good flick that could have used more pigeon perspectives and powers to its advantage, but didn't run away from its heart and story either. The soundtrack is a bit too Will Smith jiggy with it and lacked an edge Khaled could have added. I suppose my gripes are minor in comparison to the quality of the movie and its ability to produce laughs and some memorable moments to discuss with the family.

I saw this movie today in theatres and it surprised me more than I thought. The plot and story was okay, nothing to special, but it still exceeded my expectations. The moral or lesson of this movie is different from most animated kids films, because it jumps into something way deeper than other movies. This movie talks about violence and murder, and basically using it to solve a conflict may only lead to bigger and more serious conflicts. The Villain, for example, Killian, I won't spoil this movie, but he has a really dark backstory. Because of something Lance did, Killian just has this whole plot to take revenge on him. The animation was good, nothing to exciting about that. The movie has kind of a slow start, but when you get past like, 45 minutes, that's when you're completely hooked. The ending is rather questionable, and extremely short after the climax, but still delivers. The characters had a lot of depth, especially Walter and Killian.

151,calebdrums,"Solid Film, Ridiculous Message",7,28 December 2019,"There is evil in our world. That's a basic, yet sad, fact of life. This movie attempts to circumvent that truth by claiming that, ""there are no good or bad guys, only people."" That, in itself, makes this movie a bit more derisive than it should be. Oh, yes, Will Smith is fantastic as Lance Sterling, and Tom Holland portrays the awkward nerd Walter in a terrific manner. It reminded me a whole lot of his role as Spider-Man in Far From Home.There are a lot of hilarious moments in this film. For instance, the entire scene in Mexico where Lance, as a pigeon, meets up with other pigeons who then attempt to initiate him into their group is a complete and utter riot. It's uproarious, to say the least. I also enjoyed how they did not create voices for the other birds, but rather, created characters that could be portrayed with subtle movements and simple cooing. You can tell that one of them is insane, one is dumber than a box of rocks, and the third is supposed to be some kind of attractive female pigeon.The movie also touches on a lot of spying tropes and turns them inside out in order to create an atmosphere where a pigeon could engage in espionage. It also takes the time to focus on the bird's weak points and how that would be a hindrance to the task at hand. For instance, when Lance tries to take down a Japanese arms dealer, he fails miserably because his wings aren't as strong as his arms and hands used to be. It's an intensely clever premise, and the movie delivers a lot of action among the comedy.The problem, again, is the message, which is horrendously stupid. The idea that just speaking with an internationally known thief and battling him with cute images of puppy dogs and kitty cats is asinine on the greatest of levels. While I appreciate the movie's efforts to advocate for humans to tone down the violence and be nicer to each other, there are times when you have to, as the movie itself puts it, ""fight fire with fire.""So, overall, this was a very well written, well animated feature. Blue Sky never scrimps on animation, and it definitely shows here. The overarching problem with the movie is its ridiculous message that there are no evil people in the world, just misunderstood individuals.",Spies in Disguise

Most of animation movies will have its core plots on Emotions and its backgrounds ,Spies in disguise also delivers it through Walter. One through his deceased Mom Beckett, here the movie represents Mom-Son relationship (""Team Wierd"") and second through her goals and motives his son not to hurt any innocent or the criminal in a pursuit. The second point is in which caused a war between Batman and Superman both produced a complaint on each other in hurting innocent and its the major plot in this movie as well. Agent Lance Sterling played by Will Smith is deadly spy as similar to Bond mostly uses his gadgets in Killing the Villians (this is where he met Walter in gadget making team) and (important to mention)as Pigeon flying with his flock . Its Awesome to watch partnership of Lance and Walter both in Action and sharing their Emotions. All there is Fun and Comedy when Lance as Pigeon as usual Smith's Entertainment comes into play. Here I need to mention the SuperVillian Robothand is Amazing character also victim of Lance makes you Thrill throughout the movie. Therefore the movie is full of Action and Entertainment have you ever watched an Animation movie full of Action then it is a must watch movie.
Verdict : Incredible Action Animation Flick along with Will Smith's Action Fun like MIB's",Spies in Disguise

The fact that the best spy just drank some liquid in the scientist's house and that is how it all started made me roll my eyes. There was a lot of things made for laughs in this movie that really contradicted the idea of Will's character being the best.
The idea of violence creating violence is to be praised. The overall experience is enjoyable, but nothing to write home about for sure.",Spies in Disguise

163,CakeDive,"Just okay, maybe because of Disney tinkering",6,5 January 2020,"After watching this film, it made feel as if the film was originally made for an older audience. Bird Lance (Will Smith) has a censored swear scene and some jokes seemed to be kiddied-down with the overall message being half-hearted and underwhelming.It made realize that the reason the film was pished back four times was for this very reason. Scenes were cut and the overall story was changed by Blue Sky probably because Disney (it's owners as result of the Disney-Fox merger) probably wasn't keen with the original cut of the film. This is backed up by Blue Sky's wrap up party and the earlier trailer and concept art.Overall, the film was okay. It's one of the better Blue Sky movies made, as it's not as good as The Peanuts Movie but not as bad as the Ice Age franchise films. Hopefully, the original experiments from Blue Sky continue well through the Disney era.",Spies in Disguise
164,mrschitts,Could have been better,6,8 June 2020,"Great film spoiled by too fast action sequences - you literally couldn't follow the speed of the characters movements. Also Killian looked like a comic cartoon character drawing rather than film standard.

165,farhadaniaz,Funny but with insanely stupid occurrences,4,21 March 2020,"The whole deal with sterling being a bird and a spy at the same time was funny. However the movie got so stupid at the final fighting scene where all of a sudden, the woman spy that had been really envious of sterling throughout the film, comes out of nowhere and starts fighting the bad guy ALONG WITH STERLING (and walter , the birds etc). Sterling and walter literally act like the woman spy never had any hard feelings for them and never wanted to hurt them (WHEN SHE CLEARLY WANTED TO HURT THEM AND STERLING'S CAREER).Second, the movie centered a lot on Walter believing that bad people can be stopped by doing ""good things"" and through ""harmless"" means. Ok? Well what about the bad guy in the movie, its shown he has some traumatic past with sterling, but the movie just leaves his problems unanswered. Sterling did give the bad guy a chance for then to talk it out, but instead of persisting, they just ""charge"" at the guy. My second point probably won't make sense but its just something I feel",Spies in Disguise

Will Smith is okay as lance I like his voice acting and this is the first animated movie Will has been in since Shark Tale an abomination for another review. Walter is annoying and unfunny some of the jokes work most of them don't I think I counted one scene with at least five shots, they could've made the villain a lot more interesting but they decided not to put any effort into this movie, I wouldn't either if I had a script this bad, the dialogue is bland and flavorless you get some quippy lines but they're at the beginning of the movie the characters decisions make no sense sometimes, the jokes are just bad most of them being either jokes or characters staring at each other for an uncomfortable amount of time. overall your kids might like this movie but spare yourself the trouble and a better movie like Inside Out.",Spies in Disguise

Blue sky was always just kind of there. My family never went to see any of their movies in theaters. It's Christmas and we went with a cute kids movie because we were seeing it with grandparents. I was blown away. Yes it is kind of a predictable plot but it has a nice spin on it. I liked the emphasis on how violence isn't always the option, and how the movie delivered it in a non cheesy way. Tom Holland and Will Smith worked great together. I laughed a lot. Animation was colorful and fluid and I was surprised how much action was in this movie. I liked how it was an original idea and not just another sequel. Walked out happy, had a great time. Fun to see with family!",Spies in Disguise

The comedy is kinda bad, they're some funny and creative jokes, but most of the jokes in this film are kinda dull and outdated. Also, it's sometimes kinda dark, sometimes too dark for a kids movie.

195,Kids_Movie_Institute,We loved this movie!,10,13 February 2020,"We loved Spies in Disguise because it's cool and funny at the same time. It follows the adventures of Lance Sterling, the world's greatest secret agent. He's on a quest to stop Robot Hand, the world's most evil villain, when he bumps into Walter, a geek who loves to make weird and wacky inventions.
Everyone in the spy industry thinks that Walter is strange, and because of that, none of his inventions have actually been put into use. When he concocts a special potion that transforms Lance into a pigeon, the spy meets impossible problems that he has to solve. Along with Walter, of course.
We love the idea of transforming a super-spy into a not-so-super pigeon. It also has very funny scenes. It has everything you are looking for - especially if you're looking for a spy with a sense of humour!
Spike says: ""The graphics are amazing, the attention to detail is extraordinary, and I would recommend it for all ages.""
We really liked the scene where Lance and Walter jetted away on their luxurious ship. We would have loved to ride on that in real life and be as cool as them.
During the movie, we also enjoyed how the relationship between Lance and Walter gradually developed, and everyone at the KMI wishes to see a sequel on screen soon!",Spies in Disguise

My dad and I were crying laughing so much (and he watched all the movies too)! Definitely Holland's and Smith's funniest movie of the last couple months. I feel like smith's macho humour is really suited for animation while in live action it only sounds like every other macho actor out there trying to be funny. And the clumsy funny of Holland's character is well suited with all the gadgets and the sweet and simple message of the movie. You don't need to repeat to me family family family every two seconds for me to find the characters relatable (bad boys for life) or zoom in to the eyes, again, every two scenes, and show me how realistic a tear can look for me to sympathize with the hero of your movie (onward).
In summary, I loved it, I recommend it and would definitely watch again.",Spies in Disguise

Will Smith's macho humour only works because it's an animated movie and because the character turns into a pigeon, otherwise it doesn't work and it's the same humour used by every other muscled macho funny guy.
And Holland's humour was funny again because of the animation and all the inventive ways to use the gadgets.
I don't need to be told family this family that every two sentences for me to understand the plot (bad boys for life), or a close up or a realistic tear every ten minutes (onward) for me to empathize with the characters.
Of the three movies this one is definitely the best comedy. I would watch it again, and definitely would recommend.",Spies in Disguise

Although I am not a professional reviewer, nor was I paid for any review.]This movie should do well in the Christmas holiday season - it appeals to boys as well as girls, because of the strong leads. Will Smith is obviously the lead, but he is supported by the lovable Tom Holland and hard-nosed Rashida Jones.It is suitable for kids of all ages because of the action, but no actual depictions of people being killed. In addition, the supporting character (Walter Beckett) advocates for non-violent disabling of enemies.The story line is plausible, but a bit long.

What a wonderful, sensible lesson.....We can't even put him down, because ""fighting fire with fire just gets everyone burned"". Will Smith's character has a different take on the situation, but his view point is always shown in a very negative light, as if it is not just different, but entirely wrong.Movie is full of rather annoying ""cool"" pop-culture cliches. There's too much of it, even for a kid's movie.The movie makes casual humor of private parts. I'm not sure why we're teaching young children that nudity is something to laugh at... It's something that deserves more respect and maturity.It's disappointing that the movie had nothing to offer for adults. We have to sit through the movie too, you know.

208,planemaster-99299,"A movie that pushes the boundaries of the ""PG"" rating",9,25 February 2021,"I must say, I am impressed with this movie. I was sort of expecting it to be just a regular old run-of-the-mill kid's movie, and it was to a certain extent. But, it had a great amount of flair and rebelliousness to it.Why rebelliousness? Well, the main reason I liked this movie so much was the fact that it was able to push the limits to what qualified as PG. There was action! There were guns being fired, bullets whizzing by, cool gadgets being used, and realistic emotions being expressed! They even added a bleeped swear word. Very risqué for a kids movie.There were also quite a few people that were killed, on and off screen. A scientist from a lab, a goon working for one of the main villains, just to name a few. Obviously, there was no blood or gore or anything of that sort, but this movie really pushed it with the side character deaths.And the humor element! Absolutely fantastic! I was laughing pretty hard at some of the humor they put in. Whether it was some hilarious character reaction, witty commentary or just a decent joke, punchline or pun, I found it rather hilarious and quite entertaining to watch.Now, it goes without saying that this movie still had some flaws here and there. The story arc and structure was cliché and predictable. There were some apparent goofs here and there. And there was a significant villain backstory element that they mentioned and seemed to want to have a flashback, but they never directly addressed it, except indirectly through conversation.But overall, the animation, humor, rebelliousness and overall character development in Spies in Disguise is on point. This is most certainly one of the better movies of 2019 and I wish there were more like it. Once again: fantastic movie; solid 9/10 from me.",Spies in Disguise

It's plot was mostly easy to follow, but it sometimes has pacing problems. I personally felt that the plot was a lot more interesting than most kid's movies. Its animation was very fluid and stylistic, and its characters were all distinct and had a very cartoony feel to them. It's action scenes were well animated, and were generally fun to look at. Since it is a kid's film, it's obviously going to have some gross out humor. That kind of humor made the movie less enjoyable, and there wasn't very much of it, but when it was present, it was bad and unnecessary. The humor that wasn't gross out was well written for the most part, but some jokes get too dragged out or are simply unfunny. When the jokes are good, they really hit and make up for the jokes that don't land. The relationship between Will Smith's and Tom Holland's characters didn't seem too forced, it had it's pacing problems (like the rest of the movie), but it felt pretty solid. The references it makes were pretty funny, they can be kind of cringey, but are handled well for the most part. I just enjoyed the movie for what it was.

227,roundsc-26417,MUCH better than I expected,9,31 October 2021,"My family watched this for movie night and my wife and I figured it would be one only the kids would enjoy, But boy, my wife and I were surprised that we actually liked it! The movie is funny, has a plot, makes sense, is well animated, and was a lot of fun to watch. I'd watch it myself even if the kids weren't there ;-)",Spies in Disguise
228,umbratus,Out of touch moonbat,1,2 January 2020,This is probably the greatest role Will Smith has ever achieved in his career. The movie is visually stunning. Will Smith's performance is certainly worthy of an Oscar. This is certainly the acme of Will Smith's acting.,Spies in Disguise
229,jortduijnker,"Great film, Will Smith still rocks",8,31 January 2021,"Excellent film, we just watched it with the kids and we all loved it.",Spies in Disguise
230,icarb22,Kid friendly,6,13 April 2020,"Fun quick family movie, music was good too
Plus Will Smith and Tom Holland together was great. Hopefully see a sequel in the future",Spies in Disguise
231,reenieman,Unrealistic excessive Disney Crap,3,19 January 2020,"I had no expectations for this movie.
Its highly unrealistic, excessive with a storyline which is hard to follow.
That the Main Charakter is transformed into a pigeon made no sense at all.
It had no advantages being a bird.
The jokes were really rare and misplaced. Noticeable by my kid barely laughing. He was almost falling asleep like I did. The Charakters were not likeable and did often stupid decisions.Save your money and bye your kids Icecream instead.",Spies in Disguise
232,callielschuttera,Underrated and Hilarious,9,11 February 2020,Lots of laughs and great story telling!! This movie deserves much more attention. The writing and voice acting are spot on. We took our daughter to see this but we all enjoyed it way more than we expected.,Spies in Disguise
233,kevindklenke,"A good, cute and funny spy movie",7,10 February 2020,"I was genuinely surprised on how funny this movie was gonna be; it passed my expectations. However, this is a cute family movie to watch. The plot is pretty similar to Emperor's New Groove, where there's an egotistical character that turns into an animal, and goes on an adventure with someone they dislike in the beginning, but become friends in the end. Overall, was good and enjoyable to watch.",Spies in Disguise
234,luckypunk93,Excellent family film,9,10 January 2020,"In general, Will Smith is a well-known highly respected actor with an accomplished set of skills, however some of his roles are quite predictable. In Spies In Disguise, he makes the entire cast around him better. That said, the entire cast itself is exceptional, especially considering this is a cast more known for entertaining in general, rather than acting specifically. The movie is real, honest, and I personally connected with it much more than I expected, because I usually do not enjoy animated films. The jokes were varied and some landed better than others, but overall an entertaining experience.",Spies in Disguise
235,edaltair,Actually... expected worse,8,1 January 2020,"Movie was fun, exciting, suspenseful and enjoyable for the entire family. I laughed several times, I was a bit surprised of how funny the movie was. Also, the writing and directing was great, for the movie made me feel and care for the characters.Final: go see it",Spies in Disguise

237,ekes-02606,TOO MANY HOLE JOKES!!!,2,4 December 2020,My kids and i watched this movie on thanksgiving and we couldn't get through eating the turkey because there were too many hole jokes and we began to feel very sick. i think i felt more pain than will smith did when he turned into a pigeon.,Spies in Disguise
238,haidabom,So Fun,10,24 May 2020,"I am a HUGE animation fan, and I have to say this surpassed my expectations by a mile.Funny is my favourite. That's why unlike most I didn't LOVE ""How to train a Dragon"". I liked it a lot and it was funny but it wasn't ""Hotel Transylvania"" funny.Spies was HILARIOUS!!! I really laughed out loud many times.The animation is beautiful and it's the only medium I'm willing to see Will Smith in.",Spies in Disguise
