0,MartinHafer,Huh???!!!!,3,28 June 2005,"To quote Colin Mochrie of Whose Line is it Anyway, ""it's CRAP""!!! To put this into perspective, I love foreign films--and I'd rather see them than most Hollywood films. I have seen perhaps as many as two thousand foreign films--and most of the ""must see"" films of directors such as Bergman, Truffaut, De Sica, Kurasawa, Fellini, Bunuel, etc. So, my strong opinion is not without some experience--I am not just some jerk who knocks Bergman's films because they don't have explosions or toga parties!!!! My contention is that SOME of this wonderful directors (or at least some of their films) are incredibly overrated, and are seemingly above criticism. Well, not from me--I love to stir the pot of controversy and call it like I see it. Check out some of my other reviews--I had ADORED some foreign films (such as The Umbrellas of Cherbourg) or directors (Akira Kurasawa) yet been unimpressed by other films (Such as several of Fellini's films--Satyricon and Juliet of the Spirits).So, on to Bergman. My favorite film he made is The Seventh Seal. It wasn't exactly my favorite when I first watched it, but found that the more I thought about it (with its originality and intense performances), the more I was impressed. Scenes from a Marriage, Through a Glass Darkly, Fanny and Alexander and other movies of his were excellent, but not great films, as they had flaws which prevented them getting higher ratings.Persona is the only Bergman film which I gave a really BAD rating. It is hopelessly bleak, choppy (when it purports to be artsy by including repellent seemingly random images in portions of the movie) and silly. The mentally ill central character (Liv Ullmann) does not talk throughout the movie but the dialog is spoken by her nurse (Bibi Andersson)--who increasingly becomes irritated with Ullmann for her silence. I felt much the same way about half way through the film. All this excitement(?) is set in a seaside vacation home. I guess many found it shocking or sophisticated--all I felt was bored and amazed with how unimpressive the film was.So, maybe you should see it for yourself and make your own decision. Maybe all the critics are right and I am just a hopeless crank! My wife would tend to agree (that I am a bit of a crank, that is)!!",Persona
1,TheLittleSongbird,"A brilliant film, but is not for everybody I don't think",10,5 September 2012,"I can understand the viewpoints of those who loved and were moved by Persona and those who were confused or frustrated by it. I personally love it, but I was underwhelmed by it first time. Persona is definitely not the most accessible of Ingmar Bergman's films, Wild Strawberries and The Magic Flute were much more in that regard, and it is also not an easy film to talk about or review. I have seen those who didn't like Persona finding that the story structure is disjointed. In a way it is, but what also made it fascinating in my view was how it explored the nature of art and reality in an ever thought-provoking(by Bergman standards) manner. Sven Nykvist's cinematography is fantastic, the melting frame was an interesting and well-done technique here, as is the scenery, and it is not a Bergman film with a memorable image or two. Persona definitely has those, with the disturbing and somewhat daring images at the start, the immortal image of the two main characters' faces becoming an entity and the more retrospective one with Alma reminiscing with the sexual encounter. The score is hauntingly beautiful, and the way it's written Persona comes across(like Cries and Whispers) as emotionally complex, somewhat disturbing and very moving, and as ever thoughtful also. The inclusion of off-screen voices are well-incorporated. Bergman's direction I cannot fault, and it's the same with the two leading ladies. Liv Ullman proves that a performance where actions and gestures speak louder than words can still move you, and she does that splendidly. But for me it is Bibbi Andersson's film, she is just heart-breaking in her loyalty and compassion. Overall, a brilliant film but understandably not the easiest of films to watch or review. 10/10 Bethany Cox",Persona
2,SnoopyStyle,artistic film,6,9 July 2016,"Actress Elisabet Vogler (Liv Ullmann) has lost the ability to talk. The doctor can find no medical reason for it. Sister Alma (Bibi Andersson) is a nurse put in charge of Elisabet. Alma talks to Elisabet and eventually starts revealing intimate details of her life. Alma becomes more volatile but Elisabet is still unable to talk.This is truly a film rather than a movie. The visual style is stark black and white. There are snippets of surreal imagery. There are iconic Bergman blocking. It is so iconic that some even mock it in satires. The central idea of the duo personality is poetic. Of course, I'm not smart enough to decipher it without help. Essentially, this is mostly one long monologue from Alma to Elisabet. The narrative gets tiring. This may be an iconic film but it's not for me.",Persona
3,Hitchcoc,Those Bergman Females Could Act,10,23 October 2009,"Bergman has it all here. He gives us a film about two incredibly complex women. He throws in the emotional baggage his people often have and he finds a milieu for them to participate in. Liv Ullman has had a breakdown of sorts, leaving her mute. Bibi Andersson is a chatty nurse, whose role is to take her to an island and simply watch over her. As time goes by, we begin to see that she is herself a tormented soul. Ullman's character doesn't vary much. She has established a being. She doesn't speak, but she doesn't shy away. She is sensitive and smiles. The young nurse can't stop talking, telling her innermost secrets. At one point, she reads a letter that was supposed to be mailed and finds out that her charge doesn't respect her much. This sets up a rift and only bad things can come out of it. This picture is so much more, however, because Bergman plays with quick cut images, superimposed on the screen. We are aware that this is a movie because of a projector that we see in the beginning and end. There are surreal elements all over the place, images dominating the screen. If Sven Nyquist has ever done a better job, I don't know when it would have been. I have to watch this again.",Persona
4,Horst_In_Translation,Did very little for me in the end,4,11 September 2020,"""Persona"" is a Swedish black-and-white film from 1966, so this one had its 50th anniversary not too long ago and of course it was made by Ingmar Bergman who is considered being one of the most defining filmmakers of all time. Sadly, I cannot agree judging by what I have seen from him so far and this film here certainly did not change it. Rather the opposite was the case that I think he is even more overrated. Bergman was in his 40s when he wrote and directed this one, so it is neother an early or late career effort from him. The manw as nominated for no less than nine Oscars, but even if this one here is certainly among his most known, most seen and most famous (as you can see from the almost 100k votes here on imdb, which is not a given at all for such an old film), it did not get in at the Oscars. Swedish lead actress Bibi Andersson managed to score a nomination though with the BAFTAs, maybe the biggest success of her career, even if she lost out to Anouk Aimée. The latter is still alive, but Andersson died not too long ago. She was 30 when this movie here was made. Her co-lead is played by Liv Ullmann, who managed the bigger career from the two and was minimally younger than Andersson when this was made, but of course physically very different with her dark hair and Andersson being blonde. These two are at the very center of the film. There are sipporting players, but their impact and screen time are really minimal and also not too many supporting players, which is why I believe this film is also really suitable for being turned into a stage play. You also don't need many different locations as the prologue is set at a hospital somehow where the two women meet each other and basically get to know each other, but immediately afterwards the action switches to the seaside where Ullmann's character is being sent, so her health gets better, which also happens indeed. But I will get to that later. At comfortably under 1.5 hours, this is not a long film by any means and I am actually pretty glad that it was not because I cannot say I was well-entertained here at all when I was lucky enough to see this one on the big screen tonight. Or ""lucky"" enough. I must say I am a bit baffled by how high the rating is here on imdb and that this film sits comfortably in the biggest movie site's top250. It deserves none of that and in the next paragraph I want to explain why I think so.I already struggled with the realism from very early on. While it still felt somewhat accurate at the hospital itself and I especially liked the conflict about the actress maybe not wanting to speak and get active, so there is no need to ""cure"" her, it got pretty absurd at the seaside later. It felt incredibly over the top how quickly the two women had grown closer apparently and how Andersson's character saw her counterppart as somebody she liked dearly because otherwise she would not have talked about the very intimate sex experience honestly. Or was that supposed to tell us she know no boundaries and that there is something wrong mentally with this character as we certainly find out later on? The moment with the shard on the ground, apparently put there intentionally, was one of very few moments I kinda liked because it brought in some solid psycho thriller perspective with how Andersson's character keeps looking if Ullman's steps into it and actually says something as a consequence. Well, she does eventually step into it and utters one word then. The scene with the boiling water is also memorable, once again because this is where Ullmann's character is forced to speak. You could think that it all would escalate soon, but then it is simply back to Ullmann's character being about to leave and Andersson's begging her not to. In the end, we do see some blood though, but what happens exactly there is kinda unclear. It felt just dramatic for the sake of it. Another thing I did not like about this film at all was really the stylistic take. It feels fake to me and not creative at all, but all for the sake of it. With that I mean the frame with the boy at the very start and very end, the burning screen really that followd after the shard scene immediately or also when one character has the exact same scene and dialogue twice and in immediate succession. I mean sure if you dog deep enough, you could make a statement there that it includes some artistic approach, but to me it all felt very much style over substance. The story with the blonde woman losing her cool and sanity eventually even in the face of the other woman being too stuck-up to tallk to her (at least that's what she thinks and still she adores her for being a big actress) would have offered certainly much more potential than Bergamn delivered here. Also the political background with the burning man relatively early on felt all for the sake of it, to be as controversial as possible, if you ask me. I wish he could have kept it as simple as he did with the running time, turn it into a bit of a psychological thriller movie with decent subtlety instead of going so shamelessly for a pseudo artistic approach as he did eventually Still, it's not a terrible movie, but more on the weak side for sure as you can see from my rating. I also feel that my perception would not change by any means if I watched it again, so I have almost no interest to do so. I still think that Andersson nailed her moments here and there and she was good with hhow volatile her character was and how said volatility could immediately turn into danger nonetheless. Definitely not a stable character, even if her performance is also not as huge as I have seen some say it is. No surprise she scored the much bigger awards attention allone for the fact that Ullmann simply was not allowed to talk here at all for almost the entire movie, which clearly hurt her chances to truly make an impact and even if it was a crucial component of the story, she feels somewhat wasted in my opinion. So, overall, this b&w movie gets a thumbs-down from me. I suggest you do not listen to the general consensus and skipt the watch this time. It's not the massively creative achievement people want you to think it is. The editing is a bit wild too and the soundtrack over the top with how loud and in your face it is and again zero subtlety as if they wanted to get in some of the drama there that they could not get in with the script no matter how hard they were trying. Go for something else instead, maybe even by Bergman or allso by Roy Andersson for example.",Persona
5,claudio_carvalho,A Theatrical Movie of Direction and Performances,9,29 July 2004,"Elisabeth Vogler (Liv Ullmann) is an actress who became mute in a play. Her doctor (Margaretha Krook) says that Elisabeth is mute by option, in a kind of sophisticated suicide, and decides to send Elisabeth to her house on the beach with the company of the nurse Alma (Bibi Andersson). While together, Alma initially worships the actress, opening her heart and secrets to her. Later, she feels betrayed, after reading a letter of Elisabeth and then she changes her personality to act like Elisabeth. This movie is open to the most different interpretations and it probably is a marvelous essay for those professionals and students of psychological area. As a lover of cinema, I really appreciated the usual outstanding direction of Ingmar Bergman and the stunning performances of Bibi Andersson and Liv Ullmann. This theatrical film keeps the camera basically all the time focusing the two lead actresses, and Liv Ullmann, even performing a mute character, offers to the viewers magnificent expressions. Unfortunately, the quality of the VHS released in Brazil by the Brazilian distributor Continental is a shame, having subtitles in Portuguese on (covering) the English subtitles. Further, this is the unique option we have in my country to watch this film, since it has not been released on DVD or in restored copy. The title in Brazil is simply ridiculous! My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): 'Persona  Quando Duas Mulheres Pecam' ('Persona  When Two Women Sin')",Persona
6,classicsoncall,"""But somehow..., I think I could change myself into you if I tried.""",8,22 November 2017,"The movie opens with a series of unconnected and somewhat disturbing images - the shearing of a sheep, a nail pounded into a victim's hand a la the crucifixion, dead people on slabs in a mortuary. Quick edits over the opening credits additionally lend a surreal flavor to the picture, so that we have no idea what's coming. If one were to view the opening montage once again after the picture concludes, one might be willing to connect the teenage boy to Elisabet Vogler (Liv Ullman) as the son she bore who she wants no part of. One will have to decide.It seems to me this is the kind of film that's open to one's interpretation in the most personal of ways. Having read a few of the reviews for this movie, there are multiple thoughts on the film that appear just as valid as mine might be, some that even contradict each other. For this viewer, the dynamic between Elisabet and Sister Alma (Bibi Andersson) forces the caretaker to confront her own insecurities about life. In Elisabet, Alma foresees for herself a failed marriage, children she doesn't want, and abandoning a job that she likes for the sole reason of fitting into a society that expects those things from a woman.It's interesting how Ingmar Bergman's direction offers ambiguity in various scenes. When Lisabet tears up the picture of her son, does Alma witness that or not? When Mr. Vogler arrives he speaks to Alma as if she were his wife, leaving her in a state of confusion. However one of the principal ideas coming out of the film, that the personas of Lisabet and Alma are somehow merging together is one that never crossed my mind, even with the camera tricks of melding the two faces together. As I say, one will have their own thoughts and ideas about what occurs in the story, and who's to say that any one or another is valid or invalid? It's all open to interpretation.What elevates the picture to the rank of pure cinema can be found in it's artistic style and bold cinematography. Notwithstanding the early garish images, the film remains austere throughout with minimal backgrounds. The hospital room and the summer beach house are starkly furnished, as the camera focuses principally on the two women throughout. The story is an existentialist expression of it's director, and if one concentrates on the observation of The Doctor directly to patient Lizabeth, one might catch Bergman's elusive goal, to capture ""the hopeless dream of being, not seeming, but being"".",Persona
7,gavin6942,Classic Bergman,8,5 February 2015,"A nurse (Bibi Andersson) is put in charge of an actress (Liv Ullmann) who cannot talk and finds that the actress's persona is melding with hers.Ingmar Bergman made great films throughout his entire career, up through the 1980s and ""Fanny and Alexander"". But his real strength is in his use of black and white, from ""Virgin Spring"" to ""Seventh Seal"" and beyond. This film is again a triumph of black and white, with the most striking shots absolutely necessary in this form. Color would ruin them.Some have called this ""modernist horror"", and that is something I can see. More interesting, though, is just how visual this film is. Sure, we have talking (including some sexual language that may offend sensitive ears), but the bulk is just art. Visual art.",Persona
8,jboothmillard,Persona,8,23 August 2009,"From Swedish director Ingmar Bergman, being given five out of five stars by the critics, and featuring in the book 1001 Movies You must See Before You Die, it sounded like it would be good. Basically young nurse Alma (BAFTA nominated Bibi Andersson) is put in charge of looking after actress Elisabeth Vogler (Liv Ullmann), in good health but is completely mute. As they spend a lot of time together, Alma talks to her, mostly about herself and her opinions, never receiving an answers or replies from Elisabeth. Alma eventually decides to confess some secrets to the seemingly sympathetic Elisabeth, and she slowly finds she is submerging into Elisabeth's persona. Also starring Margaretha Krook as The Doctor and Gunnar Björnstrand as Mr. Vogler. Filled with some intriguing and nearly confusing flash moments, and good performances, this foreign film may have been a tiny bit confusing, but it was very watchable. Very good!",Persona
9,moonspinner55,Nothing if not bizarre,6,2 September 2002,"Appropriately (and predictably) moody Swedish drama from Ingmar Bergman examines intricate relationship between mute woman and her bright, sensitive nurse from a psychological stand-point. The plot takes some fascinating turns, but Bergman is hardly a compassionate man. A character's plight or a tender look is always undercut by bitterness or cynicism, and the bizarre opening montage may send many viewers packing before the picture ever gets going. At the heart of the piece, however, are two very fine performances by Bibi Andersson and Liv Ullmann, who never reveal a false thought or emotion (even in the tightest of close-ups). For curious movie-buffs, interesting viewing; unfortunately, the air begins to leak from this balloon with 15 minutes left on the clock. **1/2 from ****",Persona
10,blanche-2,open to several interpretations,9,12 July 2014,"I love looking at IMDb message boards for films such as this and seeing things like ""turned it off after 30 minutes,"" ""couldn't get into it,"" ""awful,"" etc. I can guarantee you those were written by 20-something young men, or, at any rate, from a generation unused to this type of movie. This is the same group that, on the board for Gandhi, wondered if he was a real character, and on the board for ""Thirteen Days"" thought the Kevin Costner role was fictional.Sorry for that diatribe because in fact, I don't totally understand ""Persona,"" though I am a fan of Ingmar Bergman and of the luminous Liv Ullmann.Therefore, I can only write what I think. There are films that are nothing but the Emperor's New Clothes, no there there, and people write tomes about them, observing deeper meanings that to me, don't seem to exist. This isn't one of those films; nothing done by Bergman is one of those films.Bergman sets up the movie by telling us, with various cinematic images, that this IS a movie.A nurse, Alma (Bibi Andersson), is assigned to Elizabet Vogler (Ullman), an actress hospitalized after she stopped speaking during a performance of ""Electra."" At the doctor's suggestion, Alma accompanies her patient to the doctor's home by the sea. There, Elizabet begins to take walks, write letters, and photograph the scenery. But she does not speak.Alma speaks, confiding her deepest thoughts to Elizabet, who listens and whose face encourages Alma to continue opening up to her. On her way to post some letters, however, Alma reads one written by Elizabet that is unsealed. She is crushed to read that Elizabet is ""studying"" her and that she thinks Alma has a crush on her which she finds ""charming."" On returning to the cottage, Alma becomes angry and belligerent toward her charge, even at times violent.The big question here is, are these two people or are they one person? Is Bergman showing us two sides of the same woman? Or is he showing us that underneath our masks, our personae, we are all the same, and that indeed, we are always ""acting?"" This is open for discussion.The photography by Sven Nyquist is brilliant, giving us a morphing of the two women's images, and often photographing each actress with half of her face in shadow. In one stunning scene, Elizabeth pulls Alma's hair off of her face, the way that Elizabet wears her hair, as they look out, their faces close together.Symbolically I think we are looking at one person who has a ""shadow"" self, each self beautifully portrayed by Andersson and Ullmann, making for a rich and thought-provoking experience.",Persona
11,Quinoa1984,"The most ambiguous, inviting, surreal, whatever-you-can-think philosophical experiment by Bergman",10,5 February 2005,"Writing from a hospital bed (as he did with Wild Strawberries, two of these being films strung out from anguish), Ingmar Bergman put down almost anything that was in his head to start with (the first five minutes- some of the most startling and thoroughly symbolic minutes he's ever directed), then transposed into a story of two women, or one. This was one of the landmark 'art-films' of the 1960's, with hints of the horrors of war (in one memorable scene, Elisabeth looks at a television screen at images of death), introspection regarding sex and identity, existentialism, and what it means to be an actor. Some of the more famous directors in history have a kind of 'notorious' film, by which many people who may not know the bulk of their works know them by one particular work (with Hitchcock it could be Psycho, Lucas' Star Wars, Bunuel with Un chien Andalou, Breathless). This could, arguably, be the one for Bergman, despite a couple of others likely also holding claim to that title. In other words, this could be a good place to start with the director if you're not familiar with his films, or it might not be. But keep this in mind- it's one of his most unique departures as a filmmaker.Two of his leading ladies (and, ahem, loves), Bibi Andersson and 25 year-old Liv Ullmann, star as a nurse and an actress, who for the bulk of the film are at a Doctor's cottage as the nurse tries to help and likely cure Elisabeth of her ailment (froze on stage, silent but incredibly observant). In the meantime, Alma the nurse, in a role that gives Andersson more talking-points than any other film she's been in, goes through some hurtful parts of her past, and just tries to understand her counter-part. At one point, a vein of existentialism is ruptured thoughtfully, when Alma gets Elisabeth to say ""No, don't"", when she threatens her. When I first saw this film, I knew this scene would come after reading Roger Ebert's review. But I had no idea it would hit me like it did. There is such a great, compelling tension between these two that Andersson and Ullmann convey that it is what makes the film work. Any lessor actresses might fumble up the whole lot of it.While it isn't my favorite Bergman film (though it is unfair to pick favorites sometimes when it comes to someone as huge in the cine-consciousness as him), there are many things that had me come back to it after being a little awe-struck on my first viewing last year. For one thing, there's Sven Nykvist, with one of the strongest, most varying eyes in all of European cinema. In the first five minutes, of course, there is some fascinating stuff, but even in the scenes of long dialog and monologue (i.e. the unforgettable speech about being on the beach from Alma), where the lighting is so delicate and sharp with the shadows that you really feel like the weight of this situation is closing in on the characters. Or, of course, when the two actresses' faces are super-imposed, which can be interpreted in more ways than one (either as a grand statement, or as pretension, or something else). I was also very moved by the pace of the film, how it fills each minute (it's not a long movie) in ways that some movies just float minutes by.Now, this is the kind of Bergman film that can't be turned on any time (not to make it sound un-watchable, it certainly isn't). But it does ask to be viewed when in a certain frame of mind- if you're looking for a movie to show off to your friends, like it's the Euro/avant-garde version of Fight Club minus the violence, look away. It poses a good many questions for a viewer, especially one who knows of Bergman's themes he's explored before and after this film's release. How do we feel, or know we're feeling? What keeps us closed in? Why do we hurt? And are we only one person at a time? It's all the more puzzling that Bergman's climax isn't a very easy one (not as doomed as with Seventh Seal but not as cheerful as Fanny and Alexander), as Alma has another monologue with Elisabeth, about her son she hasn't seen in a long while- this famously seen from two different angles, one after the other. Furthermore, it is arguably Bergman's most self-conscious film to date (the commentary on the DVD carries it well), however it may not be as off-putting as with some of Godard.To put it another way, there are two sides to the subject matter, the film, the director, and the audience.",Persona
12,sunwarrior13,A Masterpiece About Intimacy,10,25 October 2012,"Persona is a film by Swedish director Ingmar Bergman that features Bibi Andersson and Liv Ullmann..The film is difficult to characterize in simple terms, but it may be helpful to describe this complex film as being an exploration of identity that combines elements of drama, visual poetry, and modern psychology. This happens to be categorized as a postmodern lesbian romantic psychological mystery made during the 1960's.The central story revolves around a young nurse named Alma and her patient, a well-known actress named Elisabet Vogler. Elisabet has stopped speaking, and the attending psychiatrist treats the actress by sending her to an isolated seaside cottage under Alma's care. There the nurse, who must do all the talking for both women, becomes a little enamored of the actress. One evening Alma tells Elisabet about some exhilarating sexual experiences she once had and their unpleasant aftermath. Soon after sharing this confidence, the nurse reads a letter Elisabet has written and is shocked to learn that the actress thinks of her as an amusing study. The relationship between the women becomes tense, and they wound each other. Then Alma has a long dream in which her identity merges with that of Elisabet, but when the nurse awakes, both women have apparently come to at least temporary terms with their psychological problems.Bergman has come up with probably one of his most masterful films technically and in conception, but also one of his most difficult ones.This is subject to many interpretations wherein any of which provide deeply disturbing looks into the psyche of the characters or character.But overall,it is an artistic study of the rules of interplay between opposite, ill-equipped dominant and submissive characters, expresses universal ideas about human compatibility.It is a film that works in multitude of levels.",Persona
13,preppy-3,If I knew WHAT I was watching I might have liked it more,5,19 December 2009,"A nurse (Bibi Andersson) is hired to take care of an actress (Liv Ullmann) who has stopped speaking. They are all alone on an isolated island and begin to become each other...or something. To be totally honest I haven't a clue on what I just saw! I'm not a Bergman fan but I have nothing against him either. I like some of his movies but find others boring, obvious and wildly overrated (like ""Wild Strawberries""). This falls somewhere in between. It has some wonderful moments but the narrative seems to completely overhaul itself at least three times during the film. Just as it seems to be making sense something happens and you're flung into another version of the story with the same actors! Some people may find this intriguing but I found it annoying. Also some of the psychological points Bergman makes here are laughably obvious...but I suppose they were considered profound in 1966. Also there's one long monologue that is delivered TWICE! Yes--it lets us know what's going on but twice???? Complaints aside it was beautifully acted by Andersson and Ullmann and there were a few very interesting moments but the vague plot got maddening. Also I'm surprised that Bergman actually got a shot of an erect penis in the movie--that HAD to be quite daring for 1966. So, as it stands, I can only give this a 5.",Persona
14,lastliberal,"The important thing is the effort, not what we achieve.",8,14 November 2010,"One of the most disturbing films ever made. Considered Ingmar Bergman's greatest, this film stars two women (Bibi Andersson and Liv Ullmann), one of whom (Ullmann) never talks.No you won't be bored because it also has detailed descriptions of hot sex on the beach.As the story progresses, Andersson unravels while the Ullmann sits there silent, already knowledgeable of the tortuous, disturbing conclusions that true introspection brings one to.Persona is not just about an awful person understanding another awful person, it's also about our wider inability to truly conceptualize great tragic things. It's like trying to envision the pain and regression we will go though over the next couple of years under right wing control — a virtually impossible task. Something about us wants to truly understand, empathize, and come to terms with the tragedy, but something else in us prevents it.If all this sounds high-brow and academic, you should watch it just because Bibi Anderson is about as hot as it gets for women in the 60s.For film buffs, there are techniques used in this film that I have never seen before. I am sure glad it is available on Netflix, as I want to watch it again and again.",Persona
15,grantss,Ingmar Bergman's superb study of (insert your interpretation here),9,29 April 2018,"A nurse at a psychiatric hospital, Alma, is given a new patient. Elisabet Vogler is a famous actress but has suddenly become apathetic, lethargic, mute and prone to fits of laughter at arbitrary, innocuous things. Alma does her best to engage Elisabet and get her to talk but the more Alma opens up to Elisabet, the more she empathises with her and becomes like her.Written and directed by famed Swedish director Ingmar Bergman, Persona is a superb, mind-bending study on identity and personality. Well, to me it is, mostly. Every time I thought I had the movie figured out, it would take a different tack. Reading what movie critics and psychologists think it is about, there isn't a single, unifying interpretation. So, if you say you know exactly what it is about - you're either lying or weren't concentrating. Basically, every person will have their own interpretation, dependant largely on their own background and perceptions. Isn't that the definition of art?And it certainly feels like art. Bergman's cinematography is excellent, the soundtrack adds to the intensity and he uses symbolism extensively, and jarringly (maybe a tad overused - I didn't find it all necessary). Liv Ullman's minimalist performance - she utters only two words during the course of the movie - and the psychological aspects, especially, add to the sense of this being something more than just a movie. Quite profound, even without knowing what the profundities are (!).I found it difficult to give this a 10, due to not understanding it fully (and believe me, I tried!) and feeling like I could have done with a more complete conclusion. However, as mentioned previously, maybe confusion / uncertain interpretation was Bergman's aim.",Persona
16,Boba_Fett1138,"Psychological breakdown and dissection, with Ingmar Bergman.",8,4 September 2012,"Don't think I really realized this before but while watching this movie I kept thinking to myself how incredibly influenced Stanley Kubrick must had been with Ingmar Bergman and his movies. The style, the pace, the compositions, the use of music, the use of visuals and overall cinematography, real comparisons could be drawn between the two film-makers.But as far as Bergman movies go; they are also being a bit harder to really get in to, due to its themes and approach. You have to be in specific mood for them, so to speak and not have any other distractions around you. But once you really invest yourself into his movies, they are often very rewarding.All of that can be said for this movie as well. It's minimal with its setup but complicated with its themes and characters. You could say that this is also really being a movie everybody will get something different out of, since everyone shall interpret things in their own way, which also truly makes this movie you simply have to experience for yourself.The one shall enjoy it for its mysterious and mystique story, characters and environment, while the other shall appreciate it more for its underlying psychological themes. Either way, everybody should be able to get something out of this movie. I really did see this movie as one that was focusing on the human psyche. Bergman tries to dissect the mind, breaks it down and builds it up again, by letting the characters go through some transitions, supported by some beautiful- and at times also somewhat psychedelic visuals.Not that the movie feels all that weird or pretentious. I mean, once you really get into the movie and its characters there is very little strange about it actually and you can see and understand what the characters are going through and where the movie was aiming for. Yet another greatly unique movie by Ingmar Bergman, that is great to watch, if you are in the right mindset for it.8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Persona
17,evanston_dad,It's Movies Like This That Earned Bergman His Reputation,10,2 January 2007,"Ingmar Bergman made films like ""Persona"" (and ""Wild Strawberries"" and ""Cries and Whispers"") that make me forgive him for making other films like ""Hour of the Wolf"" and ""Winter Light."" In ""Persona,"" a nurse is charged with taking care of a mentally deteriorating actress, and through a series of enigmatic, dream-like scenes, we are left wondering which of the two actually exists and which is the figment of the other's imagination. It's a sort of precursor to ""Mulholland Drive,"" and the comparison is even more apt as both films are very much about the art of acting and the art of making movies.The most stunning (and stunningly simple) moment in the film comes when one of the actresses delivers a lengthy monologue while the camera slowly zooms into a close up of her face, and then the entire scene plays out again, with the other actress delivering the same monologue. Somehow, Bergman manages to overcome some of the stifling trappings that make so many of his other movies slogs, and gives us a bracing, haunting masterpiece.""Wild Strawberries"" may be the Bergman movie I like the most, because of its warmth, but ""Persona"" is the one I can't get out of my head.Grade: A+",Persona
18,zetes,Rambling on...,10,18 September 2000,"I don't know what to say about Persona, but I know I have to say something. I can say straight out that I did not fully grasp it, nor do I believe that it is fully able to be grasped. Like my favorite film, 2001, Persona allows for a plethora of interpretations, none of which can ever be said to be correct. But I know now that I do not understand everything. And I love that about it. Jesus, it needs to be released on DVD. Criterion, are you listening??? Screw everything else for the moment, do a DVD edition of Persona complete with scholarly commentary (and not the same scholar who commented on your edition of The Seventh Seal, because he did not answer my questions). Not that I want anybody to tell me definitively what anything means, because I doubt anyone can do that. I just want some people to share my thoughts with. I want to watch and rewatch this film dozens of times. With a DVD, a nice one, I could scrutinize it extremely carefully, as I have thankfully been able to do with such great films as The Seventh Seal, The Third Man, Nashville, etc, etc, etc. Watch a scene, quickly rewind, watch it again and memorize each and every word and motion. I'm starting to feel like the main character from Antonini's Blowup! I rented this film two days ago and have watched it twice. If I had not been so tired the first night, I surely would have gone through it a second time that very same night. Doubtless, I would have done it again later. And I still have it for a couple of days, the rest of my life be damned!All I can really comment on is the artistry of Sven Nykvist, the cinematographer, always been one of the very best, and on the acting skills of Liv Ulmann and especially Bibi Andersson, who gives one of the bravest and most powerful performances I've ever seen in a movie. I would compare her skill in this film to my favorite performance of all time (that I've seen): Marlon Brando in Last Tango in Paris. It seemed to me that she was becoming extremely involved in her character. And this is where I need to just engulf myself in this film. While I cannot exactly ""get"" this film from a narrative angle entirely, the important thing, and the aspect of the film which will no doubt bring me back time after time (as long as I can someday get it on DVD, because, as far as I'm concerned, VHS is only for rental anymore) is the emotional aspect. While my intellect had a somewhat difficult time holding on to the text of the film, my emotions were right with the characters. It was an extraordinarily gut-wrenching film for me, and I felt, well, some weird feelings after it ended (part of which certainly had to do with the fact that certain parts of the movie boggled my mind). So my final score is without a doubt a 10/10. Few movies compare.",Persona

Life as convention, mask for feelings and expectations.Another room of Bergman's universe. Same cruel instruments, game of flash-backs and dream sequences, visions and memories. Fight between two women as screen for interior struggle. Impact of consciences and lights of sin. Illness like armour against fake images and empty future. Confesions like way to be yourself. Like cries suffocates by silence of the other.Story about refuse and cages. About dreams and disillusions. About chaotic values and flavour of extinction. People as rabbits for experiments. The other like sign of salvation. And the question of soul.""Persona"" is an act of confrontation between Ingmar Bergman and God. The silence, the cruelty of letters, the cries and the confessions of Alma are only guns in a strange and ambiguous war. So, any film of this great director is a religious personal answer to permanent subtle fear. In this case, the shadow of divine presence is the Liv Ulmann smile.",Persona
20,lasttimeisaw,a dazzling Bergman's study in unfathomable nature of human being,8,31 January 2016,"PERSONA is Bergman's seminal work, an identity shifting psychological study centres on two women, nurse Alma (Andersson) and actress Elisabet Vogler (Ullmann), the former is assigned to take care of the latter, who is seemingly suffering from aphasia, but later one might argue, it is a voluntary unresponsiveness towards the exterior world.From its opening scenes with sharply interjected montages, PERSONA signals to be one of the most experimental and recondite work for Bergman, a minimal narrative entirely thrusts between Alma and Elisabet, one is talking obsessively while the other is selectively mute. Firstly, a hovering question is: what is wrong with Elisabet? Not until we realise her silence may out of her own volition, being an actress, she is intensely aware of the deception of words, not only to others, every time one says something, it is also a betrayal to one's id, which could be a tentative reason behind her behaviour. Then, the focus changes towards Alma, she takes the job as a challenge to sway Elisabet's resolute, bring her back to norm, she befriends her, ministers to her daily life (from the ward to a seaside cottage), involuntarily divulges the most personal secret to her (about her sex adventure, a ménage-à-quatre fling behind her boyfriend's back), only to illicit even a glimpse of her responsiveness.All the apparent harmony shatters when Alma reads Elisabet's letter to the hospital, in which she finds out that herself is subjected to a ""specimen"" for Elisabet to study, a sudden feeling of disappointment and betrayal sends her act aggressive and hostile towards Elisabet, from there, Bergman tranquilly strips the story off any normal procedures of coherence, daringly obfuscates the concrete distinction of reality and imagination, where Alma's conducts become more and more irrational and frantic, glass shards, boiling water, harsh confrontations, role-playing and the repeated elucidations of the anguished relationship between Elisabet and her son, until it comes to a bang when Alma and Elisabet's faces merge into one, everything is absolutely perplexing, through the juxtaposed close-ups, the ethereal cinematography and the out-of-context words, it is simultaneously frustrating and scintillating, a trademark syndrome from Bergman school.Starring Bergman's two muses, PERSONA signifies Ullmann's rising and Andersson's waning in Bergman's oeuvre, nevertheless, Andersson is still getting the upper hand here, thrilling in dissolving herself into various emotional states, then absorbing all in with unflustered apathy, as if nothing happens, competently consummates the dreamlike structure which keeps viewers wondering. Ullmann's no-lines arrangement effectively underpins her childlike visage, soul- reaching gaze and fragile state as a woman distraught with some unnamed grief.Upon a first-viewing, I must be honest and keep my reservation to this accepted masterpiece since instead of getting a soothing catharsis, my mind is clobbered with too many question marks, and a feeling of malaise, I shall give this another try in another time.",Persona
21,cherold,Maybe I would have liked this better when I was in film school?,6,1 January 2008,"I couldn't help wondering as I watched Persona's surreal opening if it would have appealed to me back when I was a film student. Because now, 25 years after that, I found it really annoying and pretentious.Once the film settles down into basic drama it gets more interesting, although it still goes up and down. Many scenes are intense and emotionally raw, although at times, particularly in the beginning, the film seemed much too artificial. Still, f you chopped off the two ends of the movie (and the other bit of weirdness in the middle somewhere) and replaced this with something more in keeping with the film as a whole I think I might have really liked this. But as the movie reached its conclusion I once again found myself dissatisfied. The end scenes are clever on the surface but I didn't feel the movie made much real emotional sense. I don't normally find myself picking apart Bergman films - the ones I've seen have been for the most part either searing emotional studies that feel like they tear off the skin to show what's underneath or odd movies that work on the level of philosophy and art. Persona is somewhere in the middle, and it as though it is two movies that don't entirely connect.Still, I have to consider the possibility that I would have thought this was supercool when I was 20. Although I might have disliked it back then too. It's an unanswerable question.",Persona
22,sol1218,The Sounds of Silence,8,13 December 2009,"***SPOILERS*** During a scene in the play ""Electra"" well known Swedish actress Elisabeth Vogler, Liv Ullmann, seemed to have gotten an attack of stage fright and refused to go on with the play. Elisabeth from that point on never said as much as nothing during the entire film! It's decided by Elisabeth's doctor, Margaretha Krook, that she be treated for her sudden attack of ""cat bit her tongue"" illness by being sent to her cottage on the scenic Swedish coast to recover her voice with the help of the nurse assigned to her Alma, Bibi Andersson.Alma a big fan of Elisabeth as an actress at first takes the job of looking after her as a big plus for herself personally a well as professionally. It's later that Elisabeth's silence starts to get to Alma with her not Elisabeth doing all the talking which was supposed to be, in curing Elisabeth muteness, the other way around! Without at first realizing it Alma starts to reveal to a very interested, by her facial expressions, Elisabeth her most personal thoughts and experiences. This starts to unnerve Alma in that these are things that she want's to keep only to herself not a mental patience that's she's been assigned to look after!It's later when Alma accidentally reads a letter, that was left unsealed, for Elisabeth from her doctor-Margareth Krook-that states that she found Elisabeth to be completely normal in mind and body that she starts to suspects that there's a lot more to her silence then just a slight, or major, case of stage fright! Doing her best in getting into Elisabeth mind Alma morphs into her and soon comes to the shocking conclusion to what's really behind Elisabeth's very strange and unexplainable actions that has baffled everyone who came in contact, including Alma, with Elisabeth in trying to cure her!***MAJOR SPOILERS*** A very dark and hidden secret had in fact came to the surface earlier in the film about Elisabeth's mental condition that Alma and the audience had completely overlooked. It was something from Elisabeth's recent past that had driven her almost insane in how it would effect both her career as an actress as well as her relationships with her husband Mr. Vogler played by Gunnar Bornstrand. A secret, in how Elisabeth reacted to it, that has driven her to detached herself from the harsh reality that she faced in confronting it!P.S Director Ingmr Bergman's striking black & white photography as well as the his trademark morphing scenes between Alma & Elisabeth are just a few of the reason for watching this ground breaking, in the study of split-personalities as well as one being in serious denial, film. There's also the ""Boy"" played by 15 year old Jorgen Lindstrom whom we see in the beginning and end of the movie that's seems to be, what I feel, the real reason for Elisabeth's sudden attack of muteness as well as her detachment from living in the real world. The ""Boy"" that Elisabeth had been suppressing in her very troubled mind ever since she lost her ability to speak!",Persona
23,ElMaruecan82,The vision of an Artist on the inner Tragedy of Life ...,10,25 June 2012,"Ingmar Bergman's ""Persona"" rises above rationality with such beauty and self-confidence that if there ever was one word intelligible enough to translate the power of its images, the film would have failed.I read many IMDb users' intelligent comments and although I'm impressed by the literary material they used to look deeper into the film –some philosophical references I unfortunately lack- I believe that if a film takes one book's reading to get its meaning, then it missed something. In my opinion, a film must only rely on what it shows and what the viewer perceives (besides, why should it require the use of another medium when it is already one). I saw ""Persona"" three times and twice in the same week, and although I was tempted to get familiar again with the myth of Electra or to read some articles written by Freud or Jung, I prefer to expose a view based on AND ONLY ON what my eyes experienced.And what an experience! ""Persona"" is a harrowing journey within a very special relationship between two women, Elizabeth, an actress who was playing Electra and stopped talking in the middle of a play, and Alma, the nurse who takes care of her (knowing that 'Alma' means 'soul' in Spanish would enrich this review, but I didn't know that). Elizabeth is silent all through the film, with a few exceptions, and only her eyes and her body language express and hide her true feelings. And if Liv Ullman is mesmerizing, it's Bibi Anderson who deserves the praise as Alma, one of the greatest female performances in my humble opinion. Alma is clearly fascinated by Elizabeth, with this irrational veneration ordinary people feel for artists and all she does during the first act is speaking, telling her life, from the most banal to the most shameful secrets.""Persona"" is made of monologues and silences, and the genius in Bergman is to make it feel as dialogs, as if a human personality had unlimited ways for expression. The Alma-Elizabet tandem is not a one-way relationship: Alma tells her secrets because she feels something in return, a sort of relief, of freedom to expose herself the way she is, but this very exposition, as the movie progresses, leads to its own limits. Basically, Alma unmasked herself while Elizabeth remained silent, incapable to reward Alma for having opened her soul. 'Persona' was the Latin word for mask and in a way, it conveys the true meaning of a personality, which generally consists on the way it's perceived by people, not necessarily what it really is. Elizabeth's silence can be seen as a carapace protecting her from Alma's perceptions, which inevitably hurt Alma's feelings.This is where the conflict starts, and no great film can avoid one. As abstract as it is, ""Persona"" is surprisingly explicit about it. Alma incarnates the disarming effect of an overexposed personality, while Elizabeth is the frustratingly quiet strength, strong but empty. The two women end up fighting and not just symbolically. The fight scene is pivotal because it shows that no one can lure himself into a convenient silence without being taken back to life. Yet, Alma's own regrets and insecurity proves that she needs to learn from Elizabeth. In ""Persona"", the conflict is even more gripping because we feel it's necessary for the two women. Love is like a double-edged sword and as the two women become fond of each other, the fight, as an intimate (almost sensual) manner to express anger, becomes inevitable. ""Persona"" is a learning of complementarity, not within the film, but from our own perspective.And the genius is that it doesn't hide itself from being a film. Although, the beginning might strike some viewers as quite unusual, Bergman is not making an exercise in style, the 'weirdest' parts are very brief, some subliminal images might shock, but the film is short (less than ninety minutes) and allows us to distance ourselves from the characters. Bergman has his way with the camera; he knows how to make the most subtle things incredibly accessible. Take the iconic shot of the film that inspired many parodies (including Allen's hilarious ""Love and Death"") we see one woman's profile and another woman with half her face visible, it's like a mathematical view on life as ""one and one makes one"", as if one personality was just the superposition of two faces, two states of minds, tragic, comic, the 'Greek masks' duality. On that level, ""Persona"" is also a triumph in film-making with a haunting, dreamy and hypnotic photography.Many close-ups reveal only half a face while the other is in the dark, but the shadow is not a representation of death, but fears, we hide what we fear, the most vulnerable spots of our 'persona', and while Alma seems the more lively in the beginning, she's hiding displeasing secrets. And while Elizabeth is in a communication's blackout, she walks above existence, existing without being. In one of the film's most beautiful moments, the light slowly fades out but her eyes keep on scintillating, until you can see two white vivid spots in the dark. Elizabeth can't fool herself, she's only alive with her past, her memories, and her weaknesses. And when Alma can't stand it, she makes Elizabeth talking by threatening to burn her with boiling water; it's only by expressing her fear of pain –anticipation of death- that Elizabeth states her aliveness.Another moment shows her seeing on TV a Buddhist monk burning himself to death. Elizabeth realizes that she also is plunging herself to a deadly state. And Alma is desperately trying to awaken her because the tragedy of life is that joy, passion and love can afford silences, smiles, kisses, sensuality, sex but Man's inner condition is made of doubts, pains, fears and weaknesses, and those can only be directly expressed through words, shouts, cries, voices  ultimately Art ultimately Cinema ultimately Ingmar Bergman.",Persona
24,dromasca,the enigmas of 'Persona',8,18 May 2019,"'Persona' is one of the most enigmatic movies in the history of cinema. Those who read the chronicles written right after the 1966 release of the film or the articles dedicated to it in the books of cinema history will encounter as many interpretations as authors. The same happens if we read the opinions written by film lovers on sites like IMDB, or we discuss the film between us. Ingmar Bergman had the inspiration not only of not talking a lot about this film (even less than about his other films) but he also avoided sharing too much of his personal thoughts or ideas even with the actresses or the other members of the production team. The result is an enigma. Each of us who sees or sees again this movie has his own Persona'.The ambitions are clear from the way the film is 'packaged' using the classic projection room effects. Short sequences from classical films emphasize the effect of declaring 'here we have a work of cinema'. The prelude sets up an atmosphere that could be defined as a dream, we are clearly in a world that resembles the real world but which exists only in the eyes and souls of the spectators, built with materials put together by the creator of the film from his own thoughts and dreams about the world. The 'story' could be told in few words, even if it is not a banal story. This is where the interpretations begin. What do we actually see on the screen? An ambiguous relationship between two women, evolving from a patient-care relationship to an attraction that starts to look as a melding of one into the other? Are the two characters the symbols of the two facets of the human personality - the soul and the character - as interpreted by some experts in the psychoanalysis theories? Is there a hint (or more) to a lesbian relationship? Maybe there is an element of class struggle, between the actress active on the intellectual level and the country girl whose strongest emotions are on the erotic plane? Are we dealing with a horror story, a thriller in which there is a physical threat and a struggle between the two women to gain control one over the other? Why did the actress stop talking - personal traumas, maternity failure? What is the connection between the horrors of the outside world (wars, the Holocaust) and the inner storms concealed by the Scandinavian calm? These are just a few of the questions that can be asked and of the possible interpretations.Comprehensive and ambitious cinematographic constructions involve risks. More than 50 years after the film, the Vietnam War is no longer actuality but history, closer to the Holocaust which is also quoted by the famous photograph of the terrorized little boy in the Warsaw ghetto. The black and white image also gains aesthetic significance, not necessarily obvious and intentional at the time the film was made. Acting is gorgeous, Bergman's two preferred actresses (and lovers), Bibi Andersson and Liv Ullmann are building on the screen two versions of femininity that at some point merge one into the other, two variants of the director's fascination with women for which he created the most generous roles in his films. Seen for the first time or seen again today, 'Persona' is a cinematic art concentrate and an intellectual challenge that continues to attract and fascinate through its open character and enigmas.",Persona
25,ThomasDrufke,Influential But Doesn't Necessarily Hold Up,6,20 October 2019,"There's a point about 4 minutes in to watching Persona that you begin to wonder what exactly you decided to spend 80 minutes experiencing. And even after the runtime, it's not exactly easy to interpret the message behind Bergman's psychological thriller. I almost feel like Bergman's films are films you experience and not necessarily ones you understand, am I right? He was essentially David Lynch before Lynch existed. And I can see how he inspired dozens of filmmakers to this day, but I'm not sure how effective his films may be on a viewer like me.6.6/10",Persona
26,gbill-74877,"Avant-garde, existential, fascinating",8,14 May 2016,"An avant-garde opening sequence of images, some disturbing, immediately sets the tone for this movie, as Bergman seems to say he will challenge us with 'Persona'. The story is relatively straightforward, but discerning what's reality may be a little challenging. As with many (all?) of Bergman's films, the script is fantastic, with real weight to it, and it's a cerebral film. Ostensibly, an actor (Liv Ullman) has had an existential crisis while on the stage and suddenly stops speaking. It seems to be because of her feelings of the falseness of life (and indeed, 'Persona' in Latin means 'mask'), heightened by events in the world (we see a film clip of a Buddhist monk in Vietnam who set fire to himself in protest of the war, as well as a picture of Nazis holding guns on women and children). She withdraws from her husband and young son. Doctors can find nothing wrong with her mentally or physically, and put her in the care of a young nurse (Bibi Andersson), who takes her to the seaside. Andersson has almost all of the lines in the film, talking to Ullman about her own life in quite candid terms, both about a sexual adventure she once had on the beach (which is quite graphically described!), falling in love with a married man, and her guilt over getting an abortion, but Ullman does a good job with her part, conveying a lot with just her facial expressions. As the story plays out, Andersson gets a little unhinged herself, and the two then start to mingle together, either in their thoughts and dreams or possibly in reality. In one fantastic sequence, the reason for Ullman's guilt about not easily assuming the role of motherhood is revealed, shot first with tight shots of her face as Andersson speaks, and then shown again, verbatim, with the camera on Andersson. There is a doubling here, and Bergman emphasizes it with this sequence. The movie can be interpreted in different ways which makes it interesting, but it's not so far out there that you won't take anything away from it at all; Bergman seems to get the balance right on that front. He takes us to a beautiful place – the seaside – and includes fantastic shots such as the one of Andersson looking at her reflection in a small pond, and later following Ullman down a long stretch of the shore – and yet also tells us things are not always what they seem. His ending will have you thinking, for example, whether all of this has been a dialogue within one person's mind. But even as we're unsure of 'reality', I found it empowering to women, who discuss philosophy, acknowledge their sexuality, and acknowledge what is perhaps even a bigger taboo – that assuming the role of motherhood is sometimes very difficult. And, in a larger sense, he signals that even though the world is beautiful, to exist in it can be horrifying. We're all ultimately alone, but must hold on to one another as best we can.Some quotes On marriage: ""You've taught me that we must see each other as two anxious children full of goodwill and the best of intentions but governed by forces we can only partially control.""On existential crises: ""You think I don't understand? The hopeless dream of being. Not seeming to be, but being. Conscious and awake at every moment. At the same time, the chasm between what you are to others and what you are to yourself. The feeling of vertigo, and the constant hunger to be unmasked once and for all. To be seen through, cut downperhaps even annihilated. Every tone of voice a lie, every gesture a falsehood, every smile a grimace. Commit suicide? No, too nasty. One doesn't do things like that. But you can refuse to move or talk. Then at least you're not lying. You can cut yourself off, close yourself in. Then you needn't play any roles, wear any masks, make any false gestures. So you might thinkbut reality plays nasty tricks on you. Your hiding place isn't watertight enough. Life oozes in from all sides. You're forced to react. No one asks whether it's genuine or not, whether you're lying or telling the truth. Questions like that only matter in the theater, and hardly even there. I understand you, Elisabet.""And this one, quoted from a book Andersson is reading on the beach: ""All the anxiety we carry within us, all our thwarted dreams, the inexplicable cruelty, our fear of extinction, the painful insight into our earthly condition have slowly crystallized our hope for an other-worldly salvation. The tremendous cry of our faith and doubt against the darkness and the silence is the most terrifying proof of our abandonment and our terrified and unuttered knowledge.""",Persona

28,Bored_Dragon,Monodrama,7,17 July 2019,"The famous ""Persona"" by Ingmar Bergman illustrates the relationship between the silent actress and her talkative caretaker, and in the end, it turns out that they are two ""personalities"" of the same person. Some believe that this is a film about multiple personalities, but I think that they are simply ego and alter ego, or a mask that Elizabeth shows to the outside world and her suppressed true being hiding under that mask and trying to break through to the surface.The whole film comes down to the endless monologues of Alma (""alma"" in Spanish means ""soul""), who opens completely and finally breaks before her ""interlocutor"". I say ""interlocutor"" because, although Liv Ullmann does not speak a word during the whole film, she actively participates in these ""conversations"" with her facial expression. Both actresses were fantastic in their roles, and Sven Nykvist made a great effort that we do not miss a single detail of their performance. The acting and perfect black-and-white cinematography are for ten out of ten. The rest of it...Although one part of Alma's monologues is essential to the understanding of the story, a good part of it is confusing and, at least apparently, meaningless and unnecessary. Perhaps every last word makes sense and is of key importance in Bergman's head, but if that's the case he was not able to or he did not want to share with us in an understandable way. There are also very irritating flashy piles of pictures of all sorts of things unrelated to the plot of the film, which appear at the beginning and middle of the film, just perfect for causing seizures. These flashes also may have some sort of sense in Bergman's head, but I experienced them as a very unpleasant and unprovoked throwing out of the track. Although it lasts less than 90 minutes, the film gives the impression that it lasts for an entire eternity. No, I was not bored for a moment, but I think it is unduly burdensome.I think that the extremely high reputation of ""Persona"" is more consequence of the extremely strong reputation of Bergman than the quality of the film itself, and that a large part of the audience praise it by inertia, or because they are embarrassed to admit that they actually do not like something that is generally recognized as a masterpiece, or simply do not understand it at all.

The film opens with random images of a movie projector, a cartoon, an animal getting disemboweled, an aroused male organ, etc. that leave most viewers bowing to the pure genius of Bergman.

30,sol-,My extended review of the film,10,5 November 2005,"After my first viewing of 'Persona' I was unsure what exactly to make of it. Even after a second viewing, it is still hard to say what exactly 'Persona' is about. This is not a negative trait though, but rather a curious characteristic. In fact, the overall film is perhaps best described as ""curious"". I would not call 'Persona' a flawless film, but regardless of whether Bergman's film is flawed or flawless, it stimulates one to think, and that is certainly a good quality. I will now provide some thoughts on the film, in light of having viewed it a second time. I do not know how valid all of my comments are - they are just some thoughts on the material. Unfortunately it is hard to discuss the film without possible spoilers, so be warned: my review may spoil a fresh experience of the movie.First and foremost, I would label 'Persona' as a horror film. After my initial viewing of the film, I had it down as a psychological drama, but now I think that it not only has elements of horror, but that it is dominantly a horror film. I guess it depends a lot on how you view the twist. I have heard other discuss how the two characters, Alma and Elisabeth, share the same personality - that they are the same person, but represent two personae for which every person has: the outer self (Alma, who talks) and the inner self (Elisabeth, who listens). This is quite an interesting theory, and after discussing it with some others who had seen the film, I became convince of the theory that Alma and Elisabeth are in fact the same person the whole time through.Now, it does not quite seem so clear. Watching it again, I was on the lookout for clues. There are some hints in that direction - the way the two women interact when together at the seaside property, the way that they seem to be opposites, but yet share similar ideas. The whole time I could sense communication even though, for the most part, only Alma was talking. However, Bergman throws in a number of elements that violate the theory that they are both the same person. Often he forces us to take the third person, stopping us from entering into the minds of either character. There is a female doctor in the mix, who communicates with both Alma and Elisabeth as if they are different persons. Then, there is also some narration by a man when the two women arrive at the seaside home.Yet, another theory comes into play, and a rather satisfying one. In one of their conversations, Alma tells Elisabeth that she feels that she could turn into her. She feels that they are so alike in subtle ways that they could easily become each other. Following the announcement of this idea, we hear Elisabeth finally say something that Alma ignores, but then repeats herself. Are they starting to become one another, like Alma had just talked about? It seems as if Elisabeth and Alma were separate persons, however something supernatural, for whatever reason, occurred and they suddenly either became one person or switched personalities.I still find it hard to work out what exactly Bergman is getting at, and his encouragement of the third person approach vexes me. I would not flaw the film too much for that though. Perhaps it was meant to be ambiguous. Bergman does a great job filming the material, and for skill this definitely gets top marks. The setting is excellent, and strangely reminiscent of 'The Seventh Seal' (plus notice how Ullmann looks like Death at times!). The bleakness of the sets is captured perfectly in black and white, with many close-ups to show the intimacy of the story. There is also one brilliantly filmed shot, in which the camera pans for an unbroken half minute or more, as the two women run across the beach.Bergman's vision of the material is startling good. When Mr. Vogler arrives on set, there is some triangular framing going on, with interesting shots positioning Elisabeth in a removed position from Alma and her husband, but yet with all three of them in frame. There is also the repeated segment in which we see the reaction of Elisabeth when Alma is talking to her, and then it switches to show the facial expressions of Alma. I would not praise all of Bergman's techniques here though. Some of his shots just go on from an incredibly long time without much reason, which could cause one to wonder whether he was just trying to buff up the short running time. There is a shot towards the beginning of the film in which Ullmann stares blankly for a whole minute or more, and there is another shot which focuses on an irrelevant task of cleaning up a broken pot. Some shots like those could have been cut shorter. The other part of Bergman's vision that I am not fond of is the beginning segment. While the child could possibly have meaning, some of the other images in the montage, such animal killings, crucifixions and cartoons, seem thrown in for the sake of it. The intermission, while rather chilling, annoys me a bit too. I am not sure if it was inserted in the best possible place, or how meaningful its images are. But that's all minor stuff.One last thing to praise is of course the acting. It is the acting, not the dialogue, which makes the film so intense during its middle section. When Andersson was describing her rendezvous on the beach, I was concentrating on her face, and that was telling me more than the subtitles. Ullmann also has a very expressive face, perfect for her somewhat muted character. I wish I could say more here, but I don't set the word limit.",Persona

It was not from the movie that you will watch it you will be speechless afterward. That was something that I expected to be and I was not. Although I have to say that the direction which made by Ingmar Bergman was really good and I also liked the interpretation of Bibi Andersson who played as nurse Alma. Another interpretation that has to be mentioned is Liv Ullmann's who played as Elisabeth Vogler and she was very good at it.Laastly I have to say that ""Persona"" is a good interesting movie just to spend your time but it has not something to make you crazy about and leave you as I said before speechless.

33,eddie_baggins,A genre-defining film,8,24 August 2021,"The granddaddy of psychological horror/thrillers as well as genuinely unnerving dramas, Ingmar Bergman's oft-debated and frequently analyzed 1966 black and white oddity Persona is a film that to this day remains a unique and hard to explain experience that no doubt gave birth to a range of directors and features that were born in the wake of this sometimes mesmerizing and sometimes perplexing feature length affair.A creation that feels as though it directly inspired films such as Black Swan and filmmakers along the lines of David Lynch and Darren Aronofsky, Persona is a an event that allowed Bergman to create an open to interpretation narrative centered around the off-putting friendship/relationship between Bibi Andersson's kindly nurse Sister Alma and Liv Ullmann's mute and troubled actress Elisabet Vogler as the famed director explores the very psyches of the human condition and what it means to be ones true self, in a tale that is likely going to take multiple screenings for viewers to come to some form of grips with.There's not a lot of incidents or big moments in the film as such, Bergman keeps things relatively low-key as he infuses constant close-ups and dialogue heavy scenarios prevalent throughout the tale of Alma's increasingly fragile mental state, that appears to be bought on by Elisabet's strange condition and their seclusion on a sparsely populated island but there's barely a moment in the film where you feel comfortable as a viewer, consistently on edge and doubting what you are seeing/hearing as you try to make heads and tails about who is who and what is happening to them.For those that love their films wrapped up in a neat package with answers forthcoming at most stops, Persona will likely feel like a frustrating movie watching experience but watching Bergman's directional craft at work as both a director and in this case screenwriter is a sight to behold and the performances of both Andersson and Ullmann feel ahead of their time with both actresses delivering what should be considered career best roles portraying tricky characters to bring to life.Watching these two actresses ply their trades as the fragile inner being of the two women becomes more apparent throughout the films runtime is a real cinematic delight and while the film may not be the ""perfect"" all-round feature some scholars and reputable film critics laud it to be, there's little point in trying to denying the impact Persona had on the future of film and its creators as one of the all-time greats created a unique and long-standing product with a formidable legacy following on in its path.Final Say -It may not be easy to fathom or simple to explain in words or thought but Persona is an important piece of the puzzle when it comes to key cinematic entries and its tension riddled vibe is always going too be hard to match.4 sun-baking outings out of 5.",Persona
34,johnnyboyz,The film is bound to attract as well as confuse any sorts of people that track down this sort of thing.,7,30 August 2008,"For all its bizarreness; avant-garde feel and totally disorientating visual style at points, Persona actually tells rather a straight forward narrative and adopts a relatively simple visual approach. The camera work is sly and unspectacular, relying on the film itself and its various bursts of disturbance to get across more of a 'bang' in the viewers mind and its story, with particular attention to the manner in which a relatively routine love story-come-psychoanalytical tale is told, is shot and unfolded using gentle camera-work and soft female voices to aid the visuals. Such a juxtaposition between visuals and timbre are the hallmarks of someone who knows what they're doing especially given the other visuals elements director Bergman includes.So about these other visual elements. The film begins with such a rapid display of images; it is difficult for the human eye to garner exactly what has just flashed up. This is after a slow and deliberate track into a person lying in a hospital, looking dead. The opening and closing montages which share the same powerful punch are two of the most eerie I've seen and rank up there with Elem Klimov's 1985 film Come and See and its closing display of images. But what does it all mean? Thrown in at the end of hands touching steamed up glass and odd looking creepy bugs crawling up same said panes is a projection unit playing rolls of developed film onto a white screen. I think to come up with a stone wall idea on what this means is futility of sorts. It could be Bergman reminding us that a film is still just a film and the following events (and events we've just seen) are obviously not real but the psychology behind the events to come (or just transpired) are real and do exist.This forces us to consider a complicated area: Sweden's (the nation that made the film) or indeed the world's attention to psychoanalysis and how much we are aware of such a thing. Although the film is produced several decades after the writings, it was made a mere six years after Hitchcock's Psycho which itself included such issues. Bergman's Persona covers the loneliness and isolation of a character named Alma (Andersson) who is a nurse and her gradual appreciation for hospital patient Elizabeth (Ullmann) after so many deviations and, quite possibly, regrets to do with and into the past of the life.But the film is a little more than a psychological study, even if by not very much. From my own viewpoint, no matter how wrong or how basic it may be or respectively sound, Alma suffers from this loneliness so much that to have the individual of Elizabeth around actually reminds her of what it's like to have human contact. Indeed, the contact is not a physical one and is not one as graphic as regressions into the past have us believe they used to be. One scene has Alma describe an orgy on a beach with males she did not know at the time and tells us of a friend who was also there but where is that friend now and what meaning does it have toward the larger scale of things? How did she become so 'unpopular' and secluded?There can be no denying that Alma comes across as a confident person and looking at the role she plays within the film, a nurse, you would think she needs attributes of charisma and a strong soul in order to combat any nastiness she might see on the job and to work up a strong communicative relationship with any doctor or patient she may come across. Incidentally, that scenario is played out in this film and makes me think that the film is somewhat purely a study of an individual loosing consciousness of what's around her but using the mute character of Elizabeth as a slow burning reason to tell the story. Either way, it's all very complicated but somewhat intriguing.Persona is the sort of film that gives you a headache but it's one of those 'nice' headaches you get when trying to work something out. Due to the sheer nature of the film and general inclusion of elements of the avant-garde, there cannot really be a stone wall conclusion to the film. Much like Luis Buñuel's early work, Persona is a mixed bag of interesting ideas and un-readable content  an exercise in futility from any non-qualified film personnel to read into and get marginally close to a correct reading. The film has its characters write letters; read the letters; question one's sanity; show us cameras and film stock being played; have the fourth wall being broken; give us metaphorical montages that are too quick to absorb and then have the audacity to render whatever reading we may have into it all incorrect. But I guess that's all part of the genius of Bergman.",Persona

36,SAMTHEBESTEST,One of the most complicated film ever and a Landmark Art Film experimenting in human personae philosophy.,8,5 July 2020,"Persona (1966) :
Brief Review -One of the most complicated film ever and a Landmark Art Film experimenting in human personae philosophy. Ingmar Bergman has always made out art from philosophy of human behaviour and personality even then when audience was not ready for such complexity. Persona comes out as his most tricky art form from 60s and arguably his toughest experiment ever. The film is about two women, or one if you prefer to reduce some complexity. A nurse is put in charge of a mute actress and finds that their personae are melding together. How both of them outbreaks thier past and regret is presented in artistic form. The film may be complicated to understand but very much engaging and interesting. Because there are no such wasted frames, even if you don't understand the plot you can still wonder and try to speculate the vision through technical environment. The first 5 minutes are shot in such way that you should brace yourself for ride of cine-conciousness and intricate storytelling. It is hard to believe for me that Bergman made this film in 60s cause it was far far ahead of its time, it even looks far ahead for today's time. The film revolves around two characters so almost entirely screen space is acquired by them. Bibi Andersson gets all the dialogues and transformation and she is Highly impressive. Liv Ullman stays quiet throughout the film except for couple of whispers but her expressions do the job for her role. Dialogues are tricky but comes out little easy. Cinematography is top class, you won't see so many experiments done by cameraman in any film of that time. Bergman's direction is outstanding and full of experiments not only in characters but also in technical aspects. Overall, Persona is a rare thrill ride that might leave your mind with lot of questions but a any smart movie buff wouldn't skip it and will get all answers. A dedal Classic !RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest",Persona
37,jzappa,You Must Retreat In Awe.,10,26 January 2009,"This, what could be Bergman's 27th effort as writer and director, is a film I've gone back to over the years, because over time I wish to work out what it truly means. Everything that we see in its way of communication, its dialect, its structure of implications are completely apparent. Its only mere evocations are of hidden realities, and we lose hope of finding them. It is about motherhood, or abandoning it. It is about existentialism, or a sensation of bewilderment and loss of nerve despite a deceptively vain and futile world. It is about being known too well for comfort, or whether or not that is possible.Elisabet, played by Bergman's girl Friday Liv Ullmann, stops speaking in the middle of a performance, and never again does. A psychiatrist thinks it might help if Elizabet and Nurse Alma, played by Bibi Andersson, spend the summer at her remote beach house. Seized in the same enveloped period of interval, the two women in some way fuse. Elizabet says nothing, and thus Alma feels free to talk at length, professing her hopes and her worries, and in time, confessing a truly sexy experience during which she was absolutely blissful.Bergman emphasizes the two actresses' resemblances in a disquieting shot where he merges halves of both faces. Soon after, he overlays the two whole faces, like a transmutation. Their visual amalgamation intimates a more entrenched intuitive pull. Elisabet, silent and seemingly in poor health, is a stronger presence than Alma, and in due course the nurse feels her psyche being permeated by the other woman. There is a very real instance when her bitterness channels in the arcane passages of her soul in the juxtaposingly sun-drenched patio of the lodge, where she gathers the shards of a broken glass, and then calculatingly leaves a piece where Elisabet will presumably stroll by. Elisabet cuts her foot, and we feel Bergman's familiarity with this sort of subterranean vindication as the execution of the act itself seems so unsuspecting, but still this is in effect a conquest for Elisabet, who has driven the nurse to forsake the order of her job and, literally, bring to light a failing of hers.At this second, Bergman lets his film to appear to shred and smolder as the picture goes bare before restructuring. This echoes the opening of this otherwise fairly straightforward movie. Both times, a projector lamp blazes, and there is a medley from the very dawn of cinema. The midpoint punctuates with the camera tightening in on an eye, and even into the veins in the eyeball, as if to penetrate it to the extent that a camera can.The beginning sequence could maybe imply that this self-reflexive picture is starting from scratch, with the origin of movies. The rupture in the median would then mean it returns and originates yet again. When the movie ends, the celluloid comes to a literal end and the lamp goes out. Is Bergman intimating that he has harked back to primary theories. Just before the end there is a shot of the actual movie crew, almost as if the film's central theme of merging is having a universal effect.The images and descriptions of the monologues in this sequence of variants on the subject of replication and coalescing is so commanding that Bergman truly reveals how ideas produce perceptions and certainty. One would have to be certain of what one is revealing in a film in which the plot changes through a noncausal order, entirely lacking the reverse cross-shooting audiences have grown so accustomed to in most films, replaced with simultaneous angles and point-of-view shots.When I think about it, there are only a couple of truly existent, or impartial, encounters in the story, the film altogether, each punctuated by rupturing the film, as if everything else is assembled by beliefs and feelings. Elisabet and Alma are only two or three times capable of infiltrating the trances that are their lives. The largest part of one's self-image is not complete familiarity with the rest of humanity, but a psychological transmission, like a movie, prepared by thoughts, dreams, recollections, media, interactions, jobs, faith and uncertainties. Elisabet opts to be who she is and Alma is not firm enough to elect not to be Elisabet.",Persona
38,Vartiainen,Who are we?,7,31 August 2017,"A film that starts with a collection of clips, from old movies to spiders to scenery to a lamb being slaughtered to a crucifixion. After which we delve deep into the psyche of two women and start asking questions. Is there or can there be a clearly defined self? If we are to assume that everything is a lie based on the fact that all of our existence is merely our brains interpreting signals sent by our senses, the truthfulness of which we have no way of confirming, is it then the most truthful thing of all to stop interacting with the world so as to not add to the lie? Can someone become someone else by knowing everything there is to be known about then, and even then are we that person or something else because we have our own memories as well?You know... art.Sometimes referred to as the Mount Everest of film critics, Persona by Ingmar Bergman is not an easy movie to get into. Countless papers have been written about it, and for a reason. Its plot is hard to follow and complicated, but at the same time you're keenly aware that it means something. Quite what that something is... well, that's up for debate.The story goes that a great actress Elisabet Vogler (Liv Ullmann) had ceased talking. She has been deemed mentally and physically healthy, but still she remains silent. She is sent to a distant beach-side house with Sister Alma (Bibi Andersson), her personal nurse, to heal. But soon Alma, being the only one who wants to talk, finds herself revealing more and more to this great presence, this great personality. More than she has ever revealed to anyone. It's almost like Elisabet is learning everything there is to know about her, but at the same time she's learning about her. And the blurring starts.The only clear theme in this film is that of identity. We are complex creatures. Our personalities are shaped by countless little things, from past events to falsely remembered memories, from something we once heard to the expectations of the society, from learned habits to the whims of nature. But how often we truly think about this. How malleable are our personalities? You are you, naturally, but who are you really?The film asks the questions, but doesn't provide much in the way of answers. But if there are no answers to be had or if the questions themselves are the journey's end, what then? Hard to say, but your first step on this path could be this film.",Persona
39,ackstasis,"""Your hiding place isn't watertight. Life trickles in from the outside, and you're forced to react.""",7,12 April 2008,"Ingmar Bergman's 'Persona (1966)' opens with a bewildering montage of sounds and images, a frenzied newsreel of sex, death, cinema and comedy. The sequence is so far removed from my previous experience with the director that its effect is jarring, shocking; I momentarily wondered if I'd hit a wrong button and started playing Buñuel's 'Un chien andalou (1929)' by mistake. I question Bergman's motives for including such an uncharacteristic opening, for it appears to have very little to do with the narrative that follows. Is this montage - an account of the sickening and concealed horrors and desires of society - a possible explanation for Elisabeth's continued silence? Even so, it all seems somewhat exploitative, as though Bergman was simply going for shock-value, obliterating any notions of subtlety with which I had begun to associate him {though I'll admit that the strength of 'The Seventh Seal (1957)' arose from its not-so-subtle representation of Death}. The opening scene concludes with a young boy awakening in the morgue, his hand outstretched towards the vague image of a woman's face. Elisabeth's unloved child? Alma's aborted fetus?An endless line of critics, it seems, have celebrated 'Persona' as a masterpiece, and among the greatest films ever made. I'd hate to be the lone voice of dissent, but the film is certainly the lesser of the three Bergmans I've hitherto seen, if only due to the noticeable absence of the good-natured humour to be found in both 'The Seventh Seal (1957)' and 'Wild Strawberries (1957)'. If, indeed, I were to describe 'Persona' as a masterpiece, it would be in regards to the visuals, which, photographed by long-time Bergman collaborator Sven Nykvist, are beyond description in their detail and intimacy. The film takes particular interest in the human face, and entire conversations of words and emotions are played out through the communication of the eyes, and the glimmering hint of a smile on the lips. There is one immortal moment in the film when Bergman juxtaposes the faces of each woman onto the screen, merging Elisabeth (Liv Ullmann) and Alma (Bibi Andersson) into a single entity.Persona also includes one of the most vivid depictions of sex that I've ever seen. Though the film shows us nothing, Alma's whispered description of an intimate encounter on the beach is staggering in its effectiveness; her words allow the viewer to formulate their own visuals, every emotion and nuance perfectly incorporated from the rich story we are being told. Though I may exhaust hours spouting the merits of Ingmar Bergman's film, I can't escape the fact that watching 'Persona' felt very much like a chore. The film boasts a relatively short running time, but it never seems to attain any comfortable sense of rhythm, and, by the film's end, I was left wondering just what the film was trying to get at. Bergman includes various allusions to Bertolt Brecht's ""Verfremdungseffekt"" effect  highlighting the inherent artificiality of the cinematic medium  with the film at one point appearing to burn; but, unlike in Fellini's '8½ (1963),' these self-referential flourishes seem to serve little foreseeable purpose. Am I looking too far into this film for meaning? Or am I not looking far enough? Even just hours afterwards, another layer of meaning has unfurled itself. Maybe it'll get better.",Persona
40,runamokprods,"A remarkable, and remarkably challenging puzzle of a film",9,21 April 2012,"Originally some the earlier Bergman films harder for me to get into, because most of the Bergman I saw first were from late in his career and far more 'naturalistic' – 'Fanny and Alexander', 'Autumn Sonata', 'Scenes From a Marriage' etc. I don't think I understood that for much of his great career he was as much an experimentalist (at times) as David Lynch, or Fellini, or Kubrick or Godard. Now that understand that, it's easier for me to get excited by the earlier experimental work. Also, with 'Persona' the experiment seems more subtle and complex than in some of Bergman's other early work. The themes are right out in the open but there's much less literalness in the questions. The whole FILM is a series of questions, but posed in a poetic way – what is identity? What is acting? What is film? What are the boundaries between people? What is reality and what is a dream, both in this film, and in our own experiences?This is a haunting deeply disturbing work, and part of it's very effectiveness is it's 'unexplainability', ala '2001' or a Magritte painting. Like a Koan, it forces you to try and make sense of something that has no simple answer. On first viewing there were a few times when things felt a little on the nose, or my feeling of 'huh?' was the bad kind, not the good one.But this is a fascinating film, that combines some of the most truly dreamlike sequences I've ever seen with what seems a conventional narrative, only to curve in on itself into obscurity yet again. It is ultimately the kind of puzzle that art does best – it makes you ponder things both consciously and subconsciously at the same time. The two lead performances by Bibi Anderson and Liv Ullmann are extraordinary, and Sven Nykvist again creates a series of unforgettable images (now with the wider palate that Bergman started towards in 'The Silence' – more camera moves, more 'cinematic' angles.). But the nexus of this film, isn't the acting or the photography (though the film would fail miserably without both being great), this is a film about the inside of the filmmaker's mind, and by extension the inside of all of our minds as we fight to make sense of the lives we lead.It also has the single most erotic scene where nothing physical happens I've ever encountered. And it's that kind of paradox that 'Persona' is all about. I know I will get more from repeated viewings. The film begs for it. It's also impossible to note how many films since have borrowed its techniques and images. Indeed, after the rare moments I felt dismissively 'we've seen this idea before', I'd realize 'no we HADN'T seen it before Bergman made this film'.",Persona
41,st-shot,"Bergman, Nykvist at the top of their game.",9,20 August 2008,"Famed actress Elizabeth Vogler suddenly goes silent during a performance, perplexing specialists in search of its cause. They put her under the care of Alma, a nurse who is to monitor her therapy in an isolated house along the rocky Swedish coastline. With Alma doing all the talking she soon forgets boundaries, revealing personal intimate details to the mute actress whom she has grown to trust. When she finds out her trust has been betrayed Alma lashes out.I'm not certain how much of Swedish film director Ingmar Bergman's highly personal work I understand. The film opens with a prologue of sorts, a dream sequence (Elizabeth's? Bergman's? Both?) that for me become puzzle pieces which for the rest of the film I attempt to fit into the narrative. Confusing as this is Persona is a fascinating watch of beautifully lit scenes and some of the the most devastating use of close-up since silent film. Bibi Anderson's Alma gives one of the finest performances of the decade as she is run through a full emotional gamut by the enigmatic Elizabeth, played with an incredible haunting silence by Liv Ullman. This is achieved in large part by the masterful camera work of Sven Nykvist whose ground breaking work in Persona astounds to this day.Worked into Bergman's requisite death and desperation templates there are nebulous undertones of adolescent masturbatory fantasy and artistic self loathing as well as physical and emotional sadism. His use of jarring music in tense moments has a thriller mawkishness to it but with Nykvist documenting his vision and Anderson and Ullman performing it Persona is a startling piece of cinema.",Persona
42,GiraffeDoor,Needs a remake. Come on America!,4,8 October 2019,"This could have really worked as a sweet little film but it just drowns in its own over-ambition.I sort of like how it explores how two seemingly different kind of women actually have a lot in common, they're just different points of the same journey. But the thing takes itself so seriously. It's absolutely sincere: no irony. I like stylized film making but this takes it too a new level. We're talking things like images of movie cameras and how it's sort of blurry and then snaps to clear.The effect for me is that it simply eclipses the substance of the movie. The characters (like most Bergman's movies) aren't really well developed. They're more like psychiatric case studies than an actual three dimensional character.So, yeah, it's an experience. It's hard to be taken seriously if you don't love this movie because they had some kind of meeting and stamped this movie as technically good or something.

The film opens with a style of an experimental film with seemingly unrelated imagery abruptly flashing across the screen. From several minutes of quick cuts, the film launches into longer and calmer scenes that explains the core story. During a presentation, a famous actress, Elisabet Vogler, suddenly becomes mute and has been put in the care of psychiatric nurse named Alma. Sent to recover at a seaside house, Alma tries to break Elisabet's silence by talking to her. During her long solo conversations, she talks and shares very personal stories and the more she seems to unearth the more she works through her own emotions. Her dialogs seems to be with Elisabet or is it really herself? The film has highly symbolic cinematography that leads the viewer to wonder if Elisabet is real or is the film personifying Alma's internal thoughts and struggles? Two actresses carry the film and it is really unique to have one portray such emotions with uttering just a couple words. This is certainly a film worth studying and rewatching.",Persona

The film manages to seem impenetrable and highly simplistic at the same time. Abetted by Sven Nykvist's stunning B&W cinematography, this was and is Bergman's greatest achievement. It's haunting, frustrating, and at times even funny. Liv Ullmann, as the actress, and Bibi Andersson as the nurse, give performances that have justifiably become legendary. Andersson appears to do most of the heavy lifting as she has nearly all of the dialog and while her performance is tremendous, Ullmann is just as good projecting some pretty hideous angst from her silent face.",Persona

I'm just warning you gentler folks out there that this may be too offensive to watch.In the first 2 minutes we see an erect penis and a gory calf slaughter and disembowelment. (By the way, it's not just ""stock footage"". It's Bergman's trademark camera technique which prompts me to believe that Bergman ordered the slaughter whilst he filmed it. Classy.) That's all I have to say, but just for the sake of meeting the IMDb 10-line minimum, I'll inject one opinion. And it's just an OPINION, gang, so calm down. I believe it is easy--if not amateur & pedantic--to shock an audience with animal slaughters and genitalia. Any pervert with a camera can do that. But what I consider true art is the subtlety of presentation. Movies like Kurosawa's ""Ikiru"", Chukhrai's ""Ballad of a Soldier"" or even Bergman's own ""Seventh Seal"" are fine examples of poetic subtlety which carry powerful (ofttimes shocking) themes, and they don't resort to schlocky in-yer-face tricks like this in the name of ""art"" (a much better use of your time would be listening to and reading the accompanying short story of David Bowie's ""Outside"", a scifi rock opera about ""art murders"").

Franz Kafka said of books that the best ones should be 'the axe for the frozen sea within us,' meaning that books should hit us hard and make us reevaluate our lives and how we're living; this is a film that does that to me. Every time I watch it, it makes me want to take a step back from my life and reevaluate my persona, and ask myself: Why do I do the things I do? What do I believe about the world?

51,davidmvining,"Complex, beautiful, and difficult. It's also incredibly worthwhile.",10,25 November 2019,"Four-fifths of the way into my second viewing of Persona within a week, I placed my hands on my head and exclaimed, ""I got it!""Out of all the Ingmar Bergman films I've seen, Persona is easily the most difficult. Others have difficult subject matters or portray difficult situations with clarity, but Persona is the first where I thought I understood what was happening both literally and thematically but I simply could not connect with it. What convinced me to give it a second try so soon after my first foray into it on this Bergman odyssey (I had seen it once before in college) was the film's reputation as a masterpiece and one of Bergman's best. If the movie didn't have that reputation, I would have pumped out a 3-star review and called it quits. Instead, I insisted on a second viewing, which I am very glad that I did. Because, you know, I got it.In between my first and second viewings, I read a bit about Persona. I read the essay included with the Criterion Collection box set and I read Roger Ebert's Great Movie review. Neither did the work of convincing me on their own that what I had watched was a masterpiece, but Ebert's in particular gave me advice on how to watch.The thing about Persona is that it is unbelievably dense. Every word, image, and cut betrays some meaning. That density invites a host of different, often conflicting, interpretations which is a lot to process when the audience isn't quite sure what they're even looking at to begin with.Alright, enough of that, what's the story?An actress, Elisabet Vogler, stopped speaking in the middle of a performance of Electra and has been admitted to a hospital. A young nurse, Sister Alma, has been assigned to Elisabet, but Alma has doubts about her ability in the face of what she sees to be an obviously difficult task. The two end up sent to a remote house on the Swedish coast where they spend some time together. Alma continues to speak almost endlessly to the point that she confesses to an infidelity against her fiancé in rather explicit detail. The two women steadily look more and more alike and Alma seems to change. There's a scene where Elisabet enters Alma's room at night and the two seem to merge. There's another where Elisabet's husband arrives and confuses Alma for Elisabet to the point that they (probably) make love. It all comes to a head in a scene that actually plays twice in a row. Alma finds Elisabet with a torn image of the actress's son, and Alma cuts deeply into Elisabet's past and identifying exactly how Elisabet feels about her son (all while Elisabet had never said a word about it).My ""I got it!"" moment came in that scene.Bergman's always been about people more than anything else. His topic and the focus of his lens is the human face. He wasn't going to abandon that the second he decided to use an experimental montage to open his film. I referenced something that Roger Ebert wrote that helped open up the movie for me, and it was this (paraphrased): Read the movie literally. So, I watched the movie as literally as possible. I shoved aside the idea that the two women might actually be one (something that may still be possible) or everything about dreams (I take those scenes as literally happening), and I saw the story of two women finding a way to connect.Both try to connect with the other for different reasons. Alma wants to connect with Elisabet in order to discover how to convince the patient to speak again. Elisabet wants to connect with Alma as research for a part. Neither can understand the other at first. They look different, dress differently, and (even considering Elisabet's silence) they interact with the world differently. Quickly, once they reach the coast, they begin to dress alike. First it's a pair of hats that are of similar styles (Alma's extends down implying a more limited view while Elisabet's brim is flat implying that she's looking further out), then their clothes begin to resemble each other. There's one point where Alma leans over with Elisabet in the background, and it's impossible to discern where the shirt of one begins and the other ends.When we finally get to the scene where Alma reveals Elisabet's core issue, it suddenly became obvious. We are watching two women trying to understand each other at the deepest levels, and the only way to make that happen is to inhabit the other person completely. There's the core of the film. There's the emotional center that drives the stylistic and visual nuances throughout the film (in particular the moment the two women's faces are superimposed over each other). The framing device is part of that as well. The framing device is filled with images of early cinema and finally a boy trying to touch a large face behind a glass. This implies that there will always be a barrier between people on the two sides of a screen, meaning that we, the audience, can only ever get so close to the people we are watching.My breakthrough on the film would actually work quite well with the idea that there is only one woman and that the whole movie is actually just a split-second of time where Elisabet was frozen in the middle of a performance. I haven't thought through the idea, though. Another viewing could bring that more to the forefront.And that's the other key to Persona's power. It's so rich that it allows for this kind of exploration across multiple viewings. I remember reading a comment from someone on a message board about how a movie that didn't grab him on a first viewing was unworthy of a second. I'm so glad I don't subscribe to that line of thinking. If I did, I would have seen Persona once in college, not understood it, and never bothered to revisit it at all, much less twice in one week more than a decade later.",Persona
52,Amyth47,BERGMAN'S PERSONA IS A MULTI-LAYERED PSYCHODRAMA.,9,19 September 2018,"My Rating : 9/10In Bergman's sensual psychodrama, a nurse, Alma (Bibi Andersson), takes care of stage actress Elisabet Vogler (Liv Ullmann), who has recently been struck mute.However, their personalities change completely and irrevocably by the film's finale, in which they are depicted as distrustful, angry and consumed by their own shortcomings.David Lynch's Mulholland Dr. was inspired by this and I love it so much.'Persona' is one of Bergman's most accessible films after 'The Seventh Seal' and is a must-watch. Those willing to delve deeper must enter Bergman's stream of consciousness whereby both the persons - the nurse and the actress are actually the same person.",Persona
53,Galina_movie_fan,'The human face is the great subject of the cinema. Everything is there',10,18 June 2004,"When talking of Bergman, critics and viewers usually name Wild Strawberries, The Seventh Seal, Cries and Whispers ahead of Persona. While those films are all amazing and stay very high on my list of all time favorites, for me, the truly unique and inspirational s 'Persona' - Bergman's enigmatic masterpiece.The story is seemingly simple: ""A nurse, Alma (Bibi Andersson), has been assigned to care for a famous actress, Elizabeth (Liv Ullman), who suddenly stopped speaking during a performance of Electra and has remained silent ever since. When they go to stay in a seaside house owned by Alma's psychiatrist colleague, the apparently self-confident nurse gradually reveals more and more of herself in the face of Elizabeth's silence, and is shocked to read a letter the actress has written implying that Alma is an interesting case-study. The two women seem almost to exchange identities, or to become one (strikingly expressed visually in a famous shot); in a dream sequence (or perhaps fantasy), Elizabeth's husband comes to visit and seems to think that Alma is his wife. Finally Alma, back in her nurse's uniform, catches a bus to go home, leaving the almost-mute Elizabeth alone.""Whether Alma was able to get her identity back remains one of the film's many questions. What is absolutely wonderful in the film  performances from two actresses. Anderson is the one who has to carry almost the entire dialog, her voice is one of the film's priceless treasures while Ullman is equally powerful in expressing hundreds of emotions through her face and eyes. Sven Nykvist's camera, the third star of the film makes two stars shine so bright.Each scene in 81 minutes long film is memorable, some of them just unforgettable. For instance, the long scene where Alma reveals her most intimate memories of a sexual encounter with two boys while sunbathing nude with another girl on an empty beach, is infinitely more erotic to listen to than it would have been to see in flashback. There is so much to think about in Persona. One major question concerns Elizabeth's silence: is it elective, as happens in Tarkovsky's ""Andrei Rublyov"" , or is it some kind of mental breakdown?. The documentaries about the war horrors that Elizabeth watches on TV suggest the former; the fact that it suddenly happens during a stage performance of ""Electra"" suggests the latter. I keep thinking about it. Why ""Electra"" of all plays? The story of the daughter who hated her mother and wanted her dead  does it reflect the accusation brought up by Alma that Elizabeth did not love her deformed son and wanted him dead? Did Elizabeth become so overwhelmed by guilt realizing that her life reminded so much of Electra's story? We don't know for sure, and Bergman does not help. The identical monologue in which Alma is accusing Elizabeth is the film's resolution. We hear it twice: first time, camera is concentrating on Elizabeth's face, second time  on Alma's. Is Alma talking about Elizabeth or herself or both? After that encounter on the beach, Alma became pregnant and had an abortion. The monologue may reflect her feelings of guilt and emptiness as well as Elizabeth's. Does it really happen? Is Elizabeth a vampire sucking the life out of her victims only to use them as characters for her acting roles? Is that the ultimate price the artist is paying for being a great artist? Does he need lives and souls of others to be able to create? Can he/she love the ones who utterly depend on them and need their love? This film and later Autumn Sonata (1978) with Ingrid Bergman as a concert pianist show famous stars as selfish women who can't and don't love their children. The same question was brought up also in the earlier ""Through a Glass Darkly (1961)"" - in the relationship of the writer and his daughter. Then there is the question of whether there are really two women at all; could the whole film be played out as a fantasy of one of them, or indeed of somebody else? Is there a sexual attraction between the two women? It might be or might be not. I believe, David Lynch has watched ""Persona"" very carefully, thought about it and used some of its ideas in his own ""Mullholland Dr."" There are so many questions in this incredible film that are left unanswered. For almost forty years, viewers and filmmakers alike have been trying to find the answers. One thing is obvious  this is one of the films you want to watch over and over again. I think it should be seen by any viewer. If you've seen it already  see it again. You'll learn something new. If you have not seen it  you are in for a great experience. See it for Sven Nykvist's camera work, for Liv's face, for Bibi's voice, for the unique and mysterious world that is Ingmar Bergman's universe.",Persona
54,nycritic,Who Am I?,10,22 February 2005,"When I viewed PERSONA recently, I didn't know what exactly to make of it: what was it telling me, what was its intentions, its ultimate meaning. Not being a conventional director by far, I felt that Bergman had deliberately left all this 81 minute of storytelling to me to figure out... and I may have been right, but I either wasn't getting it or this was too much of an abstract film to merit any analysis, so my review was at face value and even ended with the sentence ""this is exactly how Bergman wants it."" Seeing it later more emerges, and the deeper story takes place even if it still seems linear: Elisabeth Vogler (Liv Ullmann) loses her speech midway through Electra and will not speak again (except once throughout the entire film, and in an imagined sequence). There is no apparent reason as to why she has lost her speech, and the only hint is the horror she witnesses on the television as war, genocide, and destruction rage on. Other than that it is never alluded to, her muteness.Into the picture comes Alma (Bibi Andersson), the nurse who is put to her care by the suggestion of a psychiatrist. Both retreat to an isolated home. Seeing that Elisabeth will not talk, Alma fills space and time with her own erratic ramblings that take shape and form, a need to fill a void, and that void is of course, Elisabeth, who listens and listens and listens impassively yet with interest. Alma's stories are a form of confession: if Elisabeth is the mute who bears the scars of the world, Alma is the conveyor who purges inner traumas and erotic experiences, hurtful on a lesser scale. The fact she has been laid so naked to the woman she is trying to rehabilitate and the fact she learns this very woman considers her an interesting subject suddenly shocks her: from being caring, she turns vindictive. A shard of glass left deliberately to have Elisabeth step over is the catalyst: the images break, abstract images take place again, and the story re-starts. But one wonders, what if Elisabeth stepped over the glass with equal deliberateness? After all, she does need Alma. And she is an actress foremost. This moment is the one that amps up the tension between the women and even then they become closer, so close Elisabeth's husband thinks Alma is her as Elisabeth quietly allows this to happen. Is Elisabeth re-living some form of event through Alma? Is Alma the only way another secret involving Elisabeth's child can come through? Whatever the reason, Alma is clearly a conduit for Elisabeth to come forth and the merging of their similar faces is the culmination of this haunting psycho-drama that goes beyond its cinematic boundaries. No clear resolutions except the almost casual references that explain both women's return to their own sense of normalcy, but this somehow inconclusive ending is what gives it the weight of a great story and excellent Bergman. Reality here is what is so common to us: who we see ourselves as, how others see us, how self-identification becomes self-preservation through the experiences of others, good or bad or a combination of both. Pain and ecstasy are a part of our make-up, and PERSONA is the best example of the merging of the two.",Persona
55,bandw,"Transfixing, no matter what you make of the story",10,21 February 2008,"This is the account of an intense relationship between two women: Elisabeth (Liv Ullman), an actress who stopped talking in the middle of a performance of ""Electra"" and withdrew from life, and Alma (Bibi Anderson) who is a nurse assigned to her care. The two of them wind up in a cottage on a lonely island and that is where things gets interesting, but more than a little ambiguous. I'm sure there are many film studies theses written on various interpretations of this film. Where the two women really just two sides of the same woman? Was theirs a lesbian relationship? Was their relationship a power struggle? Was it a dream? Was it a battle of egos? What parts were imagined and what real? Is the film primarily a study of how two strong personalities affect each other? Did Elisabeth retreat in response to the horrors of the world? Was her withdrawal a rational response to the lack of meaning in life? And so on, with almost an infinite number of interpretations. For me, it is a study of how it is virtually impossible for people to know each other, or perhaps to know anything. No matter what your interpretation is, or even if you have no interpretation, this film scores big on several counts. It is one of the finest examples of black and white cinematography you are ever likely to see. Black and white cinematography seems to be an art form of the past. I don't know if modern black and white film stock is not of the same quality, if directors and cinematographers have lost the skill, or what, but modern attempts, like Woody Allen's ""Manhatten"" or George Clooney's ""Good Night and Good Luck,"" lack the sharpness of the old films of the 50s and 60s. And the ability to realize the potential of the art form seems to have been lost as well. So, just the sheer beauty and quality of the cinematography is one reason to see this. Faces are much more interesting in black and white than in color and this film is about faces. I think we will never again see a film that so elegantly portrays the faces of two beautiful women. In close-ups, silhouettes, or in paired compositions, the effect is stunning. What a love poem to two women Bergman has given us, and what powerful performances the women gave him.There are several soliloquies that enthrall. One long wonderful segment has the exact same dialog spoken with the camera on Alma and then repeated verbatim with the camera on Elisabeth. And Alma's description of a youthful sexual experience with two adolescences is, I think, more erotic than if that scene had actually been filmed.There has been nothing like this film, nor is there likely to be.

One of these women is possibly Alma, a young nurse who is assigned by a doctor to see a patient, Elisabet Vogler. Elisabet is a stage actress who has suddenly fallen silent and still, although the doctors have determined it is not a result of physical illness or hysteria, but willpower. While at the hospital, Alma reads Elisabet a letter from her husband, which comes with a photo of their son that Elisabet tears. She also becomes distressed seeing TV footage of monk Thích Quảng Đức's self-immolation in the Vietnam War. The doctor decides Elisabet will recover better in a cottage by the sea, and sends Alma and Elisabet there.While at the cottage, Alma talks to Elisabet, remarking no one has ever really listened to her before. She speaks about her first affair and her fiancé, Karl-Henrik. One night, she relates how, while in a relationship with Karl-Henrik, she was sunbathing in the nude with a woman she had just met named Katarina, when two young boys came along.

57,DeeNine-2,Beyond Interpretation,10,27 June 2001,"Someone who has read a biography of Ingmar Bergman would probably be able to offer an intelligent interpretation of this very personal film by the great Swedish director. Since it stars his two most famous proteges, Bibi Andersson and Liv Ullmann, and is an intense focus on their faces as though to look into their souls, and further since during the film their personas merge as one--given all this, perhaps it could be speculated that Bergman is suggesting that his perfect love would be a composite of the two. Certainly part of the erotic power of this stunningly filmed masterwork (black and white cinematography by the gifted Sven Nykvist) is the evocative display of the two Swedish actresses, who were respectively, 30- and 26-years-old, when the film was made. It is curious however that Bergman is very deliberate in downplaying their sexuality. They are never coquettish, nor openly sexual. Very little skin is exposed and that only incidentally. It is their differing power as actresses that is explored with some, no doubt, deliberate and unavoidable revelation of their real life personalities.I was particularly impressed with Bibi Andersson's performance. She plays, Alma, a young and naive nurse who is called upon to help rehabilitate Liv Ullmann's Elisabeth Vogler, an actress who suddenly stopped talking. Andersson has a beautiful and expressive voice that should be heard, so avoid a dubbed version (if it exists). It is true that the subtitles are occasionally ungrammatical and full of typos (and at one point a misleading term is used to avoid a gross sexual expression), but it doesn't matter because everything is very clear; indeed one could view this without the subtitles and without knowing Swedish and still get a fair idea of what is going on. Liv Ullmann is also brilliant in a part that has her on camera for most of the film but without a single speaking line! Nurse Alma does all the talking and something curious happens. She becomes the ""patient,"" spilling out the intimate details of her life while Elisabeth becomes in a sense the (superior) shrink, and a ""transference"" takes place. This is no doubt a Bergman joke (he was no fan of psychotherapy), but it is also a statement about the power of silence. Elisabeth stopped speaking during a performance of the Greek tragedy Electra, and of course we have all heard of the Electra Complex, the female equivalent of the Oedipus Complex so beloved of psychoanalytic theory. However what Bergman's point here is, I have no idea. I do know that in the last two Bergman films I have viewed, this and Autumn Sonata (1978) with Ingrid Bergman as a concert pianist, the star is a selfish woman who does not love her children. Here, we have Alma tearing into Elisabeth with the accusation that she hates her son and wishes he was dead. Since Ingmar Bergman both wrote and directed this film, one might reasonably ask what this has to do with the psyche of the master. The fact that an older man makes love to both women is also grist for the mill of an autobiographical interpretation.However, I am Against Interpretation in this case (although clearly a film like this cries out for it) and more in favor of experience. A work of art can always be interpreted and sometimes should, but always it is essential to first experience the work. If I ever see this film again, and after reading up on the life and loves Ingmar Bergman, perhaps I will look for what Persona says about him. Meanwhile, I am content to observe that this is an original work of art, and as always with Bergman, an emotionally draining experience.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon!)",Persona
58,frankde-jong,A relatively modern film that however has not aged well,7,25 February 2021,"Many (among whom Bergman himself) consider ""Persona"" an important film in his oeuvre. Also today it has one of the highest IMDB ratings of all Bergman films.I am not so sure about this film. In my opinion this story of patient and nurse gradually trading places has not aged as well as other Bergman films. It is evident that this film was made in a time that Freudian psycho analysis was taken much more seriously than it is today. No matter how different, in this respect ""Persona"" has the same weakness as for example ""Spellbound"" (1945, Alfred Hitchcock).""Persona"" is however quite innovative in another respect. Most directors do everything possible to make the audience forget they are watching a movie. In ""Persona"" Bergman reminds his audience on a couple of moments very explicitly they are watching a movie. An approach that is still relatively modern today (see for another example ""Dogville"" (2003, Lars von Trier) with its non realistic set pieces).",Persona
59,Cosmoeticadotcom,"Good, but not in ways expected",9,15 September 2008,"Persona, Ingmar Bergman's 1966 black and white film, reminds me of Herman Hesse's novella Siddhartha. Not in the subject matter, but in that both works of art perfectly marry their messages with their forms, and both say so much with so little a narrative spine. In that sense, both are great works of art that transcend any of the discomfit their often dubious artistic and social claims make. Persona has only four main actors, two of which dominate the film, and only one of which speaks. That would be a 25 year old nurse, sister Alma (Bibi Andersson), who is hired to take care of a famous stage actress who has had a nervous breakdown and refuses to speak. This is Elisabet Vogler (Liv Ullman). The other two actors who appear and speak are Mr. Vogler (Gunnar Björnstrand), who makes a brief hallucinatory appearance late in the film, and the doctor of the asylum where Elisabet is housed and where Alma works (Margaretha Krook). The title, also, given that Elisabet is an actress, has been endlessly argued over, even though it's perhaps the most manifest part of the film. In his defense, I think Bergman realized that he could not make too long a film out of this material, lest be charged with filmic narcissism, so wisely it only clocks in at about an hour and twenty minutes, for there are loads of people willing to overpraise this film for Bergman, without relying on himself to do so. That said, Bergman does give a little bit of narration, to most manifestly inject himself into the proceedings, as he does in shots where Elisabet is his surrogate, physically guiding Alma in her scenes with Mr. Vogler.Bergman takes the usual smug swipes at artists- that they are selfish, lazy, narcissistic, etc., but these are rather hollow moments, as true as they may often be. So are those moments involving pain, ecstasy, truth, ego and superego, and their critique. The real core of the film comes from the most artificial of the artifices. That Bergman acknowledges that art is all artifice (they come from the same Latin root, as I've long championed) it can never be reality nor truth, therefore, what the film really declaims is that all human pretensions to the nobility of art and truth and suffering are just that, pretensions. That so few people and critics have not realized that Bergman is not attacking the 'deep' questions of existence, in this film, but affirming the immediacy of the shallow, is part of the film's brilliance. And this is true, whether or not Bergman claims it so, because the intent of the artist is meaningless. Once the art is completed, he or she has no more claim over it than any other interested percipient of it.That all said, the film is a technical tour de force due to the stellar camera work of cinematographer Sven Nykvist. The composition and lighting of every scene is breathtaking, heightened by the black and white (mixed with multiple grays), which is the true coin of the dream state, which this film fully exploits. Also, other than Alma's speaking, much of the rest of the film works as a de facto silent film, recalling to me the great Carl Theodor Dreyer film Vampyr, or Roman Polanski's Repulsion, which came out a year earlier. Both films are superior to Persona, for both have better tales, and are less self-conscious. Repulsion was set in a real world setting, and took off from there, while Persona is all artifice, with experimentation at its core. But that fact does not deny Persona its own form of greatness. There are numerous scenes which blatantly and slyly reference vampires, and Persona seems to have lifted much of its imagery and symbolism from Polanski's film, and Bergman's own earlier The Silence. Persona is indeed a horror film, in the sense that all horror is based internally, not in monsters manifested externally.Many critics refer to this film as deconstructive or Postmodern, but they are again missing the point. Those terms are merely inward terms, gawking at the art. That is only the veneer of this film, the toolkit used, as it gazes outward at the viewer. The film, however, is a small film, in every sense of the term, which holds up a mirror to the viewer, not the art it is. In that sense, it is anti-deconstructive, for the art is what it is, and the viewer is the subject matter under examination. The acting by Andersson and Ullman is consummately fine, especially with Ullman's realistic and hyper-realistic acting without words. Only four decades into the talky era, she has utterly shed all of the artifices silent films' acting required, and the acting and visual virtuosity of the film are more than enough to cancel out the hollow psychology, and dated artsy clichés.Persona is self-conscious, narcissistic, and not too psychologically deep, for there is no real reason offered for Alma's identification with Elisabet, nor her breakdown, but it is the ultimate style over substance film, and as such attains its true greatness, despite the visual sleight of hand that leads many to be sucked into its hollow posturing as some source of great depth. But, more so, it's a grandly entertaining film, more than it is a deep one, giving the psychologically naïve much to talk about as Bergman deceives the viewer into deep thought over the shallow. As such, it was most deserving of its Oscar for Best Foreign Film in the year of its release, but I urge every viewer to ignore any reviews of the film beforehand, even this one, for a naked approach to it is the only way to fully plumb its essence. Good luck.",Persona
60,jromanbaker,The Silence of the World,10,19 January 2021,"I like many of Bergman's films and mainly his earlier ones. It is because of this that I have resisted watching his later films, or to be more exact those that came after ' Persona '. I have even resisted watching ' Persona ' which I admit to being a mistake, but on reflection perhaps it is more ' modern ' than it was in 1966 and more accessible in 2021, so the timing for me is right. Like the retreat into silence many of us are doing, fearful of others and isolating Liv Ullman's retreat is ours. We watch in horror as she sees the terrible images on her television screen as we do now.. In 1966 it was the image of a man burning himself alive as the crowd surges by, and the terror and incomprehension of a child at gunpoint, hands pitifully held up and being led to a concentration camp. This is the world, and its fairly recent past that she shrinks from, as we do out of perhaps personal necessity ourselves when we gaze at our present images with equal terror. Too much has been written of Bergman's coldness as if this was just a Modernist exercise in abstraction. I take the opposite view; it sears and burns with passion, as she is confronted by Bibi Andersson playing her nurse who speaks too much first in friendship then in hostility. I will not give away more, and this is not a thriller but a profound examination on states of mind living in the vital world of human communication and being remote from it. Bergman shows with precision how this can lead to the ' nothing ' which is the one word Liv Ullman is forced to say. Is ' Persona ' one of the ten best films ever made ? I think we can all make our lists, but we should resist what is told us and not be over reverent of critic's choices. Objectively the film is incredibly well made and visually as near to perfect as it can be. The great Sven Nykvist was responsible for the visual excellence, but Berman, magician that he could be is the creator and for me it is the apotheosis of all that he achieved. The true greatness of it is that it is open to so many interpretations, and although I deny some written here I respect them and choose my own. The silence of not speaking, and the silence of talking too much can both open Pandora's box, and the demons within are let loose. Our freedom is to choose a balance, which the silence of the tormented child led away is forced to endure, and that brings us to today. Let readers of this review draw their own conclusions.",Persona
61,jromanbaker,Silence,10,19 January 2021,"So much has been written about this film. The great thing about it is the many interpretaions that can be written down about it. I think it is the tragedy she sees around her that makes Liv Ullman fall into silence, an actor who sees while performing ' Elektra ' that all theatre and perhaps artistic interpretaion are essentially false. When the superb actor Bibi Andersson as her nurse takes care of her she listens to stories of ' life,' especially the confessions the nurse makes about her past. Is she studying the nurse or is the nurse just draining her ? Set on an island they are divorced from the world and friendship ( silent though Liv Ullman remains ) turns into hostility and violence. It is a gruelling, magnificent film. I think it is the highest point in Ingmar Berman's work and a film that is to be watched many times. Sven Nykvist is behind the camera. A great artist in himself who added radiance to many films, and that I for one miss in the world of cinema. Another interpretation. Maybe we should all be silent about this film, and the paradox is no words can adequately do it justice.",Persona

I had gone as far as I could go"" The significant words said by the director direct our thought towards the very core idea of the movie. Therefore, what I intend to emphasize in the review is not the content. That has been discussed by many people reliably. I would like to concentrate on the director's psychological masterwork and his captivating perception of human nature.Indeed, when deciding to see this film, one has to go deeper than usually, one has to let oneself be absorbed by the unique world of the film and by the absolutely stunning insights into our acts and decisions. Since Bergman did not care about the commercial success of the movie, he let himself do the 'unbelievable' on screen, he let the human nature to be portrayed in the unknown manner touching the very gist of PERSONAlity. At the same time, he remains different, realistic by placing his film at the very concrete moment in the history of cinema. Seldom can we find such intense minutes on screen, such powerful manifestation of 'ego' combined with a specific inner world. Seldom can we find a movie so honest to show the fire in the projector and melting reels; simply images which seem to say to the mind: ""That's how the story is broken...It's only a fiction, one little moment in the history of cinematic art."" However, what a fiction it is! What a moment!Except for Bergman's flawless direction, the man who supplies us with memorable experience in this film is Sven Nykvist. His photography allows us to see the striking contrasts of images that represent the inner world contrasted to the outer reality. Let me just mention the close-ups to the symbolic images where light clashes with darkness, where sacrifice clashes with selfish pleasure, where the old clashes with the young; yet, where face does with the soul. There is a terrific use of HUMAN FACE and the photography that works perfectly on the screen. Mr Nykvist delivers his best in portraying the faces of Ms Andersson and Ms Ullman.Not many cast, indeed. As a matter of fact, two women and their psychological intercourse are in the focus...the women whose backgrounds differ considerably; yet, whose thoughts, intentions, actions and desires seem to meet a strange and unpredictable consensus. Alma (Bibi Andersson), a nurse who talks, whom we get to know thanks to her inner world expressed in words; she is a young woman who has made a few mistakes she regrets, perhaps, but the one who has certain plans for life. Her WORDS become IMAGES in a viewer's imagination --- the other woman, Elisabeth (Liv Ullman) hardly reacts to anything and does not say a single word for a long time. As an actress, she cannot stand the discrepancy between the fact what she is before herself and what she is before other people. Although she cannot stand violence on television, she seems not to care about violent decisions in her own life. As an actress, she purely understands the gist of a mask, and decides to act her role so well in reality. What a mask she becomes! ... Silence! What a means to achieve it! Alma is more genuine, more open, more humane...will it pay off? By getting to know her patient, Elisabeth, Alma gets to know herself...Elisabeth seems to take the easiest role...hides herself from the world and refuses to reveal her cherished 'ego' --- Alma seems to be naive and too much open. Yet, there is something that begins to link the both women. As Roger Ebert memorably put it in his 1967 essay on the film: ""As the two women grow intimate, a strange exchange of personalities seems to occur."" Indeed, a significant moment is one evening when Alma tells her intimate experience from her life, her early youth...what does she get in exchange? Is she happy only because there is someone who listens to her?The psychology of their intercourse, however, seems to reach its climax when Alma grows acknowledged about Elisabeth's motives. Alma's child was not born and never experienced love...Elisabeth's child was born...yet, did he experience love? Why is she tearing her boy's photo? We hear the same story twice yet the images differ considerably...what a memorable focus on FACE, on feelings expressed in eyes, gestures, mimics! Masterpiece! What a terrific emphasis on perspectives! What an unforgettable depiction of a touched conscience! Here, the bitter truth becomes catharsis, the only one that can cure the wounded soul, the wounded mind, the injured inner world. The hemispheres appear to exchange, the feelings appear to be mutually felt. That appears to be the aforementioned 'exchange of personalities.' Alma defends her ego...""I am not you, I am Alma!"" yet...does she have enough strength to maintain what she is?Not to spoil much, it will just suffice if I say: Bergman's MASTERPIECE! No commercial stuff, of course but a movie like no other! Indeed, something where Bergman went as far as he could go. At the first viewing, PERSONA may seem too vague and unendurable, but after more viewings, you will be mesmerized by something that has a unique power over you...the power to thrill the very depths of your own 'ego.' Highly recommended! 10/10",Persona
63,gftbiloxi,A Masterpiece,10,21 April 2005,"PERSONA may well be Ingmar Bergman's most complex film--yet, like many Bergman films, the story it tells is superficially simple. Actress Elizabeth Volger has suddenly stopped speaking in what appears to be an effort to cease all communication with the external world. She is taken to a hospital, where nurse Alma is assigned to care for her. After some time, Elisabeth's doctor feels the hospital is of little use to her; the doctor accordingly lends her seaside home to Elisabeth, who goes there with Alma in attendance. Although Elisabeth remains silent, the relationship between the women is a pleasant one--until a rainy day, too much alcohol, and Elisabeth's silence drives Alma into a series of highly charged personal revelations.It is at this point that the film, which has already be super-saturated with complex visual imagery, begins to create an unnerving and deeply existential portrait of how we interpret others, how others interpret us, and the impact that these interpretations have upon both us and them. What at first seemed fond glances and friendly gestures from the silent Elisabeth are now suddenly open to different interpretations, and Alma--feeling increasingly trapped by the silence--enters into a series of confrontations with her patient... but these confrontations have a dreamlike quality, and it becomes impossible to know if they are real or imagined--and if imagined, in which of the women's minds the fantasy occurs.Ultimately, Bergman seems to be creating a situation in which we are forced to acknowledge that a great deal of what we believe we know about others rests largely upon what we ourselves project upon them. Elisabeth's face and its expressions become akin to a blank screen on which we see our own hopes, dreams, torments, and tragedies projected--while the person behind the face constantly eludes our understanding. In this respect, the theme is remarkably well-suited to its medium: the blankness of the cinema screen with its flickering, endless shifting images that can be interpreted in infinite ways.Bergman is exceptionally fortunate in his actresses here: both Liv Ullman as the silent Elisabeth and Bibi Anderson as the increasingly distraught Alma offer incredible performances that seem to encompass both what we know from the obvious surface and what we can never know that exists behind their individual masks. Ullman has been justly praised for the power of her silence in this film, and it is difficult to imagine another actress who could carry off a role that must be performed entirely by ambiguous implications. Anderson is likewise remarkable, her increasing levels of emotional distress resounding like the waves upon the rocks at their seaside retreat. And Bergman and his celebrated cinematographer Sven Nykvist fill the screen with a dreamlike quality that is constantly interrupted by unexpected images ranging from glimpses of silent films to a moment at which the celluloid appears to burn to images that merge Ullman and Anderson's faces into one.As in many of his films, Bergman seems to be stating that we cannot know another person, and that our inability to do is our greatest tragedy. But however the film is interpreted, it is a stunning and powerful achievement, one that will resonate with the viewer long after the film ends.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",Persona
64,khanbaliq2,"A watershed film in its economy, symbolism, and frank sexuality, Bergman's Persona ranks as one of the director's most personal pieces.",10,30 August 2010,"Persona is a puzzling, obsessive film that director Ingmar Bergman seems not so much to have worked out as to have torn from himself. A nurse (Bibi Andersson) begins to identify with her mentally ill patient (Liv Ullman), a stage actress, and herself has a nervous breakdown.The film is an intense clinical study presented in a complex, hallucinatory manner which compliments but also obscures the main theme. It's an audacious, fascinating experiment; opinions about its effectiveness tend to polarize. The film is considered one of the major works of the 20th century by essayists and critics such as Susan Sontag, who referred to it as Bergman's masterpiece.",Persona

Persona didn't register fully for me at first viewing, and as of now I can't consider it one of my favorite Bergman films - I didn't enjoy it half as much as I did The Seventh Seal the first time around. This is likely to change after a second viewing though; and that's one thing that marks Persona as a good film to me - that I really do want to see it again. It's beautiful and intriguing enough that I truly want to ""get"" it completely.Even with nothing else the 9 star rating is well-deserved for the imagery and cinematography. The beautiful black and white draws the viewer in from the very eerie beginning, and never lets go. The story and characters are fascinating and complex, and everything in the film hints at layers of symbolism and nuance beneath the immediate psychological interpretation.

66,Atreyu_II,An unusual kind of film,9,1 February 2012,"'Persona' is a Swedish film with an Italian title. The movie is as minimalist as the title itself: a simple plot, simple cinematography (although not without some beautiful Scandinavian scenario), short in length (less than 1 hour and a half), with some very quick takes (so quick that you hardly have time to see them or understand them) and bits when it breaks apart (screen flashes white, scratch marks appear up and down the image, sound rises and screeches, and the film appears to unwind as brief flashes of the prelude reappear for fractions of a second each), a low number of actors however focusing mostly on the two main actresses and one of those actresses (who ironically portrays an actress) speaks so little that you can count by your fingers the total number of words she delivers.It's strange to watch a film with practically only two actresses, a fact that only gets stronger considering that one of them talks all the time to break the silence, while the other one is completely silent and impenetrable. In fact, her silent is so heavy and deafening that it creates more tension than if she was talkative.This is a strange film in a mostly psychological way. There is, however, some strong and disturbing content, particularly when the movie opens (scenes that aren't pretty to view).Overall, an interesting concept of film, with psychological impact, well directed and very well acted by the 2 lead actresses but thanks to some controversial scenes it isn't a movie to be always seen. That is its only let-down. Therefore it creates mixed thoughts.",Persona

68,tonypeacock-1,"Persona really made me think, more than most films",9,18 August 2020,"Swedish art-house classic from director Ingmar Bergman that really screwed up my mind more than any other film I have seen. (Including 2001: A Space Odyssey)It basically tells the story of two characters, an actress with psychological problems that has gone mute, Elisabet Vogler (Liv Ullmann) and a psychiatric nurse stationed to assist her 'recovery', nurse Alma (Bibi Andersson).The nurse begins the film as the level headed character, career driven but after living with Elisabet in a coastal house owned by the psychiatric doctor, she begins to develop the 'persona' of Elisabet and vice versa.Director Bergman uses clever imagery that a casual movie watcher would miss.
Watching the serious nurse open up with her innermost sexual secrets to a seemingly silent actress really starts the mind games.The nurse is enraged when she finds out that Vogler found the story amusing in a conveniently open letter to the psychiatric doctor that Alma reads.Dream sequences involving Elisabet's partner and split personalities shown by both character's listening to identical dialogue adding to the mind mash.Each character is trying to open up the personality of the other? In that I mean Nurse Alma is trying to make Elisabet speak and open up.
Elisabet is inadvertently changing the conservative Nurse Almas behaviour. A sort of character study for an actress.The film evoked memories of Roman Polanski's Repulsion from the same era, however Persona beats that for mind blowing entertainment.Was Bergman up there with Hitchcock? To be honest I never thought I would be as engrossed in a black and white, Swedish language with English subtitled film.",Persona
69,elvircorhodzic,"""The important thing is the effort, not what we achieve.""",9,26 October 2017,"PERSONA is a psychological drama that, with a strong emotion examines the relationship between an older mental patient and her pretty but lonely nurse. This is a film about the identity, self-centeredness, sex, lesbianism, motherhood and madness. The characters are very intimate, so that, a boundary of reality, in longing and despair, becomes a nightmare and a distorted picture in the mirror.The story revolves around a young nurse named Alma and her patient, a well-known actress named Elisabet Vogler. Elisabet is a stage actress who has suddenly fallen silent and still, although the doctors have determined it is not a result of physical illness or hysteria, but willpower. Alma is somehow fascinated with her patient. The doctor decides Elisabet will recover better in a cottage by the sea, and sends Alma and Elisabet there. A very strange relationship develops between the two women in this isolated environment...Mr. Bergman has put a very complex problems in a relatively simple framework. The research of an identity starts from the elemental drama, through visual poetry and dark fiction, to modern psychological analysis.The beginning of the film is outstanding, Mr. Bergman has managed to disrupt an illusion of reality with some dark symbols including a crucifixion. It is important that impressions are different. That is the point of this melodic game between the desire, repression and insanity. The atmosphere is in an opposite contrast with the environment.Liv Ullmann as Elisabet is the silent patient. Her reactions are a distorted reflection on her beautiful face. Her lips analyze and test. Bibi Andersson as Alma is a nurse who often leads monologues in which she lacks at a word on the other side. Just one word uttered by her patient will scare away the fog that slowly descends between them. However, words slowly dying, while her lips move in fear of a truth.",Persona

The story explores a woman's life and awakening as her personality begins to merge with another woman. Starring Bibi Andersson and Liv Ullmann, Persona opens with disjointed images of camera equipment, animal slaughter, and a boy in a hospital bed next to corpses, which pulls the audience in immediately. Initially, the audience has no idea what's going on, which is precisely my kind of film. The film seemed to have touches of the emerging French New Wave, which was also fun for me, as that is my favorite film genre. Having seen Mulholland Drive before Persona, I couldn't help but see the many similarities the two films share. An experimental romp with Ingmar Bergman, Persona is undoubtedly one of Bergman's most well-known films and it is easy to see why.",Persona

The music was perfect for this film and kept up a horror film's sense of suspense the whole way through. All and all it was haunting, challenging, and definitely worth another look. There's a lot of ""theories"" floating around about this film and methods for analysis, and normally I'm all for that, but this is one you can go into cold and still come out the other end intact.

The editing and split shots very effective for this. I think the film ""Performance"" with Mick Jagger and Anita Pallenberg may have been somewhat inspired by some of this although I think ""Performance"" is the better and certainly most colorful of the two.This film opens with esoteric abstract and quick shots of erotic and disturbing images. I'm not sure how they actually tie in with what we see later. Madness perhaps?The film did involve me but at the same time I was thinking how nice it would be to be watching something a bit more vibrant and uplifting. I think that actually between the two women that this story is about the nurse is the most insane of the two. The doctor at the beginning of the film makes a comment that is very honest and revealing and nothing else later on really contains that clarity! Which is really too bad. There isn't much here that is mysterious in my opinion. I doubt many people will want to sit through this more than once.",Persona

76,steiner-sam,Not worthy of being a landmark film,5,30 May 2021,"At the most basic level ""Persona"" is the story of an actress, Elisabet (Liv Ullmann) who in the middle of a performance stops talking. After apologizing to the cast after the show she says nothing more until the end of the film, when she says, ""Nothing."" A nurse, Alma (Bibi Andersson), is hired to care for her. We see the evolution of their relationship at the hospital, then at a seaside cottage. Alma does all the talking, Liv responds with no words, but with her amazingly expressive face.Alma becomes angry at two things -- Elisabet's continuing silence, and a letter Elisabet wrote to her husband that references an erotic experience Alma has told her about. Elisabet had let the letter unsealed and Alma read it. Did Elisabet deliberately leave it unsealed?There are several scenes that could be ""reality"" or could be dreams. One is an encounter between Elisabet and Alma at night that ends with a kind of embrace that is repeated multiple times in the film, and became an iconic image of ""Persona."" Another is an interaction between Alma and Elisabet's husband (Gunnar Björnstrand) in which Alma takes on Elisabet's identity and Alma and Elisabet's husband have sex.At the beginning, middle and end of the film there are collages of pictures that seem to set the relationship between the film and the audience. These include the famous scene of a Buddhist monk immolating himself in Vietnam (remember when the film was made).It is likely true what some critics say, that ""Persona"" is not a film that one understands; it is a film that one experiences. Soon after the film was made, in an interview that included Bergman, Ullmann and Andersson, Bergman said he no long thought about the audience when he made films, but rather than he wanted to ""communicate."" That made no sense to me, since the audience is obviously one recipient of his ""communication.""""Persona"" is the first film Bergman made with Liv Ullmann after their romantic relationship began. He created the film with Ullmann and Andersson in mind.For me ""Persona"" was an interesting film I'm glad I saw because of its reputation as a landmark film.

The most significant parts of it can easily be reduced to 15-30 minutes.Sadly, it appears to be shown to a small audience of art/film history students who have very little film viewing experience and the feeling they must rate it highly for a teacher equally sheltered from film reality.

80,Rockwell_Cronenberg,Stunningly observed.,8,11 March 2012,"Persona was my first Ingmar Bergman film and it certainly makes me curious to check out more of his work. As an enormous fan of 3 Women, which Robert Altman openly admitted he drew a lot of inspiration from this for, it was a natural way for me to introduce myself to Bergman, and the parallels between the two studies were evident almost immediately. As with Altman's film, Persona explores deep themes of female identity, utilizing the contrast between it's two characters to draw out a fascinating study. The set up is brilliant, as nurse Alma (Bibi Andersson) is tasked with caring for actress Elisabeth (Liv Ullmann), who has voluntarily given up the ability to speak. This simple act of making her mute creates that contrast between the two that Bergman uses to it's fullest capacity.As their time together begins, Alma finds herself opening up to the silent Elisabeth, speaking about things that she never imagined she would tell another soul. You can see her world begin to open up, finally releasing burdens that have long plagued her, and Elisabeth sits listening. The seclusion of these two was an intelligent design, restricting them to one another and allowing Alma's appreciation and personal admiration of Elisabeth to slowly influence her more and more as time goes on. While at first the ability to speak and be listened to was a relief for Alma, she begins to grow desperate for conversation, finding herself lashing out at Elisabeth and the dynamic begins to shift. Alma gradually becomes more and more like Elisabeth, or at least what she begins to perceive Elisabeth as, cruel, selfish and arrogant. Even with this though, Elisabeth remains silent and unresponsive to Alma's change in demeanor.It's a fascinating idea, having one character completely emotional and responsive while the other is eternally reserved, almost as though Alma plays the entire film against a mirror of herself. She never gets a response, but she draws her own opinions on Elisabeth through herself. She begins to resent and despise her and this rift between them furthers through a deeply disturbing visit by Elisabeth's husband. It's a finely crafted study that I feel will become even more rewarding upon multiple viewings, but even on the first go around the work with these characters gave a lot to admire and reflect upon.One thing that I did particular notice of was how Alma's clothes change as she goes through the different stages of her personality evolution. When we first meet her she is in her nurse's clothes, the ultimate symbol of someone who lives not for themselves but for others. Then when the two first go away together she decides to be lazy and stay in her pajamas, the ultimate symbol of someone living for themselves with no real regard for others. As she becomes more and more a mirror image of what she perceives to be Elisabeth, she begins to dress more as a reflection of her, until eventually she breaks free from this trap and reverts back to her original uniform.The performances by the two leading ladies drive the film under the watchful eye of Bergman, and they present as strong of a contrast as the characters themselves. Andersson is an emotional powerhouse, seamlessly evolving from open and warm to an almost schoolgirl like playfulness all the way back down to the anguished and bitter Alma that will eventually grow out of their interactions. Ullmann meanwhile is the stable rock, never speaking and barely being responsive, but you can often see a little something in her facial expressions to give you an idea that there is still a person there. Whether it's a slight smile or a deep sadness in her eyes, Ullmann makes sure that this is never a one woman show.",Persona

82,jackasstrange,Fantastic study about the human feelings.,9,2 November 2013,"Bergman's 'Persona' is probably the film which most deeply explores the human nature that i've ever watched. Nothing really comes close. The psych of the characters are so present that you can almost feel the fear and shame which they are feeling. Of course, both fear and shame are two frequently explored subjects in the film. Mostly shame. Being said,it's not recommended for weak people. It can be very disturbing at times.The script is basically build upon long monologues. But it is never boring, because after all, is what about the film is made. And notably, we have a very hot description of a orgy in one of these monologues. This may sound weird for some, but it makes totally sense into the film context. But i hope you aren't going to watch this film only because of that scene, if is that your interest. It has also very surreal moments,precisely in the last 20 minutes. Such scenes seems to be totally random and nonsense, but in the reality, these surreal moments are what explain everything in the film. Simply fantastic.

83,x_manicure_x,Finally old enough to get it,10,14 August 2021,"Being finally able to understand ""Persona"" on a deeper level might have been the only good reason to get old. I used to get overwhelmed by the long series of monologues and the incredibly slow pacing, but it seems that I finally lived enough to understand Alma's psyche and authentically feel for her existential despair. If you think about the title (""persona"" refers to the ""mask"" that people wear in public to conceal their real personalities) and the main character's name (""Alma"" means ""soul"" in Latin), it's not hard to figure out what Bergman wanted to say. However, it's something so hard to conceive for a teenager or a young adult.It's definitely not a film for everyone, but it's one of the few classics that do not need extra stars just for their status. It's the best example of a truly timeless film, that still looks terrific and explores themes that are still contemporary.

84,barberoux,Vague but engaging.,8,18 April 2001,"Persona was too confusing or vague or you could say deep to give a straight forward comment about.  Since it was so vague it leaves itself open to many interpretations.  Well here's mine.  I think Alma and Elisabeth were the same person.  Elisabeth suffered a psychotic episode on stage and was hospitalized afterwards.  There she developed another personality of a young nurse named Alma.  Her Doctor figured that some peaceful isolation at her cabin would help Elisabeth integrate the split personality.  At the cabin Alma/Elisabeth talked out the mental issues causing the split. The scene with the glass was a realization by Alma/Elisabeth that the behavior she was engaging in was destructive and it caused a crisis.  After the glass scene the conversations turned to arguments, the mental split disintegrating, that culminated in the soliloquy about her child.  The child and Alma/Elisabeth's reaction to it was the thing causing mental anguish. That realization, by both personalities, caused the two personalities to merge into one, Alma's. OR, Alma may have had a psychotic episode and developed a older, wiser personality of Elisabeth.  Either way the end personality was Alma seen cleaning up the cabin, putting things in order, physically and mentally, and leaving on a Bus back to society OR, away into another mental world.  What was so great about the movie was the multitude of interpretations available. The inclusion of the film effects were meant to remind us that we all play roles.  Alma and Elisabeth were just two roles of the same person.  Some lingering thoughts still entertain me. Was the child a result of the beach episode? Did Alma feel guilt over the beach scene? Was Alma abandoned by the father of the child?  Did Alma feel used by men who couldn't see, (the dark glasses), who she was or what was going on inside her?  The movie has stayed with me, affected me, as a good movie should.  The photography was wonderful with a beautiful use of light on the actresses faces.",Persona
85,kijii,One of Bergman's Best,10,4 November 2016,"The Criterion DVD is great! Not only is there the usual subtitles but there are also three soundtracks. A commentary in English, the original Swedish soundtrack , and a dubbed English soundtrack. This not only gave me an opportunity to effortlessly watch the movie (without having to read the subtitles at the same time), but it also gave me an opportunity to read English subtitles and hear the dubbed English and find out how different the one is from the other. Finally, I did watch it in Swedish with English subtitles as I usually do with foreign movies.Even though I have only recently become a Bergman fan, it is better late than never. This Bergman film was riveting for me from beginning to end. Though the story seems straight forward, I can interpret layer upon layer of possible meaning to the movie and would enjoy some conversation about it here.The basic story is that a stage actress (played by Liv Ullmann) who is suddenly struck dumb while performing Electra. After being sent to a mental hospital, her doctor decides that she is well enough to leave and sends the her and her nurse (played by Bibi Andersson) to a seaside home together. The two become not only patient and nurse, but also trusted friends. Since the patient never talks, the resulting pregnant silence allows (or compels) the nurse to talk more and more, opening up secrets about herself. At times, we feel that the roles of patient and nurse become reversed. At other times, we feel that the roles of the actress and HER audience (the nurse) become reversed. Then there is the positions of voyeur and performer. Which is which—and when?What about OUR roles as the audience? Don't WE feel that we, too, are looking into this relationship as voyeurs? But, whatever roles are being played here, the participants seem willing to play the role, until the nurse reads a letter from the actress to her psychiatrist in which she talks about what the nurse has relayed to her in confidence. When the nurse becomes upset, she confronts and reproaches her own patient to shift the ""spotlight"" back on the patient (the actress).About the time we realize how complex this movie might be, Bergman starts to blend and morph one person's face into the other's (sort of a half Ullmann and half Adnersson shot). NOW, I begin to wonder if we are seeing two sides (or multi-faceted sides) of the SAME person.0The film is resplendent with multi-faceted interpretations. Here's yet another: ""A 'persona,' in the word's everyday usage, is a social role, or a character played by an actor. The word derives from the Latin for ""mask"" or ""character"", derived from the Etruscan word ""phersu"", with the same meaning."" ---(From Wikipedia)",Persona

Another problem was that at the first time I wasn't paying attention for the film's dialogue and this is a film that requires some attention from the viewer for payoff.It is not easy watching but it can be a very rewarding experience if you are ready to pay attention for the 80 minutes of film before you.

3. Both Liv Ullmann and Bibi Andersson display brilliant chemistry together.

5. The sound design is utterly mesmerising.
6. The fight scene between Alma and Elisabet Vogler is wholly gut-wrenching and visceral.

It pairs that with a duality between people - Alma + Elisabet. Elisabet + Thich Quang Duc.

90,ivanmessimilos,Didnt like it,4,14 August 2021,"Unpopular opinion. I really think about what and how to write about this film that I wanted to watch for a very long time. In the end I am really not satisfied. Too much remains unexplained, and I really don't like that when there's a lot left for personal interpretation. A lot of the shots look like redundancy because they don't bring anything new to the plot (my perspective). A very artistic film that pays too much attention to the way a particular scene or frame is shot instead of concentrating on the action in the film itself. It's clear to me that the plot may not be that important here, but it bothered me a lot. Precisely because it's artistic (which I don't like this word for, but I don't know a better term) a lot of the scenes were illogical and weird. The unusual ending, just like almost the whole film, has no point or I haven't seen or understood it, a lot left to the viewer to explain what it means, unrelated scenes, a beginning that has nothing to do with the rest of the film and the film didn't evoke any emotion. . I don't want to say that I'm some smartass or omniscient, in fact I'm an ordinary spectator, and Bergman is a movie legend. Just my personal opinion and experience of the film. I am ready to defend all this to the death. And beyond that.",Persona
91,FairlyAnonymous,Historically Important but a bit of a mess,7,7 February 2019,"I understand the historical importance of this movie and how it effected Art Films and film history and what not... but... it's a bit of a beautiful mess.Visually, I don't think I have ever seen such a nice looking black and white film. Bergman's cinematographer always knows how to capture textural detail in an environment and use it to contrast against the characters who wear textureless clothes. In the visual department, this movie is a success.The main issue I have with this film is that it doesn't really work beyond being a metaphor or an analogy which renders it feeling kind of empty. Similar to the movie ""Mother!"" which had an interesting premise but as soon as you realized what it was about it kind of lost a lot of its weight. If you know nothing on screen is really happening then there is no real tension or drama. While watching the film I desperately tried to figure out how the plot could work in a real world scenario and not just be metaphorical, but alas that is what it is. A big ol' visual metaphor for a woman who is trying to escape from the world.The other big gripe I have with the film is that it has somewhere around 4 endings or more where the film feels like it is at a climax or a conclusion but then it decides to continue a little bit longer and give us information that may or may not be necessary. For instance, there is a scene where Alma cuts her arm open and Elisabeth drinks he blood. Why? It could work for metaphorical reasons but that's it. The ""finale"" is just a slew of random scenes of Alma coming to terms with the fact that she is just the ""Persona"" of Elizabeth and isn't actually who she thinks she is.All in all it isn't a terrible film, it just isn't very interesting to me. It's kind of like when a movie does ""But it was all just a dream!"" where it feels unsatisfying and kind of like a cop-out. What bothers me even more is that it seems like Ingmar Bergman doesn't fully know what the movie is about as in interviews he has stated he has ""an idea"" of what it is about. If you only have an ""idea"" then I don't think you fully know your own story.This frustrates me because Bergman made Wild Strawberries which is one of the greatest movies I've ever seen with multiple layers of depth that show up with every viewing while Persona on the other hand is sort of... eh... if you see it you get it. Also, don't even get me started about the pretentious generic art house score of random instruments hitting different notes in unison. I've seen that done so many times before and I actually laughed every time the music came in.So, I've insulted this film for several paragraphs and I haven't given a reason for it to be a 7/10. The reason why I haven't given it a lower score is because I understand the concepts behind it are intelligent and the way it presents itself is intelligent (most of the time), I just don't think that the end product is at the same level as Bergman's other works.",Persona

93,brianberta,A mind-blowing masterpiece,10,4 February 2017,"Film historian and professor Thomas Elsaesser once said ""...writing about Persona has been for film critics and scholars what climbing Everest is for mountaineers: the ultimate professional challenge."" I completely agree with him. Despite being under 90 minutes, this film is probably one of the most complex films I've run into in years. After I finished it, I didn't even know where to start when attempting to analyze it. However, after thinking about it for a little bit, I formed a basic summary for it, and things kept going uphill from there.A nurse named Alma is put in charge of a mute actress named Elisabet Vogler. She talks to her numerous times without ever receiving an answer. Eventually, the 2 go to a beach house. After living with each other for a little while, the story twists into a bizarre and complex story beyond realism.Many of the analysis's that I've read argue that either Alma is Elisabet's persona or vice versa. Those are interesting interpretations. However, I think that both women are personas of the boy we see at the beginning and, briefly, at the end of the film. In the movie, we learn that both Alma and Elisabet got pregnant and had an abortion. We also learn that Elisabet's baby survived, and she gave him away to a nanny. I think that that is what happened to the boy. When I was first introduced to him, I got a slight vibe that he's being mistreated at his current home since his bed looked really unappealing. He wasn't given a pillow and he only had one thin bed sheet. He also didn't have much clothes on. I felt like he could've been slightly insecure due to his seemingly poor treatment (this explains some of the seemingly random imagery at the beginning and the middle of the film, although I'm not sure about the film reels).With that being said, I think that the personas of the 2 women represented the boy's depiction of his mother. He likely has a negative opinion of his mom since she abandoned him and left him in a dull environment. It seems like he's punishing both of the women initially. Elisabet is being punished as he's not allowing her to talk. Alma's initial punishment is a little harder to figure out, but it's possible that the boy finds her having to watch over an insane patient (Elisabet) as a punishment since they become isolated with each other. After Alma tells of how she got pregnant, we can assume that the boy is especially upset at her due to the different things that happen to her. We see that Elisabet is trying to mail Alma's sex story to the public, Elisabet gives her a bloody nose in a fight, and Alma is negatively effected when Elisabet attempts to leave her alone at the beach house (she breaks down crying at one point). This goes on for a little while, but we see the boy change his focus after Elisabet reveals a similar story which seems more plausible since we learn that she was unable to abort her baby. This scene is famously repeated in the film, which could mean that the boy is trying to confirm that it really was her.Bergman usually nails cinematography really well in his films. Bergman also handled the visual aspect expertly in this movie as well. It is, quite possibly, the most visually impressive of his films. Images of the beach and cleverly lit rooms are beautiful to look at. There are also some scenes which have a somewhat surreal quality to them. The movie is able to use simple camera movements to create these. An early example of this is when Alma is talking to the Doctor near the beginning. The camera is usually pointed at her for most of their conversation, and on the 2nd time she meets with her, the camera is only focused on Alma, and we just hear the doctor's voice. There are several of these shots throughout the film. I also really liked the surreal imagery at the beginning of the film. It made that sequence really memorable, and it informed me of the complicated film that would follow it. Also, on my re-watch, I noticed how the movie constantly focused on hands. There were numerous shots which seemed to draw attention to hands almost like it was a motif. These shots tended to stick out quite a lot. It's possible that those shots were supposed to represent reaching out into the unfathomable depths of someone. This fits in with the scene at the beginning pretty well when the boy reaches out and touches a screen with both women's faces on it. I think that Bergman was sort of giving us a clue as how to go about interpreting his film.In conclusion, this movie is a masterpiece. It's incredibly complicated with a lot of obscure imagery and set pieces, and it has great visuals as well. It's always great to see a challenging film which requires you to think every now and then. This movie, however, feels incredibly complicated and more so than other complex films that I've seen. I didn't enjoy Bergman's ""The Seventh Seal"" that much, but this movie was definitely worth my time. I'm going to look into Bergman more in the future.",Persona
94,ags123,"""Ow!""",2,16 February 2019,"I loved the one nugget of much needed humor somewhere in the middle of this pretentious one-way talkathon. It's the scene where Bibi Andersson breaks something then sweeps it up with a broom and dustpan. She sits down nearby and spots a shard of glass that she missed. She deliberately leaves it there for barefooted Liv Ullmann to step on. Sure enough, for one brief respite, hilarity ensues, along with the one word of dialog that Ullmann had to memorize. I could have done without the remaining 84 minutes of glum posturing and dated pseudo psychology. I also wasn't thrilled by the callous use of the famous Holocaust photograph of a young Jewish boy being marched away by the Nazis. Bergman should have known better, but this was before political incorrectness became a capital crime.",Persona
95,robsta23,I Am a Fan of the use of Thematic Material,7,26 March 2015,"Years ago when I had seen Persona for the first time, I feel I was not mature enough to appreciate it in its entirety. The mind games at play in this relatively short film are key to this movie, and it makes the film a disturbing look at psychology and reality.I have to say that I am not a fan of the idea of Persona as an ""art"" film. The montages at the opening and closing of this film do not necessarily make sense of the images used, though it can be taken at the ending that the boy shown could be Vogler's son. I usually prefer a good narrative when it comes to film, though non- traditional narratives like The Tree of Life can be intriguing as well. I just did not find too much meaning or content in these montages within Persona.It is very interesting the way the two leads seem to represent two halves of a whole, though I do not agree with the fact that Bergman was going for the idea that the two women look very similar; I can distinguish them very easily. However, there is a brilliant image formed by half of each character's face, and it is manipulated in a way to show the two are one in the same. I am astounded by this effect and wish I knew how it was achieved because it is very interesting and is definitely at the core of the film.I love films that deal with psychology at its core, and I think that is why I am intrigued by this film on a second viewing. However, Persona could have been better if it was made to be a less pretentious film, one which has a reach which does not exceed its grasp.",Persona
96,Artimidor,"A woman in trouble mystifies, irritates and shocks...",9,9 April 2012,"Bergman films often have - and this is partly due to the director's history as a playwright - a very stagy look to them with talky characters and little action, even though one can be assured that what happens on screen is meticulously constructed and technically brilliantly executed. The drama that unfolds however has more to offer than what is apparent on the surface. Frequently it constitutes an introspection made explicit with the elements shown to the viewer catering effectively in support of this basic idea. This approach might make Bergman's film less accessible and look dated to modern audiences despite an interesting theme at the core, regardless of the obviously commendable cinematography, the exquisite lightening and direction. But as so often with a master of his craft, it pays off to dig deeper and look closer, especially at a multilayered work like ""Persona"".The film is seemingly easy to summarize: ""Persona"" follows the nurse and her patient, and the viewer accompanies them as they try to get to the bottom of the woman in trouble. Which is not to say that we can easily penetrate to the source of it all, assess the consequences deriving from our observations and come to an eventual clear resolution in this mystifying work of art. The film undoubtedly is a highly psychological study, irritating, disturbing in parts, even right from the start confronting us with shocking images, constantly occupying the mind. It is a mix of reality, fantasy, dreamlike and surreal moments - and of course there are those question marks... While the picture is open for different interpretations, it falls never short of generating a strange fascination and suggests new angles on repeated viewings. As such ""Persona"" constitutes a challenge and intellectual enjoyment - and if you're willing to go that path it doesn't look dated at all.",Persona

98,patryk-czekaj,Bergman's grand take on the human mind,8,2 June 2012,"I don't think that anyone was ever able to get the full message of Persona. Even watching it a few times doesn't answer all the questions that come to mind. There are so many different intertwining images in this film that it's really hard to grasp what Bergman wanted to communicate through them. On one hand, it seems like it's packed with various metaphorical, spiritual and philosophical connotations of utmost value. On the other hand though, there is a possibility that one should watch the movie and look only for the simple literal meaning of its storyline.Juxtaposing those two contradicting viewpoints may seem like an impossible job, so I would quietly concentrate on my personal feelings and on those aspects of this picture that I gathered to be the most interesting.Persona is an extraordinaire achievement in the field of cinematography. It starts with a few disturbing images: an old horror picture, some tramp, a cartoon with an old lady in it, etc. And all of this is surrounded by an aura of burning film reel. This is supposedly an attempt of connecting Persona to a vivid notion of the origins of cinematic culture. In the story, a young and inexperienced nurse Alma has to take care of a well-known actress Elisabeth, who stopped speaking without a specific cause. Right from the start she says that she shouldn't get this assignment, as if she knew that her weak mentality wouldn't let her cope with the strangeness of this situation. It all starts in the hospital room, the first meeting and first conversation, or should I rather say – first monologues. The prime clue about why Elisabeth doesn't want to speak comes at night. She watches television. In it we see brutal images of a burning protester and ferocious riots. Are human poverty, violence and hatred the reasons behind her decision? Is it some kind of a psychological strike against all of the evil in the world?After a few days the girls move to a beach house. This is where the tension starts to build up and the aura encircling those two women becomes thicker and thicker. Something starts to change in Alma's perception of reality. It all seems like a lucid dream that she can't wake up from. We hear a powerful monologue that actually is so explicit that all of the images come alive in the viewer's mind. The ideas create the visions, and that's the greatest achievement of Bergman's conceptual style. After some time it seems that Elisabeth's silence is the key to Alma's realization of her true nature. She becomes angry, loud and even violent at times. She is mad at Elisabeth, because her perception of a relationship between the girls vastly differs from the one implied by her patient. She just wants to listen and embrace all of what Alma has to communicate. In the meantime, she also starts to turn into a shadow of the nurse. Even more, she becomes HER. This is beautifully implied by the most memorable camera shot when the faces of the two women melt and convert to a unity. When Elisabeth's husband arrives late at night (or is it just a figurative dream? The viewer can't be sure whether any particular scene in the movie is real or not) he takes Alma to be his wife. At first she screams and denies, but after Elisabeth places takes her hand and places it on Mr. Vogler's cheek everything changes. She realizes that the unconscious transformation is in the process. She might even adapt to the situation that the altered reality is actually the one that is becoming more and more clear and full. Dreams collide with daytime events.Then comes another disturbing monologue, its intensity increased with the fact that it's stated twice, by the same woman, but from two different angles. It's about the burden that Elisabeth has to bear, a sick child that she never really wanted. The horrible images come alive once again, as the viewer hears the cruel truth about a cold-hearted mother (another clue that this may be the reason behind her forced muteness). By doing it two times Bergman probably wanted to tell it from the view of Alma, and then Elisabeth through the voice and mind of Alma, to put an emphasis on their especial fusion of personalities. As the title suggests, we actually deal with a persona. Just one. Whether the two women were really there or was it just a psychological insinuation deliberately placed by Alma on herself will never be known. The final scene can only be a hint to this puzzling and unusual, yet unearthly magnificent movie. Persona is a station in the history of moving images that no one can omit. It's striking imagery and uncanny atmosphere, combined with distinctly creepy music, provide for a picture that will let everyone a little shocked and perplexed.",Persona
99,calspers,"Extreme, haunting, and downplayed masterpiece",9,26 February 2019,"With an extreme beginning, even for a Bergman film, ""Persona"" tests the boundaries of the art form, and remains my favourite of his films.What can I say? It has it all: gorgeous camera- and lighting work, completely mesmerising mixture of editing and score, and all done more efficiently than in most other films, especially considering its age, brilliant performances, and a terribly haunting plot. But the direction by Bergman is the true mastery of the film, which is subtle, yet terrifying, beautiful, yet paranoia-inducing. It is these dynamics that Bergman masters to the fullest in ""Persona"".It is all too clear to see how this film has influenced countless others. I am certain that ""Persona"" will continually inspire future films, as it has in the recent decade (e.g. in the form of ""Shutter Island"" and ""Ex Machina"").",Persona
100,quinimdb,Persona,10,21 July 2016,"During the opening to this film, I had no idea what kind of movie I was watching. It shows film unrolling in a projector, gore, a strange silent film for a few seconds, and finally an old woman, cut in with pictures of a young boy, laying down in seemingly the same room. We see him wave his hand in front of what seems to be a large screen. We see our main characters appear. The credits start. I think this montage is to show us that we are watching a film, and the potential for what it can be at that moment is endless, considering its up to the creator to decide. This fits in with what we learn about Elisabet Vogler, an actress who suddenly, during an audition, got silent, and had a ""sudden urge to laugh"", and she has not said a word since. We learn she does have a husband and a life, and she even clearly cares for him, so this sudden change is perplexing to many. But it is this sudden change that shows that the individual is completely in control of their persona, and can change it at any minute. In fact, we all do it, as demonstrated by the nurse of Elisabet, Alma. Almost daily we change our outward personality depending on who we are with and when and where. The film suggests we are almost never exactly who we are on the inside. But the most thought provoking question the film presents is this: can we change who we are on the inside?The answer is yes throughout the film. Alma, at one point in the film, has a long monologue about a boy she slept with on a beach, how it was the best sex ever (yet she still feels guilty), how she got pregnant from the kid (but had sex with her husband the same night), and how her husband and her both got an abortion, but were happy they did. She mentions that she felt like a different person when it was happening. Throughout the film it seems that the two characters are merging into one, and my theory is that they are both the same person. When Alma is delivering the mail for Elisabet, she realizes her mail isn't sealed, and checks it. It involves Almas personal story, and it says that Elisabet is studying Alma. Alma feels offended and wants to get her to finally stop and talk. There is a long scene involving Elisabet walking around and finally stepping on a shard of glass Alma accidentally shattered, this seems to be Alma attempting to get Elisabet to talk, or react in any way, but all she hears is ""ow!"". Suddenly, Elisabet's husband finds her and Alma, but Alma is talking to him. At first she says, ""I am not your wife"". But he goes on about how ""you love somebody, or say you do... it gives you security, a chance to endure, doesn't it?"" which calls back to Alma earlier in the film when she reads her letter to Elisabet that was from Mr. Vogler, and both times he mentions that they both treat each other as ""anxious children"", and what matters is their intentions. This also calls back to when Alma reads ""all our faith and doubt is evidence of our loneliness"". Elisabet stands in the room as they have sex, but I believe she is only metaphorically there, in that she is a part of Alma and vice versa. The next scene involves Alma talking to Elisabet about her being told she cannot be a mother, then feeling that she needs to prove to herself and others that she can be a good mother then becoming terrified when she gets pregnant then wanting an abortion but having it fail multiple times then hating the child, but the child loved her unconditionally so it was hard. Then, this same scene plays again, only this time we are watching Alma and not Elisabet. This is another nod to the director being able to control the film entirely, but also, at the end of this one, Elisabets face is superimposed over half of Almas. So, if Alma and Elisabet were the same person, why would they have two different stories of getting pregnant and having a successful abortion and one failed abortion? I believe the failed abortion is true, but Elisabet is Almas suppressed true inner feeling of being an ""actor"" in everyday life. She sometimes plays different roles, during the pregnancy, the role of the happy expectant mother. Of course these almost never align with her inner self, as stated before. But ultimately it shows that we all have multiple ""people"" to us, even on the inside. And sometimes we can even convince ourselves that we are a different type of person for our own sake. I think Elisabet does this when she invents Alma, who had a successful abortion. Of course we never go as far as literally convincing ourselves that something different happened to us in the past, but it's a metaphor for how we choose different personalities even internally. Life may seep back through and prevent us from doing so, but we go back to hide ourselves from the horrors of the world.This is a very complex movie, especially for taking up only a short 85 minutes of my day, but I can promise it will inhabit your mind for much longer than that. It cuts from past to present at random, blurs the lines between reality and fantasy, and sometimes deviates completely from the main story to show us that we're watching a film with strange montages. It's about life, the human race, our psychology, film itself, and sometimes nothing at all. It's the most perplexing film I've seen since ""Last Year At Marienbad"" and thats intentionally perplexing. I mean all of this in the best way. It is one of a kind.",Persona

103,Lucabrasisleeps,Interesting and dark movie,8,1 January 2009,"Yet another attempt at watching an art movie. My last attempt at watching an art film was not interesting(Cache) and quite a chore to sit through. So I was quite wary of watching this movie. But I wasn't disappointed. The one special thing about this movie is the detailed depiction of its characters. That is the speciality of Bergman. In his own words, he wants the audience to feel passionately for his characters. Unlike other ""art"" movies where the characters leave you cold, his movies have a certain humanity to them and the characters in his movies are usually disturbed individuals who can connect to the audience. The whole movie is like a character study with the two women going through a variety of emotions as they deal with each other. We understand the reasons for their behaviour and begin to empathise with their problems. So I would place this movie above other art films I have seen till now, except maybe 8 1/2. This is not to say that this movie has no negative aspects. But these negative aspects are common to most art films. For example the long takes at certain parts could have been avoided. They don't contribute anything to the story anyway.There are only two characters in most of the movie. An actress, Elizabeth Volger, has been admitted to hospital after she has totally stopped speaking to anybody. The doctors are skeptical about her ""illness"" and a nurse, Alma has been asked to look after the actress. They then move to a beach house in the hope that the actress will open up to the nurse. But the actress instead induces Alma to open up to her and tell her secrets about her personal life. Alma's behaviour to Elizabeth changes after she sees letters Elizabeth was going to send which contained Elizabeth's opinion of Alma's secrets. This then influences the attitude of Alma towards her for the rest of the movie.It is fascinating to notice the interaction between the two women and even the audience is drawn to the personal battle between the two. The lives of the women are then intertwined and we don't know if we are watching Alma or the actress at some parts of the movie. Alma gets confused and begins to act like the actress. The scene where she gets angry at the actress is a highlight of this movie. The performances are top notch in this scene. Bibi Anderson as Alma has done a great job and her performance was one of the best I have ever seen in art films. This is because most of the characters I have seen in art films don't really behave like regular people. But Bibi Anderson's performance was so true to life and depicted a woman exasperated with the behaviour of Elizabeth. Liv Ulmann is also quite excellent in her performance as the mysterious Elizabeth Volger who seems to have some past issues which has caused her present state. Her performance is quite creepy, to say the least. The cameo by Gunnar Bjornstrand(a regular in Bergman's movies) is also quite good. He seems to the right person in a creepy movie such as this, with his stony expression. The best aspect of this movie is the background music. It is quite creepy and is one of the best background music I have ever heard in a non-horror film. The background music adds to the creepy atmosphere for this film. This music must have been the influence for most Hollywood thrillers of next few decades. It is now the standard style in Hollywood thrillers today.The camera-work is topnotch and the scenes where Alma's face merges with Elizabeth are done quite well. Also, the scenes where the screen disintegrates in certain scenes are also well done and this is what sets it apart from other art films. The camera-work is used as a tool to describe the mental state of the characters.Well the negative aspects might be,as I mentioned, the long takes at certain parts. I have no patience with such scenes and this seems to be a recurring feature of art films. Thankfully though this movie has less of them. Also some of the scenes like the long boring monologue by Alma regarding her sexual behaviour is boring but this scene is important in the movie's progression. But the length of the monologue could have been shortened.Overall rating 8/10. I don't think I can find much fault with this movie except that art films are not really my kind of thing but this one is one of the best in its genre.",Persona
104,NateManD,Persona gives me all the reasons to love art-house films! It will leave you awestruck!,10,24 July 2005,"Long before ""Muholland Drive"" there was another masterpiece that left viewers confused and awestruck. It also dealt with two beautiful women. ""Persona"" is a film that kept me glued to the screen. It has to be Ingmar Bergman's best film. I'm not just saying that because every critic has said that since the mid sixties. I'm saying that because it is a surreal mind puzzle that made me dive into my subconscious. ""Persona"" is filmed in gorgeous black and white and at an 85 minute running time it never wears out it's welcome. The montage in the beginning is sooooooooo bizarre, don't sit to close to the screen you might hallucinate. The story concerns Alma (Bibi Anderson), a nurse who is taking care of Elizabeth, played mysteriously by the sexy Liv Ullman. Elisabeth refuses to speak, she stopped talking in the middle of a play. For some reason Alma feels very comfortable around her and starts to tell her personal things. She even moves in with Elisabeth to help out. Alma explicitly talks about a sexual escapade that her and her friend experienced on the beach. The scene shows nothing sexual, but the vivid language and sexy Swedish dialog turns this moment into one of the hottest most arousing scenes in cinema history. (something almost popped up for me... spring-boing!!!) Elisabeth still remains silent. There characters eventually merge as one person. Alma also finds out that Elisabeth has betrayed her when she reads a letter she wrote telling a friend about her personal intimate secrets. Oh no! This is when the film turns into a crazed decent into madness as only Bergman could bring you. He even films one scene twice but at a different angle. Now if only Bergman was more optimistic; poor guy. All kidding aside, Persona is an amazing experience that breaks the fourth wall between film and reality. Images are only representational of life, Bergman shows viewers this as the camera runs out of film. This is just my interpretation. Oh heck, I think I'll have two watch this a couple more times, and not just for the explicit conversation about Alma's orgasms. I think both ""Persona"" and ""Muholland Drive"" would make a great double feature. I don't think there is any film that is like ""Persona"". In fact there probably never will be. This ones a must see.",Persona
105,anthonyf94,Metacinematographic language for isolation of human beings,9,22 November 2019,"With technique that uses metacinematographic language to expresses unconscious deliriums (broken frames, images that are disconnected by the plot etc.), Bergman shows the pathological fertility of human: the opposition and relation between two women, the nurse and the patient, that are rapidly reversed in the nurse that's follows a therapy through dialogue and the second that listens. In fact, the second one is mute: with this method, the nurse starts to feel the patient (actress) and body as an instrument to talk about her past and her problems, until to feel rage and hate against her because of her silence. It is the play of double character and of identification with other people (in fact ""Persona"" refers to the Latin word that indicates theatrical mask and also to the etymological meaning if voice's amplifier), that can happen in the silence of this relation (also with subtile homo-erotical tensions) until the delirium of impossibility of language (and communication) and impossibility of understand the past. Humans remain in their silence, as body disconnected one to the other and constricted to live their complexity in their own incomprehensible bodies (the maternity - aborted - also communicates this power and at the same tragedy of human body).",Persona

In the unusual situation set up in this film, the answer is yes.There's lots to think about in this film - for example I still cannot explain the scene when Vogler's husband comes to visit and mistakes Alma for Vogler.  Does Alma simply imagine this scene?  Or does she really sound and smell like Elisabeth Vogler by this stage.The special effects merging Alma and Elisabeth's faces etc. are low tech compared with modern efforts but the impact is still there.Difficult to describe why this is such a gripping movie - I suggest you see it and work it out for yourself.",Persona
107,Don-102,Definitive Surrealistic Film...,10,15 April 1999,"It's hard to comment on a film like PERSONA without sounding like a philosophy teacher or a self-indulgent art-house nut.  Some people have said the film is absolutely impossible to understand.  I can relate to that, because PERSONA is not the kind of movie you rent for popcorn and beer purposes.  It is usually seen in college film courses (where I saw it first) or by discerning filmgoers with a passion for foreign films.  What I see in this truly haunting film is the definition of surrealistic cinema.  Like Luis Bunuel and Salvador Dali's classic short UN CHIEN ANDALOU suggests, our eyes are about to see into a portion of the unconscious mind.  This is not to say the scenes are not connected and have no point.  There actually is a story here.  Once you begin the visual journey Ingmar Bergman puts you on, there is no turning back.PERSONA is actually a love story.  An actress goes mute seemingly because of the madness in society, or does she?  A key scene has Liv Ullman, who plays the actress, watching a TV report on the Vietnam War.  She is cracking.  A nurse, played by Bibi Andersson, is chosen to take care of her.  They go away to a secluded summer spot and become engaged in one of the most erotic and mysterious relationships in film history.  I can describe what happens in laymen's terms, but there is no way to enlighten you regarding PERSONA's visual strategy.  The nurse falls in love with the actress, and she does ALL of the talking.  A story about a sexual rendezvous on a beach is told so well and for so long, you almost feel like you are WATCHING what she is talking about.  So many of the images stay with you and your senses are put to the test.Liv Ullman is hypnotic as the ""actress"" who may or may not be scamming on the nurse for background research for a part.  Or so the idea is implanted by the nurse.  Sometimes you do ask what the hell is going on, but if you just relax and view without racking your brain for symbolism, you will take what Bergman is presenting to us.  This is a film for film's sake.  We are constantly reminded that we are watching film.  The film even ""breaks"" when the tide starts to turn between the two women.  Are they exchanging identities?  I really don't think so.  It is more cut and dry.  A love story with gentle, dream-like lesbian undertones is on-screen.Again, explaining the film in words is a futile gesture.  It is 70 percent visual.  The dialogue (in Swedish with English subtitles) is low-key and mostly said by the nurse.  There are scenes of absolute wonder, much like 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY.  Some are easily understood, others not.  There has never been nor will there ever be a film like this again.  Ingmar Bergman starts us off with a flurry of eerie images: a young boy with his hands on the face of what appears to be the dissolved image of Andersson and Ullman's face; nails driven into a bloody hand, etc..  Enough already.  Just see this bizarre, erotic ""story"" of two women that is not all that difficult to understand.RATING:  10 of 10: Use Discretion and Do Not Watch With A Crowd!",Persona
108,marissas75,"A truly astounding film, though not always in a good way",8,8 April 2006,"Ingmar Bergman's ""Persona"" begins with a montage that deliberately assaults the senses: a sequence of flashing images, visceral, grotesque, unexplained. Since I had expected a psychological drama about two women, my first thought was that something had gotten mixed up and I was watching an avant-garde Surrealist film from the 1920s. But eventually the title ""Persona"" appeared and the film settled down to introduce its characters and situation. Elisabeth (Liv Ullmann) is a famous actress who is mute, by choice, following an existential crisis; Alma (Bibi Andersson) is the young nurse assigned to care for her. Both actresses are superb, and the camera captures all their myriad emotions. Ullmann rises to the task of portraying a larger-than-life personality without a word of dialogue; incredibly, she was an unknown at the time. But I think I prefer Andersson's performancerather than playing a mute, otherworldly figure, she begins as a sweet-natured, effusive, ""normal"" young woman, gradually reveals her desperation and sadness to the ever-listening Elisabeth, and then comes to despise her patient. During her complex character arc, she perfectly delivers two bravura monologues, one about a sexual encounter on a beach, and another accusing Elisabeth of being a neglectful mother. After this speech comes the famous shot of a composite face, half Elisabeth and half Alma, suggesting a blurring of personality or identity between the two women. In this composite image, Ullmann and Andersson's facial features match up quite well, but in the beginning of the film, the two women look very different (Andersson's features are sharp and perky, Ullman's solemn and a little swollen, as if from crying). It's as though the sheer force of the women's acting changes the appearance of their faces to match their characters' internal changes.But while I love the acting, the script, the cinematography, and certain metaphorical effects like the composite face, I remain a bit resistant to ""Persona"" as a whole. The reason for this is some of Bergman's other directorial choices: the montage at the beginning, a similar one halfway through the movie, and an annoying shot of the filmmakers themselves near the end. Critics have justified these choices by saying that they remind us that what we're watching is only an illusion, adding another layer to the film's themes of what is real and what isn't. But how necessary is this layer? ""Persona"" is already stylized enough that there's no need to shout ""Look, it's a movie!"", and ambiguous enough that, even without those montages, it would still be difficult to determine what ""actually"" happened.""Persona"" succeeds very well at psychological drama (propelled by Alma's lyrical, powerful speeches) and at dreamlike ambiguity (propelled by beautiful but disconcerting images of the women's interactions). But, not content with this kind of thoughtful and subtle film, Bergman assaults us with montages full of images like penises and slaughterhouses. They make me take the movie less seriously, since they seem to exist out of an adolescent desire to shock and alienate us. And that desire, I think, is what people refer to when they call ""Persona"" pretentious, as if the film thinks itself so special that it can get away with anything. While that's not possible, ""Persona"" does much that is wonderful and impressive, and six days later, I'm still thinking about its unanswered questions.",Persona
109,Koundinya,Phantasmagoria,9,16 June 2012,"The movie that exemplifies Editing and Cinematography.Ingmar Bergman loves to tantalize the audience with his method of making movies by introducing figments of imagination to bolster the story that leaves us with a thin line of difference to differentiate fantasy from reality.The movie doesn't have much of a story but the editing of the movie is what left my jaws wide open. Elisabeth is an actress who seems pretty healthy physically, though she has some psychological problems which get exacerbated by the television footage of Thich Quang Duc's self-immolation. She is under the care of nurse Alma, who is chatter box. She finds it had to receive replies to her never-ending questions but that doesn't stop her from being loquacious. They travel to an island so that Elisabeth might show some improvement. The bond between them strengthens all of a sudden.The movie culminates with a scene in which Bibi Anderson and Liv Ullman, who do not have the slightest resemblances, has a frame of their faces mixed and it's hard to make out who's who. Such is the editing!",Persona
110,vishal_wall,Girls can fight even if they can't talk to each other. Great message.,4,24 September 2006,"have very carefully given it 4 out of 10. the reason is I cant decide if I liked it a lot or didn't like it at all. I read some 15 reviews and realized I am not the only one who has no clue. Then I read Bergman also had no clue about this film. I think I liked this film in parts. Thankfully it was 81 minutes long and I just fast forwarded all great cinematography and Great poetic Jazz. I just concentrated on the story and finished the film in 45 minutes.I think story is good. Don't think there is any great or profound message in the story. Don't think its about duality or exchanging personality etc. because we don't know their original personalities forget about the new ones.Think its a simple story about 2 different people stayed together for sometime and got together for a while and after sometime began fighting. The conclusion is girls fight even if they cant talk. That's the only profound interpretation of the film.find irritating to see a film where director doesn't want to explain anything. This film reminds me of the incident where John Lennon after the recording of 'I'm the walrus' said ""go figure out that one"". Lennon had a reason to call people idiots but I don't owe anything to Mr. Bergman and so I will call it a 'personal gratification' and let it pass. It has a lot of junk so just fast forward it. Not worth 81 minutes.",Persona
111,TheNabOwnzz,"Incoherent, pretentious, and just plain weird",4,28 May 2018,"For some reason Bergman is considered by many great directors & critics as one of the greatest directors of all time. After having seen The Seventh Seal (1957) and this one i can definitely declare that statement null and void.There's no doubt the black and white photography and the visual imagery are beautiful, and there is really nothing wrong with Bergman's skills with the camera itself, as he uses brilliant closeups and wideshots combined with great cinematography to create a visually impressive film. But these kind of factors need to be combined with the context of an actual story to truly make an impression on its audience, since simply showing pretty images all the time isn't what cinema is about. It's about a combination of technical expertise and relatable human emotion to create a great immersive experience, but this film only has one of these traits.I suppose this movie is generally well liked mostly by pseudo intellectuals who think themselves very smart for liking such an incomprehensible film. The first forty five minutes of the film are pretty linear and straight forward, and do not seem to be anything out of the ordinary. Now these first 45 minutes weren't very good either, but atleast it was coherent and it seemed to have an actual plot. It still never made any sense that the connection between the nurse and a mute actress became so strong so quickly and that she would tell her about something so sensitive that she never told anybody before, but atleast Bergman seems capable of telling a story for some part in a film. However, after the 45 minute mark is where it gets considerably worse and its final 30 minutes focus solely on muddled and repetitive dialogue, weird editing & just a complete mess of a conventional narrative structure to make sure you will have no idea what's going on. Totally seemingly irrelevant images of a spider, a nail being driven through a hand, a boy reading some book are seen throughout the film and all of them are designed so the film can appear to be intellectual, while in reality it isn't. It's easy to say that the film isn't meant to have a conventional narrative structure or an actual cohesive plot because of its ability for pseudo intellectuals to 'Open your mind', because that would make it a whole lot easier to create an actual good film since there is no need for a story, characters, character development or creating a coherent experience in films like this. These kind of experiences are never immersive, because we do not feel connected to the main characters in any way because their connection built in the first 45 minutes feels so wobbly and fake.So, in terms of visuals and camera work there really is nothing wrong with Bergman's way of directing, but it's the messy plot structure and the disconnected editing and sometimes addition of irrelevant images is what turns this film into a pretentious jumble.",Persona
112,SimonD1900,Luckily not as abstract as I had anticipated,8,8 September 2021,"I expected one of those very abstract and heavy films, that is extremely pretentious and super hard to understand. And I actually dreaded to watch this for quite some time. Still, I had made up my mind to do so. Then, I was a little surprised over the simplicity in the story.Beside the opening, where a bunch of random and different images are shown, the movie is kind of clear storywise. You can interpret the first 3-4 minuts in many diffent ways probably, I think it's just there to set a mood. The images are somewhat disturbing and the main character of the story is a very disturbed person. That's about it, I think, because this is a psychological character study of sorts, that takes an abstract approach. It's about a certain person's inner mind.Do you have to be an intellectual to understand or enjoy this film? I don't think so. To understand it, you only need to pay attention to the dialogue. That is not a matter of intelligence, it's a matter of attention span, patience and if the subject interests you, beacuse we humans rarely pay attention to things that doesn't interest us, at least not when we don't have to.So, if a person enjoy this movie or not, has nothing to do with their intelligence, it's more based upon their preference, taste and personality. That's all. It's perfectly fine not to appreciate or enjoy a film like this, it doesn't mean you're dumb or unsophisticated in any way what so ever. It's just a matter of taste. Because we people have different taste, unregarding to what sort of intelligence we might posses. This is fact.So, what type of person would enjoy this? Well, first of it would be someone interested in psychology and emotional and mental suffering. It would probably be an somewhat melancholy person and also a sensitive person. And someone who enjoys slow pace, dialogue heavy and black and white films that makes you contemplate the behavior of the characters. Definitely, a person that doesn't crave action.Now, if you ask me, that is not a matter of intelligence. It's simply more a matter of taste or even mood. A highly intelligent and ""sophisticated"" person, could prefer a action movie to this film, or a cigi adventure or a classical horror. I strongly believe this. If someone thinks of themselves as more intelligent, just because they enjoyed or ""got"" this film, while someone else didn't. That would actually be more a sign of an extremely stupid person, someone very egocentric, with a delusional high self view of themselves. In other words: an idiot.Someone told me that this film is extremely abstract. So, I sat down to watch it when I could put my full attention to it, I was in the best mood possible for a film like this. I do enjoy artsy film of this sort, to a degree, sometimes but I actually prefer a action film. But, I decided to watch this when I was in the mood for it and with my best intentions. The outcome was that I expected something far less straight forward then what I saw.My interpretation (spiolers maybe):This film is about a person that suffers mentally, simple as that. It's purely a psychological based film. It's also just about one person. There never is ""two women,"" there is always just one. That's my interpretation anyway, could be wrong off course.It's about this woman actress, who is an ambivalent person that almost has two personalities. One very cold side, that holds up a fake facade of emotions to the world, a completely fake persona, that doesn't do or say anything from the heart, everything is an act and a lie. A person that can't even find love for her own child, only distaste and whom despises everything and sees the world as dark, empty and completely meaningless. The other person, or the other side of her personality, is the opposite, she's caring, compassionate, loving and strives to find great meaning in life. Or maybe this is who she wish she could be.What I think this film is about, is that some people are very complex and can feel opposite things about something at the same time and this creates a conflict in the consciousness in that person and can make them mentally ill, almost a split personality. I even think a lot of people could relate on some level. If you can't, perhaps this movie isn't for you. Doesn't mean you're stupid, just that you're mentally stable and this film is just not your taste.It's okey to have different tastes. Sometimes it seems that some people seem to link different tastes to higher or lower intelligences. If you ask me, that is kind of stupid and show no awareness of the human psyche or intelligence at all actually. It's perfectly fine to have different tastes in things and movies too. And your taste says nothing about your smartness level, only about your personality.Which actually is what this film ""Persona"" is about. Personality.I liked this film a lot and can appreciate its intent. The acting and cinematography I also enjoyed. So, I guess this is my taste. But then I also know, that had I watched this film, when I wasn't in the mood for it, if I just wanted to be entertained by some cool action (which I most usually do when I'm watching a film) I would probably not have enjoyed it as much or perhaps not at all. But, then again, I did enjoy it. I guess I have a broad taste actually. Mostly because I usually have nothing better to do then watch movies and I do need some variety from time to time.",Persona

114,matheusmarchetti,Silence is golden,10,24 June 2009,"It is impossible to put down in words the greatness of Persona. It is something really beyond words... literally. The movie is made up of long, tense sequences with hardly any dialog, and never better executed in that way since the times of silent cinema. Liv Ullmann speaks probably one or two (short, that is) lines of dialog, and yet she appears in basically every scene of the movie, and gives us a tremendous performance relying on characters emotions and expressions. I can go as far as to say that this is the best female performance I have ever seen. Truly mesmerizing. Bibi Anderssan also gives a stupendous performance as the happy-go-lucky nurse Alma. Bergman's solid direction couldn't've been better, and here, proves again that he is the greatest filmmaker who has ever lived. The gorgeous cinematography by Sven Nykvist also helps to create the film's oppressive, claustrophobic sense of dread, building the tension to a maximum. The film is filled with disturbing images and sound effects, that stay with you for a long while after you watched the film. Some of these moments are so shocking they could even be from a horror movie (some of these ideas he would use to a maximum in 1968's Vargitmmen, his only horror movie which, coincidentally is very similar to Persona). The story of the film I won't give away, because you just have to watch the film and experience it, like I said before, and be drawn into it's world. Final Verdict: 10 out of 10 stars. A masterpiece of cinema.",Persona
115,JoeKulik,A True Masterpiece Of Cinematic Art !!!,10,26 May 2015,"Persona (1966) is the best Ingmar Bergman film that I've seen so far. In fact, it might just be the very best film I've ever seen PERIOD, at least in terms of artistic merit.The only word for me personally to describe this film is ""Psychological"". I don't mean ""Psychological Thriller"" or ""Psychological Drama"" or, perhaps, ""Psychological Suspense"". I mean just plain ""Psychological"".Lisbeth (Liv Ullman) is a successful 30-ish actor who has been in the hospital for three months because she has seemingly lost the will to speak. She is functionally mute, although the doctors have done all the tests and find nothing wrong with her.In walks Alma (Bibi Andersson) as the young private nurse who's been hired to take care of Lisbeth.After the hospital declares that there's nothing more that they can do for Lisbeth, she and Alma go to an isolated beach house, away from Lisbeth's husband and young son.The bulk of the storyline is set in the isolated beach house, where the mute Lisbeth and the now talkative nurse Alma give us a two character play. Alma quickly becomes more of a friend than a nurse for the always mute Lisbeth.As the storyline progresses, Lisbeth and Alma get to know each other better until, at a critical juncture, their interaction starts to become crazy and even tragic. It becomes apparent that the talkative Alma is beginning to assume the thoughts and feelings of mute Lisbeth. When Alma gets to know Lisbeth so well that she essentially recites back to Lisbeth why Lisbeth got pregnant, and how she didn't want the baby, and how she never really loved her son from the moment of birth,it's apparent that Alma is really losing it. At that point, it's obvious that Alma is deteriorating mentally from being around this mute woman and Lisbeth gets the message across that she wants Alma to leave, which she does immediately.In this film, Bergman doesn't an excellent analysis of our real, our inner self with the outer, the social self that we portray to others.It is apparent to Lisbeth's doctor that Lisbeth is just burned out from being essentially a phony, someone who constantly portrays a social self to the world that is denial of her true, inner, real self. So rather than to live with this phoniness, Lisbeth, at some conscious level, just stops her social interaction by not talking anymore, thus truncating her social self. The significance of the relationship between Lisbeth's inner, real self and her outer, social, phony self is compounded dramatically in the film by the fact that she is a professional actor, that she is someone whose job it is to portray a character, essentially a contrived, phony self, on the stage or in front of a camera every day.Alma is portrayed as a sincere, yet naive person who hasn't spent much time so far in her life thinking about all this ""inner self versus social self versus phoniness"" business. In fact, one might say that when Alma and Lisbeth begin their isolated coupling at the beach house, Alma is generally unaware that she herself has a true, inner self that is in any way different from the way that she portrays herself to others. It is only through her talkative interaction over time with the always speechless Lisbeth that the idea starts to even dawn on her that her past, outward, social behavior hasn't always squared with her inner values, with her real self. The awakening in Alma of the actual existence of two selfs in her, the inner self and the social self is what starts the crazy and ultimately tragic interaction between her and the speechless Lisbeth.An interesting aspect to Bergman's psychological analysis is that Alma learns a lot about herself, becomes more aware of herself, while being alone with a person who NEVER says a word to her about anything at all.Complementing this excellent screenplay by Bergman is the radical editing and imagery that he incorporates into the film. There is a critical point in the story where the action just stops because the image on the screen actually looks like the celluloid film stock just tore in the projector. This is immediately followed by a montage of seemingly unrelated random images lasting about one second each before the film and the storyline resume as if nothing of the sort had happened. There is a scene where the camera is closely focused on mute Lisbeth's face while Alma is delivering a rather long monologue, which is closely followed by the exact same scene, but now with the camera focused closely on Alma's face. There is a rapid repetition very close to the end of the film of snippets of scenes that occurred much earlier in the film. There are close up images both at the start and at the end of the film of the inner mechanism of a film projector in operation. There is a very short cut away at one point from the storyline to a scene of two men operating a motion picture camera on a raised platform. There is a close up shot of Alma's face at one point, where one side of her face becomes the same side of Lisbeth's face. All this radical editing and radical imagery is done in such a way that greatly accentuates the psychological theme of the film.In a word, Ingmar Bergman's Persona (1966) is just HEAVY, every way you want to look at it. But the film is particularly very heavy in artistry. The whole way that the film is put together with the very innovative screenplay, and the excellent direction and acting, and the radical imagery and editing just adds up to a fine work of art, at least the best that I've ever seen on the screen.20 Stars !! 20 Stars !! 20 Stars !!",Persona
116,antoniokowatsch,A movie about introspection,8,7 December 2017,"The movie starts out with a weird scene that seems to be completely unrelated to the actual movie. It'll make more sense once you identify the real premise of the movie. What I found really interesting about the movie was the fact that there was basically no film score (with the sole exception of the opening and ending scene; they used aleatoric atonal music for those scenes which is quite avant-garde). It worked pretty well with the psychologically intense ambiance of the movie. A film score would've diverted attention away from the scenes in which the tension between the two protagonists manifested itself. Another thing that is worth mentioning is the almost dreamy nature of the movie. It seems very bizarre and surreal at times. Don't be fooled however. This was done deliberately. The movie is trying to tell you something. Which is ultimately the reason why this movie won't appeal to everybody. Unless you decipher its true meaning it'll appear to be quite nonsensical in nature, I assure you. As far as execution is concerned this movie is in a class of its own. I've rarely seen such a well-executed movie about such a complex topic. Exploring the subtleties of human psychology in a visual way without being too artsy fartsy.p.s. When I saw the movie for the first time I was quite confused. I didn't quite get it because I took it literally. After some research however I learned that this movie is actually a very clever metaphor and things started to make a whole lot more sense all the sudden. Since I don't want to spoil the movie I'll say this much: the title of the movie is really fitting because it's a clue as to what is actually happening in the movie. Just not in the ""physical"" sense. All of this happens in the protagonists head. Maybe this'll help you to figure it out.",Persona

All these Filistines shouting that Bergman is difficult, are, quite frankly, lying. As long as you can watch a movie as much with your eyes and mind as with your heart and soul, there will be no problem at all.Kafka once said that Don Quixote never existed.

Yet for some, this conclusion is neither apparent nor obvious.Plot in a Nutshell: A nurse (Bibi Andersson) is assigned to care for a seemingly healthy woman (Liv Ullmann), apart from her sudden - and stubborn - reticent behavior.I've read many reviews of this film, and I don't know if any two of them agree on what it is actually about, or what it's trying to say. That is not a good sign. Everyone, or almost everyone, must be confused, then, on its message and purpose, if no one can agree. And rest assured, this film is confusing. Unlike most others, it does not tell its story in a conventional way. Most films you watch, you can follow the plot and dialogue, and you understand what is happening on the screen. That is not the case with ""Persona."" You don't know if the two main characters are actually one character, if they are in fact separate, is it about duality, or schizophrenia, or something else again? ""Persona"" has rightly been called the ""Mt. Everest for film analysis"" because it feels like an insurmountable task to accurately decipher and understand it.It's like a Jackson Pollock painting, when he threw buckets of paint on a canvas and called it 'art.' Who knows what all of those splotches meant? Do they have meaning? Or is this just random artistic expression? That was up to the individual. And so it is with ""Persona."" Some people will view it and see genius; others will look at it and see a mishmash of images and shapes that don't amount to anything of interest or substance. I never cared for Pollock; give me Monet or Van Gogh any day.Roger and me: Roger Ebert reviewed this film twice, in 1967 and again in 2001, and both times he rated it 4/4. However he also wrote that he returns to it in the 'hope to understand its mysteries.' So he, too, still didn't understand it after multiple viewings. I've seen it once and don't care if I never see it again. Life is too short to waste on trying to figure out what Bergman wanted to say, if indeed he was actually saying anything at all; we'll never get the answer.4/10. Would I watch again (Y/N)?: Not very likely.(Incidentally, Alma the nurse could have had a successful career writing for Penthouse Forum; her 'beach story' scene is easily the best part of the film!)",Persona

It could be a pioneer in this genre. Maybe it's also a character study or better said ''a look into the human soul'', because it centers so much on facial expressions and feelings and truth and what is right and wrong and what is real and not. It's a philosophical stew that is quite entertaining. The entertainment might be supported by the actresses and the mystery or unusual atmosphere that everything is wrapped in.

121,sc8031,I am Bergman! Hear me bore!,5,24 July 2008,"I was hesitant to write anything about this film at first because I wasn't sure if my negative reaction was from moodiness or the result of disappointed expectations. I haven't seen too many Bergman films, but most of the ones I've seen present interesting ideas, but as though they were the most earth-shattering profound concepts ever conceived. It can be a bit much. Okay, so here we have a movie that deals with similar themes as his later, better film, ""Hour of the Wolf"". Liv Ullman plays a popular actress who goes mute in the middle of a stage performance. A nurse, played by Bibi Andersson, is assigned to care for her. Eventually the two take a vacation to a cottage out on the beach (a typical Swedish method of recovery?) where a series of interactions begins to take their toll on their personalities. Here the film seems to investigate the line that is blurred between people's identities who are in close proximity over long periods of time.It seems the characters are established exclusively in order to explore Bergman's philosophical meanderings and musings, which involve the significance of the interior and exterior views of the self. Elizabeth (Ullman) seems to be someone who recognizes her lack of a strong internal identity. Alma (Andersson) is the opposite and manifests a strong internal sense of self but a weak external influence. Maybe Bergman is also saying something about the role of the artist -- that their persona is stolen by so much giving, so much internal conjuration and performance. That over time, society consumes the artist's inner world by making their gifts into novelties and taking the inner spirit for granted. But I don't really know and that's the problem. Many people say this movie is open to interpretation and that's what makes it so deep. But I think such an explanation only proves that this film is too broad or vague and relies too much on hind-sight and art-house praise. On some level it becomes too self-indulgent to really be enjoyable. I really suspect that many individuals like this movie because they view it with the same self-impressed state of mind as Bergman did when he made it.I can certainly credit Bergman with having a knack for writing decent dialog and for being inspired in his film-making. He really is empowered to make films. But he also seems obsessed with his own perceptions, making complicated and fractured works about feelings and ideas that could be presented more concretely. But then again, many people like him for that, or his aesthetic, or a variety of other reasons that I haven't mentioned here. I enjoy some of his works, but this one didn't interest me too much.",Persona

123,MagicStarfire,Pseudo Artistic Hogwash,2,22 December 2007,"If you are one of the sheep who believes an Ingmar Bergman film must be a masterpiece because you've been told they are, then by all means watch this pseudo artistic piece of baloney.On the other hand, if you prefer a film that actually has a plot, a definite ending, some point to it, explanations for why the characters behave as they do and where something happens - skip this one.In the opening, prior to the title, the film just jumps around from meaningless image to meaningless image, mostly centering on a scrawny young boy running his hand over the close-up of some woman's face, accompanied by music akin to fingernails on a blackboard.However, once the title is shown then the film settles down to center around two women.One is an actress, Elisabeth Vogler who has gone mute, the other is Alma, who has been hired as her nurse. Why she needs a nurse is unclear, since physically she is all right--and the nurse does nothing to aid her psychologically. Neither does Ms. Vogler's doctor. Instead, Ms. Vogler, accompanied by Alma, is sent to stay at the doctor's beach cottage, in a rather isolated area. How this is suppose to help her condition is never explained, beyond resting.Since Elisabeth does not speak, Alma more than makes up for it by talking at her endlessly.We are teased by undercurrents of lesbianism on the part of the two women, but this comes to nothing--just like the rest of the film.Eventually, Alma confesses an unbelievable, graphically described, rather disgusting sex scene in which she was involved, and reads a letter Elisbath leaves unsealed, which the actress wrote to the doctor. The letter makes Alma mad and she rants quite a bit at Elisabeth. I think this is the one time Elisabeth does speak--gets too scared not to, I suppose.Alma also rants at Elisabeth about Elisabeth's feelings in regards to her young son. How Alma would know any of this, is never explained. In fact, she does the same exact scene twice in a row--why the director decided to repeat this, like everything else in this film--unknown.There is also an odd scene where Elisabeth's husband visits. Although never said, I assumed he was blind since he was wearing black glasses. He seems to think Alma is his wife and she goes along with it for some unknown reason, while nimble-wits Elisabeth merely stands by watching.Even a blind person would know their own spouse, so this scene is absurd and completely unbelievable.The film comes to no particular conclusion.Although Alma is shown driving a car at one point in the film, it ends with her getting on a bus as if she has no other transportation, nor do we know where she is going.2 stars is being generous.",Persona

There is no lack of emphasis on the screen's function of reflection and access as a mirror. Give up the formal struggle, in which we are difficult to fight the world.

In addition to these sentences, the film describing two women's inner world will get me far away from Bergman's films.

126,xmdbx,So much said with words and without,8,18 December 2018,It's not hard to see why this film is considered one of the best in the history of cinema. Two masterful performances from the two lead actresses and Ingmar Bergman at his best. There isn't a single wasted frame nor a single wasted line of dialogue throughout the whole film. Some of the most iconic shots in cinema come from this movie.,Persona
127,gothic_a666,Brilliant,10,17 March 2006,"How to communicate the distance and overcome it, where does the self end, and how much are we the product of our words or lack thereof? To speak of Persona is to bring up all this queries, to delve on matters as primal as anguish and as complex as identity and its construction, in other words, the elaboration and rounding up of the ""I"" as an entity independent of its external surroundings, as a fragment of existence that is defined and placed within a perimeter: in a more immediate way the body and extrapolating a bit, the soul. And yet, to truly begin to digress is to build a whole structure of questions to which there are no absolute answers, the act of questioning becomes pivotal and it is on it that all further considerations must be grounded. Elisabet. An actress who has retreated from the stage and into a great solemn and promising silence that is never without meaning. Her reasons for this apparent withdrawal from reality are never fully explored.At any rate, a variety of emotions are underlined and even created by this obstinate refusal to communicate.Elisabet is a self created enigma, understanding her essence as such and, as such, a self conscious abstraction. Alma. A nurse bent on helping Elisabet recover from whatever trauma banished Elisabet from the speaking world. From the first, Alma assumes the role of one whose concerns can be centered on others as well on herself: a propensity to steep actions of firm notions that are a result of a nature inclined to help and protect. Yet aggression can be a most pervasive thing, and its completely absence can be as bloody and act as its overt exercise. Pressed by a silence which she alternately reads as warm and inviting and, conversely, as hostile and cruel, Alma is led to disclose her life, through the medium of her speech, to the quiet mystery before her: Elisabet. This need to fill the void, to assure existence over uncertainty, blinds her to the danger and withers her emotional defenses, and so she finds herself recounting events long suppressed by a strong drive to obey a certain code she feels she has infringed. What Alma cannot understand is the danger that lurks and is the indissociable consequence of such confessions, the power attached to voicing one's deeper hurts. Once this avalanche of emotional damage is expressed it gains a paramount presence in the present: sins invoked are sins revisited. Expecting to extract compassion from apparent, albeit passive kindness, Alma hopes to evade judgment.Soon, Alma realises her own history as a human being,is at stake, viscerally invoked by Elisabet's lack of compromise, for the actress will not speak and all desperate attempts to reach her prove futile and only in moments of dream lunacy can she be met half-ways, as an echo. A strange war follows, as cogs come undone and the very fabric of self is put to the test. Eventually, both characters blend into one another, and Alma's revenge is also liberating, as was Elisabet's incisive study of her. They must talk: and that they do. Only Alma's voice is heard, as she unrolls the records of Elisabet's secret and most intimate sorrows. From all the alienation and failed empathy there arose some fleeting moments of communion and knowledge must gush forth.To fully understand the other, without losing that which one is: a challenge,a goal which falters through the whole movie. What is beyond the mask and to what extent one becomes the image of one's self, and the role of words are matters closely related. For words fail, they are bits and scraps captured by a lonely radio in the middle of a lonely night, they cannot mould themselves to that which must the said. So gestures replace words, and even these are deflected, illusive, refusing to tell just what they mean and how much of what they might impart is, in fact, real. Once the most elemental unit, that of the self, is blurred and displaced, the whole world loses focus.A child unloved, a child dead, both different persons, from the wombs of different women, yet, perhaps, different face of the same reality, that of the inability to return love with love. To ask for pity and receive cold insight, to beg for forgiveness and be left in the dark, all relations become unpredictable and identifying with the Other may be a way to understand it, to draw an alien and independent being into one's comprehensive unit of self, yet it brings fragmentation and disorientation. Emotional states are taken to the excess, sublimed and hurled as weapons, overcome and used as shields, a theatre of subtle shadows and disrupted love, turned to itself as a source of new pain. To be without feelings, to close down all roads and barricade the world outside, such a tactic of resistance towards life is assaulted by the strong urge to burst through these borders and conquer apathy. This is a movie that obviously lends itself to multiple, perhaps even infinite readings. The cinematography, with its half illuminated faces and warped distorted coupled with long shots of intense beauty, as the two characters blur features through a film of bright light, to become almost interchangeable in their eloquence, as a deep silence acts against and in unison with a voice aimed to share, shatter and subdue.Persona is a haunting experience. It lingers in the viewer's mind, permeating dreams with its own visions of oneiric inspiration and its impact does not fade with time. I suspect it might actually augment, as all its intricate subtleties rise from reflection.As any of the tragedies around Electra,Persona is a masterpiece not to be ignored or taken lightly, its structural nihilism is enough to generate an uncomfortable awareness that is vital to all speculation.",Persona
128,jason_13,Movie experience!,10,13 July 2007,"Persona is one of the most unique films, ever made. A nurse develops a bizarre friendship with mentally disturbed patient, refusing to speak.Bergman is undoubtedly, one of the greatest artists of all time. He proves it with Persona. A movie that is so provocative and beautiful, that you begin enjoying its allegorical path. Everything seems weird. The plot is like a puzzle the viewer has to fix. The experience begins.The nurse, Alma, firstly seems like a typical young girl. Innocent and pretty, friendly and smiling. She feels for her new ""task"" and puts a great effort in order to start the treatment. Alma obviously suffers from loneliness, sharing very private things with Elisabth - the patient. Alma realizes, the best decision is fresh air, far away from the depressing hospital.Persona is not a typical surreal film. It doesn't contain elements from David Lynch or Luis Bunuel's work. It's a character study with its own methods of creating an illusion. The first half of the movie is full of monologues. The storyline doesn't develop. Just another one of those movies about nothing, but you still enjoy them. The second half of the movie, however, is one of the most impressive cinematic experiences ever. Every scene holds a significance, a key to the explanation of what's really happening.... according to you.Alma finds out that Elisabeth is making fun of her in a letter, and feels betrayed. Her heroine becomes much more complex, almost scary to watch. Alma's actions become more and more unpredictable and weird until she fails to find an answer to her own existence, losing herself into a world of delusion and moral emptiness. Alma's past starts chasing her conscience. She becomes a completely different person. Elisabeth is still silent and too weak to overcome the problems she has faced over the past.Bergman covers the existentialism issue by creating two characters, blending into one. Elisabeth doesn't speak, because something horrible has happened to her. However, she is not scared, but rather desperate, re-thinking the meaning of life. As an actress, she is too eccentric to reveal what's inside her. Bergman, perfectly contrasts Alma's confessions with Elisabeth's mysteriousness.Persona is so great, because your interpretation solves the movie. Bergman provokes your imagination by describing the plot as two women, becoming one, which is pretty confusing. As I said, the movie is an experience. You just sit and enjoy its weirdness, thinking of all kinds of explanations.The acting is pure greatness. Bibi Andersson and Live Ullmann deliver two of the greatest performances ever.Persona is like the stage of falling asleep, dreaming. Things are normal, boring and pointless when you go to bed. Your dream, however, depicts barely connected, vaguely images which you interpret at the next day.Bergman's direction is again, phenomenal. There are a couple of close-ups which change the whole concept of the particular scene. Much like the relationship between the two women, the camera moves falteringly, with calm atmosphere, lack of any tension. Only a true artist could make a movie disturbing by classic character development.Persona is one of the greatest movies ever and quite possibly, Bergman's true masterpiece. A beautiful, disturbing character study that is pure example of beautiful cinema.",Persona

If you are new to art cinema, do not worry if it bothers you, be aware that no audience, no audience at all can ever deny this film hunts you down, frustrates, makes you glad, and in sum... it brings the best and worst in all of us. From the technical artistic aspects such as photography, music, acting (oh yes babe!), till the superb humanistic analysis that explodes outside the screen, this film is most likely the greatest surrealistic experience made to bring you down to earth.

Both seem true. I came out of the movie feeling rather mixed.The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous, with incredible uses of light and darkness. The acting is excellent and the movie serves as a great psychological study. It kept me engaged throughout.But, the dialogue (which largely drove the plot) often was pretentiously existential and the film itself painfully self-aware. Bergman's decision to break the fourth wall will bizarre image splicing certainly is memorable, but it distracts, forcing the viewer to remember that he or she is watching a movie, one with a plot focused on the meaning of an individual's existence.I recognize it as a very well made movie, but I cannot say I enjoyed the viewing experience.",Persona
131,iniyan_arul,Made me forgot my existence,10,6 October 2019,"The film got the raw lie which is made of truth as its story. Unbelievably realistic how the creator potraits the char that was inside his mind..

132,AdFin,Once again I don't know what to make of it...,10,8 December 2001,"...and that isn't necessarily a bad thing, it just means that I need to see the film a few more times, but I will point out that Persona is not as great as a lot of reviewers have made out. The film starts fantastically, as Bergman draws parallels with the film and the process of film-making. We are taken inside of the inner working of the camera, before Bergman slowly brings us into the room of a young boy. One of the great things about the film is the minimalist composition of the frames, lots of stark whites with no variation, and only a few items of furniture. Weather Bergman was trying to say something about the emptiness of life, I just don't know. Anyway Persona is such an experience that my interpretation is worthless, everyone has an opinion on it, and I don't agree with most of them here so I won't contribute mine. Now let's get down the flaws, firstly, the film just makes no sense, yes the film works in a very dream-like way, but there is some kind of plot in here that needed to be fleshed out. Bergman expects us to buy into this psychological, semi-sexual relationship the two women are going through, but it just isn't carried well enough. To me the film seemed similar to Performance (1970), with the parallels of a stronger force mentally breaking down a weaker force in order to take on part of their identity, maybe Cammel and Roeg have seen Persona too many times. This is just a simple psychological drama, but Bergman takes on the ideology ""you are what you are"" and tries to structure a film that is as baffling in shot design as it is in narrative and theme. Persona is a good film, but not as good as I have been lead to believe.",Persona
133,AdFin,"""I understand and admire""",10,2 May 2002,"Back in December, after my first viewing of Persona, I stated that the film was ""not as great as other reviewers had made out""  How wrong I was.  I watched Persona again last night and found it, second time around, to be challenging, interesting and enjoyable, emotions and feelings that went straight over my head on first viewing.  This is the closest thing to ""real"" cinema that I have seen, because it doesn't offer the viewer any easy answers, Bergman lets the story unfold, and as he goes deeper into the psyche of the character he expects us to pay very close attention to what he is doing.  The film is pretentious, unashamedly, but the way Bergman takes the style from the narrative means that the pretension isn't a bad thing, because the images of Persona are some of the most memorable and haunting that any director has dared to show.  From the opening images of the young boy framed in front of a full-screen rear projection of his mother, to the famous image of the two women's faces merged as one, the images help the audience decode some of the more complicated elements of the plot.Now I must mention the acting (something I glossed over in my first review), because there are better performances in this film than any other I can think of at this moment.  Firstly Liv Ullmann, who is simply amazing as the broken-down actress Elisabeth Vogler, she manages to seem both trustworthy, but at the same time controlling without speaking a single line of dialog, and she's helped out enormously by Bibi Andersson.  The way that Bergman uses these very different (but in some way similar) actresses, is to contradict their actions at every turn, to continually play with their status within the film, Ullmann comes off as the masculine character, despite the fact that her profession would call for her to be feminine. Similarly, Andersson's nurse Alma often comes off as being far too weak for her vocation, but is this a general character flaw, or just a continuation of the role reversal the two women are undergoing.There is still a great deal of Persona that I don't understand, and maybe I never will but this only makes me want to watch the film again and again, as it's the perfect film to just loose yourself in.  There is so much that I have picked up on since my first viewing that I could write about this film for even longer, but this is not my personal forum form any kind of film critique.  All I can say is Persona is a film that must be watched multiple times, every viewing only strengthens my affection for it and my growing admiration for Bergman that hit full swing after I saw The Seventh Seal.  In December I gave this film a rating of  8/10, now I feel compelled to, not only change that score to a 10, but also to see the film again. A true masterpiece",Persona

135,swillsqueal,I am she and you are me and we are all together....,10,17 January 2006,"""Persona"" is a movie set in the time it was made, circa 1966. It opens with an alienated, existential clang banging up against a sense of the interconnectedness of humanity. A woman actress in Sweden, decides that she won't speak anymore and this happens at a most inconvenient time, during her performance of ""Electra"". She's taken to a hospital for observation and eventually farmed out to a nurse who is to take care of her at a secluded beach house on the Swedish coast. The nurse (Bibi Andersen) has almost all the dialogue. In this state of near solitary confinement, she confesses much to the actress (Liv Ullman), including a rather bizarre sexual encounter and her philosophy of life. Why has the actress given up speaking? It has to do with her perception that the world has become so cruel that she wills disengagement from dominance/submission and contamination..... She has given up the hope which her nurse still embraces. But has she not been contaminated by this cruelty which so disturbs her? Check it out. My all time favourite Bergman effort.

Many consider this one of the best films of all time, which gives me a question: How the hell do y'all force yourselves to like these kinds of movies? There is NO way you're actually ENTERTAINED by this. Sure, it's an art film, and on a technical level is one of the ""best"" ones. But come on... I refuse to believe you genuinely ""enjoyed"" this. I put quotes around enjoy because sometimes you aren't supposed to necessarily enjoy a film, but feel emotion through its rich themes and style. I personally was not very entertained by this, but I was intrigued. That is why I give it an 8/10. Obviously factoring in the ""masterpiece factor"" this probably got a higher score than it deserved. This was a very interesting film, though. I will admit that it does really leave you thinking, and it does leave you to interpret what you just watched on your own. Ingmar Bergman knows this, he has stated that that is one of the main purposes of his films. Anyways, I don't think anyone will ever truly know what's going on in this film. Are Alma and Elisabet the same person? Is Elisabet just faking it/acting so she can study Alma's spiral into insanity? We may never know. But one thing is for sure: this is another one of those films that it is absolutely necessary to endure if you love movies.

139,Slime-3,"Unique, Bizarre but Mesmerising Art House classic",8,3 February 2015,"CONTAINS SPOILERS. Bergman has such a daunting reputation that for many of us it's perhaps a leap of faith just to even chose one of his movies. The expectation is of something deep, brooding, obscure and rather slow. Comedy sketches have been written around the silences and menacing composition that are perceived to form the backbone of his films. There's a lingering aura of Bergman being 'only for the intellectuals'. Maybe some of this is, at times, true. Maybe not.It's a personal choice for each of us but the rewards for taking that leap and staying with a Bergman movie are well worth anyone's time and effort. None more so than PERSONA which combines a few famously bizarre surrealist sequences with a phenomenal piece of claustrophobic two-handed acting by Ullman and Andersson, the like of which I cannot honestly recall elsewhere. Their beautiful faces, often shot in ultra close-up are lit to emphasis every pore and minor blemish as if to highlight that however gorgeous as they are, these are human and imperfect faces on flawed personalities. The slightest twitch or tremor is given significance, the quasi-lesbian relationship they appear to develop is treated with an intense but chaste sensuality and the turns in the story are arresting and unsettling. The fact Ullman remains mute and Andersson does all the talking sounds like a recipe for some chronic naval-gazing. Not so. Introspective it is, self absorbed too, but Andersson's character has a secret or two which her initial prim, starched appearance belies. Her graphic description of a pivotal liaison in her past is truly unexpected in a movie of this vintage. It must have seemed alarmingly candid when first shown. It still does. It's also poetic and rather beautiful. I can only recall seeing one other movie, LAST YEAR IN MARIENBAD,in which so much of the dialogue stems from just one of the characters and at times the direction PERSONA appears to take(or not, as the case may be)emphasises this similarity as do the striking monochrome photography and the exacting use of composition. Surrealist sequences aside, PERSONA is the more real of the two films, the least fanciful and at the denouement probably the more satisfying. What does it all mean? Well thats the rub.As you'll see from the discussion boards on IMDb it's up for constant re-interpretation and perhaps because of this more than anything else it's a film that stays in your head long after the final credits.",Persona
140,markmuhl,Fascinating but challenging,8,19 November 2017,"Wow, this film really left me behind with ambivalent feelings. On the one hand, it offers excellent acting and truly beautiful black&white shootings of both landscape and human physiognomies, but on the other hand, there are so many obscure scenes in it that even studied psychologists have a hard time in explaining the meaning of it all. It surely was also in the Intention of director Bergman to leave space for interpretation but one should be careful not to overburden the spectator.I truly enjoyed the first two thirds of the movie, which are quite straightforward apart from the first five minutes of seemingly unconnected and quickly changing film sequences (one of them being a young boy longing for a big motherly face on a screen). A young nurse is assigned to a new patient, an actress, who seems to be healthy apart from the fact that a few months ago she fell into speechless silence. To support a better recovery they are both sent to a house on the beaches. The young nurse tries to fill in the gap of silence by telling stories of her own life. This is a bit like the situation on a psychiatrist's couch where the patient keeps on talking as an answer to the doctor's simple comments or even silence, only that the roles in this case are turned upside down, because the nurse takes over the role of the patient and the mute patient takes over the role of the psychiatrist. Her admiration for someone being an actor and appreciative smiles make the nurse become more and more trustful until she even makes confessions about sexual experiences and an abortion. She is wondering why sometimes she does not live up to her own standards. These monologues are in fact more entertaining than expected. They never really become too long and are supported by great acting.Then the nurse gets to read a letter written by her patient, in which the patient is passing on the nurse's private confessions and describes her as interesting to watch. From this moment on, the nurse feels betrayed in her affection to the patient and her behavior changes to hostile. I especially liked the scene where the nurse leaves a piece of broken glass on the floor hoping that her patient would step into it and when she does the actress for an instance is breaking her silence with an Ouch.Oddly enough, despite the tensions, the nurse, in the last third of the movie, starts more and more to project her own thoughts and fears (of being a bad mother unable to love her own child, maybe the boy from the beginning?) onto her never dissenting patient and seems to get one person with her. When the patient's husband is visiting, the nurse is even mistaken by the husband to be his own wife. In how far the nurse's projections meet with the patient's reality is hard to tell as the patient remains quite an unreadable book. Then in one scene, we see the nurse waking up, so probably all the oddities from the last third of the movie can be explained by being a dream reflecting the nurse's subconscious, which tells her to be lost in very much the same way as her patient.Is it about not being able to cope with the dishonesty and harshness of life that leads us into speechless isolation? Is it about all of us having more than one personality and normally showing only one of the many as a disguise? Is it even about behind this disguise being nothing? Or is it about not being able to help each other, since in the end, the patient still does not speak and both the nurse and the patient leave the house separately.Finally, I was sitting in front of the credits knowing to have seen something substantial but feeling a bit dizzy at the same time. Still, the positive impressions clearly predominate and therefore I give it 8 points out of 10.",Persona
141,IMDBcinephile,Abstract Film that Differentiates Art and Reality,10,25 June 2011,"Ingmar Bergman's titular ""Persona"" is first of all, truly about the persona of Human Beings and their study in the form of humanity; they can be inquisitive, perspicacious, foresighted, intelligent and they can also be vulnerable (proven by Alma's patient, Vogler).The beginning starts off with head or tail of the things being inscrutable; it's accessible due to my curiosity but what is it? It's a menage of the projector and possibly the older kinetoscope; a fat woman is underneath the footage of the projector and we're forced to presume that there is no escape to the film's historicity, it's whether or not it's indispensable to be filmed in such a way that keeps that wonder; you even become a voyeur in one of the bits, that may confound and exploit, but it's all about mankind....Then we see the six inch nails going into a hand... so yeah, already this is a statement of different types of film making and this is technical and fantasy made real. The plot centres on Alma, a young nurse, who is to look after a patient who is a stage star, who is possibly psychosomatic; she is lost for words, and with her anecdotes, is able to open her up and even amuse her, but as the suspense of getting her to say words is at state, it becomes a much more daunting experience, as she opens her most precious secrets to her, her love for the thespians and artists (a possible allusion to Jean Puc Godard and definitely putting him under the trope of an artist codifying him as a leading phenomenon), her experiences out with boys, her chasms about life and the beauty of it and her childish theories; however, this is counterproductive to her, as her patient consults to her hand and paper about these things out open and this causes a quarrel intervening between Alma's position and her patient's sanity. As it grinds down the mileage of our thoughts to her patient is slowly becoming unsympathetic... for the reason she's there.This movie is not a movie; it's a narrative movie and it's an abstract excursion to be witnessed. Of course, there will be criticism's that it actually depends on exposition and dialogue rather then anything else, but it's visual experience overcompensates for this; plus, the dialogue is also a treat, as it can actually give you ambivalence and a sense of an open environment.The whole crux with the idea that this is a real life event with characters that are real characters is what the coverage of life is really being brought to life; transfigured and poetically spiced up, but why do we like the characters? Are they given their roles in a way that we understand? The hardships? Why are these characters so interesting paralleled with Alma under the same spell as the actress? It's complex sphere amounts the idea being in place with the greatest simplicity... in a way that we kind of look at this as an allegory for life's hardships I suppose; all induced with the passion of Bergman's older pictures from the beginning (his more menial one ""Prison"" from the 40's that's so invigorating to look at, as if it's in the kinetoscope emblematic of his chapter in the index of time and history) and then to use his ""Through a Glass Darkly"" being emphasized, we can see this man wants all his work to make this picture grander and as it is seen, its fruition is successful; however, ""Seventh Seal"", ""Wild Strawberry"" and so many of his films overshadow it; but he did admit it was his tied-2nd favourite that he done.In the movie, she's not just helping her; she's scrutinizing her and her patient is not just unwell; she's evasive to her responsibility of life. However, the movie utilises a lot of footage about civil war protests, presumably, and this can cause despair as well.I think the beginning is unbelievably important, while still toiling with a different medium to establish, it alienates you and then if you're attentive enough, it can really exhilarate you and make you think ""WOW! I forgot the importance of that sequence! I should have been more judicious in my train of thought - but I was hoodwinked!"" - just to let all know that pay attention, however many ways it can be possibly viewed through the scope of it; even the beginning is complimented in the bit where the doctor doesn't want her to hospitalised and mentions the chasm between a fantastical system and in depths of the reality that can be controlled with it; the answer is very seldom.And this movie ranks among my favourites; as it says on the back of my DVD that I got from work released by ""Tartan"" it says ""a true tour de force in visuals"" and I have to agree; the movie is visually interesting, visually stimulating and visually scary; it's scarcely realistic, even when the crew are shown near the end, as if that surveillance camera is what brings his vision to life, and in actuality it does.People may deride it for its shallowness and kind of alien manner, but when I'm to understand this barrier that works as a pervading fourth wall joke (sort of like in ""Ferris Buller's Day Off"" where John Hughes makes Matthew Broderick says to the audience ""Here the movie is over. Go home"" which was off course adopted in one of Pixar's movies). ... But I can't but leave the ingenuity of this movie and how it forces us to take sides at both worlds, both places and how it takes us time to slowly conform to it. Deal with it. Or if not, then it's simply one of those movies that become subjective. And even if that's where it stands, I still really think that it's a metaphor for that perception.",Persona
142,YellowManReanimated,An Existentialist Deconstruction,10,17 August 2021,"The film begins with a montage of seemingly disconnected images: in a meta-presentation we see the heating of the film projector, the running of the celluloid: on the celluloid there is an animated scene of a woman washing her face, a sheep being killed and gutted, a tarantula, a mime artist, a silent scene involving a man in a skeleton suit chasing another man, there's an erect penis and then we're shown a boy in a room, naked to his waist who is digesting all of this imagery, is it the director himself as a youngster? He caresses the faces of Alma and Elisabet, who will go on to become the two characters of the film.The film then moves on to focus on Elisabet, an actress who seems to be experiencing some form of depressive episode. She has stopped speaking and refuses to leave her bed. Alma is the nurse who is charged with caring for her. Most of the film takes place in a coastal retreat where Alma and Elisabet are alone. Alma tells Elisabeth about her life, her troubles, her uncertainties, all the while Elisabeth remains silent. Her silence is comforting to Alma at first but eventually she begins to be wounded by it. She perceives it as a weapon, it draws her out of herself only to hurt her, dissect her, break her down until she has no defence. She is left exposed by the futility of her language, the limitation of her thoughts, she is forced to contront the carefully sculpted narrative of her life and she witnesses it beginning to melt and transform in front of her.The film is beautifully shot, Sven Nykvist's contrasting black and white tones are desolate and gorgeous. It also vibrates with an eerie, discomforting atmosphere: it's painful to watch Alma being drawn in to the nihilistic depths which her counterpart radiates, there's a sense that, via Alma, we as an audience are being drawn in with her. The film is highly experimental and innovative, it's more poetry than prose. It plays with perspective, both visually and via character, in ways which are uniquely captivating. There really is no other film I've seen that's quite like it.",Persona
143,supernma,A psychological film,9,21 June 2010,"""Persona"" is one of Bergman's most praised and talked-about films, so I was enthusiastic about watching it. While I certainly wasn't disappointed, it did go in a completely different direction than I had imagined. This is Bergman ""unleashed"", if you will.From the opening display of seemingly random images (a mix of the gruesome and the shocking) to the moments of strange-but-effective artistic choices made throughout the film, ""Persona"" wraps itself around your mind and isn't always clear about what it's trying to convey. I'm sure I don't understand all of its metaphors, implications, symbolism, and perhaps even the overall theme (that will require a re-watch and maybe the commentary) but what I've taken out of it at first viewing is how dangerously close and reliant we can become to others and how psychologically fragile this can make us. This is a film about vulnerability and exposing one's true feelings and emotions, and the consequences of doing so. Of course, it's also about how we can see ourselves is another to the point where we forget who we are individually. There's a lot going on in this film, and don't expect to understand absolutely everything at first (unless you're a psychology major). However, I don't want to give the impression that the film is confusing or disengaging. It's very intense and shocking, and never lets you look away. Certainly Bergman's most unapologetically ""revealing"" film.",Persona
144,cathcacr,Pure cinema; unlike anything else I've seen,9,12 February 2003,"This one stands alone among the all-time great works of cinema. It has a purity, grace and simplicity that brings to mind some words from reviews of another masterpiece by another cinematic legend: ""A perfect film . . . I ask that you give yourself over to the experience."" -Persona- is the ultimate art-film. Haunting, mysterious, and wondrously enigmatic, but as filmic expression goes, it is unsurpassed. As entertainment-film, it succeeds by being as engaging as any great film, period. Liv Ullmann is unforgettable in her beauty and her silence. Given how it stands alone, it is exceedingly difficult to recommend other movies to those who love this one, but other personal favorites that possibly bear mentioning include: -Mirror-, -Solaris-, -Nostalghia-, -Woman in the Dunes-, -2001: A Space Odyssey-, -Barry Lyndon-, -Eyes Wide Shut-, -Mulholland Dr.-, Bergman's own -Cries and Whispers-, -Hour of the Wolf- and -Wild Strawberries-.But words really don't justify -Persona-'s greatness; you will just have to experience this for yourself.",Persona
145,Sonic_Ocean,Disappointing,10,20 June 2013,"Overall, I did not find this in the slightest bit interesting. I do enjoy movies with an out-of-the-box concept, but this seemed like pretentious drivel. I expect a movie to pull me in and give me some sort of reaction, but by the time I finished 'Persona,' it just left me completely cold and indifferent.It seemed interesting from the get-go and just when I was expecting the movie to take an interesting turn, it didn't really go anywhere at all. I mean I do sort of appreciate the minimalist aspect of the movie, but apart from that, not much really happens in the movie to even make me care about its plot or the characters. Maybe someday I may get the feeling that I should watch this again, but as of now, I highly doubt that will ever happen.",Persona
146,jdoan-4,Allusive and alluring,9,5 October 2005,"As I watched this film, I was simultaneously perplexed and stunned. The meaning of the film (if there is one) seems very allusive and shrouded in symbolism. The movie is very bleak and despairing. It seems to say that life and art are ultimately futile and disconnected, commonplace themes, or anti-themes, for post-modern expression. That being said, the movie is beautifully shot and intelligently constructed. No director is better than Bergman at composing shots. This movie to me was like a T.S. Elliot poem. I wasn't sure what he was saying, but I enjoyed the way he said it. There seems to be hundreds of shades of white and black and gray throughout the picture, all used to the utmost effect. This movie could be considered a study of the human face. I have not seen a film that better utilizes the close-up. I detest movies that use extreme close-ups for no reason other than because they can. Bergman shows more human emotion in one close up--the shot of Elizabet listening to the music on the radio toward the beginning, for example--than in all Jerry Bruckhiemer-produced films combined. It certainly helps that the actresses perform with uncanny realism. This is a stunning film, one that haunts you for days following",Persona
147,dragon-90,Melting the Screen,8,23 June 2006,"""Persona"" is art house cinema defined! The loose plot centers on a Scandinavian-Freudian ego/id struggle going on simultaneously in two very complicated and classically beautiful Swedish women. One woman is an actress (played by famous Swedish actress Liv Ullman), in seclusion during a nervous breakdown, the other woman is her nurse (an explosive Bibi Anderson). The women bond into a volatile co-dependent relationship that has (at times very) vague lesbian (is it so controversial to say this?) undertones but is mostly expressed in long slow sequences of dialogue that escalate to volcanic displays of emotion.What makes this movie such a great classic is the magnificent cinematography, and the innovative screen shots and cinematic effects used throughout the picture. Additionally, the original musical score is used to important effect and the editing and direction are flawless. The total visual effect of ""Persona"" is one of the best examples of cinema as ""art"". The clarity and composition of all the camera-work is simply superb. And don't let the plot summary fool you -- this is a hard film to describe -- there are plenty of surprises and it remains very modern to this day!",Persona

149,selfparody,Neat looking but hollow,6,6 May 2005,"My take on this film is that Bergman didn't make it: Sven Nyvist did. The story frankly isn't interesting: an actress can't talk, and meets with a boring nurse who won't shut up, and allegedly, they strike up a relationship. Bergman himself said he didn't know what his point was. The good stuff is happening off to the side of that, but is good only if you like looking at footage. A hand being nailed through, the footage of the Buddhist monks in Vietnam burning themselves, etc. Those are the things that you remember, but that's really not much better than the video shown in Ringu in terms of film-making, to be blunt. I have heard some good reviews of that monologue where the nurse talks about her sexual encounter on the beach, but I frankly was saying ""they have sex with random guys who walk up to them on the beach? Wow, I'VE got to go to Sweden.""",Persona

For 1966, this is possibly Bergman's most experimental film... i feel after a response to the uprising of the French New Wave, he opens with quick fire editing & incredible sound design, even a 1 frame fully erect cock will be seen... this is preparing you for the ride that is ahead... and reminding you throughout the film that you are watching a film, with some scenes in the film freezing, then tearing apart or the film burning up... or is a reminder that u rnt maybe watching what's real? maybe large parts of the film are fantasy or a dream? this is what makes this film an absolute masterpiece... After first viewing i'm sitting on a 9 but it will definitely go up to 10/10... this is a film that requires multiple viewings to really get into Bergman's head, into the nurses head, into the actresses head... and u decide where u stand... i could easily see this film appearing in my top 20, maybe top 10? It's a tour de force, a masterful accomplishment of pushing the realms of cinema, with a script that Michael Haneke would get a serious boner over, and a delivery like no other Bergman film I've seen as far as cutting and sensory overload goes... this should be seen by everyone to show what cinema can be, how nightmarish a psychological drama can test you - ala Kubrick's The Shining... If u want a real head fuk that leaves u gasping for more, see what happened before David Lynch was around, even see the long curtains that appear in ""Twin Peaks"" (1990) with a long corridor and multiple doors... just talking about this film is making me want to give it a 10 cause there's no way it's not simply perfect in what Bergman was trying to achieve... Watching this on the big screen would be a delight like no other... this film is best watched in total darkness, on the biggest screen u can find, with the loudest sound possible... and possibly by yrself, cause it will truly fuk u up!!! 9/10 on initial screening, 10/10 on my next for sure!",Persona

The collage of images before the opening credits are somewhat grotesque and particularly ""nonsequitur"" such as the graphic depiction of crucifixion. Midway through the film the description of a casual sexual foursome on a beach just seems out of place and nonsensical in the story line. In the 60's all of us naive movie enthusiasts were maybe taken in by Bergman's ground breaking departure with conventional movie styles.

But I think Persona works on a smaller scale as well, depicting how the artist interacts with society, as well as the interplay between the various aspects of the artist's inner life. The various perspectives do blend together, but there's more here than just a depiction of what cinema is and is not.Great performances by a pair of very beautiful and talented women, Ullmann and Andersson. Great cinematography as well. I particularly enjoy the shot of Andersson with her sunglasses on, leaning back against a white wall. Also the night scene with the two doors where Ullmann walks into Andersson's room wearing a white gown. The unadorned simplicity of the various settings is also enjoyable.The more I watch Bergman the more I appreciate his analysis of the polarization of modern existence, the vast gulfs which separate us from ourselves, from others, from God, and his belief that love is what can close those gaps. Some may find him depressing, but I always come away from his films hopeful. Persona gets a very rare 10 from me.",Persona

One thing which needs special praise is the sequence in which the actress told her story, how she become mother, first by camera focusing on her with the voice of Alma and then the camera on Alma with the voice of her own, showing that both characters are becoming shadows of each other, merging into each other and losing their identities.Movie is disturbingly grim and dark yet grips you, haunts you and makes you linger in the memory of the movie.A must watch but specially for Bergman's fan.9/10",Persona

Why am I subjecting my self to this torture? Why? Because for some reason, all the great directors (and my favorite directors) admire him.I don't believe that his movies were made by a human being. They feel like they were made by sociopaths, or even aliens, trying to emulate human emotions and behaviors. No, nobody speaks that way, nobody reacts that way, nobody thinks that way. Nobody would confess their deepest secrets to a mute patient. Nobody would ever care so much (to the point of madness) about what a mute patient thinks about them... But, wait a minute.... A MUTE PATIENT? What ???? An actress who stopped talking?? Oh, boy, are the Swedes having a hard time or what? People survived the holocaust and kept on leading normal lives, but ""Ingmar Bergman"" characters are such sensitive existentialist geniuses (even when they are nurses...) that they are so deeply traumatized by an abortion or marrying the wrong man that they decide to go mute, or develop an alter-ego in their heads... Yeah, sure, one can definitely relate to that (NOT!).Of course this movie is filled with pseudo-intellectual clichés (Hallo Vietnam screening - Make our super-sensitive actress go completely insane from a TV programme) and ""freudian"" imagery that tries to point out hyper-OBVIOUS things about life and human psychology, in such a pretentiously artistic way that literally makes my blood seethe with anger. What? We project a different persona than our real deeper self to the outside world - IT HAD NEVER EVEN CROSSED MY MIND BEFORE THIS MOVIE, THANK YOU SO MUCH INGMAR BERGMAN! What??? People have to suppress their deeper sexual fantasies and preferences when they enter marriage??? THIS IS SO AVANT GARDE I CAN'T EVEN BEGIN TO GRASP THE GENERAL PICTURE!!!

160,nathanielqwilson,Watch Wild Strawberries instead,3,4 June 2018,"It is almost impossible to praise this movie without sounding smart and cultured and it's almost impossible to criticize this movie without sounding like a bit of a philistine but...yeah, I don't like it.Now, I'm all for stylized cinematography, when ""If"" switched from color to black and white for no obvious reason I was so impressed because it's the kind of movie that can do that.But here I don't feel it works because, firstly, it makes the whole thing kind of risible, especially given how stone faced the tone is and secondly, the essence of the thing kind of gets drowned in bizarre angles and sudden blurriness.It could have been a fairly effecting exploration into the way, despite superficial differences we are all alike, and part of the same universal journey yet still determined to analyse others. It's ambitious in being mostly just 2 characters (one of whom is almost mute by choice) but ambition doesn't equal skill.I don't think I totally missed everything the movie was trying to say: we see the nurse as the one who has it together and is so different from her but then we see that she is more like simply being at a later stage in her life with elements of her being already visible in the Nurse with her problematic relationship with her fiancé. Or maybe that's tripe but it's the impression I got.And the motif of film: the literal film reel and that she's an actress...the artificiality of the persona...we get it. Oh, and one of them is called ""Alma"". Seriously.But ultimately I'm a bit ""so what?"" about it all. There's a tendency for the characters in Bergman's movies to be complex but in the way a psychiatric case study is complex without any relatable human qualities or individuality within except for what is strictly and obviously relevant to the plot or central themes; a tool for movie rather than someone I could meet. So the incites the movie has may be intelligent but also a bit pointless and irrelevant.And while I won't reveal the ending, I didn't even realise it had finished when it did because I saw it with ads on Film4 and there are no credits. So when I found it had finished I was like ""wait, is that it?""It's a dense, not very accessible piece of ""arthouse"" cinema that really exemplifies what people imply by ""arthouse"" though of course all films are art. It may have been good if it had been half the length and one third the stylization. It has some great atmosphere, the sense of the cold desolate Nordic beach is intensified by its creepy arrhythmic score. The acting is quite stilted, it is first year performing arts academy stuff. Kind of interesting but that doesn't stop it being dull and giving every impression it's convinced of it's own genius. Really just for cinematic curiosity.",Persona
161,Clockwork_Orange55,Perfect Cinematic Art,10,15 September 2016,"Ingmar Bergman's ""Persona"" is as good as a 'middle-finger' towards anyone who thinks that story-quality is essential in cinema. This Bergman's film has no story, no direction, but only ideas. And till now, it still remains as one of the most critically acclaimed motion pictures of all time. ""Persona"" acts like a film class with groups of passionate cinema addicts; and to casual moviegoers, the film would go as far as being mundane or worthless. The movie centers around a nurse named Alma (Bibi Andersson) and her patient Elisabet (Liv Ullman), who suddenly refuses to speak completely. The story does nothing much and only mostly explores the relationship between the two mentioned characters. Exhausting but surely not wasteful monologues is the film's cup of tea.""Persona"" displays towering filmmaking. The filmmakers behind the camera must be so skillful that every scene, every frame is to be conceived for excellence in photography. In a scene where Alma recalls about an incident at a beach and talks about it, Bergman never showed any images on-screen about the recollection at all, but I could vividly paint her (Alma) story inside my head through the dialogues and actor's delivery of the lines. This shows its exceptional work in writing and acting.""Persona"" is not an easy movie. You will need at least two viewings to fully possess a grasp of Bergman's imaginations. The film is big in interpretations; and if you look up to articles about the film on the internet, you will see tons of it. But here's my theory: Alma and Elisabet (two different characters), are one. Although they are of two different persons, their personalities and histories are actually the same. So, when Alma speaks about or does of anything that is related to Elisabet, she is indirectly referring to herself and vice versa. I believe this makes more sense when Bergman showed an image of halves of the two characters' faces merged together, thus becoming one.""Ingmar Bergman's finest film."" I cannot assert on that as ""Persona"" is the only Bergman's film I watched. However, this is a supreme work of art from the master of cinema who also made highly revered films like ""Wild Strawberries"" and ""The Seventh Seal"". ""Persona""'s beauty, is well suited for people who decide to appreciate cinematic art. Bergman's talent might have left us, but his works, his masterpieces, will be felt still, in the long future.(Cinematicmadness.blogspot.com)",Persona
162,chuckchuck21,Many women or one?,10,13 August 2014,Ingmar Bergman's Persona is a complete picture of Transactional Analysis in action. Is there only one woman in the movie or three? TA is an approach to psychology & psychotherapy that was created by Dr. in Eric Byrne in the late 50's. Born in Canada the Dr. worked in the USA. Bergman was obviously very well versed in Transactional Analysis concepts & brings them to the scene as only he can.The more I look at these scenes & their construction the more impressed I am. I haven't seen every Bergman film but this is definitely the cream of the crop in my estimation. I will never tire of seeing this movie & being amazed at the care & skill put into its construction. It's a marvelous achievement & a joy to contemplate. The acting by Bibi Anderson & Liv Ullmann & cinematography (Sven Nykvist) are the equal of the directorial effort. Easily a 5 star Amazon rating for this film. Recommended to all.I do admit to being puzzled by the montage lead-in. It really didn't seem to relate to anything in the movie & resembled the pictures used to test convicted felons for abnormal sexual responses. IMO it leads in a false direction for the film but perhaps the viewer is being tested.,Persona
163,frasif00,Experience of a lifetime ....Pick of a Genius mastermind.. a true Psychological masterpiece,10,10 March 2011,"I don no how This movie made me impulsed to make a review..this is an experience of lifetime ! Probably this is the best direction and camera-light work I have seen in a movie so far . This black and white classic is one of the most original and genuine psychological masterpiece of all time, thats for sure ! Now i come back to the point of this movie.The most amazing thing of this movie is that you can explain and see from two very different point of view ! both the lead characters are so complicated and strong that you can't say what's the lead and whats the supporting character ! From the very first appearance of this movie you will see some bizarre and symbolic scenes , traditional from Bergman. After that, the first appearance of the actress will give you many questions of what you will get the answers at the last of movie, in the meanwhile the suspense arise gradually that what happened to her for this kinda unlikely condition ?? why did she made herself mute and detached from the outsider world ??she certainly has her own very reason and U can do nothing but only respect her from that. But would it be pleasant or praiseworthy for every other person ?? There comes the second point of view from the second character ! She doesn't know many things outside her life, she is only a nurse. But does that mean she can't have her own very feelings about all things, own point of of view, above all her own ''persona ""? She feels like 'The actress' is her idle, though she doesn't wanna talk but that can't her aloft from expressing her very personal feelings only to her what she can't tell everyone. Ultimately she became very close to her, but she only saw the surface of the mentality and everything that that belonged to her, but then came thee twist ! When she finally got to know what she really is, she can't idolize her any more ! All the time she wanted to imitate her, but when she finally got some success in this matter, she can't like her anymore! What will happen now?? What about her own ""Persona"" ? what she will do now ? Ingmar Bergman is a real genius. He pulled every strings so carefully and subtly that you will be stunned and mesmerized how he could do it !I wish I could give it more than 10 ! Feel like seeing it again and again!",Persona

166,acorral-1,"Beautiful movie, shocking experience, a master piece",10,1 June 2005,"Is hard to say if this film is Bergman's best, but I can say with no doubt that this movie is one of the best ever. Reasons are many and I would like to start with the excellent photograph (as always) of Sven Nykvist. He is a genius and I can understand why Nykvist had been working with Bergman in 22 films and TV productions: when two geniuses collide the result is superb. He had been the cinematographer of Bergman's finest movies such as the excellent ""Cries and Whispers"", ""Fanny and Alexander"", ""Autumn Sonata"", ""The hour of the wolf"", ""Face to face"" and many more. In a sequence of Persona, almost at the end we can see the two of them (Bergman and Nykvist) behind the camera, preparing a scene with Liv Ullman. A silent recognition from the director to his friend. They been working together since 1953. How important is Nykvist in Bergman's work? Well I couldn't find better answer that Persona film. The use of light and shadows is one of the key elements on the plot. In the climax scene, when Alma (Bibi Anderson) is talking with Elisabeth (Liv Ullman) about her son's dark history, we basically see the same conversation twice; one focus the camera on Ullman and the other one, on Anderson. In the first sequence half of the face is on the shadows, when we see the other sequence, Andersonn's face have the same peculiarity, except for the side, is the opposite. At the end of the two sequences, Bergman overlap the two lighted sides of the faces to create one single face. An extraordinary and beautiful result, visually speaking.Other important element is the two actresses. For Liv Ullman, this film represented her first collaboration with Bergman as an actress and because of this film they started a romance. As a result they had a daughter and other 10 films together (including Autumn Sonata, Face to face, Cries and whispers). One characteristic of Mr. Bergman is to work with a select group of actors in all his movies. In this occasion he worked, besides Ullman, with Bibi Anderson and Gunnar Björnstrand (The seventh seal). Anderson's performance is excellent as the hysterical nurse. One of the best sequences is when she is telling Elisabeth the orgy history by the beach. The dialog is so powerful that we can image with clarity all the actions described. Good performances, as all Bergman's releases.Another key element of this movie is the strong criticism against Vietnam War (and war in general). Is a silent protest and in one shot we saw Elisabeth in front of the TV when a monk is burning alive. Probably that's why Ullman'a character stop speaking. The position and ideology is another important element in the movies, and that's why I consider Bergman one of the greatest, because he has the ability to reflect with mastery social problems and adopt his ideological tendencies and believes. Only few directors as Godard, Buñuel, Herzog or Fassbinder have the same ability.If you want to read more about the film, I recommend the essay that Roger Ebert included in his book "" 100 great movies"". He explained in a very simple words some of the sequences (like the first arbitrary images at the beginning, middle and end of the movie). Finally I want to comment about the image that represent the presentation card for the entire movie: Ullman and Anderson's faces. The first at the back, grabbing Anderson's hair, both smiling. Probably this is one of the milestones of 20th century filming industry.A must see movie and a master work. If you like movies, you will like Persona.",Persona
167,findkeep,The Limitations of Words,10,23 April 2001,"To really comment on a film like Persona there would first have to be written full, a dictionary of completely new words and terms.  Verbal language simply cannot describe the emotional piano Persona plays.  Along with 2001: A Space odyssey, it is the single most disturbing and mind opening film I have ever seen.    While in the middle of performing the last act of Electra, Elizabeth Vogler suddenly freezes, and from then on ceases to speak.  She is in perfect health both mentally and physically, but for reasons unknown has simply retreated into herself.  Sister Alma, a young nurse, is sent to look after her.  They go together to a small remote Island, where Alma attempts to nurture her out of her silent facade.  At first, due to her silence, Alma cares for Elizabeth like an oversized doll.  But then, with the opportunity of real conversation, Elizabeth becomes to her an empty vessel into which she spills her soul.  And Elizabeth, hollow, becomes a sort of vampire, constantly taking in Alma, but at the same time giving herself up as well. Nestled together, without the interferences of the world, their personas begin to mesh, as they become the two sides of a single personality, one soul living amongst two bodies.  However, as a human body warns off a foreign intruder, the personas of Elizabeth and Alma become allergic to each other, engaging in a fierce battle for identity. Throughout, as if testing his own skills as a seducer, Bergman tries to remind his audience that it is just a movie they are watching, not experiencing.  But true to his form it becomes of no use... Persona is an experience.  Alluring, compelling, mind opening, and disturbing, Persona is all of these things.  It is a film that works on a multitude of complex levels.    In a sexual sense, not a stitch of clothing is removed, and yet the film permeates with eroticism.  It is on many stages completely surreal, but you don't realize that.  You don't realize anything... you simply experience. And then afterwards you sit in awe, trying to recall what has just gone on.",Persona

171,N_Sgo,The Camera Wants To Be Loved,10,11 October 2007,"Just before he started filming this film, Bergman wrote in his notebook: ""Even if prayer is just a cry into an empty space, we should not desist from that cry."" Our camera is confused. It tries to show us a mother who doesn't love her own child, but pretends to do so. It tries to understand it, but cannot. We also cannot understand, looking through the camera's eye. Because points of view mix, intermingle, flow into one another. The camera is too weak to show us a mother who doesn't love, a God who doesn't care. In one powerful moment (the stepping on the shred of glass), it will try to end it all by burning itself up. But will have no choice but to go on filming, exploring this vicious riddle.What use is a world without a loving God? A world of the Vietnam war (a monk self immolates in protest), of the Holocaust (a child raises his hands before a gun). One in which a mother doesn't even love her own child (and keeps his picture only after tearing it in half)? There is one scene in which Bibi lies on a bed in darkness, behind her are two rooms full of light. Liv enters from one room then goes to the other. We hear a ship departing for voyage in deep sea.Persona is the name of a blank mask in ancient Roman theater, in modern times it is ""who you are"" socially. Bergman also is a master of faces, of masks, of affections. There is almost no action in this film, only emotion. As if there is some fleeting moment between one mask to the next, when the face might reveal something hidden, forbidden, truthful but unbearable. Our camera probes both faces in search of this moment.We get to see ourselves only in the beginning and the end. A child, (Bergman? Us?) first playing dead, then trying to explore his mother's mask-face, to feel her indifference, to find some reason for it. And the camera (Bergman? Us? Art?) , showing itself in the end of the film, confused, descending, burning up.There is a clear differentiation in the film between the spoken word (Bibi) and the written one (Liv). The spoken word is a window to the soul, which should be shut down to conceal this awful truth - a lack of love, an empty universe, without meaning. Liv tries and fails to become fully written, to suppress speech, to end this awful lie of truth. Bergman again: ""For the first time I did not care in the least whether the result would be a commercial success. The gospel according to which one must be comprehensible at all costs, one that had been dinned to me ever since I worked as the lowliest manuscripts slave at Svensk Filmindustri, could finally go to hell."" In a way, we all go to Hell with it.Bibi had an abortion, Liv gave birth to her unwanted child. Both meet in the doubled moment when the truth of Hate is revealed through a picture torn in half (first Liv's child, then the heroines faces). Finally, the faces fuse together, forming a mask of truth, combustible material. Famously, both actresses failed to recognize themselves in that impossible shot (in which, just like the rest of the film's attempted exploration of the unexplorable - the montage itself is, almost, framed).How brave do you have to be to explore a universe in which God doesn't care, from the point of view of God? It is bound to fail, yet it is a brave attempt, another cry. But Bergman cannot fully imagine this unbearable universe, where love can and should only be imagined. In the visit of the blind-deaf husband he provides us with a brief relief, an image of a loving god. But it cannot hold our faith, it makes Bibi scream in desperation. This is the most naive moment in the film. Because, by mistaking Bibi for Liv, the blind husband provides us with a hope that they could finally merge with each other. If such a feat was possible, we would have no problem to begin with. In fact, our entire film is this failed struggle for unification, the recurring discovery that the other side doesn't exist.Forty years after it was filmed, I sat in a movie theater and watched this movie once again. When it was over, the theater remained dark and the audience remained seated. For almost ten minutes nobody stirred. The theater's darkness, the camera's final silence, provided us perhaps some brief, much needed, blessing.",Persona
172,jackosurfing14,Art,9,15 July 2012,"'Persona' was my first introduction into the films of Ingmar Bergman, so as you can imagine the experience evoked such authenticity in it's surrealism that i was quite compelled to this story of two women. The story follows a nurse who is put in charge of an actress who can't talk and finds that the actress's persona is melding with hers.The opening sequence is surrealism as it's most audacious, as Bergman depicts a dream sequence that is no doubt baffling but still symbolically powerfully in representing a disturbing mind-state of the individual, which, like most art, visual constructs meaning of the human Psyche.The film is riddled with beautiful and disturbing symbolic imagery that includes the juxtaposition of the two women to produce a quite obvious surrealistic image of the conveying persona and a monologue from alma that is so superbly written in conveying it's eroticism, that it allows the audience to use their imagination in interpreting alma story.As i assume, this film will not confine to everybody taste and while i appreciate the film i have no doubt that repeating viewings is essential to understanding the films buried messages, however for film-goers who appreciate the intellectual and the use of film as an artistic form of subconsciously expressionism of individuals thoughts, visit 'Persona'",Persona

174,zennokangae,Not Beyond Intepretation,10,17 December 2004,"I've studied Bergman's films and have seen all of them, yet Persona stands alone as his most brilliant and indeed, the most visually striking (thanks to the genius of Sven Nykvist).The story concerns a cracked actress (Liv Ullmann-Bergman's long-time lover), in hospital for treatment under the guise of a rather insecure nurse (Bibi Andersson). As the tale of care- giver and patient plays out, the nurse, Sister Alma, fills the void left by Liv Ullmann's complete silence and regression by offering a series of confessions on her own life. These confessions, most poignantly, consist of Alma's infidelities to her husband, a secret abortion and a unwanted pregnancy to please her husband. Through the course of the movie, set mainly in a summer retreat, the two women, left in seclusion, seem to drift into one another's personae. However, Bergman's dialogue turns more to first person confessional and not a tale of two women. Eventually, the viewer comes to the realization that the two women are actually two sides of the same person. Liv Ullmann represents, in pop-Freudian terms, the superego as Bibi Andersson is the ego or in other words, the 'actress' is actually the nurse and Liv Ullmann, the caretaker/observer.Elisabet Vogler is actually Bibi Andersson's persona; the one who answers to the external world, whilst shutting out the sensitive, introspective and broken inner persona, Liv Ullmann. The movie comes to a sad conclusion, wherein the actress wins out over the delicate, fractured woman deep within. As the lines in the movie say, they agree to ""nothing"", keeping the facade intact to the rest of her reality and keeping distant from her older husband and abandoning any attempt to love her son, born to please her husband.A line in the movie states blatantly that everyone has two personae; the one external and the one internal. This movie is one of the greatest human dramas with a psychological force rarely, if ever, seen today. Along with Casavetes' ""A Woman on the Verge"" and Lynch's ""The Elephant Man"", Bergman and Nykvist commit to film one of the most introspective studies of mortality, sanity and the human condition.A masterpiece.",Persona

The story begins when a nurse is put in charge of an actress who has stopped speaking. This starts a relationship that quickly becomes full of trust, then suddenly turns into bitter resentment.

179,johanncats,the ruins of psycho-analysis,7,1 February 2011,"There was a time when people believed in Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung. They really thought they could scan the depths of the psyche and come up with some meaningful information. I seem to remember an anecdote about Salvador Dali who once wanted to hold a lecture in a diving suit. He sent someone out to get one and this person, while at the shop, was asked: to what depths is mr. Dali going to dive? The guy answered: mr. Dali will dive into the subconscious. The shop owner said: well, we need a reinforced helmet then.Unfortunately, what the believers of Freud and Jung frequently came up with was incomprehensible drivel. For me the worst of all was Anais Nin's novel 'Incest', in which she is actually inspired to have sex with her father at the advice of her therapist. She goes on for quite a while about the quantities of semen he is still able to produce at his ripe age. I thought this was rather sad, but undoubtedly it paid the bills. Not the semen, the story. Come to think of it, it may not even have been true. On the other hand, the great Norwegian writer Knut Hamsun (mentioned by some, like Ernest Hemingway, Henry Miller and Charles Bukowski, to have been 'the greatest writer of all times') seems to have benefited greatly from his psycho-analysis, which enabled him to write some more masterpieces, such as 'Wanderers'.Does this apply to Bergman at all? His biographer states that Persona is a film about anxiety, fear. He also states that Bergman did not feel too much for psycho-analysis. This is a bit of a contradiction already. If it's a film about anxiety, I find the execution to be lacking. I think in this case we should get a little more information about what's going on. Bergman made notes about the stills he put in the film (it is interesting to note that 'an erect penis' is not among these notes; 'a c**t would be nice', however, is), but the effect of those was lost on me, I just found them annoying. What is the picture of Nazi's apparently rounding up people (jews?) doing in the film? I like it when a film asks questions, but please, please, give me a chance to come up with an answer. Just a tiny bit, you know, just a chance. Another thing the biographer notes is that Bergman was interested in the similarity of the girls' faces. Apparently he was pleased that, when he made the still of the faces melted into one, and he made the girls pick out their own half, they both got it wrong. Now that's a nice teenage game for in your dorm when you're a bit drunk, trying to impress the girls, but do you make a movie out of that? Come on! (it must be said, in fairness, that Bergman showed he was quite able to impress the girls. All his life, he got the real beautiful ones. He married them, loved them to a point that they believed it, and stayed friends with all of them all his life. That IS impressive)There is one more thing that bothers me. Quite a bit, really. If I decided to shut up and never speak a word again, I doubt if anybody would care. I certainly wouldn't get a luxury vacation on some island with a handsome private nurse. What is it that makes people think that some kind of personal trouble, rising out of comfort, protection and self-consciousness, is so interesting that they can burden others with taking care of them, giving them all the attention and affection they crave and, ultimately, paying all their frigging bills? Have they no shame?Incomprehensible drivel is easily mistaken for profundity. Me, I like my coffee black and my trees to be trees. Also, I like a woman to be a woman and Bergman really has me there. What beautiful faces and what loving shots! And the faces were real, unplastered, unphotoshopped, un-color-corrected, these girls had wrinkles and spots and all. I bet they even smelled like themselves. Where can I get me a woman like that? These days they even perfume their houses! I also had them upside down, I thought that Ullman was Andersson and vice versa.So maybe I got the point after all. Alright, seven stars then.",Persona

181,michaelseaman,Cinematography,10,1 June 2019,"I began my viewing of Bergman's Persona around 10:10 pm. The fellow occupants of my house were all tucked away while I sat on our ludicrously sized sectional. I positioned myself dead center in front of the TV. I had a warm decaf tea (3 decaf bags & 1 decaf early grey for the pot) and drank it from my Criterion Collection mug. I was all set to turn on the blu ray, the gray lower case ""c"" appeared on the screen and I became nervous. I was worried this film was too obviously something I'd like, but that it wouldn't connect to me.The opening sequence is abstract, more than I had anticipated from a director like Bergman. These images would occur again throughout the film. In Persona we follow two women, one actress who ceases to speak during a performance and of her assigned caretaker. We first meet them in the hospital and then on a remote island. The nurse progresses from uniformed nurturer, to casually dressed confessional (her clothing unadorned, somewhat loose as she gradual unwinds some of her deepest held secrets) to black attire that mimics our mute actress and cruelty.I thought the nurse turning toward something sinister, something complicated and confusing was excellent. In the beginning she tells the doctor that she thinks she ought to turn down caring for the actress, that she's too mentally fragile to be with one so mentally strong to simply decided not to speak. This signaled a sense of weakness in the nurse, a delicate nature. But her fragility is not wilting, but raging at all the silence brings out.Bergman & Sven Nykvist paint such exquisite images throughout Persona. Some of them among the most iconic scenes in film history. They use white backdrops with brilliant lighting to amplify the shape of hands, fingers, their movements, the curves and angles of Ullmann & Andersson's faces in such magnificent ways. Then there are all those eyes that pierce with a gaze directly into the camera. Some are casual, almost, maybe dead gazes, some sorrowful, some brooding, arrogant, etc. I hope Ullmann's slightly furrowed, turned down glare never leaves my mind.I found out from one of the supplements provided on the disc, that the original title of the film was Cinematography.

182,mohammadalifallahzade,innovative,7,17 November 2021,"The movie was interesting, different and good. But it was predictable. I do not know if the director wanted the viewer to guess the story from the first moment, or because it was too late to watch this film or watch similar films, but personally, films that left the viewer with incomprehensible ambiguities and scenes. And I don't like the sense of directing alone, and I prefer to watch a movie that ends at the end of the storyline. Taking a sequence from two angles and twice with two creative faces was innovative and new in my eyes, but it was also a waste of time, which can be ignored due to the short time of the film. The film was psychologically and atmospherically appropriate. But he left me with many ambiguities, which may be due to the weakness of my cinematic knowledge. Anyway, I enjoyed watching this movie.",Persona

This one got by me somehow, but because of all the glowing reviews I've read here and elsewhere, I decided to rent the DVD. It was a complete waste of time: pretentious, dull and hollow. The only part remotely interesting was when the nurse describes an erotic beach encounter with some voyeur boys. Flashbacks, apparent dreams, repeated scenes, unexplained images. None of it worked for me. About the only thing that held my interest was whether or not Liv Ullman would ever speak a line. The answer to even this question remained ambiguous.This is the ""Emperor's New Clothes"" of all art films, as far as I am concerned. There is nothing there.",Persona

186,Thunderpa,Psychological thriller masterpiece,10,19 May 2012,This is one of my favorite films of all time. It is one of the best psychological thrillers ever made and sets a standard for future psychological thrillers to be judged by. The emphasis in this film is more on psychology and less on thrills or suspense. Persona explores some of the fundamental psychological issues that most humans experience as they mature and addresses these issues in a chilling way that should impact most viewers of this classic film. This approach results in a film that will be very compelling to some viewers and very uncomfortable for other viewers. This is fundamentally a two woman screenplay and the interplay of the two female leads provides the substance of the film. Both female leads deliver unforgettable performances. Any fan of cerebral films should enjoy Persona.,Persona
187,buystuff1_855,Bergman's Enigma: Art vs. Philosophy,8,22 February 2008,"I first saw Persona when I was a teenager, and then again recently (some decades later). Both times, I was impressed by its originality, the performances of Liv Ullman and Bibi Andersson, the precise camera angles and cinematography, and the fascinating Gordian knot of its psycho/philosophical ""meaning."" My take on the latter had changed a fair amount over the years, and I was curious about how other people understood the film. After reading a number of film reviews and a lot of the comments on IMDb, here's my impression: A number of commentators offer what they insist is THE correct interpretation of Persona. They often make eloquent cases, which vary from Freudian to Jungian to Existential to Post-Modern Deconstructionism, et al. But it seems to me that Ingmar Bergman created Persona not as a philosopher but as an artist. Instead of making a statement, I think he was trying to present a heartfelt quandary about art and the human condition. Taken as a work of art, Persona is a film that has many possible interpretations, each one valid if it is meaningful and enlightening to a given viewer.This time around, I took the title in the most general sense of the image through which a subject interacts with others. The ""persona"" of most films (and most works of art) is the fake reality we willingly pretend is real. But in the bizarre opening of Persona, instead of establishing this reality, the film seems to aggressively attack it. The confusing, disconnected images give us nothing to form a relationship with -- either emotionally or intellectually. We can only react with visceral responses. Without its ""persona,"" the film seems just a jarring, incoherent process with no purpose.Then, we're into the fake-but-convincing reality of the story of the two women. The nature of their identities becomes more and more ambiguous as the story unfolds, and occasionally the story itself is discarded by the film. Are there two women, or is there only one? Which woman has imagined herself as the other? Or are they both imagining themselves as each other? Which scenes are ""really happening,"" and which are delusional? Is this film a story about the two women, or is it something else? If it has no clear identity, can it be art? If one or both of the women have no real identity, can they be human? What are human beings behind their personae? If they have no fixed identities, are they even real? I think Persona is unique, brilliant, thought-provoking and unforgettable. Nevertheless, it is not my favorite Bergman movie. While I'm fascinated and often moved by the story of the two women, the avant garde techniques in which the film undermines the reality of the story seem to me more annoying than effective. They strike me as self-consciously ""clever"" instead of profound.One last impression I had this time around (which I doubt Mr. Bergman would have agreed with): from a religious or spiritual perspective, the story of the two women can be taken as a depiction of the hopeless artificiality of human identity when it is egocentric and based only on itself. If we ourselves are actually the product of a more fundamental reality (""God,"" ""the Tao,"" ""the ground of being,"" ""the Atman,"" etc.), then perceiving ourselves as the center of reality by which all else is determined (""cogito ergo sum"") is the ultimate delusion. By cutting itself off from the source of being, the ego becomes nothing more than an idea about itself. In that case, the absence of a real identity behind the personae is not a consequence of the absurdity of human existence, it's the consequence of a false relationship with reality.",Persona
188,RG-5,A film greater than the sum of its parts,10,20 October 1998,"Deceptively simple on the surface, ""Persona"" may be one of cinema's most complex expressions.  Critic John Simon has gone so far as to say that ""'Persona' is to film what 'Ullysses' is to the novel."" The comparison is apt.  In capsule reviews Bergman's masterpiece is often reduced to something like... a story about an actress who stops talking and is sent to recuperate at a beach house with a talkative nurse at which time the two women's personalities mesh. (The self-referential elements, like the projector starting up, the film appearing to catch and burn, and the soundstage shot at the end, are usually not dealt with in these reviews.) But I think Bergman's working title for the film--""Cinematography""--gives a clue to what the film is REALLY about--or at least one of the things.  ""Persona"" is about film; it is about the duplicity of film (tricking the eye into seeing motion; creating an illusion of reality, etc.) And it is about the mind's willingness--even eagerness--to accept the duplicity. It is about the duplicity of art and the artist (is s/he a humane observor, a voyeur or vampire--sucking the life from those observed?) In fact, it could be said that ""Persona"" is about duplicity in its broadest sense--the dual nature of things and the western obsession with seeing the world broken down into black and white dualities. But what's black is also white. Who's really the nurse and who's the patient in ""Persona""? Who's the actress; who's playing a role? (If ever a film demanded to be made in black and white, this is it.) Yet ""Persona"" is much more than just a treatise on duality. It is a film that seems to be enriched with each viewing, and the viewer is enriched in the process.",Persona

But I found some of the situations in PERSONA too obscure to hold my interest, Actually I couldn'tt watch it straight through, I kept going back to it over the course of several days and it seems much longer than its 85 minutes.

193,SantiagoDM1,Life trickles in from the outside.,10,31 July 2018,"Persona presents Elisabet Vogler, a well-known theatrical actress who, during an Electra performance, is speechless. Entered in a psychiatric hospital, although it is not possible to diagnose any type of disease, it continues without uttering any sound. After different tests, the doctor determines that she is healthy but, to get her out of her silence and practice different therapies, she entrusts her nurse to take her to an idyllic summer home to seek rest...The film begins with the staging of the entire cinematographic device. That allows us to look outwards (the lens of the projector that light gradually, the film that begins to be rewound to project itself) as well as inside the device. Stating that the enigmatic child seems to represent the viewer (not in vain, his role in the story is not other than to wake up and then decipher, first a book and then the film image of the two faces)...Ingmar Bergman's responds in a concrete way to the neuroses and the cinematographic challenges of his time. It dwells on philosophical themes which are portrayed in the relationship between the two protagonists.When it comes communication, although Elisabet barely speaks, her expressions on different scenarios proves that an opinion, story, emotion can be tell without a single word coming out of the mouth. On the other side, we have Alma, a girl whose monologues treat nihilism, abortion, lesbianism, imposed maternity, guilt, insanity, schizophrenia trough not only an a well written and poetic script, but a magnificent direction.Bergman's beauty and precision with which he handles the dream elements make the cinema of modernity reach completely new possibilities. This characterizes him as the genius he is frequently said to be. Accompanied by the astonishing performance of Bibi Andersson, the movie grants a shocking ride over the human condition.It's a visually stunning experience to every cinema lover.10/10",Persona
194,MilezDas,A Masterpiece that explores the enigma of Persona...,10,26 July 2015,"A movie which is hunting yet beautiful to watch. Persona has always been one of my inspirational movies. It has an impact on me that wants to study the human characterization.Every scene in this movie is important, even the conversations. When I am watching this movie, I start to assume how Elisabet is seeing Alma. Is she just watching her transforming into her, or it is just another play for her, or it just character study she wants to like a pet project. It just starts to question you. Even the camera focus is mainly on their faces and the overlapping scenes telling us that the Persona's are dissolving in each other. Sometimes the shots are taken from long focusing on one of the characters then going a foot closer then again closer and finally on to the face and the expressions.It is just so incredible to watch something magical happening. I still remember the conversation of Alma where she is describing her orgy with a boy and a woman. In previous conversation she says she has been faithful to her fiancé but in the next she talks about how she was lying naked, some boys are watching them, she is ashamed but still she doesn't want to move. The woman besides her starts to seduce the boy and she herself get in the action and how she describes her orgasm's and how she was in the moment of the seduction. It was just so, I don't know how to describe it. It was just like a moment of self exploration.Then we see Alma's outbreak over Elisabet's letter. How she reacts and how she feels betrayed. We also see how she compares herself with Elisabet in the mirror or the dreams of Alma where Elisabet is with her comforting.The scene where Alma goes to meet Elisabet's husband and the husband sees Alma as Elisabet and even touches her there are the images of Alma and Elisabet blending into one was just incredible. It was just the moment where the Persona title is defined perfectly.And the last and the best conversation of the movie where Alma starts to describe Elisabet's situation and how she is rotten person and how she hates her own child and the expressions on Elisabet's face and the repeated scene on how Alma is telling the story and finally breaking down and realizing she is becoming like Elisabet and then the dream sequence. It is just like a punch on our face.What I love about this movie is the characterization. This is a difficult movie to perform and make. Bibi Andersson and Liv Ullmann have given a performance of a lifetime. Liv Ullmann is just perfection here and Bibi Andersson is beautifully perfection. Her character was like a child like sometimes even a teenager and finally a mature one.Ingmar Bergman has given another masterpiece that questions the subconscious and the identity of someone.",Persona

196,ajoebird,Quite possibly the greatest film ever made.,10,12 August 2016,"I really don't know what else to say about this film, other than that it's a complete masterpiece. I should start by saying it's not exactly for everyone. If you're just getting into foreign films and want to pick a good one to start, this is not for you. If you think the best movie of all time is Casablanca, this is not for you. This movie is quite experimental. It famously starts with a montage of seemingly random images; the film itself in the projector, a man slaughtering a goat, a boy touching a face projected on a wall, and most infamously, a split-second shot of a penis. Personally, I found this opening sequence enthralling. It made me excited to watch the rest of the movie. Obviously, this is not the same reaction everyone has.That's the thing about this movie, as strange and impossible as it often is, it really has to be taken literally. The story, though it may seem to lack one, is about two women, an actress, Elisabet, and her nurse, Alma. Elisabet has mysteriously become silent, despite being otherwise mentally and physically healthy. She is sent to live by the sea with Alma. Alma worries that she won't be able to deal with Elisabet, and will start to go insane.Despite this, the two women seem to enjoy themselves at first. Alma talks about herself, and Elisabet, having little else to do, listens intently. The two women develop a strangely intimate relationship, and Alma starts to tell Elisabet her secrets. Over time, Alma becomes frustrated with Elisabet's condition and starts to hate her. At the same time, she loses her sense of self and the two women edge towards one ""Persona"". We get the sense that Elisabet is the healthier one by far.Bergman deals with themes such as the mind-body duality, the rejection of motherhood, and the inability of art (and film in particular) to deal with great tragedies. The images are beautiful and haunting. The writing is superb and often disturbing. The acting is expert. This film is flawless, and enjoyment really depends on whether you like this type of film.",Persona
197,gustavo-hernandez,An indispensable Film.,10,24 February 2019,"Persona, released in Stockholm, Sweden, in 1996, raises, since the very first minutes, a concern about consciousness and willing muteness. In the film, the singer and actress Elisabeth Vogler decides to give up on talking during a representacion of Elektra, an Opera written by the librettist Hugo von Hofmannsthal and composed by Richard Strauss. This way, the spectator is invited to juxtapose not only the musical piece with the movie, but also with the plays written by Euripides and Sophocles during the last decades of the fifth century of the ancient era.The opera's premiere took place at the Semperoper in Desden, in 1909. The event, registered in the local media as an episode of dissent, was a renowned confrontation between the conservative and liberal intellectual elites of the pre-war period in Germany. The comments exceeded the merely musical appreciation issues and, in several times, were discussed as a moral concern. Elektra was an inconvenient and uncomfortable piece to watch for a part of the public of the first decades of the twentieth century, which may have had fresh in mind some distressing cases that would disrupt not only the european politics, but also one of its fundamental pillars: the institution of family. In the piece, the homicide of Clytemnestra and Aegisthus is device by Elektra and Orestes, both children of her with Agamemnon. The story was commonly referred as barbaric, primitive and unprincipled; but, at the same time, it was not far away from the reality of the european monarchs of the period, especially those related to the Habsburgs. Some events, such as the Mayerling case, may have given some signs of degeneration to the subjects about their own rulers and social institutions, calling also into question the foundation of their own social constructs.At that time, It has been already three decades since the publication of The origin of the family, private property and the state, written by Friedrich Engels; an openly critical work which those institutions. In this text, Engels quotes Jakob Bachofen, a swiss philologist from the nineteenth century, who dedicated his studies to the ancient matriarchal societies and who also worked on the greek myth, but this time from the reading of the Oresteia of Aeschylus. He points that the privilege given to the father´s mourning, during the trial leaded by Apollo and Athena described in The Eumenides, is the transitional point from the matriarchal to the patriarchal society. The grief suffered by Clytemnestra, produced by the sacrifice of her daughter Iphigenia in hands of Agamemnon, is considered inferior to the one suffered by her daughter and son, who mourn their assassinated father. During the trial, due to the equality of votes emitted by the areopagus, Athena decides to absolve Orestes from the punishment of the matricide committed by him. ""Father right has gained the day over mother right. The ""gods of junior lineage"", as they are described by the Erinyes themselves, are victorious over the Erinyes, and the latter allow themselves finally to be persuaded to assume a new office in the service of the new order"", says Engels. Both, the interpretations of Engels and Hofmannsthal, will be a preamble of Freud's psychoanalysis theory, a direct critic to the main institutions of bourgeois western society. His ideas will be fundamental for the social movements of the second half of the twentieth century, releasing time of Persona.The sixties were nested within a political and cultural revolution, which vitally demanded a structural change of the western world, through an overhaul of its main pillars. The french structuralism, based on the studies conducted by Claude Lévi-Strauss a decade before, pointed tacitly the margination of woman inside the patriarchal structure of western society, the repression of the Dionysian inside the bourgeois order, the consideration of language as origin of society and also its ambiguous quality, the crux of political accion, the undersides that compose identity and representation, inter alia. The disturbance caused by Strauss's Salome and Elektra could reflect the physiological constraint and decadence of western society, a determinant factor for the protest of the sixty-eight and the political relevance of Bergman's Film.The figure of Alma, a nurse assigned to take care of Elisabeth Vogler, is intrinsically transgressive. Once back in the greek myth, the reader will come across the Erinyes, justice embodiments and guardians of the family order, who will pursue Orestes due to the committed matricide. They are personifications of the greek morality. Alma, an Erinyes, torments and harasses Elisabeth throughout her silence. What mutes sooner or later begins to take shape. Alma, empathetic and sensible to her patient´s calamities, shares a memory that inflicts on her a huge sufferment, becoming a detonating episode for the outpouring of frenzy between the two characters. Frank Gado, a Bergman´s film connoisseur, sees in this particular relationship an exploration on the architecture of schizophrenia. In this manner, Alma is the incarnation of the failed and unfinished Illusion, of a could-have-been, of an intimate hallucination. Thus, this bout could arouse the close relationship between isolation, psychosis and language.In her poem The three oddest words, Wislawa Szymborska prompts a pertinent ambiguity: ""When I pronounce the word silence, I destroy it"". Elisabeth pronounces this word and seems to destroy something therewith. The provenance of her muteness, as described on the script itself, is due to the hopeless dream of being; not seeming to be, but being conscious and awake at every moment. The feeling of vertigo and the constant hunger to be unmasked, once and for all. A neighbouring position to death, but at the same time distant from invoking it. To hear the echo of Nietzsche in ineluctable. The impetuous project of the Transvaluation of values of the german philosopher, as epic as almost every utopia, finds its execution on pieces like Bergman´s Film and Hofmannsthal, Freud, Engels and Lévi-Strauss texts. They stand an invitation to query about our social constructs, to become detached from the illusions of language and to dispense ourselves.",Persona

199,MovieCinematography,My favorite Movie!,10,1 November 2020,"Persona is a Swedish Drama and Thriller directed by Ingmar Bergman. It is a black and white movie from 1966 and is about a nurse, who is put in charge of a mute actress. That summary seems to be a little short, but you probably will enjoy the movie way more, when you don't know anything about it. If someone would ask me about my favourite movie, I'd probably reply with Persona. I wouldn't consider many movies flawless, but I just can't find anything bad about the movie. Although I probably didn't even get all of it, but that doesn't even matter, because Persona has so many great ideas concerning film-making. The idea of filming the ending monologue first with one shot, in which the viewer only sees the person who is talking and then repeating the exact same monologue but this time letting the viewer only see the person who is listening, is amazing. The cinematography fits the tone of the movie perfectly, the lighting and the framing are often used in a very creative way to elaborate the story. The Story works very well, although it doesn't need much characters and runtime to tell its story. Liv Ullman and Bibi Andersson both were a very good casting choice and give incredible perfomances. The opening credits alone are the best ones I've ever seen and I was immediately amazed.",Persona

Unfortunately, he must have read too many of his own press clippings to create this piece of trash.Sometimes multiple interpretations possible in a film is a sign of a director with insight and subtlety. In this case, however, it is a sign of a muddled mind too lazy to clarify his story.If you see this film and you are confused at the end, just remember that you are intelligent and its the director who is stupid.

201,tmartigarcia,Persona is a film about cinema.,10,8 October 2011,"Persona is a film about cinema.Bergman himself recognized that this picture was as far as he could go in film making. And in fact Bergman the theater director and Bergman the writer are here, above all, Bergman the film director. Images are the key of the fascination this movie is able to create. The reason we want to watch it again when it ends. The reason of us remembering it during the day. This is pure image, this is a film about light and faces and sounds. This could never be a novel. Nor a play. And, of course, it's a film of the 60s and thus it explores an unknown world of narration. Persona has a plot, a beginning and an end. You can recognize the characters and their dramas, in which you are always interested throughout the projection. But Bergman goes beyond. Dreams and reality are mixed (for both the characters and the audience). The main character (an actress, master of the voice in her crisis) turns to be a (mute) supporting one and the supporting one (a conventional nurse) turns to be the main character (a voice and her crisis). One speech will be repeated twice, with the same words but from another angle. Two faces will be one (and they will create one the greatest icon images in cinema history). The traditional system of shot/ counter shot is deliberately avoided: a face, two faces on screen. A frame will be torn and destroyed to reveal the destruction of a soul The film starts with an astonishing sequence of images, most of all related to movies: the camera, the film, the silent pictures. All mixed with sex and suffering and death. Elisabeth will also think about other images (Vietnam, the ghetto). This is life and movies. We are all that. In Roger Ebert's words: ""Most of what we think of as ourselves is not direct experience of the world, but a mental broadcast made of ideas, memories, media input, other people, jobs, roles, duties, lusts, hopes, fears"" (""Persona"", The great movies).Never forget the young boy of the beginning, with his glasses on. This boy is Bergman. You are this boy. He is watching a big screen with a woman face. A magical, fascinating, enigmatic screen full of fears, lust, sorrow and beauty. Never forget how the supporting role is the key of this movie. The one who was supposed to watch, to watch over the talking person but, instead, ends up being the one who is exposed to her own fears and contradictions, the one who is compelled to talk.

That was my personal experience with Persona. I felt that I was a little part of it, part of each of those women fears, arrogance, vices, prejudices, pain.

203,ecco,A film that deconstructs itself,10,5 July 1999,"Persona is a film that has accumulated massive amounts of analysis and criticism.  It is the defining film in Bergman's career (although I tend to vote Wild Strawberries as his best), although it received little commercial success in the US, not that many Bergman films do receive much commercial success in the US. The first thing one must remember before seeing Persona is the basic theme behind the film. This is a film that draws more on technique than plot.  As properly put by a previous critic, Persona is to film what Ulysses is to literature. A correct analysis.  Persona's plot seems simple enough: a famous actress loses the ability to speak and a nurse takes care of her.  Simple plot- almost too simple for that is what Bergman intends.  He made Persona as a statement towards art and film.  The true identity of art and how it becomes our lives and encompasses all of what we are.  Aestheticism.  Persona is Bergman's description, and indictment, of aestheticism.  Whatever talent as a filmmaker Bergman lacks (which is not much), he makes up for as a philosopher.  Persona is art. Persona is the anti-art.  Persona is a philosophy about itself and the world.",Persona

205,bizyrem58,A most memorizing experience,10,26 October 2002,"Ingmar Bergman's Persona,is one of the most understated movie ever made. Normally, when people relate to Bergman, they think of The Seventh Seal or Fanny and Alexander.  Persona, is, infact, one of the most exquisite film ever to be photographed.  We didn't even have to turn on the volume, just watching the camera guide us through out the film was enough.  Those of you who never have seen it,  imagine a movie(such as Steel Magnolias, femine based drama, such as Persona).  In this movie the dialogue takes place. In nearly directly middle of the movie it stops, and breaks up.  We see the cast and crew working on it.  We then see a eyeball which we then enter. We are taken back into the movie.  This movie is so far in advance for 1966, its scary.  Movies this wonderfully photographed CAN never be overlooked, never.  Go see this if only for the mystical photography. Enjoy.",Persona
206,cecai,Questions for Persona,6,17 March 2013,"1.The film is obviously emotionally intense. The main characters' (two women's) emotional squeamishness bears a huge charge of personal agony. But there are also elements in the film that do not seem to connect in any causal way. Can you give some examples?2.Another difficulty with Persona is that Bergman withholds any clear signals for the audience to sort out what is fantasy and what is ""real"" in the film. Can you give an example? Why do you think the film is structured this way?3.Notice the cinematography of the film. Can you tell in what it contributes significantly to the form and content of the film?4.Do you think the two women have exchanged identity? That Alma becomes Elizabeth and vice versa? If yes, what makes you think that way? If not, why not?5.Some say that Persona is about a duel between two women. The one who speaks/shows and the one who hides/stays muted. Both women are trying to protect their ""persona"" (mask). But at a certain point both masks crack and the truth (about their personality) comes forward. In what part of the film do you see that? Or, do you see that as part of the film? What do you think is Bergman's comment about this moment of the truth? Does he celebrate it?6.In view of the complete film, how would you interpret the first and last sequence of the film? First, briefly describe these sequences. How do you think the idea of ""reflexivity"" fits into the style and the theme of the film?",Persona
207,alexgrnl,"If you didn't enjoy ""The Fountain"", you won't enjoy this one. Overrated and disappointing.",4,8 February 2013,"The only reason I am writing this review is to contradict all the positive ones, which made me fall for this... trap.The highest rating this motion picture deserves is a 4 out of 10, and this only for its cinematography/technical part. The way the filmmakers use lighting to enhance the emotion conveyed by facial expressions is remarkable. The acting itself is, well, OK.And now for the negative points: As others have pointed out, any pervert with a camera can film male genitalia and animal slaughter and animal intestines... And I say this having no problem with nudity or other graphic scenes, as long as they have their place and use in the plot. Well, these do not. For all I know, they made me feel even more detached, and as a result, even more bored while watching the rest of the movie. Don't get me wrong, I am not a viewer who judges a movie according to how many explosions, gunshots and ""cool"" pick-up lines it incorporates... I don't like that kind of stuff... But...The greatest achievement of Bergman in this film, is indeed that he managed to turn an 85'-long film into boredom. Whereas, from a purely visual and technical point, the film is captivating, even though it's B&W, the plot was utterly disappointing and self-repeating. The nurse was supposed to become ""absorbed"" by her patient's personality and lose her own... well, this was poorly carried across the film's audience... I didn't feel that the nurse underwent anything like that... to the contrary, the nurse was being a total, insensitive ""female dog"" to the actress/patient.Having watched ""The Seventh Seal"" and ""Cries & Whispers"", I was rather hopeful that I would enjoy this movie (given that Bergman himself considered it to be one of his finest). I was particularly entertained as well as provoked by ""The Seventh Seal"", and reading positive reviews here as well as other sites, I decided to give it a go. I was let down. It was rather nice as an artsy film, but nothing more. Rather similar to Aronofsky's ""The Fountain"", which tried to construct a plot but failed (but, from a visual point of view, was marvellous, at least in my opinion), so to all viewers out there: if you didn't enjoy the Fountain, you won't enjoy this.",Persona

I will agree that this film is great if you wish to learn more about Film Theory... However, I personally didn't find the movie very entertaining. The movie tries to say how the two main leads are supposed to be a representation of a mirror reflection of themselves. I didn't get that. Certain scenes where it's supposed to represent the melding of identity, I got more sexual tension out of. Overall, I think the movie is trying to be to artsy. The Film understands the idea of self reflexive nature of film, but tries to make you understand by beating you over the head a hundred times while saying ""LOOK HOW CREATIVE I AM!"" If you like the film, that's great, you were able to get something I wasn't able to. However if you are more like me, It's only worth watching once for the theories and that's it.",Persona

After that, you can start exploring and one may say that much you'll find. There are many underlying themes. Everytime you watch, you risk finding a new one.

213,shaham,Persona is an inclination to have an ideal personality.,9,23 December 2008,"Persona is a commendable movie by Bergman. It's not a simple movie to be seen just one time. This film should be commented in many aspects: cinematography, acting, directing, and lightening besides the theme. In this film I could see so much about visual elements of film making. You can easily mute this film and understand the scenes without the monologues. On the other hand you can just listen to the monologues of the nurse (Bibi An.) without watching the movie and that is also admirable. Here I just try to focus on main theme of the movie.I have seen this movie for many times and after each time I changed my mind about the interpretation of this movie. Finally I found that Alma and Elizabeth are actually the same. Instead of considering two separate characters, Alma and Elizabeth, I saw Alma as the conscience of Elizabeth. The leading role of this movie is Elizabeth, even though Alma is the one who speaks during the whole movie. We know that Elizabeth has some kind of problems with herself. She is not sick because we know that she is mentally and physically normal. Her problem is the chasm between what she is to others and to herself. These two sides of her characteristics have been gathered in Alma. Therefore Alma is not a separate character from Elizabeth. She is Elizabeth's inside. Alma in the nursing dress is the good conscience of Elizabeth who tries to correct her, but Alma in other appearances is exactly Elizabeth's characteristic as it is shown to the others, mostly seen when they are in the summer place by the sea.To support my notes I will refer you to some scenes of the movie; first of all, the scene that Elizabeth's husband comes to her but the one who encounters him is Alma, however he thinks that he is talking to his wife. We also see in a marvelous scene, where the husband is talking, the camera zooms to Elizabeth's face which gives the sense to viewers that Elizabeth is addressed by him. But we see that Alma is talking instead. Thirdly the scene in which Elizabeth takes Alma's hand to her husband's face and touches it, can also be considered as a support to my note. Another supportive gesture is the scene in which Alma imagines Elizabeth beside her when she is looking to the camera and then they put their heads on their shoulders. This scene has been repeated for three times during the whole movie. The scene in which Alma thinks that Elizabeth has said: ""You should go to bed now, otherwise you'll fall asleep at the table."" And the day after that Alma asks her these two questions:""Did you speak to me last night?"","" Were you in my room last night? "" Doctor in this movie is the one who knows everything. She wants to correct Elizabeth by the nurse which as we said earlier is Elizabeth's good conscience. Elizabeth remains at the hospital in the whole movie and she just imagines that she goes to that summer place. Actually the struggle between Elizabeth and the good conscience happens in her imagination.Elizabeth gradually got closer and closer to her good side of conscience during the movie although she didn't show any tendency to it at the first scenes. And finally we see that she totally follows her good conscience when she repeats the word, nothing, said by Alma to her. This is where the mission of Alma is completed.In my opinion there are some vague scenes in this movie which I will go through. I saw an erect penis, a spider, a sheep, a nail in a hand, an old woman, an old man and a little boy in the beginning of the movie which raise some questions, i.e. why did Bergman use these elements in the beginning of his movie? What is the relation between these elements and the whole story? I just can give my understanding about penis element. Elizabeth hated to have a baby. Since penis can be considered as the source of making baby therefore it is involved in the first part.I have seen some films directed by David Lynch, and I have found that Lynch's movies have many things in common with Bergman's, especially they both have taken scenes with seemingly irrelevant elements (such as a penis, a spider, a sheep, a nail, etc in this movie which we talked about them above) to the general trend of the movie. And also both tend to take surrealism, insanity and depression to pictures. It seems that Lynch has been affected by Bergman's movies, even stepped further.It's important to notice that the movie starts in the view of the little boy. Elizabeth didn't want to have a child. While she is playing the Electra she decides to be silent. It seems that Elizabeth's silence is mainly caused by her problem with having child. So that's why Bergman depicts the boy in the beginning of his movie. The film starts with the boy watching and touching a picture of a woman which seems to be his mother in his imagination. The picture becomes clear by touching more and more. We have the same scene at the end of the movie, but at this time the picture vanishes (becomes white) when the boy touches it, and this means that the Elizabeth's problem is solved.""Shaveh Kaham""",Persona
214,pawel-lis,Absolute masterpiece,10,31 January 2009,"What can I say? It is an absolute masterpiece in some aspects bringing reminiscences of antic tragedies (in terms of gestures mostly - vide Maria Callas in Pasolini's Medea). But most of all this movie, as almost all Bergman's movies, touches humanity of a man and asks us questions that hardly none of directors was able to present in such a clear manner. The story can be read in many ways, but for me the symbolic one is probably the most fruitful. Persona, the face, mask, in a physical meaning as used in Greek tragedies, the way to become someone else, depict and reenact myths. On higher level, symbolic meaning of persona in Jung's psychology together with all his theories about ego. Simply, a 100% must see for every thinking man.",Persona
215,mikehakata,identity crisis in the 20th century,8,10 February 2003,"The most lasting feature of Persona is Sven Nykvist's incredibly beautiful low- contrast photography. truly unforgettable, and worth the ticket alone. However, this is also one of the film's failings. The story and the ideas are dwarfed by the images. The story is actually a simple melodrama, based on emotional betrayal. The ideas date the film, since its preoccupation with Existentialism is no longer as relevant now as it was in the Sixties. The concerns of the film don't carry as much weight now, and the fact that the drama takes place apart from the rest of the world is telling. This is a film that speaks to itself. It is a closed world, a beautiful one certainly, but it is not the world of  directors like Ozu, Fellini, Tarkovsky, Bunuel (worlds that speak beyond their time and place). It is not surprising that most of Persona takes place indoors. There is no outside world. The images and sounds of the Vietnam war are so distant, so cold, that they could be of any war. Having said that, Persona works on many levels. It certainly is rich in visual ideas, and it is  has an incredibly controlled rhythm. Any lover of film must see this film, although, on a human level I would recommend Through a Glass Darkly, Cries and Whispers, The Silence more. After watching it, I felt that I had seen a great work of photography, not of Cinema. In fact it was like beautifully shot theatre.",Persona

217,rodrigvirgolini-985-508630,"Experience the intensity of an authentic psychological thriller, beautiful in every way possible. Intriguing, mysterious, confusing... A diamond among films.",10,17 July 2012,"It is films such as ""Persona"" that give testament to the profound beauty of which cinema is capable of achieving, of which art is capable of achieving. Only a handful of times does one come across a motion picture that can truly reach one's deepest emotions, to a level in which it can, almost scarily, manipulate them. Ingmar Bergman once again proves his genius providing us with yet another unforgettable experience, from beginning to end. Throughout the entire movie, we are witnesses of a disturbing story of mental corruption. Bergman exposes the ambiguity and fragility of the human mind in a sublime way, utilizing an exquisite repertoire of resources. An intensity unmatched, constant, however with peaks so high that they are able to create extreme emotions. There is a sentiment of confusion that accompanies every scene portrayed by the beautiful Bibi Andersson, and her dazzling co-star Liv Ullman. Andersson is magnificent, as always, in her role of the soft and gentle Alma, nurse who is in charge of Elisabet (Ullman). Liv Ullman plays the role of an actress who is under treatment for her constant refusal to speak, and she does it fantastically, managing to display a vast set of emotions uttering hardly a single word. At times, Bergman manages to contradict Ullman's breathtaking beauty with a sense of what I could identify only as authentic fear. She gradually becomes truly frightening, in an enigmatic, sinister way. Legendary Sven Nykvist captures the images awesomely, as customary. Pure cinematographic brilliance, it is hard to conceive any possible improvement. The music, as well, contributes perfectly to the film's essence. There are sequences that combine resources in a manner in which surrealism is almost suggested, but only to generate feelings corresponding to the inner reality of the characters, in the most subtle of fashions. The conflict transcends the screen and crawls into the viewer's mind. The closeups, the use of lighting, shadows, the beauty of the places selected, make ""Persona"" a genuine masterpiece. Ultimately, one does not fully understand the meaning of the events, or even if they actually took place as originally perceived, giving way to a huge variety of interpretations. But such is the human condition, and that is why Bergman feels no need to explain either. Intriguing, mysterious, fascinating. A psychological thriller in its truest form. A jewel of the cinematographic industry. A work of art. I'm grateful I will one day die, having watched Bergman's ""Persona"".",Persona

222,marija_call,"Not an analysis , but a view",10,3 May 2015,"It is a Swedish movie which theme is not really clear as many viewers think. It is not just a story about two women and the closeness which they encounter in those circumstances, but a lot more than that. Maybe we can see it as psychological pattern of human behavior and reactions in situations, really ordinary and normal but not open enough for discussion. A mixture of such expressions of reality and acting portraying a film that really leaves you breathless. The way it takes the natural lines of the face and puts them in the sight of a camera that can literally eat your fear at any moment makes it that hard to not envision this film as a masterpiece. Some critics say that its basic meaning it is the one we should really try to accept because the film is a haunting mystery not in its plot but rather in its images. All in all is a poetry of images and that is what it makes the artistic challenge to grow in a diagonal of questions trying to answer what the underneath is. Eventually we will find that what Bergman is trying to show it's not to be written on the articles of analysis or in the interviews trying to expose his soul but rather on the screen and our understanding of its affection on us.",Persona

If you take all the emotion you ever felt from the viewing of any film and multiply it by a thousand, then you get close to what I just felt watching Personal. The first five minutes of fast, flashing, introduction of surrealist imagery, which subsequently creates the basis for plot, are the most unsettling and stomach churning I've seen in a film.The only way I can explain what this film made me feel is like being trapped in someone else's depressed mind (if that makes sense.) The viewer becomes immediately enveloped in the ever increasing feeling of unease and tension as the nurse and her silent patience's minds become melded in a chaos of self-examination, reverse psychology and dependency. Everything in this film in measured to perfection: the sound effects and camera work are amazing, and I especially liked the kind of intermission crafted from sharp sounds and images used to signal a breaking point in the relationship of the two women.Toward the end of the film, when the truth is revealed about the silent actresses past and cause of her silence, every scene is amazingly tense, powerful and brilliantly filmed. The drip-drop sound effect, which reappeared throughout the film, is eerily effective and cuts right straight through you. Obviously, I have a lot of unanswered questions, which isn't surprising from a film this complex, which has been studied for years, and will require multiple re-viewings to interpret, (Which I'm looking forward to). At first, I was a little dubious before watching the film, as I thought it might be a little too complex for it's own good (and mine.) But instead it has quenched my thirst for this kind of cinema - a kind I watch far too little of.",Persona
224,natalyseifert,"Breaking the ""frame"" in Bergman's 'Persona'",10,6 January 2015,"It's essential to always believe that what you see on a movie screen is trustworthy. We go to the cinema to watch a movie. We know how to act in this situation. We buy tickets, sit comfortably in the chair and wait until the film grabs us inside its reality. We see a complete product, forgetting about the camera that filmed it for us. We build this ""frame"" (G. Bateson) and play according to the rules until the lights are turned on again. Bergman in 'Persona' on the other hand wants us to know that we are watching a film. He breaks the ""frame"", showing the technical side of a movie. These are the light in the projector, an actual film reel, a boy that touches the screen/camera in front of us, Elisabet (Liv Ullmann) taking picture of us, a cameraman and his team in the last scene. These elements drag us out of the reality of this movie. But why does he do this? Breaking the ""frame"" can be seen as an attempt to make us feel the emotional state of Liv Ullmann's heroine Elisabet. The boy that we seen at the beginning is her son. At first he appears to be dead but suddenly for us he wakes up and starts to interact with the large screen that shows pictures of his mom (the screen shows pictures of both the main heroines but it's not clear whether Alma (Bibi Andersson) and Elisabet are two different people). His mother is on the other side of his reality – in a world where she doesn't have to play anymore. By the time we see another shot of a film reel, the relationship between Alma and Elisabet had reached its peak. Alma knowingly hurts another woman – film burns. When the ""frame"" breaks something goes wrong with the viewer as well. Elizabeth stops speaking with an intention not to lie anymore. She is tired of playing different roles. She doesn't want to sound fake. She breaks almost every ""frame"" therefore we see a film reel.",Persona

226,sanspakeryuksel,The Two Personas of the Same Women,10,14 August 2018,"From what I understood, this movie is about the two personas of the same women- the actress and the silent, isolated. Coming to the summer home is a means for this person to deal over the inner conflicts (supposedly unwillingly giving birth to a boy - one side of the women wants to prove she can be the epitome of motherliness and the other not wanting to deal with the responsibilities that arise from having the baby and leaving aside her theatre life.) In reality, this women really loves the theatre, but is also shocked by the love that the boy gives despite her lack of attention. The main reason her inner conflict arises is guilt - due partly to both her neglecting to give attention to her son and the guilt of receiving tenderness and love from his son. She believes that if she does submit to her son's love, she will also feel guilty because she does not deserve it. So, in terms of psychology, she projects the two conflicting sides of her into two characters - the nurse and the silent patient in order to solve these inner conflicts. At the end, I assume, the one and only person being Bibi Andersson, overcomes this inner conflict and supposedly submits to the love of her husband and son. I read reviews where it is the other extent (where the actress persona of the women overcomes the motherliness which I cannot agree with). My reasoning is that the scene where the husband supposedly comes back (we do not know what is real and what is not real {surrealism}) - the women in her mind believes that the motherliness persona has overcome her other persona. When trying to analyze this movie - one has to ignore the beginning plot. Essentially, there is no nurse and there is no patient - the patient is herself and she is trying to cure herself by contemplating over her life at the summer house. Bibi Andersson (assuming this is the real physical copy of the two personas because she is seen going on the bus home) creates this situation of {nurse helping patient} for her to make sense of reality. Basically, this movie is simple but complicated at the same time and although I enjoy films like this that make me think to the point I become irritated, everyone is supposedly going to take a different point of view. And I understand fully the reasoning behind the importance of each person having a different point of view - every person wishes to think of the narrative and the plot in the way they wish to see it (in the way that their lives {experiences and environments} have shaped them.) Hence the title of the film - PERSONA - the aspect of someone's character will be revealed through the emotions they experience when watching it and their perceived understanding of the narrative of the film and the emotions of the character.Repetition but didn't feel like deleting: It is very hard, with movies like this, to separate what is truly real and what is not real. I believe that the purpose is not to reveal what is real, but to reveal inside each person, the emotions that they receive from watching the film.",Persona
