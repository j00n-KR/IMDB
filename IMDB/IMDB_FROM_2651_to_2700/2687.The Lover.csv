0,SnoopyStyle,good looking exotic erotica,7,29 May 2016,"In French colonial Indochina, a French girl (Jane March) has two older brothers, Pierre and Paul. Pierre is their mother's favorite despite being a thief and a bully. They're in fear of him. She is repatriating him to France after stealing from an opium den. The family is running out of money for him to steal. On a Mekong river crossing, the girl meets a rich jobless globetrotting playboy Chinaman (Tony Ka Fai Leung). She tells him that she's 17 despite being only 15 and a half. He gives her a ride to her boarding school and starts an erotic affair. Her friend Helene Lagonelle is the only other white girl in the school.This is a solid example of the sub-genre of exotic erotica. It's got beautiful naked people but it's not quite overt softcore porn. It's more cinematic than the classic Emmanuelle or other pornographic B-movies. The exotic locations look beautiful. It is visually stunning. The acting is competent. These are actual actors. On the other hand, the story is paper thin. The plot isn't much to talk about but that may be besides the point.",The Lover
1,Theo Robertson,Sex Sells,4,19 June 2005,"The director of L'AMANT or THE LOVER as it's known in Britain was directed Jean Jacques Annaud who would later go on to make ENEMY AT THE GATES a pretty good war film that suffers from having a sex scene that seems out of place . The problem with his earlier movie is that everything else feels out of place except the sex scenes Am I alone in thinking this is a ridiculous movie ? The sex scenes are pretty explicit which may shock large portions of the audience but the non sexual scenes that drive the narrative seem to contradict the shock . It's supposedly to have been inspired by the true story of a French teenager who embarked on a relationship with a Chinese man in the early 20th century which shocked France at the time . Of course sexual mores were different in those days and the idea of inter racial sex may be rather blase nowadays but this taboo is even more diluted by the casting of English actress Jane March who looks anything but French / White European , in fact she looks like she's of Asian extraction herself ! Apologies if I'm wrong of Ms March's ethnic origins but that's how she looks . Couldn't the director have employed some artistic license and cast a blond actress so the audience are in no doubt that this is a story of lust between two people of different ethnic backgrounds ? Even the intrusive female voice over sounds like it's coming from an Asian actress and not a French woman ! As for the story itself - What story ? It's basically plot less with several scenes that seem to have either started or have finished too soon ( Watch this movie and tell me if the editor has done an awful job or not ) and occasionally a scene appears where the two protagonists have sweaty sex in bed or on a floor and considering everything I've said the only real topic of conversation surrounding this movie when it was released is how explicit they were for a relatively mainstream movie . Who was it said "" Sex sells "" ? Probably the distributors of THE LOVER",The Lover
2,bombersflyup,Good and bad.,4,1 November 2021,"L'amant is well made and comprehensive, the story and characterization empty and soulless however.From Jean-Jacques Annaud, who also directed ""Enemy at the Gates."" The actress chosen, a little conflicting in appearance to the story being told combined with the narration. Solid visually though and engages enough, I liked the symbolization of the hands coming together in the car. The secondary characters and performances were terrible though.",The Lover
3,whpratt1,JANE MARCH IS A SUPER STAR !,10,27 July 2003,"When this film started off, I had no idea in just what direction this film was going to take me.  The photography in Vietnam was outstanding and Jane March(The Young girl) and her famous ""Mans Hat"" had me quite confused.  However, when Tony Leung Ka (The Chinaman) appeared on the screen and started making SPARKS with Jane March, I realized that this was a very deep and beautiful love story that really went way beyond the bedroom mattress.  This film showed that LOVE will break down all walls of bigotry, race or religious beliefs and even an age gap cannot stop the love between a man or woman or young lady.  It is very sad that this couple could never grow old together and be able to look back at their wonderful romantic experiences!   A deep film with a great message, don't miss it!",The Lover
4,lasttimeisaw,"an above-average piece of cinema erotica, which gives a shot in exploiting the colonised culture, along with some R-rated explicitness",7,23 December 2015,"Marguerite Duras' autobiographical recount of a forbidden amour fou in 1929 French Indochina, between a fifteen-and-a-half-year-old French girl (March) and a Chinese man (Leung) twice her age. This film adaptation is beautifully shot by DP Robert Fraisse, for its stunning exotic scenery and erotic lovemaking intimacy, who earned the film the sole Oscar nomination.THE LOVER is director Jean-Jacques Annaud's sixth feature, four years after his animalistic faux- documentary THE BEAR (1988), a theme he would re-trace in TWO BROTHERS (2004) with tigers. Here, Annaud brilliantly lays the stress on the human's most primitive libido over the opposite sex in this immoral passion act, the sex scenes are the most notorious takeaway of the film, they are artistically graphic and starkly intense, but also shimmers with a tint of obscurity under the shadowy light of the so-called ""bachelor room"", where their trysts take place. Their sex attractions are alike, the vast differences of the opposite sexes between two cultures, two races and an upended social classes (she is from a poor French family where her widow mother works as a local French teacher in a shabby town, whereas he is a layabout who has an affluent father and a family business to take over) makes room for the story to develop in this manner.Annaud is also no stranger to the Chinese soil, he would shoot SEVEN YEARS IN TIBET in 1997, which for political reason along with the director himself, was banned in China; nevertheless, his latest work WOLF TOTEM (2015), a Chinese-French co-production based on a popular Chinese novel is a huge box-office performer this year, one-time even selected as the Chinese entry for the upcoming Oscar's foreign picture race (which was denied by the academy since its co-production status). In THE LOVER, his treatment of the Chinese man is slightly different from Duras' words, his inferior masculinity is moderately muffled by a veil of oriental politeness and endurance, especially when encountering the provocation of the girl's brash elder brother (Giovaninetti). But, when he is alone with the girl, a contradicted struggle between love and trade torments him and soon his weakness lays bare completely when he succumbs to opium and complies to the family-arranged marriage, but a final advent of the black limousine does suggest his futile but lingering attachment in their liaison. 1992 is such a banner year for Tony Ka Fai Leung, currently has three leading performances in my year's top 10 list, his portrayal here establishes a disarming mien as ""the lover"", a man whose job is to love, nothing else, incapable of changing his or his lover's fate.Accompanied by Jeanne Moreau's resonant voice-over, reciting Duras' segments of texts throughout, mainly we are channeled into the girl's perspective of the affair, her precocious nature and non-conformist behaviour, all through, in spite of her poverty-ridden background, she is the one monopolises the higher standing in this romance, ascribed to the self-imposed superiority of a colonist, even during their first sexual intercourse, she makes the first move. Tangibly, there is something morally sickening in the colonised land, apart from their blatant interracial sex trade. Such a formidable role proves to be a double-edged sword for the débutante Jane March, whose comely but aloof pretence matches the character fittingly, but also would curb her future career as an erotic desire.Frédérique Meininger, who plays the girl's mother, in her very limited screen-time, manages to unfold a great range of emotional spectra from jadedness to chagrin, agony, then utter disillusion. Suffice to say, the film is an above-average piece of cinema erotica, which gives a shot in exploiting the colonised culture, along with some R-rated explicitness, e.g. a pair of gorgeous buttocks humping to-and-fro on the screen.",The Lover
5,Irishchatter,Ehhhhh things I would change....,6,27 March 2016,"I thought it was an alright movie but I didn't quite like the fact, Jane March as the young girl wasn't that bothered to have sex with the Chinaman. She seemed to be quite hesitant and not at all confident for a young actress. I know she was nearly 18 at the time but for god sakes, they should've gotten a better actress that would be confident in doing the scenes with Tony Ka Fai Leung. I also didn't like the fact her character didn't have the same feelings for the guy because this really is meant to be a romance movie. Instead she just doesn't want to fall in love with him. It's really disappointing, I expected that she would say "" I love you"" back a lot but she just didn't. The sex scene's were very good and realistic. I have to say, it was an alright movie but it did let me down with a couple of things that needed to happen throughout!",The Lover
6,videorama-759-859391,"A much loved, and fine cinematic experience",8,24 July 2014,"The Lover is a beautiful Art-house piece of film making, it's sex scenes, boldly frank and indeed sexy, where on top of that, are two captivating performances. It's hard to understand why people takes jabs at March's acting. Here, she so convincingly plays a French teenage girl, who, while traveling to boarding school in Saigon, meets an older wealthy Asian man, Leung, while boating down The Mekong River. She falls in love with him, and a passionate and forbidden affair in many ways, begins. Her character is not a happy person, neither is mother Mother or younger brother, due to the violent abuse they take from older brother. Things become worse when this relationship intensifies, fueling a much vented jealousy from older brother, a nasty piece of work. The photography and use of locations, is beautiful, which wonderfully sells it cinematically. The Lover was certainly something different for me back in 94, where sadly after Color Of Night, the underrated March disappeared off the radar, before making a slight return in that atrocious and little known Tarzan film with Casper Van Dien. The old women narration of March's character, by Jeanne Moreau, as reflecting back on this time, is perfectly cast. On the whole, The Lover is a movie experience to be experienced, which will have you pondering if love really exists, between these two or about what real love is, in general. Leung is the greatest Asian actor I've seen.",The Lover
7,mjneu59,hardly worth all the heavy breathing,4,3 December 2010,"In Jean-Jacques Annaud's flaccid soft-porn melodrama a young French girl is sexually awakened by a polite but torrid affair with a Chinese gentleman in colonial Southeast Asia. The film was adapted from the autobiographical novel by Marguerite Duras, but is actually a dimwitted cousin to 'Last Tango In Paris', with all the pretensions but none of the power of Bertolucci's film (the anonymous characters are identified only as 'the girl', 'the Chinese man', and so forth). The eroticism so vital to the story is further undermined by a script that might have been improved by subtitles (but not by much), and fatally crippled by two leads with little chemistry and even less depth. There's nothing about the vague, passive schoolgirl played by Jean March to suggest she could ever write like Duras, so it's hard to connect the often exquisite voice-over narration (read by Jeanne Moreau) with the empty sentiments coming out her mouth. Desperate publicists tried to drum up prurient interest by circulating rumors that the sex was genuine, but it's a moot point: the love scenes are no more provocative than a gymnastics exhibition, minus the dexterity and grace.",The Lover
8,Nazi_Fighter_David,An exciting journey along a winding river of passion...,8,2 July 2003,"Jean-Jacques Annaud's film version of Marguerite Duras, one of France's most esteemed writers, is quite erotic... told from the perspective of a 15-and-a-half-year-old French girl, who learns very early about passion, love and heartbreak... It's the crossing of the river... The crossing, on a ferry, of one of the branches of the Mekong, in the great plains of mud and rice of southern Indochina... A pretty young girl goes back to Saigon... She is standing on the deck, extremely defiant, wearing a silk dress, a pair of 'cabaret' high heels, and a man's hat... She is approached by an elegant dark man from Cholon who is also crossing the Mekong that day towards Saigon... 'I like your hat. It's original. A man's hat on a young girl,' he expresses, and continues: 'If you want I can drive you to Saigon.'The rich Chinese playboy with a black Rolls-Royce is 32 years old, from that financial minority that owns all the popular housing of the colony... He's back from Paris where he undertook some business studies...The film, beautifully shot, is a dreamy fantasy of escape through sex... The escape is that of the poor French teenager from the horror of her house in Sa-Dec... While the girl merely abides her innocent mother, she loves her younger brother poetically, without reserve... Her brother is handsome but not bright, romantic but terribly fragile... She fears her elder brother, a brutal and lawless dissolute man, stupidly dependent on his mother... The inexperienced girl wants to see him in pain... The most remarkable aspect of the story is the strength of character of the young girl who is always a little sad... She finds the strength to proceed against the forbidden with a calm determination... ""I've never followed anyone into a room yet.,"" she exclaims... The room was dark, shipwrecked, surrounded by the never-ending clamor of the town, carried away by the flow of the town... Her body was in that public noise... Their love was erotic, immediate, unrestrained... It was physical, violent, devastating... But the girl loves other young woman in the boarding house, the 17-year-old Helen... Her passion for Helene is intense... Helen is immodest... She don't realize she walks naked in the dormitory... She doesn't know that she's very beautiful... She's innocent lingering on in youth... 'The Lover' parallels the life of Duras herself... The setting, in Indochina, is one she knows intimately... The story is set mostly in the early 1920s following the decline of French domination of the territory that is now Vietnam... The film is the most exciting journey along a winding river of passion, which ultimately flows to the sea... Jean-Jacques Annaud handles the story with real sensuality, romance and dramatic power... He shots much of the film with a distinguished style...Jane March is attractive, but not obviously beautiful... Her impressionable teenager's gradual understanding of sexuality is well presented... She was subjected to a close, penetrating gaze by Annaud's camera..Tony Leung, as the rich Chinaman, is the lusty son unable to escape his family's commands...Although unseen, Jeanne Moreau jaded voice narrates the action and imparts a special flavor... Her words are poetry, as any Duras reader knows...",The Lover
9,baumer,This film left me odiously conflicted,6,15 November 1999,"What a strange film, what a weird concept to be seen in North American theatres.  This is a film that was funded by the United Kingdom, directed by a Frenchman, starred a Chinese man ( Tony Leung ) and had a European feel to it.  So what the hell was it doing playing in a small Canadian city ( London Ontario, population 326 000 )on New Years Day in 1993?  And why did I go see it?  Probably because I had seen everything else at the time and my girlfriend at the time dragged me to it ( yes that is you Denise, if you ever read this review ).  As it turned out I have to admit that I enjoyed this film, and not just because of the rampant nudity and graphic sexuality, although that was quite nice and almost served as foreplay, but also because the story was interesting and strange and weird and depressing and thrilling all rolled into one.  Does that make any sense?  It does to me, sort of.The Lover ( english translation ) is a story about a Chinaman and a young French girl that seem to fall in love.  I say ""seem"" because they are so cruel to each other at times that I really wondered if their relationship really wasn't all about sex and pain, of the emotional kind that is.  She is much younger than he is and they are also forbidden to marry because of his customs and society to be wed.  So they have to put on a cherade when they are at the same function or in the same place together when his family is around.  There is one scene that had me angry and it is a scene when the young girl seems to go out of her way to look sexually ravenous with another man as the Chinaman looks on, helplessly.  She does so, clearly to get his attention but it is so cruel and blatant that it becomes disturbing.  But then again, love is that way at times (just ask my ex-girlfriend).  It hurts you and it gives you pleasure.  Their relationship was doomed from the start due to their age difference and their race and religious differences.  So it is inevitable that one goes out of the way to hurt the other. 
Jean Jacques Annaud and his DP photograph the film beautifully.  The sights and sounds of the 20's are lush and colourful and the film does a great job of convincing you that it is a time period of 70 some years ago.  The acting is quite good as well.  But I guess the only reason that I didn't like the film as much as I could have is that I, like a previous reviewer, felt almost voyeuristic and like a pedophile when watching the film.  I am not opposed to nudity in film and I think when it furthers the story it is just as necessary as the music and the script.  But seeing 20 year old March in as many comprimising positions as she was sort of made me feel, well, weird. Watching the two of them go at it was almost like watching soft core porn. It was great for me as a 21 year old man, but it also may have been a bit excessive.  I am not saying that the film is bad because of it, I am just saying that it is weird to see as much as we do.The Lover is a strange film and it will probably leave you odiously conflicted as well.  In many ways it is a good film but in other ways it is just, well, weird.  Here in lies the conflict.  Do you praise it for all that it is, or do you denounce it for all that shows?  Maybe both.  Still, if you ever do come across it in a video store, it may be worth a look.  It is different than almost anything you will see come out of mainstream Hollywood, and that is always refreshing.  And dit also made my ""ex"" mad. Now that was worth the price of admission alone.",The Lover
10,vitaleralphlouis,Outstanding Tale of Intense Love - Gentle on Sex.,9,20 August 2005,"It's no longer possible for me to entirely separate the book from the movie, but I'll try. My favorite kind of story involves the joys and dangers of intense love --- regardless of whether the seed of it comes from erotic attraction, because that does not matter. Intense love isn't voluntary and it can be life's greatest joy, but can easily lead to destruction and even suicide --- as in the case of the authors of ......(never mind). Set in French Indo China, a wealthy young Chinese man encounters an underage French girl and is struck as if by lightning in his desire for her. This desire will be fulfilled with the co-operation of the underage girl as well as her family, who are willing to allow things for financial need. The story absolutely reeks and oozes erotic sexuality, both in the book as well as the movie --- yet there is actually no real sex scene, as to have done so would have made this into child pornography and filming of it into a felony. No matter! Margaret Dumas wrote her sexually charged book entirely devoid of a sex scene, and the film limits this to a kiss --- albeit a scalding inferno of a scene. The drama and tragedy in the story is that the older man will -- in due course --- no longer have the French girl in his life, and with that light turned to darkness he might as well be dead, and his material wealth cannot patch, let alone cure, the agony. As for the girl, well I suppose she was intensely involved with the older man, as this would be a normal happening, and Ms. Dumas writing her best seller --- translated into 11 languages and still selling --- an exercise in therapy. Movie or book, emotional dynamite.",The Lover
11,bshaef,Not Sure Why this Movie was Made,5,30 May 2021,"However, it was one of my insomnia busters and served its purpose well for me. I think Prime stole the Cinemax after hours library because this was a perfect fit.",The Lover
12,yris2002,pleasure in its purest form,8,20 April 2009,"No doubt that the central element dominating The lover is eroticism. When I first saw this movie I was a little more than a girl, and I was simply but intensively overwhelmed by the high erotic quality of those encounters between a young girl, a little younger than me and a young Chinese man, being emotional and physical involvement mixed up with a sense of mental confusion: I wondered and was not able to figure out whether this story was just sex, or if any trace of feeling or spirit was to be found in it. I have seen it again recently and being now a young woman, older age makes you look at things with a different and more mature eye and to find a meaning: the young girl doesn't ask herself too much, just because her young age allows her not to think, she disregards the rational and emotional complications of love, she is endowed with that powerful mix of innocence and longing for experience which lead her just to enjoy the full pleasure and sensual side of love, without understanding if their's a soul, or simply a single feeling inside that penetrating body. The young man is, on the contrary, experienced enough to know perfectly what he is searching very clearly, and he is honest since from the beginning, admitting his life is based on pleasure. We are not told what will remain of these encounters, consumed in a shabby garconniere, as everyday life goes on outside, but I believe that they were so deeply lived and felt, that their future life will always keep signs within their souls. Indeed, in the novel, in the end we find the young man who comes to Paris many years later and calls her revealing that he has never stopped loving her and he would love her until death.What I understood and rationalized is the real quality of those love scenes which once appeared to me as too strong, too obscene, too strong, even embarrassing to watch. What Marguerite Duras and Jean Jacques Annaud wanted to render was physical pleasure in its purest form: her body, in between that of a girl and that of a woman, his glabrous body with his smooth skin resembling a statue, make their sexual encounters truly transcend reality. Everything is physical but but not carnal, body, not flesh, explicit but at the same time never indulging in vulgar detail, displaying but concealing at the same time, a celebration of sexual pleasure and attraction at its best, pleasure taken and given always in the shade, pleasure never shouted, but softly accompanied by evocative music and sublime photography. A movie aimed at an adult audience, however, I admit that some of that overwhelming involvement experienced as a girl, has remained and is still able to stir strong emotions.",The Lover
13,jonathanruano,L'amant,5,4 April 2010,"French director Jean-Jacque Annaud does brilliantly with films about animals (""The Bear"") and cavemen (""Quest for Fire""), but falls flat with this erotic movie called, ""The Lover,"" which is about a teenage white girl (Jane March) having a forbidden affair with a wealthy Chinese man (Tony Leung)in 1929 French Indochina. This movie's downfall is its lack of eroticism. We never get a sense that the white girl and the Chinese gentleman are really attracted to each other (to say nothing about being in love with each other). As a result, this film has some steamy foreplay and soft-core sex scenes, but after they end, we feel empty and bored for the remaining hour of this film (compare that to Louis Malle's ""Damage"" (1992) where Jeremy Irons and Juliette Binoche's character seem irresistibly drawn to each other and you will notice a huge difference). The sub-plot about prejudices against the Chinese comes across as a cynical (and ineffective) hedge for a film that has nothing else to offer apart from its sex scenes.",The Lover

This could be well considered an interracial LOLITA.A fourteen year old girl's family is of severely modest means, almost broke. Her older brother is a no account, gambling, drunken lout. Her younger brother is sickly, and her mother is at wits end.The little girl catches the eye of a wealthy, Chinese merchant's son, who's almost thirty. She cautiously welcomes the attention, even if not fully understanding as to where it might lead. The little girl knows too little emotionally, than she learns/knows physically.

15,headhunter46,"Bitter sweet, enchanting, but somewhat disturbing",2,26 July 2006,"This movie was enchanting in that it gave us a look at what Vietnam was like in the 1930's but it was disturbing in its execution. We are shown an obscenely wealthy man in his 30's obsessed with a young woman who tells him she is 17. Instead of respectfully leaving her to her life, he attempts to seduce her only about 30 minutes after meeting her. Maybe things were different in 1930 but this movie was being shown in the 21st century. This man would today be labeled as a sexual predator and to make it seem a love story was to me unacceptable. Had the woman been in her twenties it would have come across a bit differently.The redeeming factor of the movie was that it clearly demonstrated the effects of prejudice and racism.Do not watch this movie if you prefer something that leaves you with a good feeling, it is a bit saddening.",The Lover
16,marissas75,A sensuous escape to colonial Vietnam,7,1 February 2007,"""The Lover""/""L'Amant"" is a movie drunk on its own romantic, self-consciously exotic beauty. There is really something iconic about the image of Jane March leaning on a boat railing in her man's straw hat, loose sack dress, and crystal-embellished pumps. A number of other images also qualify as ""perfect shots"": the matinée-idol entrance of Tony Leung, who plays the title character, or the way the tears in March's eyes catch the light at just the right angle.With mixed results, the movie goes to great lengths to prove it's about something more than beautiful people having lots of languorous afternoon sex. Most successfully, it comments on the double standards faced by both ethnic minorities and women in this society. The Lover takes this 15-year-old girl to his bed but insists that he must marry a virgin; the girl's family is appalled by the thought of her having sex with a Chinese man, but eventually turns a blind eye to the relationship because it helps their financial difficulty. I'm less convinced, however, that the movie makes a cohesive and truthful thematic statement about the nature of love: the concluding line, meant to be poignant and romantic, is instead totally banal.Other than this last line, Jeanne Moreau does a great job narrating the movie: her voice is rich, aged, and mysterious, and speaks English very well. Jane March, as the younger incarnation of Moreau's narrator (isn't it nice how their names sound similar?) manages the difficult task of being both very childlike and very self-possessed. I thought Tony Leung's performance was shallow at first (perhaps because English is not his first language), but he eventually improves, and one of his last scenes is extraordinary.In my opinion, the central relationship in ""L'Amant"" is a bit too poorly defined to make the movie rank with the greatest cinematic love storiesthere are times when you're just not sure what part of it is love, what part is lust, what part is curiosity. But perhaps it's good that the movie leaves you with questions like these. And it definitely has a dreamy, sensuous escapism all its own.",The Lover

Tense, gripping, even the slow scenes are deep and not a dull moment. Probably one of Tony Leung's best performances. Jane March is excellent. I watched this in 1992.

19,Jeremy Bristol,Not as good as the book,6,20 March 2002,"There are just some books that shouldn't be made into movies because plot is not the main focus.  Margaurite Duras' book was one of them, and this movie is the proof.  While certainly one of the most erotic movies I've ever seen, and the cinematography can't be faulted, the movie lacks the language, POV switches (from first to third and back), and the stream-of-consciousness transitions that made the book work so well.  Without those key elements, what's left is a movie that shows the ""reality"" but not enough of the art.",The Lover
20,Alan-40,Very pretty. A character study without much plot.,8,17 June 2002,"This movie has been called ""soft core.""  Such an assignation might be justified, but it is not just.  No movie that takes such care with photography and scenery and characters deserves to be dismissed as a mere sex show.You feel as if you are really in a place called Saigon in the '20s. How directors can get those panoramic outdoor shots -- a bay with dozens of vessels including a steam liner -- with every detail in place and faithful to the setting is beyond me.  But that is what it does.  You get the impression someone checked to door hinges to make sure they aren't a model made too late for the story's credibility.As for the characters, March and Liang are nearly faultless in their roles, although at times the script borders on the less believable. Sometimes they also seem to be confused as to who is the lead character.  What makes it work are the supporting characters, including the vile older brother and the much-fallen mother.Having said all that, the critics that don't place this as one of the great movies are not wrong.  This film is worth seeing and worth preserving an any complete library, but not a lot more than that.",The Lover
21,Dark Eye,A Sensual Movie With A Difference,10,5 February 2000,"It's not often I get to see a movie like this.  The story of L'Amant potrays a most complex and provocative relationship between a young French girl (Jane March) and a Chinaman (Tony Leung).  The two lovers' attraction towards each other are purely physical, but there are a lot of psychological burdens and suffering that they can't break free from, since the two of them are psychologically washed-up people who lives within the shackles of society that they live in.  At times they treat each other cruelly while at times they treat each other with tender affection, yet we don't know whether they feel true love for each other or not.  That's where the story gets very interesting and different.The sex scenes are indeed graphic, but by no means done in bad taste or just for the sake of sex.  The film is much more than about lust, it is about two lovers who found refuge in each other's arms.  Jane March and Tony Leung gave great performances, showing the subtleties of conflicting emotions that they had to endure.  Beautifully paced storyline with great atmosphere and soundtrack will make this a worthwhile movie experience. Very highly recommended.",The Lover
22,rajah524-3,Mysteries to Us; So Obvious to Them,10,22 May 2009,"I think I was about 23 -- freshly returned from Vietnam -- when it began to dawn on me that the culture that includes most Americans is horribly crippled.(At our best, we seem trapped in a fog of bewilderment. At our worst, we are certain we know what is best for everyone. Yet we dine on a steady diet of ""love"" the French would swear was ""rage."") I came back from what had become quite normal to me to the place I'd grown up, and found it anything -but- normal. That sense of disconnection only lasted for a time. I wasn't conscious enough then to recognize that the undoing of my disenchantment was simply a matter of becoming a part of that crippled culture again.But when I see films like this, like Bertolucci's ""The Last Emperor,"" like Wertmuller's ""Swept Away,"" like Fontaine's ""Nathalie,"" I know once again what it is like to know what I really -feel- about life.

23,larrysmile1,Jane March's first movie is becoming!,8,11 October 2004,"Jane March has not made many movies in her 31 years of life. Only 8 films, I believe. L' Amant was her first movie in 1992. She was a very young and sexy 19 years old. I liked this movie and it bordered on being considered, in my opinion, ""clean erotica."" Jane's character falls in love with a wealthy Asian in Vietnam. Of course, he is betrothed to someone else. But, he takes an apartment in which he meets with Jane March's character and they make love in the afternoon. Jane is only referred to as the Young Girl in the movie. I think that folks will like this movie if they have an open mind and consider that the morality of the story is based upon the morals of the characters of the time. Too bad that Jane has not been offered more films to make, or, maybe she just doesn't want to make them. See this film and enjoy it. Larry de Illinois",The Lover

25,akkoziol,Love and torment,10,20 June 2007,"I saw the film at an art house in the early 90s and loved it. I later saw the unrated cut on laser-disc and the added footage did flesh out (no pun intended) a lot of the scenes. This film is so beautifully shot and much attention to detail is given so as to envelop the viewer in colonial Vietnam during the hot summer months. I wish it would have gotten a 5.1 treatment as the ambient audio tracks on this are great. The story is, of course, based on the Duras book of the same name but is perhaps a bit more tame. Great interplay between the two characters makes this movie great and painful to watch as the story plays out. Certainly not for the younger set (though it seems the younger set watches this as it is practically soft-porn at times), it's very erotic, often arousing, and sadly painful but beautiful.",The Lover
26,tintin-23,More Than Skin Deep,10,3 March 2008,"There are three interconnected themes in this film: an impossible love story in the colonial environment of pre-WWII Vietnam, relationships, and the constant crossing of boundaries and borders.I was rather disappointed while reading more than a dozen American reviews of this film penned by professional film critics. Only one reviewer seemed to be knowledgeable about the author and the position she occupies in the world's literature. These film critics concentrated somewhat obsessively on the sexual scenes, which take a total of nine minutes, or 8% of the film's duration. In my opinion, these movie reviews are the result of the genetic puritan attitude that prevails in the American society. Or maybe the reviewers were asleep during most of the film and only woke up for the ""good parts?"" ""The Lover"" has nothing to do with pornography. It depicts an intense passion, where, of course, sex plays an integral role. Annaud had no choice but to include this aspect of the story, and he did it in a meaningful and artistic way.The Chinaman has the advantage of being older, male, and wealthy, but he is Chinese -- and she is white. He has ""lived it up"" in Paris, where he had many liaisons. He is an expert at lovemaking. But he is also vulnerable as an only child, orphaned by his mother, dominated by his father. The Chinaman uses love and lovemaking to shore himself up against his insecurity. He is the archetypal romantic lover, talking to her of love, death, and eternity. His love, while passion-filled and pleasurable, is also an agony and physical torment. He is not at all the dominant, forceful seducer whom she craves. However, we must be careful to remember that we see his desire for the girl only through the narrator's subjective memories.By contrast, we know the feelings of the girl, even though time has certainly altered her memories. Right from the start, the girl refuses to use the language of love, denying the romantic concept of being his only love. The girl's desire for the Chinaman's body is firmly grounded in sensuality as well as in curiosity, but the first appeal she feels upon meeting him on the ferry is for his wealth, his luxurious car, his diamond ring. However, as she sails back to France, we learn that she comes to the realization that she may have loved him all along.As the affair progresses, other figures creep into the sexual imaginary: the young brother, the older brother, her friend Helen, and of course, her mother. There is a mother-daughter love/hate relationship. Duras depicts her mother as an unhappy, driven woman. She admires her mother's quality of perseverance, yet Duras cannot forgive her mother for the life of poverty and degradation, nor for her mother's excessive love for her oldest son and apparent failure to love her two younger children.And of course, Duras cannot forgive her mother's opposition to her becoming a writer. With her lovemaking, the girl experiences a triumphant sense of separation from and superiority over her mother. She is trying to eradicate the mother, to escape the stranglehold of their mutual hatred. The daughter's drive toward the lover, toward social disgrace and reputation, without understanding it herself, is to ""punish"" the mother.The girls' love affair with a Chinese man is also a giant step toward her liberation from the tyranny of her elder brother. It is somewhat ironical that the older brother's gambling, drug-addiction, and social marginalization are mirrored in the way her lover spends his days gambling and smoking opium.Finally, there is an undercurrent theme which runs throughout the film, which is that of boundaries and borders. The film opens with a ferry ride across the Mekong and ends with an ocean crossing, signaling the constant crossing of frontiers and borders: geographic of course, but also racial, cultural, and sexual. These are confronted and sometimes dissolved as the poor white girl of French parentage meets her wealthy Chinese lover in the Cholon, the ill- repute Chinese district of Saigon. She, a white girl, was raised among natives, almost as a native. He is a native who experienced the western culture and somehow longs for it.There is also the transitory period of the girl's adolescence, between what remains of her childhood, and the onset of her womanhood. On the ferry and on the steam liner, the girl wears a child's pigtails, but she is dressed in women's clothes. The gender roles are somewhat blurred, too: she wears a woman's dress, but also a man's hat, in a color that signifies femininity. The boarding school in Saigon is home mainly to the abandoned mixed-blood daughters of local women and French fathers. The girl has an intimate friendship with Helene Lagonelle, which is ambivalent and perhaps sexually charged. The girl is unable to treat the Chinaman with even a modicum of courtesy when she is with her brothers because he is Chinese, not white. In the public bus, she rides in front, separated from the locals, yet in her private home, she lived as a native. In the cocoon of the ""garconnière,"" she is separated from the crowd on the street by only thin cotton blinds. There is even a meta-boundary crossed, as Duras takes her memories and feelings and externalizes them in the form of her writing. What has been internal and private becomes external and public.""The Lover"" is an autobiographical love story set in a post-colonial environment. We owe the remarkable transcription of this literary masterpiece to the artistry and creativity of Jean-Jacques Annaud. In this production, he has successfully combined two art forms, the beauty of the written word with the fascination of the image. I believe that the film has been, for the most part, misunderstood in this country, and I would recommend a second, more open-minded look at it. It will be a worthwhile experience.",The Lover

28,Sam Sloan,Lolita of Viet Nam,10,28 June 2011,"The story is told to us through the sullen and hauntingly beautiful voice of Jeanne Mareau from the pages of novelist Margureite Duras' own book. The movie begins as we follow a young and beautiful French high school girl in 1929 French colonial Viet Nam when she begins her journey on an uncomfortably packed native bus to begin her school year in Saigon. It is on a small ferry carrying her and her bus across the Mekong River where we see her now standing along the side of the ferry staring out with her right foot casually resting on the ferry's bottom rung of a rope safety cordon. But also on this same ferry, watching her is a rich, handsome and well dressed Chinaman sitting in his chauffeur driven car, a car that must be one of the most luxurious cars of its day. He leaves the comfort of his automobile to join this very young girl and nervously and awkwardly attempts to make conversation with her. She seems disinterested in him and says little to him in reply, but pressing forward anyway, he then offers her a ride to the city. We now watch them riding together as the car drives along the dusty dirt road to Saigon with the only sounds we hear are those of the chauffeur honking the horn through the Vietnamese countryside passing rubber plantations and rice fields, weaving and dodging people and animals on the way to their destination in Saigon. He notices now her small hand resting on the seat between them and we see him now attempt to go beyond small conversation to make his first physical contact with her. He brushes against the side of her hand with his own and she doesn't draw her hand away from his but instead seems to relish his touch as we watch their two hands now become one, his hand over hers, their fingers eagerly and tightly interlocking in sexual intensity and energy.The Chinaman wastes little time in Saigon before taking her in his car from a break in school to a seedy part of Saigon in the Chinese district of Cholon. We watch them walk the last of the way through Cholon which she describes Cholon vividly as ""smelling of Jasmine, minced meats, charcoal and soup, busy with the commotion of the mid day meal."" In that room what follows is probably some of the most erotic scenes ever to be shown in a movie such as this and we almost aren't prepared for it, It isn't just what we see happening between them that holds our interest, but that room itself with sunlight piercing through the narrow slats of the room's window shutters, casting enough light on old used furniture, that bed and the writhing bodies of the lovers lying upon it to creating an unforgettable almost surreal dream-like state. We hear a cacophony of sounds just outside those walls produced by a motley variety of people, shoppers, vendors of every sort from stalls and along the street, diners, street peddlers calling out, a child (probably) practicing lessons on a piano and animals of every sort too. Together these sounds merge and drone on like that of locusts, somehow adding to the intensity of the sexual pleasures being engaged within the privacy of that room as if an island refuge from it all. This relationship as we expect is eventually doomed for various and obvious reasons and the time comes when they must part. Their parting and last sight of each other is poignant and from afar as we see Duras standing aboard the French liner, the Alexander Dumas as it begins leaving Saigon harbor. She is standing in the same manner she did the same day they first met aboard the small ferry, her left foot resting casually yet purposely on a bottom rope of the ship's safety cordon, as if a signal, looking intently outward for him where ever he may be on that dock yard. Finally, she sees his car, parked beside an old warehouse and almost hidden behind a pallet of unloaded piled high cargo with him watching her from the same seat in that same car where they had once sat together. They stare out at each other until they can see each other no more. She is not to hear of her Chinese lover again for many years later as we see her now an old woman at the movie's end sitting alone working at her desk in a dingy office in Paris with snow falling in the gloom of early evening outside her window. Her phone rings and he tells her in a voice that has lost his Westerness, regaining the dialect of his native China, she explains, that he loves her now as much as he loved her then and will always love her until the day he dies. Her emotion touches us as we ask why did it have to end? And as we ask that question, we are reminded of the impossible set of circumstances of race and age that by the standards of that day and this doomed any future for them. But still . . .This is a great movie, made all the better by Jane March and Tony Leung. March most ably portrays the innocent child school girl with the sexual awakening of the eager young vixen that lies beneath and erupts to the surface. March was made for the role and it is hard to imagine anyone else who could have played it any better. And Tony Leung had his role down just perfectly as well, bringing out the inner torment of the man he plays, evoking our sense of empathy for him in spite of the line he crosses in what many would call the sexual exploitation of a minor. I never tire of this movie and I watch it again and again and again. I know I am not alone.",The Lover
29,rawisnwo,A Classic,10,7 March 2019,"The Lover follows the lives of two characters in 1920's Saigon. The French girl, who is smart and sensual yet young, poor and inexperienced. The Chinaman, who is rich and experienced but constrained by an impending arranged marriage.These differences between the two create a lot of tension. This was a time of extreme prejudice and interracial couples were unheard of.Instead of a normal relationship, one of lust and fulfillment takes root. With the girl desperate to help her impoverished family and the Chinaman reluctant of his future partner, they both help each other. Sexually at first but it moves towards other ways.Visually, the film places you in early 20th century Vietnam. The sights and sounds are spot on and accurate.

Sex doesn't belong to the instinctual side of the human beings here, sex is about self discovery and the discovery of a new world. This self discovery brings not only passion, but also other feelings like hate, shame, anger, guilt and love. I don't know why people ask if the sex scenes are real or not because this is not the point here, it is the love story that's interesting, not the problem of the actors having intercourse or not.

33,Charles_LePoje,A French nymphet in a man's fedora thought it wasn't love,10,9 April 2007,"This exquisitely rendered film adaptation of Margaret Duras' international best-seller weaves a bittersweet story about the most unlikely love affair.An extraordinary love story unfolds in Saigon, in French colonial Vietnam, in the late twenties. The two protagonists whose budding liaison we follow throughout this melancholic French film are polar opposites. Cultural prejudice, the age disparity, class difference, racial divide, dysfunctional family, a pre-arranged marriage, a young girl in a man's fedora, all stand in the way of the most of elusive of humane pursuits - love. This is a love affair par excellence, about love of a very special sort; the only kind of love that is forever etched in the lovebirds hearts - the love that leaves both lovers broken-hearted.Veteran filmmaker Jean-Jacques Annaud (Quest For Fire, In The Name Of The Rose, The Bear) gives the stellar screen adaptation of the book - by his frequent collaborator, screen writer Gerard Brach - a de luxe treatment. He seamlessly translates the superb screen play to the silver screen in the most effective fashion; much like celebrated rendering of Mario Puzzo's 'Godfather' by another cinematic master - Francis Ford Copolla. Both directors have miraculously elevated source materials, pop culture international literary phenomenons, into cinema classics. This memorable feature is a crowning achievement in the career of an acclaimed artist with imposing international stature.That this flawless cinematic gem has not gotten prominence it deserves on our shores, is a lamentable testament to our puritanical society and the crudeness of populist taste. Irrespectful of high cinematic achievements the two sub-genres will always encounter sharp scissors of our merciless and hypocritical moral and cultural guardians. Our censors will inevitable relish at any 'sexually explicit', controversial love story that is left of mainstream (coffee-table pornography, in our righteous film critic's parlance) and, for different reasons altogether, at a serious, probing, insightful and provocative political picture. These are exactly the two film arenas in which foreign filmmakers are in a league way above the common and the mediocre, the two American leagues tackling the respective sub-genres.There is a seduction scene at the beginning of this luminous picture that is as sophisticated and erotic as anything written by Stendhal; right from a classical French novel. This extremely rich, masterfully shot, explosively potent scene brimming with subtle eroticism, is the meeting, in the back seat of a car, of suppressed mature desire and the sweet dread of carnal awakening of a nymphet.There are numerous scenes of striking beauty, poetically realized, throughout the movie, but one stands out. When the young girl, her sexuality fully awakened, approaches her lover's car and purses her lips on the window.The precise, top-notch editing serves the picture well, always adding to the story's narrative drive or allowing for a moment of contemplation. The most exciting scenes end at just the right moments, when the viewers anticipation is at its highest. They are always followed by a lingering or tracking shot of magnificent, lyrical beauty.Seldom is a close-up as eloquent as it is in the hands of Robert Fraisse, the film's Oscar nominated cinematographer (he had a misfortune of running against Robert Redford's 'A River Runs Through It). We learn more about the character of The Young Girl from a single protracted close-up of the girl, than we learn about characters in many other movies during the whole first act. By the time his camera reaches her old cabaret shoes, slowly lingering down her pigtail, pausing on a ribbon, the essence of her innocent persona is half-revealed. The whole film is spectacularly shot; a picturesque collage of never-ending, breath-taking images, elegantly composed and framed with a finesse full of visual majesty.The film main conflict surprisingly stems from the young girl's a priori approach to the blossoming relationship. Her determination to keep the affair strictly sexual could have come out contrived were it not for the grim circumstances of her family life that had her mature before her time. Not inherent to her age group, the determination was way ahead of her times. It would take decades for such attitude to approach mainstream with female liberation movement which emerged in the late sixties.On the opposite end, her rich Chinese lover is bound to marry according to his father's wishes and to the tradition of arranged marriages. Born into riches, with no profession nor any discernible talents, in his own words he is nobody without his money. Seemingly a perfect set-up for a guilty-free sexual liaison gets complicated when the Chinese bon vivant falls in love with the young girl and meets the torments of unrequited love.'The Lover' is a cinematic gem of rare color and unforgettable spark; the love story of singular beauty and distinct resonance.",The Lover
34,shoutingagain,let's talk about love. Maybe statutory rape too.,3,18 July 2020,"Gotta get kick out of main review listing ""POINTLESS objections"" yet in one of them instead seemingly indicating the objection is valid--the one referencing they DO NOT KNOW each other!! Sure, there's slow character development in movies that work. Not here! What does NOT work is trying to tell a moving love story that involves NO love, only lust. You never see them get to know each other at all. I'm no prude but can be honest about what I'm watching, it's f*&^fest only! He likes what he sees, lusts after her & then we watch them go at it.
Love? Don't make me laugh (or disgrace the word)... that is only, AT best, lust!
Secondly, add in the fact they both so wildly disrespect each other, words fail to convey.
Yes, he tells her at dinner how SHE is now not ""marriageable"" to him in China due to not being a virgin (yet he some stud I suppose. What the hell is with social acceptances of mistresses in Asia anyway? SCREW that patriarchy!) ..and clearly, I totally trust that crazy sexist misogyny existed in 1929 & maybe today...dunno, it's ridiculous & offensive. Yet she doesn't care, she's the same slut HE is.
Then she goes on to disrepect HIM at every turn as well, from the way she speaks ""Chinaman"" with such awful disdain, you'd think she's banging a dog. WHO would want a child like that? Even some rich pervert should have some small fraction dignity for himself left. Well looks like he does for ONE flash where he slap her (she almost appears to beg for it, so sick there too) --I mean, c'mon! Again, they do NOT KNOW EACH other, they never TALK (if they do, appears filmmakers so not want to let us in, heck, we might miss some more sex).
Truly to KEEP using the word ""lovemaking"" is offensive to those of us who know the meaning, so at least try to stop peddling your soft-to-medium porn by giving it something it is not. Just sex, so please don't make more of it.and yes, I was trying to seque (using ""child) to once again to the most disturbing part NO ONE cares about in this film. She's FIFTEEN so yes, that is rape. They are both more consumed with race, social norms & what others think than RAPE. some 36 (or there within) perv sticking it to some mentally unstable nymph-child nightly is gross, distasteful & unethical. STILL rape which is no light matter.
And all this, is REALITY! BAM! Can't gloss it up as some ""art"" piece, that's a laugh. No matter HOW lovely you try to conceal child statutory in earthly deep cinematography, music photography, lightening & good-looking actors, you are still trying to pass off a pig in lipstick (and calling it beauty).
OH and then lastly, kinda hard to also miss oft all the sick premises involved here, also introduced a solid notion of pimping & prostitution (what I guess she was & her Mom & brothers, pimps).
Women's groups should've picketed this disgraceful farce trying to pass as film art.

35,jodilyn,Beautifully and elegantly erotic!,9,20 December 2005,"I found this movie while searching through a movie bin for Christmas presents. It is a must have for your DVD collection but be aware there are very explicit scenes throughout the whole movie. It is not for the faint of heart! Amant, L' borders on almost pornographic eroticism. Some could say it is too explicit, however, these scenes are necessary to show what passions can be awakened and how confusion can come from such an awakening! The scenes between the girl and her Chinese lover are beautifully filmed, and the accompanying music triggers a dream like quality. The scene where he washes her after their first time together is sensuously tender! The sadness of this movie is how they can't understand or fuse their passions with their hearts. He cannot hope to be with her..he is tied to the social customs of the time. She cannot hope to be with him..she is also bound by social customs but also in not being able to give her heart to him and these elements transfer over to their affair..They are tender at times but cruel at others. It is the yin and yang of passion...the pleasure and the pain! In the end, they learn the tragic truth of it..the Yin and Yang of love and passion..the pleasure and the pain. Can you give sexual love without involving the heart and soul? It seems to not be an easy question to answer! Excellent movie!",The Lover
36,ostryjak,A well made film although I disagree with most of the other comments.,7,12 April 2005,"I loved the backdrop for this film. The scenes and the places. For me the story was one of unrequited love. The Chinese gentleman (and he was a gentleman) was totally in love with the girl and as we find out at the end of the film , remained in love with the girl all his life. She appeared to be a self motivated rebellious teenager who thought prostitution was cool. I think she , many years later and wiser , realized what she might have had. This young girl begins to realize that her choices have a cost as she is ostracized by those around her , berated on the one hand by her brother and used by her mother to obtain more money from the Chinaman. Although her family is quite dysfunctional I found it difficult to have any real sympathy for the girl who is portrayed as a bit of a tart with a smart ass attitude and no class to speak of. The opposite in fact of the Chinese gentleman. Quite a feat of acting I would say. Both parts were played well and I thought this quite a thought provoking film in so many ways.

37,penniah,Left me hot and cold... (spoilers),5,1 June 2002,"Let's get this right out of the way... yes, the sex is explicit. Guys, if you're looking for a movie with sex that you can get your girlfriend to watch, go find the unrated version. It's well done and doesn't have cheesey porn music.That being said, there are other interesting points to the movie. The characters are perhaps one dimensional, but let's be honest - so are a  lot of people out there. I don't understand why moviemakers are so often blasted for portraying people who aren't layer upon layer of insight and revelation. Real life is often not like that anyway.These are good renditions of people trapped by convention and culture. The Chinaman is an outsider, socially unacceptable, who won't step outside the customs that bind him. If he follows his heart, he will lose everything. So he doesn't. The Girl is much the same. When she is alone with her lover she drops the pretense that her milieu demands. But when she is with her family, he is just another man with a skin colour not her own, and she ignores him. With a little encouragement from her, her lover might have dared to step outside custom. But she was seduced by a rich, mysterious, older man and does not want what would come after if they did decide to defy everyone. She's already poor and sad; she doesn't want more of that life. After their affair is over, she experiences regret, but not because she misses what their life would have been, but because she misses the excitement in her sad life.At the end, you see how it really was: years later, he phones and says how he will always love her. He was, in truth, her lover. But as the narrator stresses in the opening, she had been fifteen and a half. This was not a story about two lovers, but the one. How many fifteen and a half year old girls do you know who are capable of mature unselfish love, the kind that demands real sacrifice? That's right, not too many. Real love between these two was never in the cards; while one partner may have been capable of it, the other was not.As far as story goes, there's not much. It's pretty basic, but great movies can be built on other things too. It's a beautiful film, as well. But the one biggest problem is the sex. It was done too well for a movie that didn't have much to put in the spots where there was no sex. The sex is hot. Then she goes back to school. Or home. Yawn. I kept expecting that maybe someone would do something in protest of her behaviour... her drug addict brother or her mother maybe. Or maybe the younger brother might shoot somebody... something!! But nothing. Blah.All in all, very nice to look at, but pretty empty, and very uneven.",The Lover
38,funkyjuju,Artistically sensuous and enjoyable.,8,15 February 2015,"""The Lover"" is, without a doubt, a stunning film to look at. Every frame is like a beautiful lost photograph and the setting is lively and exotic, particularly for a Western audience.One of the film's main strong points is its weather. For the majority of the film, the sun is shining and everyone is sweating attractively. It gives the whole film a feeling of ripeness which is probably symbolic of our young female lead's blossoming sexuality. It's only towards the end of the film, when the romance is starting to falter, that the weather breaks into rain which is both sad but also slightly releasing.Jane March's acting is not stellar by any stretch of the imagination but it doesn't really need to be. She fits perfectly into the style of ""nymphet"" beauty but her character is almost... boring. She seems disinterested in everything around her, even during love scenes or the scenes when she fights with her family. The character also borders on cliché with her casual, teenage cruelty and thin, white dresses that beat you over the head with their ham-fisted symbolism.Tony Ka Fai Leung's character is a lot more interesting. It would have been easy to make him very suave and predatory when he makes a pass at March's character but instead, they opt for making him nervous and intimidated by her. Leung's performance is wonderfully nuanced. There is one scene in particular, where he's consumed by rage due to the girl's treatment of him and forcefully has sex with her. He keeps himself more or less composed but you can see the anger and hurt bubbling underneath that calm demeanour.The love scenes are, at times, gratuitous but they are mostly gorgeous to watch and very cleverly done. There's beautiful scene of the girl being washed by her lover afterwards which is lovely and tender.The film's meandering plot will bore some viewers but I liked it because it mirrored the lovers meandering love affair that was doomed from the start. However, the ending of ""The Lover"" was unsatisfying for me. It just felt unfinished and vague, like they didn't know how to end the story effectively.Overall, The Lover is a visually exquisite film which is interesting enough to not be written off as simple pornography but it's not quite strong enough to be considered an art film, in my opinion. However, it's definitely worth a watch and will probably play on your mind for a while after your viewing.",The Lover
39,rolandbrilla,An underrated film,9,8 February 2002,"(contains spoilers)This is a very underappreciated and underrated film, and I do not really understand the reasons for that.  The story about the initially mainly sexual relationship that - after separation - turns out to be genuine affection is touching and has some interest with the ongoing family conflict and the cultural differences between the lovers.  The sex scenes are absolutely justified, in content as well as in length (I guess I saw a modified version, though), since sex is an essential part of the story.  The acting is good enough - especially Jane March needs to be mentioned, she gives a credible performance of a teenage girl in love and in trouble.  The development of the plot appears logical, the conflict unfolds in a credible way, and, for instance, the atmosphere during the dinner with the girl's family is palpable.  The scenery of colonial Vietnam seems to be caught very well, and the cinematography and the melancholic music are excellent.  One of the final scenes - the farewell, when the ship leaves the port with the girl - is very moving and unforgettable.  Overall, I think this is above average if not even great cinema.  Some people apparently did not tolerate the sex scenes, but instead of saying so, they try to deny any artistic value of that movie, and without any good reasons.  It may very well be that Maguerite Duras (the author of the novel, which I did not read) did not like the movie, that she had something else in mind that this movie failed to express - but overall, this film is as good that it has its own value, independent of the novel.",The Lover

After I saw the film I read the book which is a touching autobiography by Maurgurite Duras and that was the best book I have ever read. Now I am reading ""The North China Lover"" which is another autobiography which is the same story and I am completely into it. This film gives me a wonderful feeling  because all of this really happened. This was MASTERFULLY acted and OUTRAGEOUSLY filmed.  It was wonderful to see the lush scenery in Colonial Vietnam. All of  the storyline is touching and DROP DEAD GORGEOUS. Buy this film RIGHT NOW.",The Lover
42,thedoctoroctopus,Arguably The Best Looking Film Of The 90's,8,18 January 2008,"The first time I heard about The Lover I was in high school and it was one of those films that a few classmates of mine would always bring up as the ""dirtiest"" movie they had ever seen. When I caught the unrated version of the film when it premiered back on Cinemax in 1993. I had no idea what I was in store for. I had already seen films that intensely explored sexual relationships in graphic detail, but most relegated the central issue, sex, to the background. They were more concerned with showing the emotional consequences of unrestrained passion, and not showing the obsession as it's played out in the bedroom. What makes The Lover so unique is that it's a movie which is not afraid to show us exactly what its lovers do when they're together. It shows us in explicit detail, repeatedly. The movie has incredible acting, direction, production design, which I will get to in a second. But the main reason to see this film is Jane March. Throughout this movie Jane is showing us her beautiful figure and openly sharing with us her sexual uninhibitedness. Her scenes with Tony absolutely melt the screen with eroticism. She was 17 years old during film, and you can see that her tremendous teenager body was still in course of formation. Jane is almost constantly naked throughout the middle of this film, and see her young body from practically every angle there is. We get great looks at her body during sex, when she's being washed, when she's walking around, and even when she's just lying there. But even when she is not seen disrobing, March is unbelievably sexy. The scene in which she puts her lips on the window of a man who is visiting her at school are some of the most erotically charged scenes in cinema history.The story focuses on ""the young girl"", whose life is already a tragedy at only the age of 15. Her family was once wealthy and respected, but they lost it all. They find themselves living in French occupied Vietnam. There is no love loss between the young girl and her mother--a truly cold woman with no sense of right or wrong. One of her brothers is addicted to drugs, and treats her with nothing but contempt. Her only shining light of hope is her younger brother. The lover is himself a tragic figure. Educated in France, he despises much of traditional Chinese culture, and is desperate to leave tradition behind and marry for love. He is severely depressed, and becomes infatuated by the sight of a young European girl he spots on a ferry. He decides right then to pursue the young girl as a way to escape his increasingly sad state of mind. After accepting a ride in his car, the two find themselves tightly holding hands. After dropping her off at the boarding school she attends, he becomes obsessed with seeing her again. The two eventually make an arrangement to meet in his bachelor pad, which according to Chinese tradition, is a ""practice area"" for marriage. The very intense relationship progresses as each plays with each other's bodies, lives and feelings. He says that he is in a prearranged marriage and cannot marry her, but he seems totally taken with her. She says that sex is totally fine with her, but could she be denying that it is love that she feels? With both families aware and opposed to their meeting, the young girl and the lover continue on exploring each other. It is only at the end that the true feelings are revealed.What director Annaud does brilliantly is to portray the lovers' yearning without giving voice to it overtly. He depicts it through a series of disavowals, through the wounds they inflict on each other, and allows the viewer to fill in that which cannot be uttered. Annaud spent over a year in Vietnam scouting for the most beautiful locations and remain of French colonial empire. The music is rich, the costumes are beautiful, and photography captures the sultry atmosphere of Indochina. The director took a long time finding a young actress who could easily pass for a girl in her mid teens. He finally the incredibly youthful looking Jane March. Although she plays a 15 year old here, the makeup and lighting make her appear even younger.No review of The Lover is complete without mentioning its pervasive sexuality. There is a bit of a controversy over the possibility of Jane March losing her virginity during her scenes with Tony Leung. There seems to be so much speculation - and different accounts, so its hard to know the truth I guess. You'll notice her facial expressions in the ""deflowering"" scene seem to be authentic, as they show her grimacing one second and smiling the next. Did they have actual sex? Opinions vary. I believe they did, and the actors just lied about it after wards. Take the third love scene as an example. The fact that Leung and March scoot across the floor like that while in the throes of passion makes it seem very likely that they were actually having sex. The fourth love scene, which has March sitting on top of Leung clearly shows a penetration shot. One cannot fake that.In the end, The Lover is a compelling story of how people fulfill the need for emotional survival. It is a testament to how blind we are to our own deficiencies. The ending is one of the most haunting scenes in film history. It's impossible not to feel for the young girl as she thinks about what her relationship with her lover could have been. Check this one out.",The Lover
43,JdMoV,BLAH!!!,2,27 March 1999,"I'm sorry, this may be based on a popular novel, but I think that the whole story is just an excuse to see the untalented March nude or having sex with the also untalented Tony Lieung.Tedious, unerotic, and LONG.  OnE STaR OuT oF FoUR",The Lover

45,uruguayita_mimosa,A masterpiece,10,7 February 2005,"I have seen this movie in 1992. I was quite young, in fact I was 16 and when I heard about it something inside me make a noise. It seemed to be an amazing story, a girl of my age having a lover... I said Wow. And one afternoon I left my English class and I went to the movies. It was quite a desert. It was amazing, wonderful, marvelous, a gem. This story is well written and incredibly well performed with this exquisite Tomy Leung, an unknown actor to me at those times. The scene of the car, when Tomy Leung's finger barely touching Jane March's and the contrast with the one they are arriving to the Bording School with the grip of those hands. And her breath showing her arouse.The love of those people who cannot break the rules of the world they were living, the prejudices, the society but that at least they could enjoy a period of exquisite love, tenderness, passion, experiences that one person could never forget. For me it is unforgettable, I have seen this movie nearly 20 times and I have recommended all of those I think they deserve a piece of joy.",The Lover

47,fridaynightchicken,Better than expected,9,19 February 2012,"I saw 2046 and wanted something else that would take me to someplace other than the normal film construct. I looked through the indie film channels and found this on at 2 am, I recorded it to watch later. I read a review by Ebert and others which said the film was just like Emmanuelle and basically soft core porn. I wasn't too enthused by this, even though in highschool I liked the dubbed version of Emmanuelle so much that I bought a copy, it was so dream-like and ethereal. I looked at the director of The Lover and saw that he also directed 2 brothers about the two tigers and I liked that movie so I got more enticed. I do like to read a little backstory about a film before I see it, because I see them as a piece of creation/art and since I am spending an hour or two of my life observing this creation I would like to understand the context of it. The Lover is a good film, and a great imagination. Even though the original author experienced this same plot in real life, her imagination is the one that brought all these events into existence and viewed them from this narrative.I empathized with all the characters. The director and the original author depicted the pain of each person so well, usually without even saying a word. Just the role that each person plays and their conditions really draws you in. I could relate to the older brother and the film even made me reevaluate my own status in my family. When the young girl asks her mother why she treats her older brother so differently than the rest of the family the mother simply says 'I don't know'. That to me made this movie more true and legitimate than any other movie I have seen. Because everything else that happens in the movie relates to this trueness, and it all correlates so crystal clear. It is truly a sad movie. That is the core of what it sent to me. The poor young girl, the poor family. It was broken apart through events and the protective figurehead, the father, died. Now, they are left in squalor in Asia, and they are truly at a loss at how to reorient their lives. It is like watching headless animals wandering around with no understanding of what to do or how to fix it. And out of this, lack of center, the young girl enters her sexuality and her female skill of lethal seduction. The seduction that many young women use to give their feelings of insignificance something of power and control. This young girl draws a wealthy man to her by her skills and right from the start her animal nature tells her that she just caught what she was fishing for, in a sense. She has become significant. And she uses this role that she has created to elevate her to near or above her domineering older brother, and the squalor around her. She finds love, that she is missing from her mother and dead father. And she knows that the wealthy chinaman only wants her because he can't have her. From the start this chinaman showed that he was unworthy of compassion, by the way he told her he only wanted sex, and so she began her pantheress pursuit of his carcass. Her sense of guilt was non existent from his display of inconsiderateness for the thing he wanted to eat and use, and so the young girl's mind was free to take her prey down to lengths even she couldn't know she was capable of. And perhaps she was still more able to continue with it because of the hurt of her knowing that if she ever did fall for him his sense of need would die along with his inability to possess her. She liked how powerless he was, and to be honest, it is very enjoyable to be reassured that no matter how much money you have, you can never buy somebody's emotions.Though the last of the feeling that you get from this movie is the sadness that this poor girl had to sell herself for the emotions that she could have and should have gotten from her family and those around her, love, devotion and importance. I see it all the time, and it just makes the woman feel cheap and disillusioned with life and cold at how heartless and simple people can be.",The Lover
48,valentin_rubtov,Wonderful movie,10,22 March 2005,"A great movie after all trying to show as clear as possible the impossible multiracial love relation in old French Indochina at that time, although a wealthy Chinese guy and a financially poor white very young girl are involved. The atmosphere of that society is very well showed with all its interdictions and decadent customs. Jane March is shining in this movie and the role is just perfect for her despite the multiple soft core scenes she was involved in. The movie is based more on the very youth of the feminine character, oh her sexual development, on the taboo customs of that time society, on the fragility and undeveloped feelings of the feminine character and on the maturity and steadiness of the masculine one. If you have the chance to watch this movie when you are at least in your 30's, you will have the chance to see more deeply inside the fragility of both characters and pay attention less on the sexual part of it. Generally it's wonderfully made and it is worth watching.",The Lover

50,moviemaniac-9,Passionate and Sensuous,9,14 June 2003,"Oohoowow, this is one of the best love story i have the priviledge to watch and one of the best movie ever produced.It is erotic, passionate, sensuous, sensitive,  stunning, zesty, reflective, cinematographic, haunting and a very tragic love story.The movie is based on the semi-autobiography of one of the most famous French author, Marguerite Duras who passed away in 1996.I certainly disagree with several critics who did not hesitate to label the motion picture as ""nothing more than a soft-porn.""  This is pretty obvious to me that the critics are unaware of or have ignored the story behind the story and the message the author and the film director are trying to convey.Just because this movie contains scenes that are erotic with nudity, and passionate, it does not mean that the film is pornographic. Critics need to be aware of this fallacy. Moreover, critics have ignored the historical background of life in French-ruled Vietnam and the general French attitude towards the Vietnamese and the Chinese in the 1920s and 1930s.To paraphrase another fan of this movie, who reasoned that, if this film is a porn, it would not has been nominated for an Oscar and won an award from the mainstream French Cinema. I would add: it would be totally ignored bythem.One of my favourite erotic scenes in the movie was when the girl gradually and teasingly, pursed her lips on the glass window of the limousine for her lover.Another favourite of mine is: the scene in the limo, showing Jane and Tony slowly and hesitatingly held hands together without looking at each other.The camera works that captured these two moments were extremely well done. These two scenes were so erotic, my heart nearly skips a beat. To do justice to this movie, one really needs to watch it, to believe what I have just described here.The Story: This is a movie about a teenage girl who was physically and emotionally abused by her mother and elder brother. She felt unable to control her predicament.She sought solace and control through her passionate affair with a wealthy Chinese man (actor Tony Leung) from Cholon.
The affair is tragic from the beginning because of the cross-cultural conflict experienced by the two lovebirds.On one hand, there was the French social restrictions about relationships with the ""inferior"" race of Vietnamese and the Chinese. On the other hand, it was about the Chinese tradition of arranged marriages.The question is: Did she eventually love him?Here are the words of Duras: ""Among all the other nights upon nights, the girl had spent that one on the boat....when it happened, the burst of Chopin.... There wasn't a breath of wind and the music spread all over the dark boat, like a heavenly injunction whose import was unknown, like an order from God whose meaning was inscrutable. And the girl started up as if to go and kill herself in her turn, throw herself in her turn into the sea, and afterwards, she wept because she thought of the man from Cholon and suddenly she wasn't sure she hadn't loved him with a love she hadn't seen because it had lost itself in the affair like water in (the) sand and she rediscovered it only now, through this moment of music......""By the way, the Chopin music did played in the movie.

53,foghorn46,Great love story but.....,9,15 July 2006,I have seen the movie 3 or more times and am still mesmerized by it. I think the story is great but could have done with a little less of the sex part. Sure it is needed but to that extent? The passionate scene where intense love was being made maybe. ..... The others maybe a little less Hence the 9 rating instead of a 10. Great insight into the life of the era.It was interesting to see how the rich in China lived. I wonder though who was the looser in the story? Who do you feel the most for? The lover because of his lack of backbone? The mother for her lack? The young mistress for her lack of self esteem? Why could no one stand up to the older brother? Was the younger brother just as hopeless as the Chineese lover? Might be an idea to read the book and see if it tells me.,The Lover

56,jhk53,Touching and beautiful,9,17 February 1999,"""The Lover"" is a beautiful love story.  Unlike other movies, it does not portray love through excessive sweet-talking/ or heartbreaking tear scenes. Rather, their love is portrayed only physically (sex).  ""Chinaman"" and ""Young girl"" are two weak people. Chinaman is rich, but powerless under his father.  Young girl is so poor that she gets beaten and abused in the family. Their names were not given, it was not necessary. They were without individualities, both under control of others, hopelessly weak. When those two were met, their love blossomed, seemingly with money and pleasure. Every little scene and moment is beautiful.""The Lover"" is a special movie, because its love is above the prejudice of appearance, race and wealth.  It is even more touching, because it is a story of two powerless beings, desperately trying to find love. When they ultimately find true love, they become more than nobody. Through love, they existed.  Excellent movie, I recommend watching it more than once.  The more you watch it, the more you feel it.",The Lover

58,zn75,lust lead love,10,20 November 2005,"It's a movie I heard of long time ago and just saw it on last weekend. All I know about it is it's a story about a white girl and a Chinese man in Vietnam. The movie is famous for it's sex scene. After seeing it, I think there are much more than sex.For the sex showed in the movie, is more than other ""normal"" movie. But for a grown adult, I don't think it's too much. The impression I have for the sex scene is the close-up shot which shows the man's skin and even fine hair(he has silky smooth body so you know how close the shot is) For me, the impressive part more lies in the experience of denial. On the surface level, the girl feels it's OK for meeting the Chinese guy, but actually he hates that. It's not only peer pressure, the girl herself doesn't feel it's right to have sex with the guy. She likes the guy and she desires the sex, but also he felt guilty for that. So she uses her mother and brother's punishment to lessen the pressure.Years after that, she are more open to her true feelings and she can make her own judgement so she value the experience greatly.I think for everyone of us, feels guilty for what we do sometimes and use peer pressure to release the pressure from ourselves.",The Lover

60,z_williams16,You'll love The Lover,10,15 June 2006,"I loved this movie, and i think its safe to say that it is the only (if not one of very few) extremely erotic movies that can be taken seriously for its plot and the sheer caliber of its film-making. This movie is a beautiful recreation of near '30's Colonial Vietnam (i don't know how accurate, but i was convinced), the ""look"" of the movie can be summed up with that one scene near the start where the camera pans up on the girl and shes describing her wardrobe; her cabaret shoes, dress and unique mans hat (that no other woman, Vietnamese or otherwise is wearing at the time), you get an impression of subtle defiance from her that only expands and endures as the movie courses on. The cinematography of 'living' in this movie really draws you in, be it when they're washing out the house, dancing in the restaurant or (my favorite scene) when the car overheats and the young brother gets out with a watering pail to get some water from the gutter, it just made me smile, all these scenes are elevated by the camera work and positioning of the characters. Anyways the dialogue is amazing, like when the girl says ""my brother smokes too much"" to which the Chinaman replies ""too too much"" (i just thought that was so naturally clever) or when she first makes love to the Chinaman and describes him (part of him) as ""the golden novelty,"" this is a prime example of how this movie, unlike so many others, elevates the eroticism within it to something more than 'porn with a plot' as many other erotic movies seem to be, the focus of this movie is the story, it just happens to be erotic (not that i'm complaining), and if all that wasn't enough to get you renting (or buying) underlying and driving the plot is the brilliant and engaging retrospective narrative by an older Duras (Author of ""The Lover"").

62,ray-528,An example of colonial life and attitudes,8,16 September 2006,"Review This is primarily a love story, heightened by crossing the color/race line and constrained by the colonialism and snobbery of the times, which, to some extent still occurs today. It is a sad story for both parties, and anyone in an arranged marriage today without love,will identify with it, if they had a prior romance. Apart from this,the settings of colonial Indo-China under French rule are authentic and show what the lovers are up against. The film portrays accuracy in both the sets and locations and of course the lovers meet on a ferry, of which there are fewer and fewer today. Interestingly, the French colonial family that the girl comes from is by colonial standards poor and unsuccessful - as was the case when many Europeans who could not make it in their home countries went to the colonies where they had servants and a much better standard of living at the expense of the natives. The Chinese man also comes from an immigrant race to Vietnam.",The Lover
63,lorrie-26,Unbelievably beautiful and touching Love Story,10,2 April 2009,"I just watched this movie for the first time last week and have not been able to get it off my mind. I have watched it several times since then and have bought both the books written on this subject and also the DVD and soundtrack. I think everything about it was beautiful, from the music, the scenery, and the acting. I think the most sensual parts of the movie are when the Chinaman first sees the young girl on the ferry and is watching her from the automobile and then leaves the car and approaches her. He is supposed to be a worldly man and experienced with women but yet trembles as he offers her a cigarette. Another sensual scene is in the car driving to Saigon and he moves his hand close to hers and begins touching her fingers and then she clasps his with her thumb and then they are clutching hands. Also he watches her all through this movie, on the ferry, while they are driving, while they walk together, in the restaurant and then while she is dancing with her brother, you can see the jealousy. He is a gentleman and a gentle man. He offers her his coat when she is chilly and really does love her. I think those scenes are more sexual than the sex scenes. I think her leaning on the ferry in the beginning of the film with her hat on and her dress blowing in the breeze and her leg on the railing shows how sexy this young girl can be. There is something about that scene and the same stance at the end of the movie that is sexy and the Chinaman saw that. I do think she loved him and knew that nothing could come of it so she was not going to say she loved him or cared for him. I think she was acting tough because she didn't want him to think she cared for him. I almost think she was the seducer. That she was ready for an adult encounter and he was the one that showed up. Why wouldn't anyone want him. That shot of him as he departs from the car and then turns around was something else. He is so handsome. I wanted to know where I could go to get one of him. Yes she is ready for a sexual adventure and she goes for it. I felt very sad that the two of them could not spend the rest of their lives together. When he tells her at her mothers old plantation that he spoke to the father and tried to tell him that a love like theirs only comes once in your life was so touching and then says the father would rather see his son dead than with a white women and she remarks back that she will be leaving anyway and that she doesn't love him. I thought she was mean to say that but then she was mean in a few scenes. I thought he had more class than she did and manners as well. I cried at the end, I guess because the love had no place to go once she left. He was left with nothing and she was moving on to whatever. Then she realized that she did love him. After reading so many articles on the book and the author it seems that the Chinaman was the great love of her life. That the relationships she had did not work out all that well and he of course left her know that he had always loved her. This relationship that they had lasted for a year and a half according to the book. In that much time you can become very attached to someone. If there really wasn't anything there on her part as far as love or caring I don't think she would have stayed with him that long. She was young she would have moved on. This is definitely the all time favorite movie for me. I am haunted by it and cannot stop thinking about it. Jane March did a great job as an unexperienced in the love department young girl. Tony Leung Ka Fai, uhmmmm let me say this, wow what a handsome guy who makes the screen sizzle when he is on it. Those shots of him in the beginning and at the dance and his wedding all I can say he is something. His dress is impeccable in this movie. He really looks like a rich aristocrat and behaves as one as well. Loved the movie and will never forget it.",The Lover
64,synthysys666,My favorite movie ever!,10,28 February 2010,"I first watched this movie in 1992 with my second girlfriend... I was 32 at the time and had very limited experience with women. This movie was so life changing in so many different ways for me. I have always have had playboy tendencies and the story really kind of resonated with me. Its about a Chinese trust fund type of dude who basically just hung out and partied with different women, one day he meets a young white school girl and they seem to really click. For the rest of the movie, they basically just hang out and have mostly a physical relationship. This film is one of the most erotic and well filmed movies I have ever seen! In 1992 I barely ever saw anything like this and have not since. The build up of sexual tension is something that you never see in any films. As far as the explicitness, it never really occurred to me that this film was explicit at all. Two years after I saw this film, I became single, and for the next ten years, I basically lived the lifestyle of the Chinese Playboy. In fact I seduced at least half of the women during this time period by showing the video, there were some misses, one gorgeous Russian girl who was actually a bit innocent, found it somewhat pornographic and I blew that date. But we did become good friends to this day anyways. This movie is one reason I had such a great love life during those years. It makes me wonder about the power of great movies, because my other couple of favorite movies actually kind of frames my lifestyle too. For those who don't like it much, there might just be some racism involved, seeing a non-white male, especially an Asian male in such a sexual movie must be kind of a role reversal from the usual negative stereotyping of my race. Thank you the creators of this movie, I have had a great couple of decades thanks to your movie...",The Lover
65,deserthordes,Poetic exploration of female sexuality,10,27 January 2004,"This movie is one of the very few successful attempts at evoking female sexuality and sensuality in a non-obscene way. It's an exploration of the work of the senses, not so much a story with a plot. Therefore, it is unique in the history of cinema. Whereas other movies featuring a young girl and an older lover are mostly playful, ironic or simply intent on breaking a taboo, this movie brings an ode to the senses themselves in a much more subtle way.Difficult as this may be, Annaud brings us as close as we can get to the atmosphere of love in a colonial and exotic setting. This delicate setting with its many contradictions (race, gender, age) adds to the experience. (A young girl who explores her own sexuality, couldn't dream of a more well-suiting context). In fact, the ""colony"" herself is a major character in the movie; the colony with her mighty Mekong River, her smells and colors, her strange sounds and her enigmatic people.On a more metaphoric level, the Colony represents a temporary space, a place where Western people only pass through, a space that cannot be owned forever, a place of love and hate, just like the lovers' relationship. And in the end, the lovers have to go their own way, just like the colonialists have to leave the colony they love.The movie is poetically slow, and at times becomes an almost ritual repetition of a single act. Precisely therein lies its 'dramatic content'. Add the beautiful cinematography and you have a nice exercise in film.",The Lover
66,S-Paduraru,A masterpiece,10,26 May 2013,"I have to start by saying this is my favorite movie of all times. I consider it both technically and as a storyline to be perfectly done. I have seen it dozens of times, it almost breaks my heart each time, the incredible acting, the story and the music are simply impeccable. Watching it several times made me understand the drama better, how She hides her love behind society's appearances, with her heart torn apart during a brilliant piece of music by Chopin. I don't think I have seen such expressive faces of actors before, each character so fantastically defined, you can practically read his/her thoughts on their faces. Lovely movie, a masterpiece in cinema indeed!",The Lover
67,wilsonso-1,the best love story on my list,10,31 December 2005,"I have seen this film when it first opened in 1992. I bought the film when it became available. Sometimes when we think a film is the best movie ever made, it might change over the years. Not in this case, 14 years later, The Lover still stays on number 1 spot on my list. The voice of the narrator and the music has an lasting effect on me. The sex scenes were very natural, and not 'dirty'.The were many similar love stories that come along, (for example -The Notebook, Harry & June) but non of them can be compared to The Lover. You can feel the passion between the two characters. If you don't believe me, see it for yourself, it will change your view on love! Btw, number 2 on my list is A Very Long Engagement! Number 3 spot is a tie between ""Amelie"" and ""In The Mood For Love"".",The Lover
68,cporac,May I could see her soul,9,18 January 2005,"I always wanted to meet a woman like The Young Girl of this movie. First I didn't hope it may be succeed, but lately I found that the subject of this movie is up to date. The Young Girl lives in the neighborhood, suffering the stranglehold of restrictions, ready for destroy anything conventional, first of all her innocence.Marguerite Duras & Jean-Jacques Annaud created the most magnetic female hero for me, who acts it if she's hell-bent for passion, but keeps secretly her feelings.After all, I think the story is not about her, but how society can deform human relations...",The Lover
69,helenfadel,The best movie I've ever seen,10,29 August 2014,"This film is my favorite. It shows how a Chinese man in his thirties falls in love with a 15-year-old girl. Although she is not conscious of the love she feels for him because of the social pressure she has to face, young Marguerite Duras (the film is based on her autobiography)completely abandons herself to the man and discovers true love. To me, the way the film was shot is quite poetic, even artistic. Far from conventions, The Lover is an immersion in colonial Asia. You can smell,ear,taste and touch what the characters are experiencing: something unique that even time can't erase.",The Lover
70,mattshi,what love is?,9,23 June 2005,"""What love is ?""""What love should be?"".Such questions totally beyond my intelligence,and i know the more i dwell on these questions,the less i will find.But i just can't help myself thinking about them since i reviewed the movie""lover""(情人) this afternoon. i don't know the girl really love the Chinese man until i heard the west girl crying and screaming in her ship to hometown ,when she forced to leave the man forever....Yes ,this ending i guess the director tell us both the 2 love each other deeply ,though the girl refused to admit her love for the man because their races ,ages,families,and religious all extremely different....... It is really a good movie ,though only suitable for adults duet to its sex...",The Lover
71,jaeminuf,Tender and near sublime,10,26 May 2008,"The beauty of this film and its heartbreaking romance lie in the unspoken, between the acrid disavowals of love, in the bitter context of colonial racial, socio-economic, and gender relations. Tony Leung and Jane March superbly portray the tensions existing within the multiple layers of colonial relations - the emasculation of the Chinaman vis a vis the privilege of the girl's whiteness playing out along with the shame and barbarity of the girl's poverty vis a vis the civility and access of his Chinese (not even native) affluence. Ultimately, the schism wrought by the sociocultural constraints of their disparate backgrounds is what tears them asunder or rather dooms their romance from the beginning.What Annaud does brilliantly is to portray the lovers' yearning without giving voice to it overtly. He depicts it through a series of disavowals, through the wounds they inflict on each other, and allows the viewer to fill in that which cannot be uttered.As for the graphic portrayals of sex, I am usually the first to decry graphic sex scenes. However, in this film, the sex scenes again plays out the dynamics of the characters as a part of the larger colonial relations. The tenderness of this film and of its romance lie within the beautifully cinematographed sex scenes as well as in the violence and poignancy that exists throughout rest of the film.",The Lover
72,rbnwills,A film that haunts the soul!,10,15 November 2006,"This is one of my favourite films of all times. If you are a man then you must surely see the action through the eyes of the Chinese lover ... who loved this beautiful young woman in the physical sense but who never quite possessed her! If you are a woman then you will see the action through her eyes ... intrigued by this older foreign man who awakens the woman in her but where she is not quite mature enough to cast off the restraints of upbringing and recognize love until it is all too late! As I see it, he is first attracted to her as to any of the many other young women that we are led to believe he has slept with, but ... what he has not reckoned with is the dawning of his love for her. For her part, he is exciting and a way to rebel against her suffocating upbringing as well as an outlet for her emerging sexuality. For them both ... and for us the audience ... a 'love' experience to look back on with bitter-sweet memories!",The Lover
