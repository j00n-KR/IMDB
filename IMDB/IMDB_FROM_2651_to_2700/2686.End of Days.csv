0,Leofwine_draca,Arnie's apocalyptic actioner never disappoints,7,7 July 2016,"After the relative quiet patch of the mid '90s, Arnie is finally back on form in this apocalyptic thriller. Aside from all the comedies he made (which I'm frankly not interested in and have no wish to see), the three recent films he has made have been rather disappointing: TRUE LIES and ERASER had fine action and special effects, but both films were shallow and not serious enough. And the less said about BATMAN AND ROBIN the better. Still, END OF DAYS is a wonderfully fun film in which the horror and action genres are skilfully combined by veteran Peter Hyams (OUTLAND).Sure, the critics might have hated it, but they hate all of Arnie's films anyway and never give him any scope for success. I expected a lot from this film and I got it: fine acting, good special effects, exciting action sequences, and there was even more besides, as the film raises some interesting questions on the likes of God and the Devil. Thankfully these ideas never get in the way of the frenetic action, and the second half of this film becomes a cat and mouse thriller, one of my very favourite types of film.Having been away for over two years due to his heart operation, Arnie is finally back on our screens and shows us once again how he has matured as an actor. From simply being an expressionless muscle-bound hulk in stuff like THE TERMINATOR, he gradually developed a likable persona, who delivered some trademark quips and one-liners, and now finally he accepts his most challenging role to date: a complex, downtrodden character, on the verge of suicide and grieving the death of his wife and child. Yes folks, Arnie cries. Aside from his well-drawn character, Arnie also shows us that he is still more than capable of carrying the action scenes, too old? No way.The actor is well supported by comic sidekick Kevin Pollack, who is not bad in a relief role, and also Gabriel Byrne as Satan himself. Byrne injects just the right amount of charisma, impish charm and evil into his character, so Satan is a memorable guy in this film. Robin Tunney (THE CRAFT) is thankfully given little screen time as the film's heroine, so she comes off well, as a girl who both knows what's going on and yet refuses to accept it. There is a totally gratuitous nude scene of her character though, so be warned. Further down in the cast is exploitation favourite Udo Kier, one again playing a bad guy and meeting a sticky end, Rod Steiger who makes a believable and amusing priest, and Miriam Margoyles, who surprisingly beats up Arnie's character in one scene before being thrown through a coffee table.Aside from the many horror elements (a stigmata victim, a man who is nailed to a ceiling, Latin writings which foretell of death and destruction) there is a plentiful helping of gore, as many Satanist thugs are dispatched by Arnie's character, Satan burns, rips out the heart of, and kills people who stand in his way. The special effects are mainly of the pyrotechnic variety, although we do get a few sequences of Satan regenerating himself after being harmed. Stan Winston's CGI winged demon at the end of the film is impressive too, especially as it is only shown briefly which makes more impact on the viewer.The action sequences are well staged and very exciting, from a huge fight in a house where Tunney is besieged by homicidal Vatican priests, to the climatic fight on a train which culminates in a huge explosion. The best moment comes when Arnie fends off a huge gang of street thugs, breaking and hitting them until he finally succumbs. Yes, Arnie does take a huge beating in this film, he even needs stitches and comes across much more vulnerable than the typical action persona he plays, immune to bullets and other weapons. END OF DAYS is a great (if generic) slice of entertainment, and should be shown to Arnie fans, horror movie buffs and action aficionados alike.",End of Days
1,SnoopyStyle,Dark gritty Arnold but still a minor failure,5,5 March 2014,"The church has searched for Christine York (Robin Tunney) since her birth but the forces of evil have controlled her from the start. It's December 28th, 1999, Satan takes possession of Gabriel Byrne's body in NYC. Jericho Cane (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a tired ex-cop drunk haunted by the deaths of his wife and daughter. He is part of a security team hired to protect a wall street scum that turns out to be Satan. As he and Bobby Chicago (Kevin Pollak) investigate an attempt on Satan by a priest, it's closing in on the new millennium and they follow the leads to Christine.Director Peter Hyams is trying to bring a dark apocalyptic drama with some gritty hard-boiled style. I think he has potential to be something good. There is a definite 'Se7en' vibe to this movie. But then he's also trying for ridiculous over the top action. I wish he forgets about this being a Schwarzeneggar movie, and concentrate on making this dark.I do have a minor problem. I'd probably keep Jericho as a cop. It would be more logical for him and his partner to keep investigating if they are cops. If they are the security, why would Satan be walking around by himself? And it would solve the problem of Jericho having to work for Satan.The bigger problem is Arnold going up against Satan. The idea of the ticking clock is obviously hokey to begin with. Then the question becomes how would Arnold defeat Satan. The mismatch seems overwhelming. And it isn't particularly clever how the movie resolved the problem. The climatic scene on the altar is just awkward.",End of Days
2,classicsoncall,"""I am the answer to your prayers!""",6,1 January 2012,"There's just so much that's laughably bad about this picture that finding a place to start this review is somewhat difficult. Now I could forgive a bad film if the elements used to tell the story had some kind of internal consistency, but this one is just all over the place. Think about it - the forces of evil are unleashed on Earth and Satan himself is scouring the streets of New York looking for the virginal bride that will plunge the entire world into chaos and eternal hell fire. So an alcoholic ex-cop with a nine millimeter Glock handgun is going to stop him? Seriously, how much thought was put into this? Now I never saw this film until today, kind of appropriate I think because it's New Year's Day 2012, and later this year we'll have to get ready for the end of the world again when the Mayan Calendar runs it's course. Thoroughly familiar with the '666' Sign of the Beast concept, I just about doubled over when Rod Steiger came up with that '999' business - how could the film makers have ever foreseen Herman Cain's ill-fated economic plan an entire decade ago? I guess that's just one of the unintended bonuses of waiting until just the right time to watch an action flick in which the devil takes center stage.Now I'll give credit where credit is due. The rattlesnake blood baptism of the newborn Christine was an intriguingly creative element, but if demonic forces were already at work at the tail end of 1979, why let the kid grow up in New York City and allow the Governator to get involved? The ceiling crucifixion of the visionary assassin priest was noteworthy, as well as the creepy subway guy who shattered into pieces - both were cool effects that might have carried more weight in a better story. The same goes for the underground ancient guy with his eyelids sewn shut.But in the final analysis, none of this matters at all. I tried holding it together until the epic final battle between the forces of good and evil, when all of a sudden Arnie broke my concentration by yelling to Christine as they entered St. John's - ""We must lock the doors!"" Seriously, wasn't he paying attention earlier?",End of Days
3,gavin6942,Lame,5,20 February 2014,"At the end of the century, Satan (Gabriel Byrne) visits New York in search of a bride (Robin Tunney). It is up to an ex-cop (Arnold Schwarzenegger) who now runs an elite security outfit to stop him.Sam Raimi and Guillermo del Toro were originally offered to direct ""End of Days"", but both turned it down as they were busy with other projects. Marcus Nispel was set to helm the movie, but he left due to problems with both the budget and the script, and Peter Hyams immediately replaced him. I think this film would have been better in the hands of any of these other three men than with Hyams.The plot and themes are really good and often the imagery is quite striking. But there are enough ""what the heck"" moments to really make the picture fall flat. Naming the characters ""Jericho Cane"" and ""Christine York"" was the first big blunder.Roger Ebert correctly pointed out that ""'End of Days' involves a head-on collision between the ludicrous and the absurd"", with the only really decent thing about it being the involvement of Udo Kier and Stan Winston.",End of Days
4,jboothmillard,End of Days,5,27 June 2008,"From Razzie nominated director Peter Hyams (Timecop, Sudden Death) this is an interesting apocalyptic supernatural action thriller. The film begins with the birth of a baby in 1979, who may have a terrifying future to face, and then it fast forwards 20 years to New York, preparing for the Millennium, 1999. Jericho Cane (Razzie nominated Arnold Schwarzenegger) is the suicidal, drunken and atheist cop in deep depression because of the memory of the murder of his wife and daughter. Everyone doesn't know it, but from the pits of Hell, Satan has come to Earth, taken over a man's body (Razzie nominated Gabriel Byrne, I thought he was good), and he has come to take his bride with him, and then he will be able to spread a deadly plague across the world. Jericho eventually finds the girl victim to this terror, Christine York (Robin Tunney), get it, ""Christ In New York"", and now she and him are on the run from the devil that only they can see intentionally. Also starring Kevin Pollak as Bobby Chicago, Face/Off's C.C.H. Pounder as Detective Margie Francis, Rod Steiger as Father Kovak, Derrick O'Connor as Thomas Aquinas and Miriam Margolyes as Mabel. It is ironic that they got an actor with the name Gabriel (like Archangel Gabriel) to the dark lord, for me he, the ""devilish"" moments and one or two quite good special effects are the only good reasons to see this film, it should have been scarier. Worth watching!",End of Days
5,ccthemovieman-1,One Of Arnold's Most Entertaining Movies,8,2 June 2006,"Despite the hokey theology and overdone action, I still enjoyed this film and found it to be astounding in certain parts, thanks to some incredible special- effects, at least when it came out in 1999. They still look pretty cool. I also enjoyed the nice visuals and excellent sound.You just can't take the story seriously, but how many films can you, especially Arnold's wild movies? They are just there to be enjoyed, to get a couple of hours of escapism entertainment. Among the baloney, however, are a few profound statements of truth. Rod Steiger provides them as a priest in the film. Unfortunately, the devil (Gabriel Byrne) has some, too!Overall, the story is very involving, so much so that it that at 125 minutes it can wear you. About 15 minutes of less action would have been best. One of Arnold's most entertaining movies.",End of Days
6,rmax304823,Metaphysical Mess.,4,19 February 2013,"This flick was supposed to have been written by somebody named Andrew W. Marlowe but I don't believe it. It was written by a Magic 8 Ball and occasionally a heuristic computer was called in for a consult. Don't try to kid the kid.As the new millennium approaches (Kids: That would be the year 2000.) the Devil must appear and impregnate a mother-designate before New Year's Eve so she will give birth to the Devil's spawn, who will then rule the world. The Catholic church apparently has a handle on these plans. In fact, one perverse but well-meaning sect is out to eliminate the young lady (Robin Tunney) and prevent the design from being realized. The Good Priest, a plump and lumbering Rod Steiger, has nothing but good in his heart but is unable to do anything in the material sense. Schwarzenegger, in his last movie before becoming a real power as well as a health food fanatic, is an ex cop who gradually catches on to the sneaky stuff and does battle with both the militant Catholic sect and the more or less immortal Devil (Gabe Byrne) and his myrmidons.It's a kind of pastiche of horror movies. Let's see. The impregnation and the need for its being prevented is from ""Rosemary's Baby"" and ""The Terminator."" The Devil nobody believes in is from ""The Usual Suspects."" Steiger does a reprise of his honest but helpless priest from ""The Amityville Horror."" The final earthly representation of Lucifer looks like the monster in the defensive field in ""Forbidden Planet."" The smashing up of the subway cars is reminiscent of the subway crash in the third installment of the ""Die Hard"" franchise. The prelude to the climactic confrontation -- in which Arnold buckles on all kinds of black leather straps and holsters and arms himself with enough weapons to destroy a city is from every Arnold Schwarzenegger movie you ever saw.Yet, the Magic 8 Ball must have realized that the series of Schwarzenegger action movies was growing a little long in the tooth. It must have advised, ""Try Something New."" In this flick, Schwarzenegger is no longer Superman, like Steven Seagal, who emerges from heroic battles unscathed. Here, he gets thrown around a lot, banged up, beaten with pipes, slammed against walls. He bleeds. He howls with pain.But the over-achieving 8 Ball went a little too far in suggesting that Arnold be given a chance to act. And not only act, but to act out a crisis of faith in the aisle of an elaborate church with stained-glass windows and a thousand candles. Tears run down his face. He has an epiphany, a Road To Damascus experience, before throwing himself on a sword after being possessed (Cf., ""The Exorcist""). He gave a much better performance as governor.The best lines are given to Gabriel Byrne, with an attempt at a New York City accent. He makes some clever, if not especially fresh, observations on the nature of good and evil, and the character of God. The lines aren't really challenging though, not to people who have given any thought to them, or who think at all.I understand Shwarzenegger is now back, in another action movie. Too bad. He can't possibly need the money.",End of Days
7,BA_Harrison,Devilish fun.,7,6 December 2013,"The end of the 90s saw the human race suffering from a collective case of pre-millennium jitters, people convinced that the dawning of the year 2000 would be the beginning of the end. Some thought that technology would fail us, plunging humanity back into the dark-ages; others predicted cataclysmic natural disasters; overzealous religious types either looked forward to The Rapture or feared the oncoming of The Antichrist.Biblical horror/action hybrid End of Days uses this last idea as the basis for its plot: Arnie Schwarzenegger stars as suicidal ex-cop Jericho Cane, who finds a new lease of life when he is pitted against none other than the devil himself (Gabriel Byrne), who is in New York searching for the woman with whom he will spawn a son. Robin Tunney plays the unfortunate young lady destined to bear the devil's offspring unless Jericho can keep her safe till midnight, New Year's Eve.The hackneyed plot for this theological tosh feels almost as old as the 'good book' itself, clichéd and predictable throughout, right down to the trite 'cat scare', the Satanic aides, and the tragic central character having lost his faith due to the tragic murder of his wife and child. Arnie is as wooden as ever (not great when his character demands an emotional tour de force), Gabriel Byrne does a poor impression of Pacino from The Devil's Advocate, and Robin Tunney is forgettable. However, despite the over-familiarity of the material and the shocking acting, End of Days actually proves to be quite a bit of funHyams is an unexceptional but dependable director and he once again delivers a slick Hollywood product, ensuring more than enough overblown action and gratuitous violence to please the average Arnie fan. Memorable moments include Arnie chasing a gunman suspended from a helicopter, the star being beaten up by Margolyes of all people, the Devil punching a man right through the chest, and a spectacular train crash. The film also dares to do the unthinkable by offing Arnie at the very end, but only after he's pumped the devil full of high explosives and sent him back to Hell with his tail between his legs!Such silliness isn't going to win any awards (not even Razzies, although it was nominated for several), but it's an enjoyable enough way to kill some time.",End of Days
8,Quinoa1984,"Arnold, 52, still bad as ever",6,17 May 2000,"Arnold Schwarzenegger brings this film to a nice high pitch action film that hasn't been matched by him in years.  The film is a typical tick-tock till Y2K film, but this time, satan Gabriel Bryne is good as this man) has come up to impregnate the one who's child will become the antichrist.  But one thing he didn't count on is Jericho Cane (Arnold) who is a ex-cop who gets the job done.  Heart pounding action defeats a not quite great plot and succeeds.  What's best of all is Arnold actually acts here, and it's not a stupid comedy.  Great.  A",End of Days
9,michaelRokeefe,Satan puts up one Hell of a fight!,5,4 November 2000,Plenty of action makes up for lack of script. The story line is pretty powerful and intense. Satan takes human shape and comes to New York City to find the young woman with whom he plans to mate and start the 'End of Days'. This mating is to happen during the last hour of 1999 and Satan will have taken possession of the world. Standing in the way is one stubborn ex-cop(Arnold Schwarzenegger). No way to nap long during this one. Loud and full of action. The finale is awesome. And the appearance of the Devil putting up his grand struggle for the girl is worth waiting for.This is the best thing Schwarzenegger has done in a very long time. Robin Tunney plays the marked young woman. Gabriel Byrne is outstanding as the Man from Hell. Also in the cast are Rod Steiger and Kevin Pollak.,End of Days
10,hitchcockthelegend,Faith Or A Glock 9 Millimetre?,7,20 October 2010,"End Of Days is directed by Peter Hyams and written by Andrew W. Marlowe. It stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Gabriel Byrne, Robin Tunney, Kevin Pollak, Rod Steiger, Udo Kier & CCH Pounder.It's the end of the Millennium and as 1999 draws to a close Satan (in human form played by Gabriel Byrne) is in town and looking for his bride. That bride is Christine York (Tunney), who 20 years earlier on her birthday had been chosen by Satanists to be the one for the spawning of the anti-Christ. Enter retired cop Jericho Cane (Schwarzenegger), a suicidal security expert whose family were murdered, and who after being hired to protect an every day business man finds himself in a battle with evil itself. It's not just the fate of poor Christine that's now in his hands, but that of mankind too.Arnold versus The Devil, you couldn't make it up could you? Well actually ""they"" did, but hey, what's wrong with pitting modern cinema's action super star against man's ultimate enemy? The answer is nothing wrong with it at all; as long as the expectation level is set at brain left at the door for some mindless popcorn fun. Which when one sees the premise on offer is all one can surely expect to see. Surely? Budgeted at $100 million by Universal Studios, of which $25 million went on the Austrian Oak's salary, End Of Days, contrary to some beliefs, made over double that when all sales were factored in. However, it was still a poor return for such a big block-buster and Universal were most disappointed in the returns. As was Schwarzenegger himself, who was hoping to launch a big movie come back after a run of sub standard movies had seen his stock fall. Throw in the Razzie nominations for Schwarzenegger, Byrne (who was also up for Stigmata) and Hyams, and it doesn't make particularly inspiring reading.It's all very ridiculous, the film not the statistics, but End Of Days is a whole bunch of explosive, bonkers, action based fun. The flaws are many, not least that the plot is actually an adventurous reworking of T2: Judgement Day (Arnie playing it on safe territory one feels). While giving the big man some character depth was never going to be a good move considering his-ahem-range. Yet the film finds him on particularly good muscular form, machine gunning, shooting rockets and facing off against Byrne's (having a great time and playing it as it should be played) snarly, sarcastic Old Nick adversary. Tunney (wolf whistle that body) bats the eyes and screams as befitting the role, Pollak deserves better but runs with it in his usual dry dulcet way, while the wonderful Miriam Margolyes gets to kick Arnie's butt! Yes it's that kind of movie folks.With dashes of grue and explosions aplenty it was never about trying to win awards. If ever a film does exactly what it says on the tin then this is it. Arnie V Satan, it is what it is, relax and enjoy. 7/10",End of Days
11,Theo Robertson,I Wonder What The Story Behind The Production Is ?,5,8 December 2003,"Watching END OF DAYS I got the distinct impression this movie had problems in the early production stage . The story as revealed at the start of the film involves two sets of the clergy , one of which is trying to protect a young virgin from the clutches of Satan while the other set is trying to murder her so he won`t mate with her . So far so good , so why include the character of Jerico Cane , a burned out suicidal cop ? After all the story could have worked without his inclusion even though it may have been too similar to  THE FINAL CONFLICT in feel and execution , but I still feel Cane didn`t have to be included while the role of the hero could easily have gone to a good guy priest . Worse still Jerico Cane is played by big Arnie which means through box office necessity ( ie box office bucks ) instead of END OF DAYS being a haunting supernatural drama it ends up being a supernatural action/adventure movie that doesn`t work . It should also be pointed out that Arnie doesn`t have the acting range to play a burned out sucidal cop . How about this as a casting premise: Anthony Hopkins plays a disillusioned priest trying to save Christine York from Satan . Doesn`t that sound a whole lot better ? Not to be too negative the story is interesting in places , and I`m sure the first draft of the script was very moody and atmospheric until the screenplay was re-written to death . Gabriel Byrne plays Satan with the exact right mixture of charm and menace which leads me to believe he`d be the perfect choice as The Master if Hollywood ever make a big budget screen version of DOCTOR WHO . Peter Hyams direction while not perfect is far better than much of his work in recent years and does manage to inject a fair amount of mood into his work . But at the end of the day ( Pun intended ) this movie would have worked a lot better if we had an acting star instead of an action star as the hero",End of Days
12,preppy-3,"Very loud, very violent, very stupid, very fun!",7,1 December 1999,"""End of Days"" logically, is a ridiculous movie. Satan comes to Earth, possesses somebody (Gabriel Bryne) and has to have sex with a certain woman at 12:00 Jan 1 2000 and the world will come to an end (or something like that). Enter Arnold to save the day. I'm giving the plot as short a write-up as the actual writers did. The plot is dumb from the word go, there are laughable leaps of logic (see how Arnie and Tunney escape from a subway train hurtling to them--actually had me yelling out ""Oh come on!"" out loud), needlessly LOUD (has to have more explosions than I've ever seen in any motion picture), crappy acting (except for Bryne who's obviously enjoying himself) and needlessly cruel (a main character gets crucified...for no reason) but I had a fun time! If you can turn off your brain you'll have a great time. The movie is never dull (SO much action) and the exposition (what there is of it) is SO lame and badly acted that it becomes fun to listen to! So no great movie at all...just dumb, loud and violent. If you're in the mood, you'll have a great time!When I saw it there were two kids in the audience who couldn't have been more than 13. They howled through the movie and walked out saying, ""Boy was that DUMB!"" That should tell you something.",End of Days
13,LeonLouisRicci,"Guilty Pleasure......""I don't do guilt""...Satan",7,13 November 2012,"Gory, lurid, and ludicrous, this is a dark Action/Horror flick that delivers the goodies with bad taste and that's the way it should be. Were dealing with the Devil here not human scum. This has a very downbeat delivery. Is it possible to have Satan's return and the end of the world as we know it in any other way?Sure it is rough and raunchy. Sure it is dark and dank. But it has a lot of gusto and gives all its got to make it a God-awful combination of Religious rantings and Spiritual significance. There is some dark humor and the cast is holding its own against an onslaught of high-tech special effects and low-brow belief systems.Gabriel Byrne steals the show with the best lines and sinister behavior. The action is non-stop and it takes itself rather seriously, because this isn't Monty Python, it is Arnold action and millennial madness, through Biblical prophecy and for that it is a guilty pleasure of over-the-top revelatory ridiculousness.",End of Days
14,CinemaSerf,Fire is the Devil's only friend...,6,19 November 2021,"Arnie is ex-cop ""Jericho"" who runs an high end private security company. When an attempt is made on the life of one of his clients, he pursues a man throughout the city before being given a portentous warning by the would be assassin that the son of Satan is soon to be born. Now even he isn't going to but that, but as more mysterious happenings occur, he finds himself trying to keep ""Christine"" (Robin Tunney) safe from some henchmen, and from the Church - as she is sought by the big ""D"" himself (Gabriel Byrne). The plot is pretty flawed from start to finish. One would assume that however strong and resilient ""Jericho might be, the fact that his foe could cause people to spontaneously combust at will would have but paid to any resistance fairly early on. Nope - he keeps coming back to fight another day - and after a while, that just becomes a little bit dull and leads to an ending that is as flat as it is predictable. I suppose I ought never to have expected much jeopardy, and neither the acting nor the dialogue really do much to elevate this from a very average outing for Schwarzenegger that offers us plenty of action but totally underplays the more demonic aspects of the plot that ought to have made this just a bit darker and more interesting. It is also way too long, and though well enough made, just left me feeling that I'd seen this all before, just in a different guise.",End of Days
15,poolandrews,I really rather liked this one...,7,5 September 2006,"End of Days starts at 'Vatican City, Rome 1979' where a Priest realises that an ancient prophecy on a scroll is about to happen... Cut to 'New York City 6 Hours Later' where a woman (Rainer Judd) gives birth to a healthy young baby girl, the baby is whisked away & a strange religious rite is performed on her by some dodgy Priest (Udo Kier) before being returned to her Mother... Jump forward '20 years Later' to the '28th December 1999' where alcoholic ex-cop Jericho Cane (Arnold Schwarzenegger) lives out his life playing bodyguard for the rich along with his partner Bobby Chicago (Kevin Pollak), on this particular day they have to protect a stockbroker (Gabriel Byrne). An attempt is made on his life, Jericho manages to catch the would-be assassin who turns out to be a Priest named Thomas Aquinas (Derrick O'Connor). As Jericho investigates things further he discovers that his client is in fact Satan himself who intends to mate with Christine York (Robin Tunney) at the turn of the millennium & bring down civilisation as we know it as she has been destined to since birth 20 years ago... It's up to Jericho & his Glock 9mm to save the Earth from Satan & protect Christine!Photographed & directed by Peter Hyams I really rather liked End of Days, sure it ain't no masterpiece but as good, solid entertainment what's not to like? The script by co-producer Andrew W. Marlowe moves along like a rocket, there's plenty of explosions, CGI computer effects, demons, sex, nudity, gratuitous violence, chases, helicopter, car & train mayhem, an albino guy with a really bad hair style & of course there is the one & only Arnold Schwarzenegger running around blowing the crap out of things with big guns. What, may I ask, more do you want? While all the necessary, well as far as I'm concerned they're necessary, ingredients are present & correct there's slightly more substance in the story & character's than one might expect from a big budget Hollywood shoot-'em-up. Again I should stress it's not going to change the way you look at life but I thought the character's were well fleshed out & fairly believable (in context obviously!) while the story itself had a bit more to than I expected with a decent amount going on throughout the film. I also thought the ending was brave, I believe this is the only film in which a character played by Schwarzenegger dies so don't expect the usual sugar coated happy Hollywood ending.Director Hyams does a good job, a lot of the film is pretty dark. The action scenes aren't outstanding or particularly original but their well done & are suitably over-the-top & extravagant. The film seems to have a hard time deciding whether it wants to be a horror or action & as a result it sort of alternates between the two in a seemingly random & uneven way. There is one funny bit though where the old grey-haired & somewhat fat Miriam Margoyles has a fight with Schwarzenegger & beats him up! There's some decent gore here, a cut open snake, an exploded head, plenty of gunshot wounds, someone is crucified using medical equipment, a shard of glass is pushed into someone neck, cut out tongues & someone has their heart ripped out.With a supposed budget of about $83,000,000 End of Days has that Hollywood polish about it & it is very well made with great production design, special effects & cinematography. The acting was OK, Schwarzenegger has never been the best actor in the world but he's OK here, Byrne is class as Satan while Rod Steiger plays a Priest & the infinitely watchable Udo Kier has a small role.End of Days is one of those big budget Hollywood flicks that is loud, noisy & delivers plenty of bang for your money. I have to admit I rather liked it, one of Schwarzenegger's best films during the later stage's of his acting career, if not the best. Well worth a watch.",End of Days
16,lastliberal,We can't prevent evil by doing evil!,6,3 July 2008,"After a Van Damme double feature, one wants a little dessert. What better than a dose of AHNULD Vs. Satan.One cannot help but inject a dose of politics into this film, as the Catholic Church has a right-wing hit squad trying to kill Satan's target before he gets her. The good priest (presumably one that doesn't do little boys) cautions that ""We can't prevent evil by doing evil!"" Like the Bush administration, he is ignored. But our hero the Terminator, ends their schemes. Too bad, we can't have the Terminator help us, but we do have the Barackinator that will hopefully save us from the forces of evil and send Stan to hell for another 1000 years.Whew! This is supposed to be an action film, but it is so full of parallels that they cannot be ignored. There is great sound and lots of super fireworks to this silly story of a man who lost his faith and regains it at the crucial moment.Gabriel Byrne (Jindabyne, Stigmata, Enemy of the State) give a good performance as Satan, but one wonders how you can be a priest and the devil in two movies the same years.Robin Tunney (Paparazzi, Hollywoodland) is very good as the object of Satan's affections.Great support from Kevin Pollak, CCH Pounder, and Rod Steiger.Schwarzenegger is the man!",End of Days
17,zardoz-13,Arnold Versus Satan Is Largely Second-Rate Stuff,6,18 March 2008,"The Devil tries to make Arnold Schwarzenegger do it in director Peter Hyams' exciting but unsavory apocalyptic chiller ""End of Days,"" where our rock-jawed hero must stop Satan from siring the Anti-Christ on New Year's Eve and destroying the world. Die-hard Arnie fans will defend ""End of Days"" as 'a different kind of Arnold,' but even they will exit the theatre feeling disillusioned by this uneven synthesis of a Schwarzenegger epic and a supernatural nail-biter. The humor that punctuates the usual Schwarzenegger shenanigans lacks the wit and sparkle of ""True Lies,"" ""Total Recall,"" and the ""Terminator"" movies, not even wise-acre Kevin Pollack can salvage a decent line as Arnie's partner.""End of Days"" gets off to spooky enough start. At Vatican City in Rome, a priest witnesses a celestial spectacle called the 'eye of God.' This dreaded sighting foretells the birth of a baby marked to be the bride of Beelzebub. Instead of aborting the infant, the Pope decides to protect her. Meantime, in a New York hospital, a mother struggles to give birth. Moments after her delivery, an evil nurse carts the kid off to the morgue where a group of satanic worshippers await her. They butcher a live rattlesnake, baptize the baby with its blood, and pray over her in Latin.Twenty years zips past, and the year is now 1999. The baby girl, Christine (Robin Tunney of ""Vertical Limit""), has become an orphan and grown up. Terrible nightmares about Old Nick haunt Christine. Satan himself sneaks into the Big Apple looking like Arnie's old nemesis from ""Predator."" Old Nick takes over the body of an innocent man (Gabriel Byrne of ""The Usual Suspects""), in a classy Manhattan restaurant, and then fireballs the diner to cover his trial.Enter Jericho Cane (Arnold Schwarzenegger of ""Conan the Barbarian""), a suicidal, guilt-ridden, alcoholic ex-cop who works for a corporate security firm as a hired bodyguard for its elite clientele. Is Arnold trying to change his image? His Jericho Cane borrows heavily from Mel Gibson's Martin Riggs in ""Lethal Weapon."" Cane is guarding the Man (Byrne), Satan posing as a Wall Street wizard, when an insane old priest tries to ice him. Jericho pursues the elusive assassin across the rooftops of Manhattan in a lively chase while suspended from a helicopter. Finally, he corners his quarry in the subway. Before they blast it out, the priest warns Jericho that the Devil is in town to find a woman to spawn his child.Jericho locates the priest's hideout and finds some mysterious ""Omen"" style 666 Biblical scripture scrawled in blood on the wall. Andrew J. Marlowe's script really embarrasses itself when we learn that 666 should be read not only backwards but also upside down. Add a thousand to it, and the story stipulates that Satan must walk the Earth in a human body and impregnate a virgin. Obviously, Lucifer overlooked the test tube pregnancy route. Later, he learns that Lucifer wants to mate with a virgin to have his child. Cane and Satan aren't the only ones on Christine's trail. A radical sect of priests vows to slay her before Lucifer can procreate with her. Predictably, Jericho arrives in time to rescue Christine.Director Peter Hyams lenses most of his own movies, and he photographs ""End of Days"" as if he were imitating David Fincher's""Seven."" New York City emerges as dark, medieval, and ominous, and pessimism haunts the world of ""End of Days."" Hyams is a veteran Hollywood helmer whose credits include ""Time Cop,"" ""Sudden Death,"" ""Busting,"" and ""The Relic."" Consistently, he cranks out entertaining, above-average movies, but his films usually fall short in some respect. So far his classics have been the Billy Crystal & Gregory Hines police buddy picture ""Running Scared,"" the respectable ""2010,"" and the grungy Sean Connery sci-fi adventure ""Outland."" Indeed, ""Days"" has some memorable moments, but not nearly enough to redeem this 158 minute action fable.The subway scenes between Jericho, Christine, and Old Nick crackle with electricity. Occasionally, ""End of Days"" wallows in exposition that retards the plot. Hyams struggles to offset this flaw with some dazzling shoot-outs and breathless chases. The film is a dark, fiendish thriller with buckets of blood and gore. Hyams wastes little time on the film's silly theology and pours on the testosterone. The result is a muddled millennial melodrama that resembles ""Terminator 2"" cross-bred with ""The Exorcist."" Scenarist Andrew J. Marlowe's tedious script duplicates few of the thrills and chills that distinguished his first script, the Harrison Ford thriller ""Air Force One."" The plot amounts to a predictable as well as obtuse puzzle that Arnie must unravel by resorting to the King James scripture. ""End of Days"" mimics ""The Omen"" and ""The Devil's Advocate,"" but it cannot overcome its formulaic origins. Action heroes that attract bullets like flies but survive the shelling because they've got on their bulletproof vest has been done to death; it no longer has shock value! ""End of Days"" qualifies at best as 'fair' were it not for several spectacular high octane action scenes and some genuinely scary moments. The cat flying out of the fridge is the best of the cheap shocks in this moody religious thriller. The offbeat casting of Arnie as a troubled bodyguard wrestling with his own demons; atmospheric cinematography and settings, and director Peter Hyams' visceral staging of the action cannot overcome the second-rate script with its pretentious religious mumbo-jumbo. Stan Winston's special effects demons would have been more at home in a ""Ghostbusters"" sequel. In ""End of Days,"" they appear not only ridiculous but obligatory. Ultimately, Schwarzenegger gets to stretch himself as an actor, but only Arnie's die-hard army of fans may feel like they haven't done a stretch.",End of Days
18,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"A good attempt, but too many special effects and action scenes",6,30 April 2004,"I don't know if this was meant as a horror movie, an action movie, or a mix of both, but I think it just drowns in way too many explosions and special effects. I hadn't expected a masterpiece when I found out that Arnold Schwarzenegger was playing the lead, but considering the material, it should have been at least a little better. I've never been that much into Christianity, or religiousness, but the story did interest me a fair bit, and I think it's unfortunate that they had to put in so many unneeded action scenes and showy special effects to impress the mainstream audience. It could have been a very intelligent movie, had it not been for that. Oh well. I guess it's fine as it is. The plot is pretty good, but moves slowly at too many points in the movie. The acting is a notch better than average, so don't expect Oscar material. The characters seemed reasonably well-written and credible. The special effects are pretty impressive, it's just that there are far too many of them, and it distracts the viewer from the plot. All in all, a fairly good action horror mystery thriller. I just wish they'd have eliminated a few of the pointless scenes, in order to also give the film a more suitable length, as near the end, it just seems like it's been going on for far too long, and you just want it to end quickly. I recommend this to people who are interested in the topic and basic idea of the movie, and people who enjoy a fairly good action/horror piece with good special effects. 6/10",End of Days

This bride business apparently requires to be consummated before 1999 becomes 2000, so there is a bit of suspense going on, too.This sheer hokum is quite good fun. Schwarzenegger acquits himself well in a role which stretches him a bit, Robin Tunney screams nicely. and Gabriel Byrne thoroughly enjoys himself as a smooth but undeniably nasty Devil.There are some decent action sequences, especially the final sequence (which is typical Schwarzeneggerian spectacle) and, notwithstanding its rather oppressive tone, there is much to be enjoyed.

Christine, on the other hand, has no idea how her life has been carefully orchestrated by Satan's followers in preparation for this event. Meanwhile, the Catholic Church has been split into two factions with one side wanting to kill Christine to prevent the apocalypse and the other with the more high-minded goal of relying upon their faith to do what is morally right. Caught in between these groups is a security guard by the name of ""Jericho"" (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and his partner ""Bobby Chicago"" (Kevin Pollack) who were initially responsible for guarding the man that Satan then possessed in order to carry out his carnal ambitions. And in no time he quickly discovers that there are things happening in the world that defy human understanding. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film had an interesting plot and-coupled with a solid cast-should have been an incredible success. Unfortunately, the director (Peter Hyams) chose to focus too heavily upon action and special effects rather than horror or mystery and produced a much more mediocre product than it should have been. But sadly, that's Hollywood in this current day and age. Be that as it may, although this film wasn't nearly as good as it should have been, it wasn't terribly bad and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. Average.",End of Days
21,anaconda-40658,End This Film.,1,26 January 2016,"End of Days (1999): Dir: Peter Hyams / Cast: Arnold Schwarzenegger, Gabriel Byrne, Robin Tunney, Kevin Pollack, Udo Kier: Title bears no spiritual truth and the story lacks total understanding of the Biblical account in Revelations. Lame plot has the devil coming to earth possessing a human body and searching for a twenty year old woman who is suppose to be his bride. One could say that a mail order bride is out of the question. Arnold Schwarzenegger plays a cop who stumbles across the case and attempts to protect her. He questions his own faith after his wife and son were murdered. Several religious groups try to kill the woman before it gets sidetracked into silliness. It uses action and special effects in an attempt to cover up its pathetic excuse for a plot. Directed by Peter Hyams previously made two laughable Jean-Claude Van Damme action flicks in Sudden Death and Time Cop. With Schwarzenegger grunting and groaning as if constipated, it would appear that a higher profile action star isn't working out for Hyams either. This easily ranks as one of the all-time worst films for either star or director. Gabriel Byrne is laughable as Satan. Robin Tunney plays the dense bride. Kevin Pollack plays Schwarzenegger's partner so that the star's name isn't the only one scarred by this nonsense. With absolutely no clue to its religious rants, this film becomes pointless junk at its overproduced worst. Score: 1 / 10",End of Days

One of the main interests in this one is the fact that it comes off so much like a normal Action movie rather than a straight-up Horror film. From the assassination attempt and the chasing of the shooter over rooftops and into the sewers to a fantastic fireball-filled assault on his friends in a parked van, to other big action scenes with the mind-controlled minions with shoot-outs, brawls and racing to escape big explosions and things blowing up that make for a lot of fun overall. This is helped along by a fairly interesting plot line that allows for such high-energy action scenes to come forth, not that it's original or anything but it has more than enough applications to allow for quality moments to barrel forth, never once dragging despite it's rather long running time or allow for repeats of scenes, with the first half employed as a chase to get to her first while the second half is all about the protection she needs, with both him and the priests getting involved and generating some really good times. The extreme religious nature of such a story might turn some off, as the endless parade of Bible quotes in the middle and reapplications of faith do grow tiresome due to the quantity of such scenes, and the finale with a hokily-conceived CGI Devil isn't anywhere near convincing. Overall, this one comes across better-than-expected, though it's more for Action fans than Horror fanatics.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, intense religious themes, Brief Nudity and a Mild Sex Scene",End of Days

But Jericho does not have a clue who he's up against...Now for a comeback movie, Arnold versus Satan is a very interesting proposition, but unlike his other movies, this is a very dark movie, and his Jericho is a haunted character from the word go.So if you are looking for the one liner spouting Arnold from True Lies and T2, you maybe a little disappointed.The stands on his own merits, despite the fact that it's 'an Arnie movie'. The story is good and carries the narrative well, and Byrne is fantastically straight as the man himself. He could have gone all out over the top, but keeps it thankfully straight.Arnold is Arnold, just a little more depressed, and the film has a very glum feel to it, despite it being set in NY in probably the most important date event in our lifetime.And this is the films problem, the film was outdated more or less as soon as it was released, but it does a great job of playing on our 'pre millennial tensions' throughout.A good movie, one of those films that is fun to watch every now and again.",End of Days

It needs more horror and who knows it may have made for a really good movie, instead of being just another Schwarzenegger action flick...a movie in a line of three of his movies that really did not register on the radar (Collateral Damage and The Sixth Day being the other two). Overall I enjoyed it, but as with those two movies this is not anything all that grand or cool. Just Arnold fighting the devil with a machine gun with a few twists and turns here and there and to top it all off a very predictable ending. Still, it had good action, wasn't boring, and Arnold was his usual self, not bad, but not as good as he can get with a more top notch director. This movie has him as an ex-cop haunted by painful memories (aren't all ex-cops in these movies). Meanwhile Satan has taken over a man on this realm using him to find a bride so that he may have a son.

The hope of humanity falls on an atheist ex-cop, Jericho Cane (Arnold Schwarzeneggar), and his partner (Kevin Pollak). Rod Steiger is also on hand as a no-nonsense Catholic priest.""End of Days"" is a comic book action flick with horror/fantasy elements. It's not meant to be an accurate depiction of biblical eschatology. As such, it's useless to pick it apart on these grounds; just go with it and enjoy the ride. That said, there are some real-life subtexts and accurate biblical aspects. For instance, disillusionment due to the unjust death of a loved one (or any number of other tragedies) happens all the time.The movie is R-rated not just for the violence and cussing, but because the filmmakers try to convey the devil's filthy lawlessness, like a threesome with a mother & daughter in a brief dream sequence (which may be ""reality,"" but it's hard to tell). Byrne has fun with the role of Satan.As a holiday action blockbuster with Schwarzenegger ""End of Days"" delivers the requisite thrills where there's a massive explosion about every 12 minutes. These types of movies only work if the story and the characters pull you into their world and the film accomplishes this just enough. It's no where near as good as the first two Terminator flicks, but it's close to being on par with the third one. Of course, ""End of Days"" is its own animal due to the dark, religious subject matter. On that note, the palette the filmmakers use is fittingly dark. The entire film takes place at night, mostly in the urban labyrinths of New York City with additional sequences in Gothic churches, shadowy subterranean rooms and eerie woods.The film runs 121 minutes and was shot in New York City and the Los Angeles area.GRADE: B",End of Days

It begins to lack the bite, and the culmination, though well-shot, doesn't meet the expectations. Peter Hyams directs this tale nicely. Cinematography & Editing deserve a mention.Performance-Wise: Schwarzenegger gives his best shot, and tries his best to hold your attention, even when the writing gets weak.

31,MovieAddict2016,Arnie vs. Satan,5,18 December 2005,"Arnold peaked at the end of the '90s, I guess. He's battled Terminators, Greek gods, bears, alligators, planes, and macho men in fish net clothing. The only choice left is, of course, Satan. So they put together a movie about Satan and gave Arnie the lead.I think everyone working on this thought it would be much better than it actually is. The script was in development for years and Arnie fought to get it made. It's kind of unfortunate because Arnold gives a fairly decent performance in a film muddled with clichés. Of course, it's hard enough to buy a guy with a body like Arnold being a slob who drinks beer and pizza smoothees for breakfast. Getting someone like Jim Belushi might have seemed more realistic.Apart from the physicality, Arnold's performance is fine. He cries. He does the emotion scenes well enough - at least well enough to find bearable.It's the direction that ruins this movie. Peter Hyams is a terrible director and has ruined some very unique films in the past (his most notorious butchering in my opinion was of a 1983 Michael Douglas film called ""The Star Chamber"" - great premise, awful directing).""End of Days"" is like ""Exorcist"" meets every supernatural thriller ever made. On top of that, Gabriel Byrne should be more menacing. Robin Tunney should be less butch-looking. The direction shouldn't feel like some low-grade TV commercial - all style, no substance.Is the movie terrible? No. It's not as bad as everyone made it out to be. But it's pretty much the definition of ""mediocre."" Do I own it on DVD? Hell yeah. It's an Arnold movie - it's an automatic must-buy. But if you're not a fan of Arnie, I wouldn't recommend it - at all. It pretty much feels like any average made-for-TV scary-flick - with even worse direction.The only other good aspect of this film was that it brought Axl Rose out of seclusion to record his first original song in seven years with a new incarnation of Guns N' Roses. The song, ""Oh My God,"" didn't do too well with the critics. A bit of a shame, really. I dug it. It also fits the industrial, edgy tone of the film.",End of Days

Let's face it, deep down, we all know who's going to come out on top in that one, but, hey, let's go along for the ride anyway.Arnie plays an alcoholic cop who... oh, forget it. Arnie plays Arnie. He beats up bad guys and he's damn good at it. You must know what to expect from him by now? As I've said, in this case he's got his sights set on the high prince of darkness.

36,The-Sarkologist,Arnie goes manno a manno with Satan,3,20 January 2012,"This movie in itself looks very good. The posters and the advertising impressed me, and it promised to be a rather thrilling movie. Unfortunately it turns out to be much less so. The effects and the action sequences are literally what one would expect in an Arnie movie. Like Terminator II he is going up against something which simply cannot die, so in the end of the movie the heavy weaponry comes out. Unlike Terminator II, the movie is not constantly on the go and you become somewhat agitated as you have to put up with a rather contrived plot in between the action sequences.The movie is about the end of the world and how Swartzenegger stops it. The precept is that a girl is born who will give birth to the child that will destroy the world. Every thousand years, Satan is released to mate with the girl, and if he succeeds then the world will end. So humanity is responsible for stopping him and giving them another 1000 years to develop until he comes again. Of course this is all stupid, and the way they explain it, such as 666 being upside-down (especially since the Greeks did not use Arabic numbers like we did, and that is what John, the author of revelation, wrote in), was just plain stupid. It would have been just as good if they had left that out.The plot is the typical good verses bad idea. The good guys are the church while the bad guys are the satanists. I liked the whole secret society aspect to the film where there are disparate factions in the church with all of their own goals while the satanists are one huge underground faction bent on following their master's will. Satan is the big bad guy, and I feel that Gabrial Byrne plays him exceptionally well. What is impressive is that Satan is played as his manipulative, deceitful and betraying self. He is actually shown as not the cool person to follow, and that the promises that he makes are inevitably destructive.God, on the otherhand, is misportrayed. He is described as a distant figure who lets humanity fight its own battles. It is the Catholic Church (rife with its traditions and such) that is portrayed as the proper church, not the evangelical, bible believing church. In fact the claim that the end of the world can be predicted is unbiblical as we are told that we will not know the hour or the day. Still, the movie redeems itself slightly at the end when Arnie puts his trust in God by asking him to give him strength, and then goes on to defeat Satan. I guess in the end, Satan is a powerful being not to be trifled with, but God is supremely more powerful.",End of Days

It's up to an ex-cop (Arnie) to stop him.It's well known in Hollywood, You are only as good as your last movie. Arnie's last movie killed a lucrative franchise and sent several careers into decline. It had been over two years since Batman & Robin hit theatres, that is a long time for a workaholic like Arnie. Considerably darker than your average Arnie action flick, but it's also more absurd at times. Kevin Pollack offers solid support, but Gabriel Byrne gives a slightly subdued performance. I remember a few things about the production of the movie, the original director quit, after his ridiculous on set demands were released, an alternate 'resurrection' ending failing with text audiences, and reading a review at the time of its release saying ""Why Schwarzenegger would want to get himself involved in something as insane and nasty as this, in his comeback movie is beyond me"" In his autobiography Total Recall, Arnie talks about how after his heart surgery, studio's were not returning his calls, and movies he had lined up, suddenly got put on hold (With Wings As Angels, Minority Report, Noble Father, SWAT, Crossbow and Pathfinder) or worse, cancelled (Fox backed away from T3 and Warner put the brakes on I Am Legend by slashing Ridley Scott's budget from $100 million to $80 million) and when he finally got cast in this movie, he turned up for his first day of shooting, to find studio executives and insurance people there watching his every move. The 90's ended with a whimper, rather than a bang for The Oak, as End Of Days wasn't the hit Arnie was hoping for, ending the year the 33rd highest grossing movie, with a domestic gross of $66 million.",End of Days

40,filipemanuelneto,"Action, suspense and light horror in one movie.",7,11 July 2016,"As we approach the turn of the millennium, the Devil seeks to fulfill the prophecies about the birth of the Antichrist, looking for a bride in New York. Directed by Peter Hyams, with a script by Andrew W. Marlowe, this film has Arnold Schwarzenegger, Gabriel Byrne and Robin Tunney in the main roles.One of the last films of the past millennium, it precisely addresses the end of it and the apocalyptic prophecies about that. It's a quite grim film, which puts the audience in suspense from the very beginning. The dark picture helps to amplify these feeling, with the most scenes taking place at night or on foggy or rainy days in New York, depicted like a real and decadent ""sin city"". The darkest character is undoubtedly the Devil, but the police fighting against him (played by Schwarzenegger) also has to face his own demons: alcohol, deep depression, lack of faith and lack of self-confidence, in a double combat, physical and psychological.The film has great action scenes which strangely cohabit with several heavier scenes, almost terror. In fact, this is the major flaw of the film: it lives in a permanent dilemma between terror and action, thriller and suspense. We cannot say it's a horror movie or a thriller, or action. It's a mixture of all, which ends up easily displeasing the public looking for just one (particularly the terror lovers, as the film never gets to scare us truly). The climax is very interesting, makes good use of special visual and sound effects, manages to surprise and not be predictable, but some of the effects (the monster) are so ""cliché"" and far-fetched that destroy what was good.The work of the actors is fairly good. This film marks the end of a comedy decade in Schwarzenegger's career, and he seems convincing in his role and doesn't make mistakes, giving another proof of versatility. He wanted, truly, show that it's not only a lot of muscles, and he succeeded. Robin Tunney looks a bit bland and hysterical in the role of Christine. Byrne made an interesting devil, very calm and cold, able to boot chills through the simple look. The soundtrack doesn't stand out particularly, with the exception of ""Agnus Dei"", it's main music, combining incidental chords with small arrangements of Gregorian chant.",End of Days

For years after this movie came out we would randomly pump out the line around the house using our best Arnie accent 'Put the cookie down or it will be your End of Daaayz'.The Schwarz does his part by injecting good doses of chaotic urgency to the movie with Byrne adding a nice oozing element.More plot holes than a fishing net but its still a good fun watch.So you should see it, 'c'mon do it, nooooow' bawahaha :)",End of Days

He gets an assignment with his partner, Bobby Chicago (Pollack) to protect a Wall Street businessman (Byrne) who gets possessed by Satan and intends on finding young woman, Christine York (Tunney) to bear his evil child bringing the end of the world.

44,elshikh4,"Terminator Part 2,5 !",6,9 March 2009,"At a phase where I was young and supposed to be dazzled by action heroes, I've never been impressed by stars, only movies. So back then, I didn't concern about Arnie's career as one of the era's big names, but I lived it anyway with movie after another.So, after the massive success of Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991), which I don't like personally, I saw how Schwarzenegger lived hell literally. His career was nothing but cruel chain of flops: Last Action Hero (1993), Junior (1994), Eraser (1996), Jingle All the Way (1996), Batman & Robin (1997). Then this last one was too hard even for him I suppose, but he continued the tragedy with: End of Days (1999), The 6th Day (2000), and Collateral Damage (2002). Loved some of the above or not, the box office surely hated all of them with passion. But there was a chance for one last, nearly decent, swan song and I mean: Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003). After that, it's Governor Arnold for you!Despite anything, I went to watch End of Days having some high hopes. At least director (Peter Hyams) is one who I feel optimistic with. But I didn't buy it. And it didn't amuse me either.Look at it, it's the Terminator 2 formula again: super chaser (The devil this time) chasing a young innocent victim (who's so worthy to him only), and there is kind of super opposite that helps out the victim along the way (Arnold Schwarzenegger in both cases!). I only loved the businessman image for today's devil. But there wasn't more to love.Unfortunately, (Hyams)'s work wasn't impressive. The action wasn't ambitious. The music wasn't catchy. And it was too gloomy to be fun. Generally, it wasn't clever as a horror, great as an action, different as a fantasy, or even good as unintentional comedy. This way it earned the attribute ""tasteless"" respectfully!(Gabriel Byrne) didn't persuade me that he was the prince of darkness even if he urinated all over the American streets! (Rod Steiger) well, let's not bring up the matter that he was here in the first place, he was so serious being the real frightening factor of it! (Schwarzenegger) looks out of glamour, dusty and run-down; the word is non-distinct with anything this time. And although (Robin Tunney) seemed sweet and gentle, but not to an extent that could make me love the movie or, god forbid, re-watch it!And despite being there for swift moments, I hated the sex and the nudity. Just try to think a little how these 2 factors are used in movies. It's awful to degrade your actors, cheapen yourself, and sell bodies along with art (or for the sake of making that art sellable!). Along the years, I became so fed up with these factors in movies, and - since the last decades - in TV too!, seeing it as something not ethical, artistic or aesthetic, and with the mega abundance of it; it became inhuman and scary. Ok, the moviemakers are entitled to their opinion, the fans are entitled to their opinion, and me - as not a fan - is entitled to my opinion, though I believe I'm so alone, since I didn't run into one review that hated that, in any movie, during all my life, as if making that, along with loving it, and not thinking about it--is compulsory!So, between Terminator 2 and 3, this is the 2 and a half forgotten sequel. Being a lousy one too. And with choices like that from Arnold, it was definitely the End of Days for him!P.S: On its cover, as a video tape, it was written: ""More chilling than The Exorcist. More hunting than The Sixth Sense."", then in very tiny letters there was the name of the one critic who wrote this. True I couldn't read it, but I bet.. He was Satan himself!",End of Days
45,dee.reid,Arnold Battles Satan,8,7 November 2001,"Throughout Arnold Schwarzenegger's career, we have seen him battle all kinds of deadly villains.  These include South American terrorists(Commando), gangsters(Raw Deal), alien hunters(Predator), psycho game players(The Running Man), Russian drug dealers(Red Heat), more aliens(Total Recall), shape-shifting cyborgs(Terminator 2: Judgment Day); more gangsters, an axe murderer and his real self and what I mean by that is the real Arnold(Last Action Hero), Saudi Arabian terrorists(True Lies), corrupt government officials with high-tech weaponry(Eraser), Batman(Batman & Robin), himself or a clone actually(The 6th Day), and finally the darkest force of them all: Satan.The plot to End Of Days is simple: Satan(Gabriel Byrne in his human form) has come to Earth in search of a bride.  If he is successful in impregnating her before midnight on New Year's Eve, he will cause Armageddon.  Satan however, did not count on good old Arnold to come and foil his plans. There, simple enough for you?Yeah, you could tell that from the previews on T.V. that this was meant to be Arnold's come back movie.  Unfortunately it isn't.  The main problem that I have with End Of Days is that it's simply not thrilling enough, even for a Schwarzenegger film.  This doesn't stop it from being a good movie though. It does have it's share of action and explosions.  Arnold is good in this movie.  His grief over his family's death does pay off here.  Near the middle of the movie, Satan offers Jericho a chance to be reunited with his dead family if he tells him where the girl is.  Pretty cool, although that is all that's really new for a Schwarzenegger film.  Other than that, it's just the usual explosions and all that good stuff.8/10",End of Days

With an awesome pic of Arnold on the front cover looking mean with the cover saying ""Arnold is Back"" i read every bit about his new movie End of days over & over & studied the film images.
I was obsessed with End of days before even seeing it.At that time in '99 i was a huge Schwarzenegger fan & had been since i knew what movies were,& i was a huge Horror film buff so when i heard Schwarzenegger was doing a supernatural Horror movie with action i was too excited!!!Anyway i loved the movie & have watched it so many times I've lost count.
This probably the darkest Schwarzenegger movie he ever did, it's a nice different role & tone.
Arnie's troubled Ex-Cop ""Jericho"" is actually my favourite character that Schwarzenegger has ever played, it's such a solid dramatic role for Schwarzenegger to show he can do ""Serious"" & he does it very well!!!End of days is a very dark,moody & creepy supernatural Horror Thriller, there's plenty of dark,satanic imagery & very dark moody cinematography that looks very gothic.
The music is very creepy & gives it an old school devil horror vibe.Schwarzenegger is excellent in his role as damaged & emotional ex-cop, turned security specialist ""Jericho Cain"" (what a cool name),he's a tough guy who has seen too nuch real life horror that has left him suicidal & emotionally scarred. Jericho has lost his family to criminals so he's a hardened don't mess with me kind of guy & Schwarzenegger gives a great emotional performance.The some amazing action scenes & some very creepy scenes that drip with a dark,sinister atmosphere.
Gabriel Byrne is excellent as satan,the big evil,mr.devil in disguise, he's very charming in his sinister sly way.There's alot of depth in this film & lots of religious themes but it's all done in a Horror genre way found & not pushing things on you as i don't believe in any of that cult ""God"" stuff.End of days is a big budget Horror Thriller starring the legendary King of Action in probably his best role or atleast in my opinion anyway, this movie & Arnie's Character mean alot to me for the specific time ""1999"" & my love for my Hero to return to the big screen!!! Big Nostalgia love",End of Days
48,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Wicked supernatural outing for Arnie,8,8 August 2015,"Peter Hyams​ 's End Of Days is one of those loud, bombastic, stylized Schwarzenegger flicks that's meant to be pure unbridled entertainment. On that level it works amazingly, and nostalgically for me, it's one of my favourite Arnie films. It just has such a palpably evil atmosphere, and good old fashioned supernatural adventure to it that's awesome. Arnie plays Jericho Cane, an alcoholic, tormented private security expert with a sketchy past. When he and his partner (Kevin Pollak) are tasked with protecting a high profile VIP, an assassination attempt is made, and they start to unravel a dark,possible doomsday plot in the making. The man they are protecting (Gabriel Byrne) happens to be none other than Satan himself, hiding in human form, and trying to track down the one girl (Robin Tunny) that he must copulate with before midnight in order to bring about the end of days upon our world. Oh yeah. Byrne brings a gleeful, carefree, alpha male malice to the role, and is one of my favourite cinematic incarnations of the devil ever. Although it's a pretty implausible, fantasy action headbanger, it has a sense of purpose and duty to its own mythology, and takes it seriously, which helps a lot. Hyams also steps in for DP, and there's some truly awesome shots of New York, from dingy back alley chases to helicopter propelled vistas. Schwarzenegger is surprisingly poignant in the role, only allowing his trademark camp to surface once in a while (""you ah ah choiahhboyy compared to me, ah choiahhboyy!!"" Is my favourite). Tunny diligently plays the female lead with understandable confusion, but also noble grace when the heat gets hot. Miriam Margoyles is a terrifying little goblin as her evil Aunt with ties to the cult who raised her to be Lucifer's bride. Udo Kier, in his few scenes, is chilling as the head of the cult. The film has a chilling vibe that raises it above the level of other smash and grab Arnie action opuses, a vibe that's almost reminiscent of classic John Carpenter. The eerie soundtrack adds to the haunted house fun,me specially when old Satan first appears in NY as a giant invisible beast and meanders around looking for a human host. If you're looking for slimy supernatural fun anchored by a midnite movie style concept and some awesome at atmospheric chills, look no further.",End of Days
49,kairingler,i'll be back,6,5 July 2013,"I think this was the last movie Arnold made before becoming governor of California, someone please correct me if i'm wrong, at first yea this movie takes a little patience with,, first you have to understand the basics,, the millennium is coming to an end, and Satan wants to mate, Arnold's character has to find a way to stop the all knowing and powerful,, Gabrille Bryn.. aka Satan.. All poor Arnold wants to do is stop Satan and go home, that's it, but of course Satan has other plans.. and he comes at it with a vengeance only seen from down below. he stalks his prey, coming and going as he pleases. this movie was released right at the millennium so It did kinda make the whole picture more viable and believable to me, because there were a lot of crazy things going on at the end of the 20th century,, this wasn't Arnold's greatest picture,, and not his worth,, it was worth my time to see this movie.",End of Days
50,dworldeater,"Flawed, but still interesting horror/action from Arnold",7,6 August 2015,"End Of Days is a comeback for Arnold Scwarzenegger who has returned to the big screen after his absence due to open heart surgery. The last time he appeared in a movie before this it was in Batman And Robin, which is an excellent candidate for worst movie of all time. End Of Days is a flawed production, but in my opinion Arnold's best and most interesting project from the worst period of his career(the late 90's/early 00's). The premise of the film is where Arnold is to save the world from Satan, who in the new millennium wants to create Armageddon and Hell on Earth. Sounds good to me. However, End Of Days is not without its problems. I think because Arnold was cast, there is too much action for this action/horror hybrid to work. I do think much of this action is great. However, it is a bit overdone for a film of this type. While Arnold is killing tons of bad guys on the screen, much of the atmosphere and suspense is killed off as well. Which is not good as such components are key elements in making material like this work. Also, the abundance of horrible late 90's CGI hurt this as well. Even though the visual f/x are garbage and the action is so much that it dilutes the supernatural/horror elements, End Of Days still has quite a bit working in its favor as well. After a serious operation, Arnold still is more than capable on delivering the action. He also gave an excellent, character driven performance. He definitely held his own against great dramatic actors Kevin Pollak(his cop partner/best friend) and Gabriel Byrne(the physical embodiment of Satan). Gabriel Byrne gives an Oscar worthy performance as fallen angel Lucifer. His presence and performance is remarkable and he brings a lot of class to a production that relies heavily on action and special f/x. The support cast is very strong also. Although I feel that this could have been done better, End Of Days is still pretty entertaining and you could do much worst for an evening's entertainment.",End of Days

However, Arnold Schwarzenegger gives a pretty solid lead performance, Gabriel Byrne is really good and there are some unintentionally funny moments.",End of Days
54,ctomvelu1,Lame action flick,4,13 March 2011,"It is a good thing Arnold gave up acting to become a governor. END OF DAYS, one of his last films, is simply terrible. It is the last day of the previous century, and the Devil assumes human form to hunt for a bride who will bear him a child before midnight and the start of the new millennium (never mind that the new millennium doesn't actually start until the beginning of 2001). Once the child is conceived, the world will end and the Devil will reign supreme. The only thing standing between the Devil and his plan is ex-cop Jericho Kane, an atheist who lost his wife and child some years before. With a name like Jericho Kane, you know not to take this flick too seriously, especially after the Deil's bride-to-be yells it about a hundred times. To make things even sillier, Kane's former partner is named Bobby Chicago. Lots of explosions and fires, and absolutely no sense. It also is hard to follow the action with all the jump cuts and dimly lit scenes. Arnold is Arnold, what can I tell you? Gabriel Byrne plays an ineffective Satan and Kevkn Pollack is the former partner. Robin Tunney plays the bride-to-be, and frankly isn't given nearly enough to do, considering her considerable screen time. The bombastic ending, set in a massive church, is a joke, although I suspect not intentionally. Skip this one.",End of Days
55,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,An ill conceived plot from the beginning,3,5 July 2013,"It's understandable that over time Arnold Schwarzenegger has become one the most popular actioneer actors in Hollywood. Whenever he was cast as a good guy, he would be unbeatable, if not immortal. The prime example of this kind of aura that Mr. Schwarzenegger has established for himself is in the movie Commando (1985). And for most viewers, it is easy to suspend our belief when it comes to that, and come up with various explanations to how he can withstand such bodily strain and continue to push forward. The reason behind this was that Schwarzenegger was fighting ordinary people. But this crosses the line on believability.The story is about the ever popular ""End of the World"" prophecy that got nearly everybody cringing on New Year's Eve of 1999, where the devil is predicted on returning to open the gates of hell. Thankfully there's Schwarzenegger, playing a depressed ex-cop, Jericho Cane, who lost his family to some no-name robbers and now plays by his own game. But seriously, Schwarzenegger is going to save the day? How does a human being stop a supernatural force like the devil? That should be impossible! Well apparently not, but I still found the whole concept flawed.Character wise, Arnold Schwarzenegger doesn't even give a truly convincing performance. It's obvious that he put on some weight too since his last appearance in Batman & Robin (1997). Plus, most Schwarzenegger films have good one liners, I only laughed at one here. His performance was just dry. Playing the devil is Gabriel Byrne and he's even worse. For the majority of the film, Byrne will just walk around with a smirk on his face blowing up things or killing people. He's not menacing at all. However, there was one good scene between Byrne and Schwarzenegger when the devil tempted Cane into joining him. That was interesting, but the rest was slow dialog. The writer, Andrew W. Marlowe who also wrote the script to Hollow Man (2000) didn't do a good job here.The makeup effects I do favor along the various horror elements that were randomly inserted in the movie. Those were okay, and I say ""okay"" because they weren't scary but it was ugly visuals, which makes them horrific. Even special effects master, Stan Winston headed the creature effects, which I was happy to see. However, the effects used even in here were almost barely on screen. I also didn't understand some of the editing in this movie. There was an alley fight scene and some of the shots switched out too often too quickly. That was frustrating to sit through. Lastly, the score John Debney composed wasn't great either. There was a theme, which is fine, but it wasn't memorable. There was also a motif for the devil but honestly that particular tune was more annoying. Every time it played, the audience will know the devil is coming but it's so annoying that audiences will roll their eyes when they hear it, instead of cringing in fear. Also, the tracks that covered the action scenes were too generic, there was nothing that made me sit on the edge of my seat hoping for the best. The music wasn't compelling. This movie works in some places but not many. The people who will enjoy it the most are the Schwarzenegger fans.Schwarzenegger's acting is plain, the action is generic and the music is too formulaic. What makes it worse is that the story is way too unrealistic. There is very little that works here.",End of Days

I tolerated ""2010"" (1984); his ""sequel"" to Stanley Kubrick's brilliant film ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (1968). This film, however, is pitiful. Gabriel Byrne is terribly miscast as ""Satan"". There is much gratuitous violence, which has no meaning whatsoever. Hyams took the ""Y2K"" fear mongering and made a film based on that. Skip this woeful combination of ""The Exorcist"" and ""Rosemary's Baby"". However, those are brilliant films, whereas this is a ""B"" film. Skip it.",End of Days
57,eric262003,Too Much Action With Little Philosophy,6,9 April 2018,"In this horror/action movie ""End of Days"", Arnold Schwarzenegger assumes the role of Jesus Christ only going incognito and under the name Jericho Cane as he procures his role as the saviour from the devil's wrath in the next thousand years. According to director Peter Hyams that this is the the most pro-religious film in cinematic history. It's also nifty that the greatest action film star ever has turned in his heavy ammunition in exchange for faith in God. With that said I asked myself, can Schwarzenegger be able to withstand this movie without his ammunition? The story pans out just like the traditional apocalyptic action films with as many recyclable elements from other films making this film lack in originality. We have the leading character Jericho Cane on the brink of suicide. The only thing that he cherishes comes in the manifestation of a ballerina musics box that once belonged to his daughter. Everyday he thinks of his wife and his daughter's deaths and has felt guilty about it being that he was hardly ever at home to spend time with them. Of course Hollywood will likely to rub that in our faces. Jericho has a chance redeem himself by trying to save the like of a young Christine York (Robin Tunney) from becoming the mother to the devil's child.Gabriel Byrne really is a scene chomper here as the epitome of Satan posing as a menacing businessman complete with an evil grimace. In reality Byrne is just a banker who's been possessed by the devil while in a restaurant bathroom. The evil entity makes residence in the poor soul's body and fulfills its wrath within him. One time he was a mild-mannered gentleman, but after leaving the bathroom, he comes out a different person as he purposefully grabs a woman's breast, then proceeds to kiss her, most may call it rape, but she doesn't seem to mind. It may not be categorized as a personification of evil, but knowing the scriptwriters behind this film, they may tell you a different story.It turns out that Satan's mating ritual with Christine must emanate before New Year's Eve of 1999 and that Christine's future is at stake. In one of the more macabre scenes in ""End of Days"", newborn Christine was abducted from the maternity ward to the morgue was injected with snake's blood while Satan's followers started chiming evil prayers in Latin. Since then she has been watched over a guardian named Mabel (Miriam Margolyes). At least she can strike the at the most untouchable Schwarzenegger when the action get rough.This movie seems to touch upon ancient mysticism with a very convoluted logic to it, which is interesting in itself. However, it still an action film top priority and doomsday and conspiracy theories which raise philosophical possibilities is just an after thought. We all in the end just came for the mindless shootings, beatings and chases. Hell one character rips out his tongue, puts it in a jar and gets nailed to the ceiling of the hospital room. This helps Jericho solidify what he's up against.Alongside Kevin Pollak as his one-liner induced sidekick, Bobby Chicago, Schwarzenegger can overcome the religious barriers and spew out a rather mean-spirited quip due partially because he is an atheist. After a two year hiatus from that God-awful 1997 ""Batman and Robin"" he seems trimmed down and has stepped up his ante a bit in the action scenes, but the implausible script is the elephant in the room that's hold him and the others back from their potential. It's unconvincing to see Schwarzenegger dangling one-handed from a skyscraper. With the whole new millennium coming at the time, there's really no intensity with the exception of a few billboards indicating Y2K. I just wish they emphasized it a bit more.",End of Days
58,Gislef,Not too bad a flick...,7,9 April 2001,"...mainly due to Gabriel Byrne, who does a decent Satan without the Pacino-like overacting. Ahnald is so-so: no, he can't carry the dramatic character-conveying moments, but it's basically an action flick and he doesn't too bad at the broader character-moments.Byrne is a delight, though, particularly in the ""temptation"" scene in Jericho's apartment. Kevin Pollak has a decent role although he never gets to try out his killer Shatner impersonation. Robin Tunney is pretty much wasted, as her character is only given a chance to ""get tough"" once or twice (and gets a bit of gratuitous nudity that's so short you wonder why they bothered).  Rod Steiger gives a curiously subdued but not-to-bad performance.The main problem is just that there really isn't much...there. Satan flies around in Predator-mode until he can take over a body (Byrne's), and then spends the movie tracking down Christine. Like any good Lord of Evil (or bad movie villain), he straps up Jericho for torture rather than kill him. How thrilling. The Holy See (Knights Templar) are trying to kill Christine. Unfortunately, the irony of this is never really pointed out as we jump to another action sequence.Generally entertaining in a big-budget summer-flick kind of way, but check your brain at the door.",End of Days

So what if midnight new year's eve 2000 was an arbitrary moment chosen to have Times Square parties and computer melt downs. There's certainly no biblical significance to the date, but the film tries to conjure one up, anyway.Gabriel Byrne as the ultimate antagonist and Arnold as an agnostic cop give pretty decent performances. Efforts to make this a biblical apocalypse type story are too contrived. The bad guy acts like a bully; original. The cop runs around yelling at priests, and being a Terminator. That's how deep the script is. There's a lot of running, screaming, explosions, deaths, predictable impersonations, and so on. There's a target girl, like in Terminator. There's an exploitive subplot about a dead wife and child. Church people appear just to get killed. But there's little story behind all the noise and chaos. The ending has some grandiose effects, but holds no surprises.Arnie usually gives us classics, both serious and outrageously camp. This outing is disappointing.",End of Days
63,dunmore_ego,End of Intelligence,3,23 September 2006,"Arnold fans will holler in joy, fans of brainless action will holler in astonishment, and Catholics will just holler.Illogically written by Andrew W. Marlowe and ham-handedly directed by Peter Hyams, *End of Days* gets The Terminator out of his open-backed hospital gown (Arnold Schwarzenegger's return to the big screen after his heart operation), whilst blowing things up in Mysterious Ways and blaspheming Biblical verse to give Catholics something more to whine about.It is 1999 and doom-sayers the world over live in trepidation of their computers going fritz and losing their downloaded porn. Even as the technological stank of Y2K muttons the New York streets, ex-cop turned alcoholic security guard, Jericho Cane (Schwarzenegger, with the perfunctory ""dead-wife-and-kid"" back-story for Loose Cannon effect), must brave theological waters to save 20-year-old virgin Christine (Robin Tunney) from being conscripted as  wait for it  The Bride of Satan. Dun dah daaaarrrh! Stupidity ensues.For every anti-hero, there is his anti-Christ. Gabriel Byrne is the devil here  and he's out to party like it's 1999, on a mission to impregnate Christine with the Anti-Christ between 11 pm and 12 midnight, December 31, 1999  ironically, in the hour that all porn will be lost  thereby bringing about the End of Days. Being able to read minds, conjure hallucinations and employ limitless magic, it doesn't occur to Satan to expedite the impregnation process by appearing months in advance and courting Christine as a teen model and then closing the panty raid easily at the appointed time; instead, he appears on December 28th like a Keyser Soze Terminator and wonders why she doesn't welcome him with open thighs (See above comment re: stupidity.) Here is a movie where nothing makes sense the moment it is uttered, let alone after contemplating its veracity or mythology. A priest (Rod Steiger) tells Jericho that '666' is really '999' upside down with a '1' in front of it. So wait - *Prince* is the Anti-Christ?Satan Soze pursues Jericho and Christine (J and C  get it?) around town, at no point doing anything which would actually precipitate their capture. In one scene, Satan recreates Jericho's wife and child to tempt him into revealing where he hid Christine. But if he can see so deeply into Jericho's mind in recreating his family with enough nuance to inspire nostalgia, why can't he see where Jericho hid Christine not ten minutes ago? Satan can make an assassin talk without a tongue, yet he can't make that assassin unjam a semi-automatic weapon. And when Jericho shoots Satan at point blank range, Satan is courteous enough to open his shirt to reveal the wounds closing, so Jericho won't worry unduly about Satan's health - not sanitary to go about with open bullet wounds Matter of fact, instead of simply possessing Jericho himself to get close to Christine and rape her, Satan expends so much unnecessary energy on side-projects (crucifying the tongue-less guy, blowing up Jericho's partner (Kevin Pollak) and then saving him, and then blowing him up again, ridiculously battling Jericho when he could snuff him out with the effort of thought) that we wonder whether a more efficient assassin/lover shouldn't be put on the case  say, Antonio Banderas.What I find most precious about *End of Days* is Arnold's valiant attempts at The Method: ""sad"" means scrunching up his eyes and not blurting out anything in a foreign accent; ""depressed"" means raising a bottle to his lips and not blurting out anything in a foreign accent; ""deathly scared"" means widening his eyes and not blurting out anything in a foreign accent. There's definitely a pattern here, if we could only decipher it.In the end, the devil is dispatched not by the holy men whom Catholics pray to for deliverance from apocalypses such as these, but from the atheist Jericho. While the timid men of an impotent god exhort ""faith"" and quiver in their cells doing nothing about Satan actually walking amongst them, the Prince of Darkness is thwarted by a nullifidian with a big gun and a foreign accent. Which clearly says something that Catholics blindly refuse to hear: that even if the Devil were to exist, those who have been indoctrinated to unconditionally and irrationally fear him would be unable to conjure a belief in his downfall, let alone act towards it. Further, they might not truly WANT him defeated, for only through his contrary polarity does their god's existence become tenable.For it is written in the Book of Revelations: ""And the Prince of Darkness shall descendeth upon the Earth without any solid game plan, and impregnate a virgin on a date which won't have any significance until the Gregorian Calendar of the 1500s adopts the day numbering which will put it in sync with the equinoxes and the Anno Domine syntax which will annoy sensible people for millennia, by which time, Christians will have forgotten Christ's actual birth date and appropriated the pagan Saturnalia festival in its stead. And the Prince shall effect a Revolution through tight purple pants and ambiguously-lesbian band members"" I can believe the people being drained of blood and crucified, and the alcoholic built like a Mr. Universe; I can believe that a giant, supernatural monster can't kill a guy armed only with a foreign accent; I can even believe that the devil needs to perform some hokey thirteenth century Celtic Druid ritual as foreplay - but what I cannot believe is the 20-year-old virgin in New York City in 1999.Especially around Prince...",End of Days
64,oneguyrambling,Here is one time that I hoped the bad guy would win. Quickly.,4,20 April 2012,"It is 28th December 1999. New York City.3 days before the New Year. Three days before the New Millennium.3 days before Y2K Well 3 days before the New Millennium at least.A newborn child is taken immediately after delivery and in a ritual held within the hospital is fed snake's blood and chanted at Massive explosions fill the streets with no plausible reason forthcoming, and no-one seems to give a toss Gabriel Byrne is taken from behind by a blurry apparition in a men's restroom, and emerges a different man altogether Does New York know how to party or what!?! New York City gives End of Days a nice backdrop, it is perpetually gloomy and menacing and filled with oddballs and men and women that could quite suddenly 'do you wrong'.Unfortunately any semblance of suspense or a slow build towards a satisfying conclusion is ignored in favour of a second half that swiftly devolves into silliness, histrionics and laughable – and obviously telegraphed – twists – with a film that in retrospect rips unashamedly from the 80s action-comedy The Golden Child.()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()() Arnold Schwarzenegger is Jericho Cane, a burly ex-cop with what you might think is a dumb, poorly chosen Hollywood name. That is until we meet his partner BOBBY CHICAGO!!! (Kevin Pollack).The pair form part of a team of rent-a-heavies who perform protection and bodyguard work for high rollers and low lives with money. After they foil a brazen hit on an unnamed guy (Gabriel Byrne) that occurs in broad daylight, they quickly discover that they should have turned a blind eye, which would have meant a shorter film but saved me from wasting another 90 minutes.The core plot involves the usual pap of an evil guy – in this case likely THE evil guy himself – coming to Earth to mate/takeover/kill a chosen human before a pre-determined deadline. Wait what was coming up in three days? This time the target is the snake-blood chickie Christine York, now alls growneds ups, suitably cute, vulnerable and just innocent enough to not understand what is going on for around an hour despite much evidence and alarm bells going off all around her, in what turns out to be a vast 2 decade conspiracy permeating many levels of society, (and almost every non-Arnold & Christine character in the cast).I can't say what the Man has in store for young Chrissy, but whatever it is it will inevitably be sticky Cane and Chicago make breakthrough after breakthrough in the case yet constantly remain a step behind the Man, until the film dictates that it is time for them to come together in a sh*tstorm of noise, over the top stunts and shoddy CGI effects.End of Days grows increasingly stupid the longer it goes, and at over two hours that's a whole lotta stupid. The plot developments rapidly go from inching along to ludicrous and annoying, and even mocking Arnold's thick accent tires quickly without the macho dialogue of his big-dumb-action flicks to clumsily mimic.What is perhaps worse is that Gabriel Byrne twigged early in proceedings that this wasn't going to end with an Oscar and positively snoozes his way through the film, his 'Evil guy' is so generic and lackluster that he is out-acted by Arnold Schwarzenegger!, (who really only has his bug-eyed look and jutted jaw of defiance in his arsenal in the first place).I have said it many times before, I am a sucker for thrillers, dramas and horror films with theological elements and backdrops. I find even an average effort entertaining and engrossing if they somehow inject religious and spiritual themes into proceedings.But I have my limits.Final Rating – 4.5 / 10. There are numerous films where the primary threat is the end of the known universe, here was one time I was hoping the bad guy would win.",End of Days
65,PatrynXX,Great movie ruined by bad acting Ahhhnold,5,23 April 2000,"(Spoiler included perhaps)I kinda liked this movie, but more because Gabriel Byrne is such a great actor, however Arnold is as stupid as ever.  Portraying himself just as badly as he did in Last Action Hero.  He's one guy I just wish would go away.  Kinda like how some people claim to want Kevin Costner and Demi Moore to go away (though the movies those two have done are usually done better) Heck Demi Moore's movie The Seventh Sign is so much better than this movie. Oh sure they used computer anime to describe a three way sex scene that fused into one.  That was a rather weird scene anyway.  The comment that this movie is scarier or more haunting than The Exorcist is hardly apt. Meaning, if End of Days was scary, then The Exorcist must been a comedy. While I do like Gab, who does a great job playing the man downstairs (you don't think the devil has a sex???) I do find that this good thought as a movie was ruined by Arnolds talentless shuffle.  Going so far as to pull the Terminators weapons and put them in this movie...  That part was so laughable.  I'll give this movie a 5 out of 10. Better movies on this subject I like would be either Stigmata, The Seventh Sign or The Devil's Advocate.",End of Days
66,baumer,Why was there a cat in the fridge?,2,7 December 1999,"Warning: Does contain spoilers:I was so hyped when I saw the first trailer for this film last year.  It was either late in 98 or early in 99 that the first trailer graced our screens for this flick.  The producers obviously knew that with combination of Arnold and the Y2K and all the Armageddon stuff, the earleir they could get this out into the public awareness, the better off they would be.  End Of Days looked fantastic and I could not wait to see it.  But that is where my enthusiasm ends and all cynicism begins.  End of Days is one movie that is so short of logic that after the first 20 minutes or so you are laughing and greatly anticipating the next idiotic plot piece to invade your intelligence.  End of Days is pure idiocy and it is not even fun to mask the ineptitude of the script, straight up, this is a terrible movie.Now I am going to attempt to explain very briefly what this movie wants us to believe.  It starts in 1979 where a priest in the Vatican looks outside and sees a comet racing over the moon.  He goes to an old drawing and it too has the comet over the moon.  "" The Eye of God. "" he says to himself and then rushes into a chamber where the Pope is sitting with his religious advisers presumably talking about what they are going to do on New Year's Eve, and tells him that the child will be born tonight.  The Pope tells him he must find the child and protect her.  It seems that once every thousand years that a child will be born and that child will be the one that Satan has chosen to mate with so that he can come to Earth and wreak havoc and that will spell the End of Days ( get it? )  So now we cut to a dark hospital where a woman is giving birth and when the child is born, a nurse brings it down to the basement where some spooky looking people are waiting and one of them kills a rattle snake and puts the blood of the snake in the mouth of the child.  This is obviously the chosen one and by putting snake blood in her mouth that must mean that she is now protected by Satan and she is now Damien from The Omen.  So now we skip 20 years and we meet a buffed up Martin Riggs who is played by Arnold and he is going to kill himself because he obviously misses his wife and kid.  Hockney from The Usual Suspects walks into the room and tells him that they have a long day ahead of them and so killing himself is not very prudent right now ( I think Fenster and MacManus and Verbal and Keaton were sick on this day so they didn't come and join Hockney on this one ).  So we now know that a burned out Arnold is going to be called upon to save the girl.  That's all you need to know because the rest is really just a bad Arnold movie with logic that is so stupid that it defies logic to understand how this script got made. Here are some questions that I have for the writers of the film, and if you have seen this, you'll know exactly what I mean, if you haven't, hopefully it will deter you from doing so.1) If that guy at the beginning wasn't looking out his window and he didn't see the Eye Of God, would no one else have notified the Pope about this miraculous sight?  Was no one else aware of this Eye of God thing?2) If all of Satan's people knew that this girl was going to be born on this day, were there people all over the world in hospitals waiting for the girl to be born?  And that has to be the case because no one knew exactly where the baby was going to be born, so if that is the case then that means that every city in every country in the WORLD, there would have to be one nurse and at least one snake killing guy that would have to be waiting in the basement of every hospital in the world waiting on the off chance that it was their hospital that little Christine would be born in.  That is a pretty big following, say at least, what, 5 million kids are born every day, so that means at least 10 million people in this cult that are very well funded and have a proepnsity for catching snakes.  And you know snakes would not be too happy to lose their lives that day.  And what exactly does the blood do anyway? 3) If this day was so important and this child was so important, don't you think God himself would have taken a greater interest in trying to stop Lucifer from entering Earth therefore negating all that once was?  Somehow I think that he would send something more trustworthy that a drunk ex-cop with large biceps. 4) I have a great many problems with Thomas Aquinas.  First of all his name. No one ever mentions that his name is that of a great man from the past. If a guy named Albert Einstein showed up and was poking around doing things, I think someone may make a joke about it, or Sigmeund Freud, why not Thomas Aquinas.  And next, if this guy was all that the Vatican had going for them , don't you think that he would be a little more funded than he was and that perhaps he would live in a little nicer place than some rat infested-run-down-basement apartment in New York?  This guy was trying to save the world and he has no money?  I don't buy it.  And when Arnold and Lieutenant Wineberg find his place and they are searching for clues, how come there is a cat in the fridge that just happens to jump out at them? Why?  I have seen horror movies before that throw cats into the frame just to scare us, but never have I seen a cat that jumps out of a fridge.  Why would he be there?  How did it get there?  Are cats strong enough to open a fridge tp get in?  Did Thomas put him there to scare Jerico?  Would it not be dead if it was in the fridge?  All very good questions with no real answers. 5) If your best friend was kind enough not to kill you and then you saw him set on fire, do you A) let him burn B) try to put him out C) at least shoot him so that he doesn't feel the pain of burning to death.  I would say the answer to that is maybe B but more probably C since he is a raging inferno. 6) If a down and out ex-cop is offered all that God took away from him, why would he turn it down?  Does he all of a sudden have faith now?  Has God been good to him?  Does Satan not tempt him to have a better life?  Where is the side to him that wants to say no?  I don't buy that either?  I don't think Arnold's character would have said no to Satan. 7) How do you kill Satan?  You can't.  Not with what we have here.  If he is impervious to pain and bullets and can walk through fire, then why is it that a whole bunch of bullets can stop him? 8) If Satan can invade people's bodies then why didn't he invade Arnolds way back at the beginning and find out where the girl is?9) He is Satan, why can't he find her whenever he wants to? 10) What exactly is it that Rod Steiger and all of his people were doing in the basement with all of their computers?  Were they trying to track down where Satan was on the computer, or were they reading reviews on the IMDb or even checking their email.  According to Steiger, ""there are forces at work here that you can't possibly imagine.""  OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO scary stuff!!
I really could go on and on and on but I'll leave that to Celine Dion. Just saffice it to say that this is one film that has no logic to it and no matter if it is Arnold or not, it is a terrible film.  I liked it when he was Dutch and the Terminator and Matrix and Harry Tasker and all those other cool characters that he played.  But this Jericho is awful and End of Days is even worse.  If you want to have some fun picking apart a film, go see this one.  The ten issues that I touched on were just the tip of the iceberg, I'll bet that someone else could pick out ten other silly points to the movie that I didn't even mention, it is that stupid.
End of Days stinks.  There is no other way to say it.  And I am still really confused:Why was there a cat in the fridge?",End of Days
67,DunnDeeDaGreat,Schwarzenegger's comeback,5,1 November 2002,End Of Days was billed as Schwarzenegger comeback after the donkey sh*t of a movie Batman & Robin. While Schwarzenegger is good in the film Gaberial Byrne has the most fun as the devil. Robin Tuney does good in her first female lead and Kevin Pollack gives some one-iners. Peter Hymas has made a okay film with enough action to please the Schwarzenegger fans. I give **1/2 ut of ****.,End of Days
68,mattymatt4ever,In three words: AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME!!!,7,28 December 2001,"To tell you the truth, I wasn't expecting much when I first saw this movie. I'm a big Arnold fan, but for some reason this wasn't on my ""must-see"" list. But after I did see ""End of Days"" on its opening weekend, I said to myself ""I have to buy this movie when it comes out on video!"" 
Well, I did, and I still think it's a blast.  Of course, the plot holes become more and more obvious in repeat viewings, but the fun's still there. This is more serious than Arnold's usual work (which, despite gratuitous action, borders on comedy), but he still manages to squelch out a few funny one-liners.  And best of all, he's paired off with the hilarious comedian Kevin Pollak.  So whenever we don't have Arnold to provide us with comic relief, we have Kevin.  Wow, we lucked out!  There's one really funny scene, where Arnold makes a breakfast shake out of everything he finds in his kitchen--including a pizza that fell on the floor--and takes a sip, saying ""They say breakfast in the most important meal of the day.""  He asks Kevin if he wants some and Kevin replies, ""I'm good.""  The two of them make a spectacular team, and I hope to see them paired off again in upcoming movies--even if they have to do one of those tired buddy cop flicks.  Just watching those two on screen is a delight.  And of course, Gabriel Byrne couldn't have played a better Satan.  There is a memorable scene where Arnold comes face-to-face with Satan, who's begging Arnold to sell his soul to him.  He says, ""He's (referring to God) not going to help you.  He just has a good publicist.  Whenever something good happens, it's his will.  Whenever something bad happens, he works in mysterious ways.""  That scene alone is worth the price of a rental. 
I guess you can say it's a guy flick.  It's certainly not a date movie! There's intense, graphic violence, gore, disgusting images, foul language and one explicit sex scene.  So...be prepared!  You're not about to watch ""Mary Poppins.""  As I mentioned there are plot holes--some subtle, some you can drive a truck through--but the film moves at such a fast pace that you don't give a damn! You're here for the ride, and what a wild ride it is!  Lots of action, some cool music, great one-liners, a creative premise.  Not an Oscar winner, but there's not much more I can ask for.  My score:  7 (out of 10)",End of Days
69,vip_ebriega,Hell'z a popping',6,10 May 2008,"My Take: Definitely one on my guilty pleasures list. Silly, improbable and unashamedly mindless. Arnold Schwarzenegger may be the only man ever to be crucified twice. The first time was in CONAN THE BARBARIAN. He lived, now he goes through this ordeal once more in END OF DAYS, Schwarzenegger's first film after a two year absence. Starring in the millennium-end movie of 1999 is perhaps the great place for Arny to restart up his action movie career, left behind by his roles in comedies like JUNIOR and TWINS. Like other of Arny's one man army B-actioners, END OF DAYS has a helicopter chase, fist-with-fist fights, gun-play and a massive dosage of explosions. But it also includes stuff you've never seen before in Arny's films (or in any film put together). We have Arnold getting his ass kicked by an old woman, a crucifixion, his emotional side(!), and his fight in what seems to be the only foe Arnold has never fought before, The Devil himself.Of course, all this is very silly (Ayee! his emotional side!), but that's just one of the shameless guilty pleasures of this Apocalyptic thriller spearheaded with DIE HARD. The plot concerns Satan's return to Earth, seeking a bride to be the mother of the Antichrist to bring about the title event, something that the film's pseudo-religious mysticism says that he does every hundred years or so. Crazy ain't it not, but that's just one of the few pseudo-religious myths this film introduces (666 as 999, with a 1?). But accepting it exactly as what it is may help. It's a dark, and often very silly, thriller, which doesn't mean it ain't fun. Both action-packed and potentially silly, summing it up into one cheesy yet crazily fun night at the movies. It isn't in the tongue-in-cheek comedy form like Kevin Smith's DOGMA, which takes these religion hokum for jokes, END OF DAYS doesn't take the audiences will not take it seriously, and it does know how to make fun of itself.Arny plays a Chicago ex-cop Jericho Cane (take a look at those initials!), who's still in guilt of the loss of his wife and daughter, wishing that his new job, preventing assassinations, would do finish him off. If you don't buy an alcoholic New Yorker as the sole savior, then you'd better stop right here. This is not the movie for you. But Arny does get his chance at saving the world, as he is thrust to protect the 21-year old Christine York (Robin Tunney), the next broad chosen to be Satan's mistress. Satan here, first appears as a translucent floating, uh, thing which later takes the bodily form of a Wall Street Banker (Gabriel Byrne). At this time, I was asking myself: why a wall street banker? Then again, why not? Kevin Pollack, Rod Steiger and Miriam Margolyes offer supporting performances.END OF DAYS is not brilliant, original or the least bit intellectual in any way. The plot gets into a derivative approach, taking a little of THE OMEN here, a bit of THE EXORCIST there, with a few dashes of ROSEMARY'S BABY and DIE HARD thrown in. Of the acting, Byrne isn't the only good actor in the film, but still the only one that doesn't give the impression of sleepwalking his role of the Devil. Director Peter Hyams, also serving as cinematographer, shakes and moves the camera off and on focus. Sometimes it's stylish, often its dizzy. Rookie screenwriter Andrew W. Marlowe, who penned what may just be the best action film in long time, AIR FORCE ONE, plays with his pen and paper this time around, making what is one crazy hybrid of religion and pure Schwarzenegger-ed action fare. Silliness come at an abundance. This not the place to forage any brain food, but as is any movie of the summer. Judging as a brainless summer fodder, END OF DAYS is decent summer affair, camp and class in a package. It's fun once you know it doesn't take itself seriously. You didn't think they did this in a straight face do you? Rating: *** out of 5.",End of Days

Let it be said this is one of Arnold's lamest efforts. End Of Days might have been decent if it was played with the same tongue in cheek tone that Schwarzenegger's 80's movies played on (Commando and The Running Man spring to mind) however like all the other action heroes of his ilk the late 90's saw the change from silly fun to just plain asinine. The movie seems like a rip off of The Exorcist III but while that excellent movie had atmosphere and George C. Scott, all End Of Days has is just an artificial mood that is supposed to be scary but fails in all attempts to be even remotely watchable. Arnold Schwarzenegger plays the role so distanced that we wonder if there is something more to his character but there never is and overall there is no fun to be had in this roadkill. It is obvious that Arnold was starting to lose his edge but one wonders if he wasn't trying to outdo his career stopping performance in Batman and Robin.* out of 4-(Bad)",End of Days

It isn't the typical Arnold lead Schwarzenegger action movie, nothing at all like that. It's one of the few Schwarzenegger films that doesn't revolve around his manly pecs and bulging biceps. Arnold takes a backseat to the story this time round, the movie's really good for it, not saying Arnold's ever bad, no, I'm saying that the movie's so good it was inevitable. Schwarzenegger is actually very good in End of Days, one of his stronger depictions. End of Days is a mainstream action movie with an excellently impregnated non-mainstream plot. It's in part a really good horror movie. It has a great cast, although it doesn't have great standout stars, what it does have is performers who are established and very well cast. I love Robin Tunney in this role. Her and Arnold have great chemistry, a strength of the movie that may often be overlooked. Tunney is great. Gabriel Byrne is great. Byrne was born to play Satan.

75,ivo-cobra8,Very underrated hateful supernatural science fiction/action film,10,17 October 2015,"End of Days (1999) is the most very underrated and hated American action supernatural horror flick.Directed by Peter Hyams starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Gabriel Byrne, Robin Tunney, Kevin Pollak, Rod Steiger, CCH Pounder, and Udo Kier.I think End of Days (1999) is the most underrated Arnold Schwarzenegger film that is supernatural action horror flick. I prefer this film over Schwarzenegger new films Sabotage, Maggie and Terminator Genysis also those films are utter garbage of this days. Schwarzenegger can not make any good film this days, like he did by this one. I love this film to death. On millennium's eve 28th December a man must fight against the devil to prevent the end of the world and apocalypse on the New Year's Eve! Honestly? I think it is Schwarzenegger different action film than his classic action films were.The film's plot follows former New York Police Department detective Jericho Cane (Schwarzenegger), after saving a banker (Byrne) from an assassin, finds himself embroiled into a religious conflict, and must protect an innocent young woman (Tunney), who is unwittingly chosen by evil forces to conceive the Antichrist with Satan.This film isn't classic action movie like are Terminator 1 and 2, Predator, The Running Man, Total Recall and Commando. But it is still a good action film that I love and I will still watch it. This is the first Supernatural film with Arnold Schwarzenegger. This is a great movie.. even has some funny parts.. but Gabriel Byrne steals the show as 'The Man' .. a.k.a. The Devil. He is amazingly hot in this movie and actually had me rooting for the devil. I know I wouldn't run from him!!! All hell breaks loose when Arnold Schwarzenegger battles the ultimate evil in this chilling supernatural action thriller. When a burned-out former New York City cop named Jericho (Schwarzenegger) is assigned to security detail for a mysterious and foreboding stranger (Gabriel Byrne), Jericho thwarts an incredible assassination attempt. During the ensuing investigation, he and his partner (Kevin Pollak) save the life of the beautiful and terrified Christine York (Robin Tunney), whose destiny involves death, the devil and the fate of mankind. Now it's up to Jericho to save the girl, the world and his own soul as he comes face to face with his most powerful enemy ever! The movie pits Arnold Schwarzenegger against the devil (Gabriel Byrne), with director Peter Hyams delivering tense moments of action amid not-so-subtle choices for character development.There are forces here you couldn't possibly comprehend. Dialogue from ""End of Days'' You can say that again. ""End of Days'' opens with a priest gazing out his window at the Vatican City and seeing a comet arching above the moon like an eyebrow. He races to an old wooden box, snatches up a silver canister, pulls out an ancient scroll, unrolls it and sees--yes! A drawing of a comet arching above the moon like an eyebrow! For verily this is the dreaded celestial display known as the ""Eye of God.'' The priest bursts into an inner chamber of the Vatican, where the pope sits surrounded by advisers. ""The child will be born today!'' he gasps. Then we cut to ""New York City, 1979'' and a live childbirth scene, including, of course, the obligatory command, ""push!'' A baby girl is born, and a nurse takes the infant in its swaddling clothes and races to a basement room of the hospital, where the child is anointed with the blood of a freshly killed rattlesnake before being returned to the arms of its mother.""Put on the full armor of God so that you can take your stand against the devil's schemes. For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.""Without even realizing it, suicidal skeptic Arnold Schwarzenegger sets out to fight the evil one head-on in ""End of Days."" Throughout the story, he resorts to a plethora of guns and firepower. He just didn't understand that spiritual warfare cannot be fought with guns. Not until the conclusion, when Arnold comes face to face with the knowledge that, without God he is useless, is he able to effectively battle Satan. In this I find redemption in ""End of Days"", and Biblical truth.End of Days is a 1999 supernatural thriller directed by Peter Hyams (The Presidio). Set at the end of the twentieth century, the film stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as Jericho Cane, a burnt-out private security specialist who finds himself protecting a young woman from a man who may embody the ultimate evil and then bring about the end of the world. The film prominently features several models of the Glock pistol, including one of the earliest appearances in a film of the Glock 34. The film's cast includes Gabriel Byrne, Kevin Pollak, Robin Tunney, and Rod Steiger. At the end of the century, Satan visits New York in search of a bride. It's up to an ex-cop who now runs an elite security outfit to stop him.10/10 Grade: A- Studio: Beacon Communications,Universal Pictures Starring: Arnold Schwarzenegger, Gabriel Byrne, Robin Tunney, Kevin Pollak, Rod Steiger, CCH Pounder, and Udo Kier.

76,The_Movie_Cat,"""Sometimes you border on competency""",6,20 June 2000,"I once spent a desperately dull hour logged onto an on-line Schwarzenegger chat. Cynicism reared it's ugly head as the only questions being put to Arnold seemed to be of the ""tell us about your new movie"" variety. When the star at one point condemned the spread of guns in American society, I posed the question of how he could object to the use of firearms when his entire career appears to be based on their application?Not surprisingly, the company hosting the chat session didn't forward my question as one of those Mr. Schwarz had to answer, but the issue does get raised in End of Days, with a final forty minutes given over to pyrotechnics and not terribly convincing CGI. It's a shame the picture ends this way, as before the final quarter it was actually quite a decent film. This an Arnold who realises his place in the movie business is more in doubt than at any time before, with action movies scarcely existing and his previous film role  snigger behind your hand, he's a big guy  Mr. Freeze in Batman and Robin. Perhaps inspired by his colleague Sylvester going all thespian in the admirable Copland, Arnold tries his hand at acting. You read that correctly. Here we have an Arnold who loses his first screen fight against a middle-aged woman, a drunken, pill-popping Arnie who has bad hygiene and cries. Yes, cries. Well, a bit. And, to his credit, he shares screen space with Gabriel Byrne, Rod Steiger and CCH Pounder yet doesn't make a complete idiot of himself. He's no Olivier and that accent's as thick as ever, but he doesn't do too badly does our Arnie.The film itself owes more than passing debts to Se7en, while there's a nice line from Steiger's Father Kovak: ""Satan's greatest trick was convincing man he didn't exist"". This is, of course, a close paraphrasing of the line in The Usual Suspects, where the subject under discussion was again Gabriel Byrne. Byrne is the Devil, an evil deity with flammable urine (actually another Usual Suspects reference now I think of it) in a largely monochrome-tinted view of pre-millennium tension. Latin and old Biblical texts paint the screen, and there's a very real sense that all are giving their best, if nothing else. Kevin Pollak plays the typical expository ""buddy"" role, but other than that the film is relatively free of genre clichés. Arnie's wife and child were killed some unspecified years previously, making him flawed and negating tiresome ""love interest"" fixations.It is all nonsense of course, Byrne out to impregnate Robin Tunney as the not-that-subtly-named ""Christine"". It appears the Devil can take over the Earth and plunge all into damnation if he has a quickie on New Year's Eve. As this film had a December '99 release, it's the strangest example of a movie with a built-in sell-by date. Maybe the ""watch it in three weeks or it suddenly becomes irrelevant"" hook was designed to drag in a disinterested audience. The idea that the Devil can, if not be stopped, but temporarily set back, by Arnie's requisite 9mm is silly, and what begins as a reasonably sombre detective case (even though you'll put all the pieces together far faster than Arnie does) hopelessly degenerates into brain-off firepower. There's also some notably poor and confused editing for the fight sequences. However, it's really not as bad as some reviews have claimed, and worth a look when it comes on TV. The ultimate thought that End of Days leaves you with, though, is that while the world at one point loved Arnie, looking back we were paying to see inconsequential pap like this, The Terminator notwithstanding. End of Days is not a bad Schwarzenegger film (it certainly beats Commando hands down), but we're now watching it with the rose-tinted spectacles long since broken. Will Arnold ever be as important again?",End of Days
77,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,Smackdown - Schwarzenegger vs Satan,6,9 February 2009,"Arnold Schwarzenegger is without a doubt one of the most easily recognizable action film stars of all all time. His relatively straight-forward to film have created a sort of ""Arnold Formula."" From being a barbarian warrior to an evil robot assassin from the future all the way to playing a Soviet Police Officer and then a good robot protector from the future all the while fighting a variety of enemies Schwarzenegger's movie have not always been good, but he sure does have a taste for variety. That's probably what has kept him making big movies while other action stars have faded out by playing the same role over and over again. Here Schwarzenegger fights what just might be his toughest opponent: Satan, the devil himself!However, that is also where some potential problems begin to arise. For one Arnold, in his best movies, was an action hero with a smile on his face. The exception to that being the ""Terminator"" movies. ""End of Days"" is much more dark than your typical Arnold movie, but then again that might be appropriate since he fighting ""the prince of Darkness."" Though, this dark edge is largely confined to bloody violence and menacing explosions. Any sort of dark horror atmosphere or a really scary film about one of the stories of ultimate evil surfacing on Earth are put second. But does that matter? Not really. Schwarzenegger has been serving up mayhem since the 70s and he continues to do here in decent form. It is bound to please fans of the star, but others will find it just as silly as most of his other movies.And this movie is quite silly beyond its violent facade. For one, is it really that hard for Satan to find a woman to sleep with during the biggest party of the year? He goes about stalking her, killing people and blowing up cars. I get it, he's evil, but given his goal in this movie, couldn't he try a more charming approach? Just an observation, it's not THAT important. --- 6/10BsCDb Classification: 16+ --- violence",End of Days
78,kenandraf,Exactly what I expected....,10,17 October 2000,"I rented this movie this last weekend becouse I missed it last year and because it would be perfect for my mood to watch a kick ass movie with a touch of Halloween and I got what I expected!I Knew this movie was not going to be Arnold's best due to the mediocre reviews last year and I knew it would have a combination Exorcist,Omen,Seven,Total Recall,Terminator 2 combination movie just by the trailer.Props to whoever made the trailer because it was an exciting trailer and made no false promises.Yup,kick ass action,typical modern style formula of explosions and heavy reliance on sound and computer animation,shockers,excitment,and a stronger acting effort from Arnold.This movie delivers exactly what it promised!I think the movie is still a classic because of this unique individual called Arnold Schwazenegger.Very difficult to find somebody who embodies energy like this man.The movie fails in plot indeed but that weakness can be forgiven because everywhere else,the movie delivers for an action/horror film.I know we can get mad(as a lot of critics did) at the producers for not coming up with a better story(is it really that difficult compared to the technical wonders they accomplish on everything else in the movie?),specially when they came so close to perfection in this genre on this one in all other aspects.But considering how terrible other action movies are nowadays and how precious a performer like Arnold is (giving strong effort in performance too),and the bigger than usual production effort,and how wrong this movie could have gone(like countless other missfires out there),this one still ROCKS.The ending saved the movie and I consider it a classic for people who can look past plot sometimes.......",End of Days
79,perfectbond,Not a Good Arnold Movie,6,9 December 2002,"Since I saw Mr. Schwarzeneggar in person here in Vancouver at the public library while he was filming The Sixth Day, I'll always have an interest in his films. End of Days is not his finest effort. All the good Arnold films limit his dialogue and emphasize his muscles. The exception is Twins and arguably Kindergarten Cop. Here it is painful when his trademark accent warbles the lines as he tries to be a theological detective with a crisis in faith. Gabriel Byrne does what he can to prop this vehicle up with only partial success. 6/10.",End of Days
80,tomimt,Arnold VS. the Devil,6,17 December 2005,"End of Days was one of the many, many thrillers made about the upcoming apocalypse in the change of the millennium. what a bummer, that the world didn't end. Bummer for those thrillers that is.EOD differs from the flock of films by having Arnold Schwarzenegger (Jericho Cane), who does actually quite good part as a alcoholic ex-cop, as a hero.In the last days of the old millennium the Satan (Gabriel Byrne) comes to earth in solid mind of convincing a child with Christine Yourk (Robin Tunney) who has been chosen, without her knowledge of course, to this task. She's been raised by this cult, who want it to happen. So it's up to Arnold to kick some devil ash.EOD actually is okay action flick, despite of the clichéd religious mumbo jumbo. Movie has couple of very effective scenes in it, but the over all atmosphere is bit too serious for it to work solely as an action film and it's the thriller part which doesn't work as well as it should, even though there are couple of good scene in that area as well.Not Arnold's best film, but I'm sure at least biggest Arnold fans will get kicks out of this.",End of Days
81,Movie-12,Jumps back and forth from logic-free concepts to formulaic action. **1/2 (out of four),6,21 February 2001,"END OF DAYS / (1999) **1/2 (out of four)By Blake French:	""End of Days"" is the first movie to seriously argue that ""666"" the numerical sign of the devil, is actually a 999 upside-down. Since the film was first released in 1999, the movie could not resist to throw in that little contrivance. What can you expect from a movie when its premise is based on the concept that once every thousand years if Satan impregnates a woman during the hour from 11 p.m. to 12 a.m. on the last day of the millennium, she will give birth to the anti-Christ who will bring the world to an end? I am already thinking that the movie is vulnerable to logic (is the time given in Eastern Standard?) and it will make its own limitations at the convenience of plot. ""End of Days"" is particularly graphic in its use of violence, but never really scares us, even with such a horrifying premise like the end of humanity. 	Arnold Schwarzenegger has not made a good movie in a long time. First ""Jingle all the Way,"" then ""Batman & Robin,"" now we have a movie that bounces back and forth between action and concept. There are the standard ""action movie scenes,"" where a person sways from a helicopter in mid air, where a chase scene takes place at incredible heights, where someone grasps to a high window ledge, where a subway train crashes, where a massive fire erupts in Manhattan, and so on. There are also the false shocko moments followed with a sudden burst of loud, startling music: the its just a cat scene, its just another cop scene, its just a dream scene, its just your imagination scene, he's not really dead scene, and its just maggots suddenly growing out of an apple scene. The movie is also bound by philosophy. The action is focused towards Schwarzenegger saving the world, but he cannot do that all by himself, can he? Sure he can, if he can stop Satan (Gabriel Bryne), from impregnating Christine (Robin Tunney), who was born under the religious sign of a passing comet -- and based on her birth twenty years earlier during the sighting of that comet  is the chosen mother of Satan's child. 	""End of Days"" begins with an intriguing, although plausible, premise. The bizarre events that transpire a few days before the end of the millennium immediately inspire our curiosity. The action sequences are also fine, intensified by thrilling music and a fast paced style. The movie opens on a good note, and the remainder of the action sequences are also quite exciting. The scenes also inspire a few questions. Satan kills many people in this movie, people just like the hero, so why doesn't he just finish Arnold Schwarzenegger off like he does with so many other characters. On the other side, Schwarzenegger shoots the devil, who pulls his shirt up so we can see the bullet holes immediately healing. When using a machine-gun, the ammunition flings the Prince of Darkness backward and puts him down before he attacks again. There are simply no rules to abide by here. 
	""End of Days"" does not have a whole lot of explanation; it plays sort of like your run of the mill action picture with the gimmick of the week. There just is not a lot of true involvement or engagement after the premise. We do care about Arnold Swarzzenegger's character, and Gabrial Bryne is an especially convincing Satan. He is devilish, with fiendish appeal, proving that tranquillity is the most terrifying evil. Al Pachino did an equally diabolical job in ""The Devils Advocate,"" but Bryne is even more terrifying. Robin Tunney has nothing to do but exchange shameless subtext with Schwarzenegger's character. (""You're better than everyone else, just remember that."" ""I don't want to be better or worse, I just want to be normal."") She is more of a plot device than an actual character.
	Excellent convincing set designs appear frequently, especially near the end where the characters wander through dark chambers and dim hallways. Cinematography also adds a nice touch to the suspenseful, mysterious atmosphere, all done by the movie's director, Peter Hyams (""The Relic""). It is too bad such good filmmaking does not have a story fit enough to back it up. One more thing I just have to mention: Why do the cops always show up at the end of the movie, after the action is over. I am getting very tired of that.",End of Days
82,FlickJunkie-2,Expertly crafted action powerhouse,8,5 May 2000,"This powerhouse is an expertly crafted supernatural action flick.  It is the story of Satan's attempt to rise and destroy the world as we know it by mating with a woman and producing an offspring.  We see the birth of the chosen baby girl as the pope and cardinals, who have read the signs, plan to find her and protect her from Satan.  The film jumps to the present and we are introduced to Jericho Cane (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and an adult Christine York (Robin Tunney), Satan's intended.  The devil takes control of an investment banker's body (Gabriel Byrne) and with the aid of his sycophantic followers proceeds to stalk Christine for the mating ritual. Meanwhile Jericho finds Christine and assigns himself as her protector.  The rest of the film is one big chase scene, as Jericho and Christine run from Satan as well as the clerics who want to kill her to prevent the union.The story is pretty flimsy.  It is really nothing more than a vehicle for Arnold to strap on some firepower and wreak mayhem in his return to the action genre.  In the featurette included on the DVD, writer Andrew Marlowe states flat out that he wrote this script specifically for Arnold.  But WOW, as vehicles go, this was a supercharged nitro burning dragster of a movie.Peter Hyams puts together some of the best action footage I can remember. Overall, his photography was fantastically potent.  The technique, camera angles, lighting and use of filters to create various effects were all terrific.  But more importantly, his pace was excellent.  This film never lets up.  There are rest stops from the action, but no real lulls.  The visual effects in this movie were outstanding.  There were pyrotechnics, digitally created creatures, and exploding models that were so realistic that I didn't pick up they were models until I checked out the bonus features on the DVD (The bonus pack was great.  It included a fascinating section on how all the visual effects were produced).  The sound design was also excellent (though a bit overly loud at times) and made full use of all five speakers.Schwarzenegger returns to top form as undisputed king of the action genre. There was much speculation that, after his heart surgery, if he acted at all it he would be relegated to nothing more strenuous than roles like Kindergarten Cop'.  This film completely removes all doubt.  Arnold is pumped back up and takes on his biggest challenge yet, in a physically demanding role fighting a foe that can't be killed.  That doesn't mean he doesn't try, pouring out projectiles like a fountainhead of fire.  This part was written in a way that made Arnold's character a lot more human; actually fighting off despair.  He handled this nuance extremely well.This is probably Robin Tunney's biggest part in a feature film and she does a nice job.  Her character didn't have a lot of range; just look scared, upset and helpless and make Arnold look strong.  She did this well, helped considerably by how petite she is compared to Arnold.I thought Gabriel Byrne took the wrong approach to his character.  He is a terrific actor, but he played this role a bit too flippantly, like a sardonic wise guy rather than the evil prince of darkness.  Also, his New York accent was an awful attempt to hide his charming Irish brogue.Viewers should use discretion before seeing this film.  Anyone who is put off by gratuitous graphic violence, gore, nudity, profanity and sexual situations should avoid this film.  But this film is a must see for action fans and especially for Arnold fans.  I rated it an 8/10 in spite of a weak story.",End of Days
83,redkiwi,Cheesetastic!,7,13 December 1999,"OK, it's Arnie's first film for a couple of years, and he's back to his cheesy best, which has been all to infrequent given some of his recent films.He's had a serious heart complaint and surgery, and he looks a lot leaner - a lot more normal - and healthy.Arnie is an ex-cop who is investigating Satan's return to earth (hey, it happens every week) for his Millennial conquest of the earth.  And what a coincidence, it happens in America.  It's just amazing how often these things happen in locations that are convenient to the unthoughtful Hollywood studios isn't it?Satan is returning to mate; and the cheesiest bit by far is the name of the main female character, Christina York.  That's Christ In New York, think about it.  This tie-in was tenuous beyond almost all belief.All that said it was good old Arnie stuff, with the action scenes and special effects at their best, although he seemed bereft of some of those great lines that he has become so well known for.Gabriel Byrne was eminently convincing as Satan (not that I'd know!), and it was nice to see Rod Steiger on screen again in the first film I've seen him in for ages (Mars Attacks?).This film brought Arnie back to the forefront which is what was needed, but was somewhat let down by a tenuous concept and cheesey script and storyline. Worth seeing for its escapist content alone.",End of Days
84,Bogmeister,"We're All Still Here, go figure",5,23 July 2005,"This flic has the distinction of being outdated almost immediately, as of 5 years ago, despite just coming out in late '99. The plot hinges on the nervous anticipation everyone felt at the end of the 1999 year, when anything from Y2K to Judgement Day might have spelled the end of it all. The supposition in this story revolves around the numbers of the '1999' year, which are the TRUE sign of the Devil, not '666' as everyone figured. Talk about Topsy-turvy. So Satan (a grinning Byrne) comes to town (New Yawk City) to bed a designated virgin (Robin Tunney) and thereby herald the Apocalypse (or, a new beginning - it all depends on your perspective). His main opponent? Arnie, as a suicidal cop. Directed in the usual by-the-numbers style by Peter Hyams, the typical huge-budget action film holds no surprises (unless you count the scene where one of Satan's disciples, a grandma, throws Arnie around like a rag doll). There's also a racy sex scene with a kinky kick to it - but what else do you expect in a Satan movie? I believe we have reached a point now where we've run out of enemies for hero Arnie to face, and he better switch to light comedy. Or politics.",End of Days
85,chrisbrown6453,Arnie's back and the Devil's got him.,6,21 May 2002,"End of Days is the first movie Arnold Schwarzenegger had made since his heart surgery and he seems fine. You may have heard rumors that the big man tries acting this time out, but not to worry; his moments of soul searching and introspection are kept to a minimum. He does get crucified, however, which requires a bit of a stretch. Lots of firepower, violence, special effects and action deliver just what fans of the star want from a movie. As such, it is a relatively painless watch and delivers some goods. A few days before the millennium, earthquakes and subterranean fires hit New York. Relax...it's just the Devil arriving. He has come to town to meet his bride and to conceive a child, the antichrist. Biblical prophesies have warned that if the Devil has his way with a certain virgin between 11pm and midnight on New Year's Eve it will bring about the so-called ""End of Days."" Satan will be able to take control of the Universe away from God for the next thousand years. Jericho Cane, an alcoholic ex-cop now working in security, seems to be the only person in the tri-state area capable of saving mankind. Where is Mayor Giuliani when you need him? With Arnold on the case, who needs elected officials? Robin Tunney plays the spunky virgin in question who has been destined for this unholy union since birth. Kevin Pollack, as Jericho's mouthy sidekick, gets most of the funny lines. Gabriel Byrne adds a touch of class playing ""The Man"" who has devilishly taken over the body of a Wall Street banker. Great disguise, Lucifer! My favorite scene was the knock-down, drag-out fight Arnie has with rotund little Miriam Margolyes who plays one of the Devil's minions. Oh yea, and that awesome dinner scene when Lucifer grabs that womans..umwell, you'll see.  Director Peter Hyams gets the big action set-pieces right and does his darndest to pass Los Angeles off as New York. That is actually the Times Square celebration of 1998/99 that we see at the moment of climax. No matter how hard they tried, downtown Los Angeles is not NYC.",End of Days

High action, humour, and a truly falable Arnie, who acts really well, make for great entertainment. The only fault I found was the ""Hey look at what's about to happen"" moment near the end, apart from that it's Arnie at his best. The scene where Rod Steiger as the Priest is explaining the religious parts of the story, and Arnie is totally disbelieving is so good, with a classic line to boot. Let's see more of Byrnes in blockbusters, he's fabulous.",End of Days
87,Bogey Man,Surprisingly effective horror action,7,14 July 2002,"Peter Hyams' End of Days stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as a fired and alcoholic police officer, who is on the edge of sanity and tries to commit suicide very often. He is now private security guard and traps a mysterious sniper who tried to kill one of his clients. Soon he learns that there are some very bad things going on in the city, and the new millennium is very close..It is the last days of December, 1999.I really liked the scare department in this demonic little horror thriller from this talented director and director of photography, Peter Hyams. This film is full of effective and very ominous images and scenery and the film is very dark. I appreciate perhaps most the shots above the city and the twisted use of camera up there. That really creates a feeling of evil and that something very powerful and wicked is ""above the city"" and is about to get power. Hyams once again shows his talent as he has been the director of photography many times earlier in his own films. End of Days reminded me occasionally of Alex de la Iglesia's great horror film El Dia de la Bestia (Day of the Beast), a brilliant mix of black comedy and VERY dark imagery and atmosphere. As incredible as it sounds, this mainstream produced film is that effective, thanks to the talented men behind the camera.
There are some flaws, too, and the most irritating things is perhaps the cliche ending, which I definitely won't spoil here, but is without a doubt there only to satisfy the audience and create the safe and familiar Happy Ending. If this was made 20 years ago, the ending would definitely have been different; it would've been how the director wanted to, not hot the audience wanted to. That tones the otherwise great and exciting finale a little bit down, but fortunately it is not as syrupy as possible. Another negative thing that I can tell is the editing which is very fast, unstylishly and ineffectively fast and restless. Fast edits can be great elements if used right and with skill, but in this film, they are in my opinion gratuitously fast and too plenty. Just watch the action scenes and count how many edits there are in one minute. The editors should have realized that sometimes - and in this case - less is more. These ""flaws"" are still tolerable especially when I keep in mind how many positive points there are in this film.End of Days is also very exciting and fast paced. The train segment is great and especially the clock ticking finale when the millennium is about to change, is very skillfully created and hold my full attention. The finale is pretty similar to the finale in Kathryn Bigelow's own millennium related film, a paranoid and effective thriller Strange Days (1995). In End of Days, there are also couple of genuinely frightening, scary, sudden and loud ""shocks"" that require a movie theatre to fully work. The nightmare sequences are also chillingly original and brought to my mind the great horror classics that even Hollywood sometimes produced. The demon which Christine sees in her dreams is very scary and almost as frightening as the similar character in David Lynch's masterwork Lost Highway.As a horror film, End of Days works fine and creates an atmosphere that is so rare in mainstream films nowadays. I didn't have any expectations when I placed the VHS in my VCR, and so I was pleasantly surprised of what I saw and experienced. If we stay in the 90's, I could say that End of Days is kind of tamer version of Day of the Beast and without its comic elements. There are comic elements in End of Days, too, but those are not, fortunately, the usual Hollywood one-liners and stupid bits of dialogue. Gabriel Byrne over-acts occasionally little, but many guys who play devils seem to have this problem! He is almost as ""cool and modern"" devil as Al Pacino in Taylor Hackford's Devil's Advocate, a film which also has great atmosphere but is more restrained and drama oriented.End of Days gets 7/10 from me. Great work again Peter!",End of Days
88,malkane316,quick reviews!,8,26 May 2004,"SPOILERS!!!So I've read on the B/W board that End of Days is crap. I can understand people saying it for Collateral Damage, and admittedly this is a bit pretentious, a man taking on Satan and all, exploiting the supposed 'end of the millennium-end of the world crap' for all it's worth. But it's an Arnie film, so expect guns, explosions, one-liners, and general entertainment, if you're into that sort of thing. Gabriel Byrne is good as the devil, perhaps not as frightening as Pacino, but slimy and attractive enough to be effective. The plot revolves around a girl whose birth is believed to bring around the end of days, if Satan can impregnate her, and as the church is not strong enough to protect her, Arnie mistakenly gets drawn in. With the Dark Lord chasing her, as well as priests who believe that her death is the only solution, Arnie whips out the hardware and eventually sacrifices himself for her, and the world. I saw this in the cinema, just before New Year's Eve, which added atmosphere, not because I was stupid enough to believe that the world was going to end, but because I was surrounded by people who weren't sure. The film has a fair amount of jumpy amounts, not as effective on the small screen, and has some dark content for a typical action flick. But, once again, you don't need to think much for this one, just enjoy, but one question arises: if Arnie with guns, grenades etc can barley stop Satan, knowing that Satan tries this once every 1000 years, how did they defeat him 1000 years ago? Harsh language? Sticks?",End of Days

Arnie hadn't acted in a good action movie since ""Eraser"", and I was looking forward to some great fun.

I enjoyed the typical action good vs bad fighting in this movie. It was all so cheesy mostly because the movie tried to be too serious and dark. The movie hasn't aged well, and in my opinion is one of the least entertaining movies to pull from the Arnold library. Having said that I am a huge fan of his and will watch anything he is in. It deserves a 6.... or maybe a 666... cuz... devil ..stuff. Anyway...There was so much that didn't work in this movie, one minute the devil is all powerful next he isn't... not that I am looking for a lot of sense from a movie like this but it made for some really hard times of me convincing myself to get past it and just watch. If you want to watch a fun cheesy Arnold action stick with Conan or Commando any of the movies he is in that start with C should do.",End of Days
94,Silverzero,One of the finer Schwarzenegger movies.,4,5 October 2002,"POSSIBLE SPOILERS. A lot of people have been complaining about this movie. IT'S NOT SHAKESPEARE. Get it through your heads, its a movie about the end of the world. It's an action-horror movie. It had good action sequences. Schwarzenegger was more vulnerable in this movie. He is not an unstoppable killing machine (i.e. Commando, Terminator). In this movie he cries and is suicidle. Gabriel Byrne is brilliant as Satan and messes with Arnies head throughout the movie. There are, however some flaws, i.e. some of Arnies one-liners(e.g. when he's threatening Satan ""you're a choirboy compared to me""). Also, why does Satan choose to do the ""Bond villian"" routine, and not kill Arnie when he has the chance i.e. when Arnie gets crucified. Still these are minor flaws. The movie is still filled with enough blood and gore to satisfy any gorehound. And if you're looking for a good action movie, this won't fail. Its not Arnies best, it's not his worst, but its in-between. 7 out of 10.",End of Days
95,ExpendableMan,Darker than your average action film,7,19 November 2005,"Hyped to the heavens when it first came out as Schwarzenegger's comeback movie, this 1999 film steers the Governor away from his attempts at comedy and collaborations with Danny Devito and back into the sort of action packed carnage that made his name in the first place. However, where the likes of Commando had him portraying invincible supermen with a neat array of guns and one liners to hand, End of Days is considerably darker.Set in New York on the eve of Millennium, the film shows a version of the Austrian Oak previously never witnessed. He plays Jericho Cane, an alcoholic ex-Cop in charge of a security squad who finds himself embroiled in a battle to save a young girl (Robin Tunney) from being raped by the devil (a sadly, rather ineffective Gabriel Byrne) and bringing about Armageddon. As you do.Cane himself is not the best sort of man for saving all creation either. He is mired in deep depression, has abandoned any faith in God he may have once had and when we first see him, is contemplating suicide. However, saving the girl gives him a drive and determination even when faced with some conflicting views from the Catholic Church about how best to go about this. All of this takes place in a very grim and gritty vision of New York where the rain never stops falling, urban decay is rife and pillars of steam rise from manhole covers. It is a fitting location for the end of all creation to begin and cast a dark veil over the flick.Of course, that isn't to say the film is all doom and gloom as there are a few glimpses of just how seriously the makers weren't taking their project (the argument between Arnold and Kevin Pollack in the former's apartment is hilarious). Plus, while the story and characters are all developed to match the atmosphere of impending dread during the first hour and a half, the last twenty minutes are made up of the kind of explosive action that strangely doesn't jar against the grimmer nature of the rest of the film, though the CGI devil at the climax is pushing it a little.All in all, an enjoyable romp for fans of the Governator before his attention was diverted by a political career. It compares well to his classic eighties work by trying to do something different and while it may not gel properly in places, for a good 80% of the running time it does a very entertaining job.",End of Days
96,the amorphousmachine,an average flick....,4,2 June 2000,"It was good to see Arnie back in another action film but End of Days really over-stepped the mark. The plot seemed all over the place.Arnold's acting was okay, some of the lines were bad though. Gabriel Bryne, Kevin Pollack and Robin Tunney were good in their subsequent roles. I was surprised to see Rod Stieger in this film, his character seemed to have no purpose. This film to me was a dismal cross between the Omens, Seven and Eraser....it was so hard to take seriously especially with Arnie as the lead. I think the film was kind of just riding on the hype of the whole millennium thing, which makes it kind of obsolete in a few years. I preferred the excellent Strange Days as an action flick involving the millennium new year!I'm still a big Arnold fan, and End of Days was nowhere near as bad as Batman and Robin or Junior.

A really crummy (and I mean bad beyond belief) script doesn't help this film any, and so it turns out to be little more than 2 hours of eye candy (and the scenes in between an exercise in tedium).  Even for hardcore Schwarzenegger fans, this one could be skipped and nothing much missed; OK for weekend viewing when the brain can be decisively switched off, and there are other distractions available during the ""boring parts.""  Everything here has been done before, and a whole lot better.If you're looking for something in the 'millennium angst' genre, I'd recommend the highly underrated ""Strange Days"" (1995).  If you want devils and such, there are a million others available, but try 1987's great ""Angel Heart"" starring Robert DeNiro, or even ""Fallen"" (1998).For fun special effects and not much else (oh, and to hear Ahhnold actually say 'God, help me' (LOL)) -- 5/10.",End of Days

99,fimimix,"..a sermon on ""End of Days",10,22 February 2007,"I am shocked that I found a movie with ""Arnold"" in it that I liked. I gotta comment on his physical appearance: you'll remember they never showed him shirtless, a must for him !! Only the tank-top, but if you looked very closely, you'd have seen bulges at the waistline and very thick there, too. ; plus, very sluggish in his movements. We in Hollywood have known for years that he has become somewhat of a slob in that dept. Not too hard to keep his arms in shape, I guess. ANYWAY, I really liked this movie, and I am not one for countless-excessive gunnery-fights and explosions. However, I thought they went with the movie, so I just enjoyed..... Some reviewers are aware that Arnold has a much larger acting-job - Gov. of California....What really puzzles me is, does the pope always sit in huge rooms like that, with all those lights on ? I wasn't aware of that - maybe it was because they were awaiting for everything to explode and the end of the world. I also am confused about how they planned to ""protect"" the girl (Robin Tunnry), with some divisions of The Church planning to kill her. Hmmmmm...Arnold's name in this film is quite suggestive - ""Jericho"" for the name of the pagan, walled city the invincible Israeli general Joshua conquered the pagans, and would have the protection of Arch-Angel Michael; and ""Cane"" (spell it ""Cain"" for the evil son of Adam), because he's really about to commit the ultimate sin, suicide. Yes, in places he DOES seem to have some supernatural protection against Satan (Gabriel Byrne, who played a very suave role), but how would the movie progress without it ? His immediate return to strength and brawn goes-along with that extra-ordinary ability which people use when faced with impossible odds: brute-force, lifting autos and impossible weights. Thus, he could come down from his crucifixion and become the brute he was.....some reviewer stated he asked Jesus to ""give me strength"" when he actually asked ""help me"".I loved all those rites perpetrated on the baby, but thought the snake was a bit much. I guess it symbolized Satan. A huge gap in the script from babyhood-to-twenty-year-old with the nurse being the ""jailer"" - after Mom's death? Still trying to figure-out how other reviewers don't realize that the nurse would have supernatural powers, as an agent of Hell. And, The Vatican must have a huge electric-bill - the pope was still in that same room with all the lights, twenty years later. Oh, well......and, like others, I'm wondering how Satan couldn't see inside the church, but turned-up in it. I liked Steiger's role (Father Kovak) - I think he was very believable. HOWEVER, had I been protecting the girl, I certainly would not have been upstairs... didn't you love all that electronic equipment the church had in the basement?All of this is irrelevant - I loved all the explosions and gun-fights with Satan instantaneously healing, and knew right away that ""Chicago"" (Kevin Pollack) was on Satan's side. Indeed, Satan could do all those inexplicable things, because he HAD BEEN God's right-hand man, before he was banished to Hell. Where-in-the-world was that huge room, underground, where all the final rituals took place ?? Under the theater ?I am not one to follow a certain director nor writer, but thought Hyams and Marlowe put together a good, enjoyable tale. The CGIs must have cost a fortune. Still, all this gore will not keep me from recommending this film, nor watching it again tonight, story-seeker than I am. It gets a 10 from me ......UPDATE 10/1/07): I watched ""End of Days"" again and enjoyed it immensely. Above, I wondered where that huge chamber was, when Satan was about to do dirties with ""Christine"". I've seen several docus about the huge tunnels under NYC, and now understand........",End of Days
100,Maleplatypus,Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition,5,10 July 2018,"Taking aside the whole nonsense of the story, it's a pretty watchable film film, but too Hyams (explosions, shooting, savage deaths and so on). Arnie will be good until he learns to spell ""r"" without the accent and until he stops ""being back"". Good cast, some good jokes and a dark atmosphere. And Arnie gets to be half beaten by a mid-aged lady. Also, we've finally found out where does all the oil coming from (no, not from the ground). However, Mr. Devil remains unexplained. Is it Mr. Beelzebub (CEO) himself or just an appointed high ranking manager from Hell? They also have hierarchy, you know. So, anyway: in my opinion this is one of Arnie's ""not so good"" movies, but you may watch it. Inquisition approved.",End of Days
101,bazmitch23,"Not perfect, but a fun Arnie flick. Nothing more.",7,6 February 2014,"This movie tries to combine religion mixed with an Arnold action film, but the two don't mix. They just don't. An Arnold movie is supposed to be full of one liners, action scenes and Arnold being Arnold. A religious film is supposed to be clever. We have really stupid dialogue and clichéd action scenes. Satan himself is incredibly stupid. He knows about the guard being a pedophile and Jerico's wife and daughter being killed, yet he does not know the location of where Christine is.Well, if he did, we wouldn't have a movie would we? And for some stupid reason, he doesn't kill Jerico when he crucifies him. He doesn't even hammer nails through his wrists and feet.But he can't do that, cos you can't kill Arnold. He's the hero. He has to save the world.We have some pretty bad special effects. The scene where the Albino smashes into pieces looks like a PS1 game and the scene where Satan makes love to the woman and her daughter and they morph together like a Bosch painting looks unconvincing. However, Satan himself looks okay and the scene where the Church is being destroys looks good. I actually thought they built a giant church set and destroyed it all, but it was a miniature. Fooled me.Gabriel Byrne struggles with his New York accent, to the point where he gives up and does his own Dublin accent. By the way, the scene where Satan takes over Gabriel's body, he walks out of the toilet, kisses a woman and then leaves the restaurant. We then cut to inside the restaurant where we have the woman reacting to something. We then cut to outside the restaurant as it explodes. What, did Satan put an explosive inside the woman when he kissed her? Although full of flaws, I actually liked the film. I thought it was fun. I liked Arnold being Arnold, Gabriel Byrne has fun as Satan and the scene where Miriam Margoyles kicks Arnold's ass was funny.I loved the finale in the church. I thought that scene was really effective. This film came out the same year as Stigmata which also starred Gabriel Byrne. And this film features a scene with Stigmata in it. This film also came out the same year as Dogma, which although was a silly comedy, it was actually quite clever. Kevin Smith is a religious nut and it shows in his dialogue. Between those three films, I prefer Dogma. At least it knew how to be clever in it's religion topics. The whole ""The number of the Beast is not 666. When viewed upside down it is 999, like in 1999, the year of his return"" was just..........................., I'm no expert on religion, but................... really? I know you have to come with a reason for the world ending in the year 2000, but...... I dunno. I heard that Satan comes back every 999 years. I dunno. But then again, as stupid as it sounds, it IS only a movie after all. If you're expecting a clever religious film, look elsewhere. But if you're looking for Arnold fighting the devil, this is it.",End of Days
102,basrutten,A little bit too dumb,4,17 February 2002,"Let me start by saying that I used to be an Arnie fan. I loved movies like Terminator, Predator, True Lies and especially Total Recall. But lately, his movies have been mediocre at best. This one, ""End of Days"" is no exception. I know I shouldn't expect too much of a plot in any Arnie movie (""Total Recall"" being the only notable exception) but this movie has a little too much plot holes (how does Arnie find the girl?, Why does Satan leave Arnie hanging on a cross?) and religious nonsense thrown in. Usually the action makes up for this, but in this case I also found the action sequences to bit sub-par, but that's probably because I'm spoiled by things like ""The Matrix"" or ""Face/Off"" by now. Plus, this is yet another movie in which a cop loses it after his family gets killed by gangster. Come on, I've seen at least a hundred of those. And due to the serious theme, the movie is also sorely lacking in the ""One-liner""-department.All in all, End of Days isn't terrible, but it's a lot less funny, exciting, or even well-written then nearly any other Arnie movie.

105,buzznzipp1995,Change of ways,10,7 October 2006,"Bizarre-o. Here is a truly, deeply differing role for Mr.Schwarzenegger. Darkness encompasses this story. Troubles are on all of the sides for Det. Jericho (Arnold Schwarzenegger) Peter Hyams (Director)is a brilliant director, first off. He is supreme in vision and delivery, bringing his characters and the story to proper fruition. The set up is deeper than practically everything else he has been a character in. Finding the evil prefix, seeing the signs, the coming End of Days. As the good father Rod Steiger, was absolutely believable as sort of a counseling apocalyptic, informant, with the Catholic church. He was intense and whole-heartedly right there laying it out, giving the warning, that would need much heeding. The casting for that Monsignor was perfect. I also, truly enjoyed A.S.'s performance in this film. What a departure from other characters he has played, in many years, say since the 'Original' Terminator, in 84'. A vast, city a specific evil presence. Stalking, encompassing the two investigators. A heavy menacing power, that is relentless and Hell-bent on destruction, at any price.Finding his way around and sort of being a die hard, stumbling cop/investigator. He is on the case, make no mistake, but his own personal life is Titanic proportions. He is going down if he isn't utterly careful in every step that he takes. He is on the trail tracking evil, and he is just starting to figure out the clues, that are being left behind. The Devil, is on his trail, as much as Jericho is on it's. His partner Bobby, is 'on' and little more stabling I think, but soon trouble has come like waves on a stormy ocean, overtaking. I was really set back by this one, with Schwarzenegger, showing his other acting side, he makes good on this investigation. Gabriel Byrne is excellent again, of course. I think he has a master since of his rolls, from a solid standpoint.I recommend this one for the discriminating thriller, movie fan. (****)",End of Days
106,rhinocerosfive-1,Peter Hyams + Andrew Marlowe = .666 (out of 10),1,7 November 2008,"I had been working all day out in the Inland Empire, a sort of purgatory where smog goes to fester after it's left its stain over the San Gabriels. On the way back to Los Angeles I got stuck in one of those soul-sucking Highway 60 traffic jams. So I pulled into a mall - a sure sign of desperation - and figured a multiplex had to offer two hours of something better than sitting in my car. I've rarely been more mistaken.Okay. I should have known. Peter Hyams is God's object lesson for Hollywood, a warning to be careful what you wish for: would you really want a career consistently directing the worst movies their respective stars ever made? And of course Arnold's no slouch when it comes to picking bad scripts. But the trailer had Gabriel Byrne and Kevin Pollak, who were so recently so good in USUAL SUSPECTS; plus the always apocalyptic Rod Steiger; and when was Udo Kier bad? So I was in a way rewarded. Entertainment is a relative concept; it all depends what you're looking for. As a connoisseur of bad movies, I came to appreciate this abortion, so perfectly ridiculous it's even well-named.Andrew Marlowe is the kind of writer who pits a guy with a machine gun against Satan, and has Satan lose; END OF DAYS is the kind of movie that gives the devil, as his first fleshly act... what? What's evil enough for the Lord of Flies? That's right. He cops a feel and gives somebody a nasty look. This is a Lucifer impervious to a ten story defenestration but afraid of being shot (but who then gets shot and is more worried about his clothes), whose most despicable atrocity is a threesome to a bad Everlast rap, who urinates flammable blood but has to open his own doors, who with the entire villainous world at his disposal has chosen minions as incompetent as they are disobedient, who can't find his way around Manhattan without following signs, who seems less malevolent than pissy (so easily annoyed that he pushes skateboarders in front of buses), and who is easily outsmarted by a steroid casualty whose only convincing acting job was playing a robot. Mostly it's too bad for Gabriel Byrne, one of those fine actors cursed with never being in a good movie. His touch, for some reason, perhaps in expiation of some youthful blasphemy, is absolute poison to the quality of whatever project he's in. What else? You got a good guy named Cane and a bad guy named Abel - clever, huh? You got Schwarzenegger, eating a stale-pizza breakfast shake ripped off from a Brian Bosworth movie, as the 666th incarnation of a suicidal drunken ex-cop with a dead wife and kid. Right along with it you got the heavy saying to the hero, for the 999th time, some version of ""We're not so different, you and I."" You got Rod Steiger riffing on his own ""I'm on medication"" press conferences, screaming and staggering through helpful advice like, ""Often in dreams numbers appear upside down and backwards."" Darkest of all, you got Robin Tunney giving another performance so sulfurous that she seems less likely the mother of Antichrist than the beast itself.The best part came after I crawled from the theater, got back on the 60... and into the same traffic jam. Some kinds of Hell are visited upon the earth.",End of Days
107,johnny-08,Razzie's nominations are not fair for this one,5,5 December 2007,"Hyams delivered us ""End of Days"" as some sort of smart action movie and it actually holds water for some time, but gets lost in some scenes where you ask yourself: how is this possible (like how did Steiger's character stayed alive when Satan killed everyone in that church or how it is possible to stay alive under the train). But lets put that aside. We've got a solid story and a try to make this kind of movie different from others. My favorite scene is conversation between Jericho and Satan in Jericho's flat and the whole perception of God in Jericho's life. Also, great thing was when Satan tests Jericho and when he says that he can bring his family back to life (just like when Satan tests Jesus in desert). Maybe this movie should stick more on that kind of topics, although it gives us plenty things to think about. And Schwarzenegger (great acting if you compare it to ""Commando"") and Byrne (great in some scenes as Satan) put really solid performances that doesn't deserve Razzie nomination. Although the whole movie isn't something special, it represents solid story and acting, with good ending, cause you cannot save the whole world without sacrifice (Jericho).",End of Days

It had great special effects, but the story was somewhat muddled. I'm sure it seemed like a great idea to combine supernatural themes with action, but it seemed to fail on both of these levels.  If you want a supernatural theme you are far better off seeing Stigmata, and as for action any of the older Arnie movies would be far better.  It all seemed a little pointless, and Arnie didn't have the emotional power necessary as an actor to pull off his part effectively.

I love Arnie's work, and Robin Tunney is an actress I have high regard for (though she's massively underrated). Plus, the premise seemed intriguing enough.But... sadly... this movie wasn't enjoyable at all. Not to me at least. I thought it was done in poor taste, and there was something seriously wrong with it.I was bored within the first 20 minutes, and following the film became a chore.Arnie's character in this movie isn't very likable, and neither is Tunney's. The two leads that leave you indifferent (slightly irritated even) -- not a good sign. The Devil was not particularly remarkable, either; pretty lame, to be quite frank.There were some seriously cheesy lines, too. Well, Arnie movies tend to have those, and I've never had a problem with that, but this was a bit much for my taste. It wasn't even cheesy; it was ridiculous. The movie is infested with clichés.Basically, if you've seen ANY other ""Good vs. Evil"" movie, there's nothing new here. The movie is utterly predictable and a rehash of all the other movies with the same theme.All in all... pretty disappointing. Don't get me wrong, though -- this movie is not SO bad that I'd refer to it as ""unwatchable"", but I wouldn't want to sit through it again, and wouldn't recommend it if someone asked me for a DECENT movie in this sub-genre.",End of Days
111,TheRadiobox,I hate the Antichrist I hate the Antichrist I hate the Antic,5,8 April 2021,"End of Days was directed by Peter Hyams, written by Andrew W. Marlowe, and stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Robin Tunney, Gabriel Byrne, Kevin Pollak, CCH Pounder, Derrick O'Connor, and Rod Steiger. It's about an ex-cop trying to prevent the birth of the Devil's child before the new millennium to stop the apocalypse. I'm not kidding.The Plot: For as gonzo as the premise may sound, Hyams does what he can to keep the story in some kind of reality. It's a difficult task that's been handed out and the result is mixed but it's hard to envy the job. In 1979, Christine (Tunney) is born with the mark of the devil. In preparation for this, the Pope has sent out emissaries to find her. 20 years later with only a few days left in the millennium, the Man (Byrne) is possessed by the devil and his assassination by Thomas (O'Connor), a priest, is thwarted by Jericho (Schwarzenegger) and Bobby (Pollak). What's off is that he has no tongue. Jericho has evidence that no one else does but detective Francis (Pounder) is still somehow only minutes behind. Finding more and more odd details about the circumstances and deaths with religious influence, Jericho is left to seek out Christine and once he finds her, defend her from devilish deeds with the assistance of Father Kovak (Steiger).The Characters: It's Hyams' restraint that damages the characters and outfits them with generic traits and backstories in a movie whose premise warrants more outrageous and idiosyncratic characters. Jericho is a bog-standard ex-cop and ex-believer that now has alcoholic tendencies and a sardonic sense of humor. After the death of his family he lost his faith and quit his job as a cop and to properly help Christine, he has to return to his faith. What does work about Jericho is his arc, his reactions to and actions towards seeing people so devout after his own devastation is realistic, if not entirely reasonable. Christine is similarly decent enough in that she's not sure of her beliefs for a lot of the runtime, but because of her afflictions; she's more willing to believe. Bobby is a nothing character, as is Francis. The Man is the outlet for more out-there moments, like grabbing a woman's boobs at a restaurant and urinating oil; but he still feels weak due to his lack of on-screen participation until the latter half. To call these characters a missed opportunity is an understatement.The Crime: Schwarzenegger's leading role would indicate that End of Days is an action movie. A safe bet, to be sure, but a losing bet all the same. This Schwarzenegger vehicle focuses more on the criminal element, with Jericho doing plenty of investigating and running from the devil's men and women. Criminal actions play out with banality since most of what Jericho needs to know is handed to him on a silver platter, like the location of Thomas's base that he has a piece of paper with an address on it in his pocket despite him having been in New York for 20 years. Surely he would've figured his own location out by then. Even when the script doesn't throw Jericho endless amounts of bones via his convenient placement or written notation, it fails to do much exciting with the more investigative angle outside set design anyway.The Technics: It's easy to poke holes in the story and point out the undercooked characters, but what's hard to crack is the construction of the movie. Hyams has always been a top-notch cinematographer and it shows in End of Days. He makes use of some great production design to add a fairly identifiable and dark, semi-gothic aesthetic for what could easily be (and usually is) a bland crime/thriller. The handful of action scenes that Hyams hands out don't fare as well though. There are so many moments where Jericho does something simple like throwing a punch or shooting a gun that are edited to hell (get it?) for no reason. Arnold was clearly doing a majority of his action scenes but it's still edited like there's a stunt double that needs hidden. Some of the CG compositing is obvious, not necessarily dated, but obvious because of green glows on the edges of characters. For the most part it is a good looking and good sounding movie.This deserves a remake. A remake willing to take more risks and give a unique concept a unique execution. Even casting Schwarzenegger again would work if the writing was less tepid. Still, End of Days is a competent but unremarkable crime movie with some good moments; just not enough.54/100.",End of Days

Enter the Catholic Church in search of the very special and chosen young woman who, when she copulates with Satan in the last hour of 1999, will bring about the End of Days - and Satan's rule on Earth and the destruction of all we know will occur. (I would have loved to see how the Special Effects Departments and Industrial Light and Magic would handle THAT!).Gabriel Byrne does an excellent and malevolently restrained job as the evil Satan incarnate. His pursuit of the young woman, Christine, played well by Robin Tunney, and how they run afoul of Jericho Cane - and vice versa - if the main plot of ""End of Days"", which is gory enough to be sure you leave the kids home. And leave your cell phones home too; I think we are all tired of some idiot answering a cell phone during a movie! Rod Steiger plays the priest who not only has to try to find and protect the girl, he has to try to stop other Catholics - including the cardinal of New York - from killing the girl to prevent the copulation with the Devil.At the heart of the film is how Satan can NOT be stopped by the entire Church, but can possibly be stopped by the faith, goodness, and sacrifice of one man whose transformation away from violence must happen.  But will it? No spoilers! Will good triumph over evil? It's an old but applicable theme.One of the more curious elements of the movie is how impotent the Catholic Church is against Satan: crucifixes, churches, priests, and even one cardinal can do nothing against The Prince of Darkness. Incidentally, unlike some movies and art exhibits of note which ARE Catholic-bashing, I do NOT find that to be the case here, although it came close with the cardinal intent on murder.   Some of the scenes are memorable, such as the Satanic ceremonies deep under the street of Manhattan, and the fight on the subway train which was spectacular. Many of the shots in Manhattan are well worth seeing.Elements of ""Day of the Locust"", ""The Omega Man"", ""Rosemary's Baby"", and ""The Exorcist"" all can be recognized in this film. But even if ""End of Days"" is derivative to a degree it still works.",End of Days

This film is actually more watchable than Schwarzenegger's last action film ""Eraser"", and I don't think that it is Schwarzenegger's worst film either ""Batman and Robin"" owns that distinction.

Arnie gives his best performance of career and other characters don't really matter. Satan is all powerful but in meat body.Sadly not many people are watching this and it's not popular on Netflix or prime. I had a blast on a weekend watching this with beer and fried chicken.

122,kols,Now I Know Why,10,1 December 2013,"Always been one of my favorite Schwartz movies and I've always wondered why. At best, it's a piece of meaningless fluff adding nothing to the cannon of any of it's genres (action, horror, Satan looking for an excuse for some fun). And, in many ways, it doesn't really make a lot of sense.Nor should it - it's an action movie. Except for their internal logic, no action movies make sense. The point is to get on the roller coaster and enjoy the ride.And that's where I finally figured it out - for me, at least, this is an iconic roller coaster ride. Just watched it on MAX and was a little shocked at how good an action movie it is; everything just worked, even the most ridiculous bends in physical reality (which, after all, are signature to the genre).For me, the movie just flowed, beginning to end, aided by one feature that it does not share with many movies, regardless of genre. It uses dialog only when absolutely necessary. For me, this is what raises it to the level of 'favorite'. I've always regarded film as a visual media and The End of Days tells it story visually, the script is secondary. This, by itself, endears me.All movies require some degree of Suspension of Disbelief and The End of Days is no exception but, given the usual Suspension given to action movies, it becomes a virtually flawless example of its kind and a hell of a good roller coaster ride.Likes and dislikes being what they are and being tied exclusively to the individual doing the liking or disliking, I'd simply recommend 'give it a try' within the parameters demanded by its genre. You might be surprised.",End of Days

124,Keyser Soze-12,"What's the point, it's bad",4,4 December 2000,"I really don't know why I'm writting this.  I think most people agree that this movie is bad.  Well, let me say this:When I first get done watching some movies, I like them.  Then as time goes on, my opinion changes about the movie.  this happened with End of Days. I liked it the first time I saw it.  I thought it was entertaining.  But, a few weeks later, my opinion has changed.  So, to resolve this, I watched it again at a friends house.  Well, it's bad.I'm a logic person.  If I see a logic hole in a movie, I try to ignore it. If I see two, then I start to get annoyed.  More than two and I'm p***ed off.  End of Days made me p***ed off after my second viewing.First off, the movie is a bit depressing.  Everything about it is sad. Everything from Arnold's acting to the movie's colors.  But dark looking movies don't bother me, but some thing else did...If Satan can regenerate his wounds, how can you possible kill him in his mortal form?  If you shoot him, his skin grows back.  If you cut off his head, a new one should pop back up.  So question:  what's the point of even trying to kill him?  I'll tell you why: because this is a stupid movie that has a recycled villain.

125,Michael Kenmore,Inept and laughable,2,30 April 2000,"End of Days is one of the worst big-budget action movies I've ever seen. Muddling direction, meandering script loaded with lame dialogues and gaping plot holes, rapid-fire MTV-style editing and poor acting all the way.That's not to say End of Days isn't watchable. The movie kept me interested because I found Ah-nuld's latest action flick laughably stupid for being so inept and silly when it comes to logic. Without the sense of logic the movie dies quicker, which is why End of Days deserved a huge drop of box office reception in its second week after the opening in the U.S.I won't go into the details explaining why End of Days violates the law of movie logic, but here are several problems with this movie:(SPOILER)After the Devil walks out, the restaurant explodes without any trace as to how he did it. No snapping finger, no tampered energy gas to ignite the fire, nothing. How could this happen?Arnold and his annoying sidekick Kevin Pollack somehow magically comes up with the name ""Christine York"" after examining the phrase ""Christ in New York"" carved on a victim's body, runs the database on the computer and, viola, Christine York, the only person with the exact name in all of New York City! Beyond my suspension of disbelief. How did the characters who have come in contact with Arnold's character turn against him later in the movie? I laughed out loud when I recognized the good-stepmother-turned-evil-stepmother is the same actress who played a nanny in William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet. Her ironic transition from that film to this was absolutely hilarious if you can imagine.All the mindlessly huge explosions and gunfires. What did you expect in the Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle?The Devil took a man's body comprising of flesh and blood, yet he's invisible to bullets and explosions by healing through that body. Logically, this is impossible.As the Devil demostrates the illusion in the apartment, Arnold's character runs into the solid Christmas tree that supposedly is an illusion and *falls on it* physically.The Devil is capable of punching the person's brains out and twisting a victim's head 180 degree, yet he could not kill Arnold's character as he always intends to.How the Devil's object of desire's parents died and why evil New Yorkers run after Arnold and the object of desire were never explained at all.
In the sequence that's a rip-off of Speed, Arnold and the Devil's object of desire manage to escape the subway train wreck by the short distance inside unscathed. This is beyond my comprehension, since the force would be enough to throw Arnold and the object of desire around violently and die from fatal wounds seconds after impact.Arnold suffers the brutal beating from the mob sanctioned by the Devil and put him on the cross to hang against the wall, yet the Devil forgot to take the time and opportunity to kill him for convenience's sake.At the beginning of the movie, after the Devil took over a man's body, all of a sudden Arnold is his bodyguard??? Is this a coincidence or just an example of bad editing?Arnold's recital of cringe-inducing dialogues in the particularly laughable scenes like ""YOU ARE A CHOIRBOY COMPARED TO ME!"" are the perfect fodder for MST3K, just as Eraser did with the classic line ""You're the luggage!"".The whole theory about 666/1999 is downright ludicrous. So are the pseudo-religious babble about the Christian theology involving the end of the world at precisely midnight and the fanatic killers who know the location of the Devil's object of desire. (END SPOILERS)It is highly ironic that End of Days uses the scattered profanities abusing the deity while rambling about Christian theories. The level of violence in the film is excessive and gruesome, and is therefore unnecessary to serve the plot. The director's indulgence of excess is a factor here. He surely doesn't know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of Air Force One who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money.Hence, End of Days is a worthless film with no redeeming value except for campiness -- Arnold's worst since Hercules in New York.",End of Days

If he fails, he'll have to wait another thousand years.  If he succeeds, he'll be able to bring about the end of the world.  The fate of mankind lies in the hands of Schwarzenegger himself, who must find the chosen woman before the Man does.

127,MrVibrating,Like the old days,7,30 June 2006,"There was a time when people went to the movies to be reasonably shocked, entertained and to escape reality. That time seems to have ended. Today movies are over-criticized and have to be about either mental disorders, sexual preferences, cross-dressing or preferably both or even all three to be worth anything.End of Days is more of an old-style movie. With a huge SFX budget spent on pretty cool pyrotechnics and CGI, a loud action hero(Arnie) and the devil himself on a hunt for a one-night stand, End of Days would have been a good movie in the 40's. Of course, back then it would have been banned. End of Days is brutal and non-compromising and refreshingly cliché-free for an action film.Arnold decides to act and he doesn't fail. Some scenes are borderline funny when they're not supposed to be but still, over-all, it works. Byrne(credited as ""the man"") does a smooth, suave and satisfying devil and he is pretty much the actor of the movie.SPOILER: End of Days breaks a lot of Hollywood taboos, should be considered offensive to Christians(Byrne's devil has a line you can't shake off so easily: ""When good things happen, it's His way. When bad things happen, He works in mysterious ways""), but in the end Arnold is redempted when he is forced to choose between the Holy Spirit and his M-16 with a grenade launcher, in what must be one of the weirdest scenes of 1999. END SPOILERThe budget of 80 million dollars is put to good use with the special effects, which often rocks. The visions throughout the movie are imaginative, sometimes unsettling and always satisfying. The ""strong sex scene"" described in the MPAA rating is pretty much insane. There are strong Arnie movie vibes throughout the movie for some reason, from T1 and T2 to Predator.Maybe the film-makers really believed the world would end 1999. They put a lot on risk making this movie, and IMO, it payed off. Some neat bonuses are Udo Kier, some nods to the Omen, and Arnold's hilarious accent.

I wont even discuss the last scene with Arnie but let me say, it left me holding my head in pain and other holding their stomaches.  Arnold has made some decent movies but this is not one of them.

Instead of that, I prefer to think that Arnold made a funny parody of all his main characters in one: He is strong and powerful (more than the evil himself...), he is a really good person (he ends up crucified...!), he is a really bad guy (enters a church with a firing gun in a T2 style...), he is simple and neat, and, also, as in Terminator 2, he ends up killing himself to save the world. It´s impossible to take all of this without a great dose of humor. And that´s just what I did, and it even works, folks !

Nonetheless I will.Pretty effects and a fairly evil Gabriel Byrne do not a good movie make. It takes more. First and foremost it takes a cast who believes in the story and that in turn takes a story that can be believed. Most people would find the overall plot unbelievable but that is where movies make their point. In a cinema inherently unbelievable stories can be made realistic. This is not one of those cases.As for casting, Arnold Schwarzenegger was completely mis-cast here. He has made some fairly good movies but when real acting is called for (read: emotional outbursts) he fails pathetically.

I have always had a soft spot for Arnold and action films and so I waited in rapt anticipation of the opening of End of Days.  I was not expecting Shakespeare mind you, just a solid supernatural/action/thriller.  Instead, I got this film.I don't actually know when this film went wrong.  I think it was probably at the level of screen-writing, but I can't say that the directing was all that good either.  This film was painful to watch almost from the beginning; it never built to anything... just one scene after another with no conception of flow or even continuity.  Where were the massive crowd scenes (like in Strange Days), where were the scary parts, maybe even some gore, or some moralising (this was, after all, a film based on Christian mythology).  The best way that I can describe this film is that it contained a bunch of interesting elements, but never bothered to work them together in a satisfying way.  None of the ideas ever seem to touch each other, and Arnold is left in the middle holding the bag.Also, as a side note (and I am NOT one of those sticklers who feels the need to criticise films for their lack of historical accuracy; I don't care if they use the right type of sword in Braveheart, as long as the film is good):  Why do movie makers find the need to make films about Christian Apocolyptical and then IGNORE the actual Christian ideas?  A film based on actual Christian mythology (like The Excorcist) would have been far more interesting than what  they made up for End of Days.  Christian mythology is FULL of all kinds of neat story ideas that never seem to get plumbed by the people who make these movies.... oh, well.",End of Days

So the acting is very good, but doesn't matter enough, effects and action are good but not too surprising, the script is too obvious, camera work is too traditional and uninspired and the whole movie feels soulless, too unrealistic and artificial, and in the case of this special movie often very laughable for its story background. Everything smells very well known, just as if Matrix, Blair Witch Project and all the other cool new films had never reached the cinemas.But Arnold Schwarzenegger never had done anything different, even if many of his past movies where somewhat better than this one.

Gabriel Byrne is awesome as the devil incarnate, and Schwarzenegger is again at the top of his game.  If films where demons blow up cars with their urine or attack people in churches is not your cup of tea, try something else.",End of Days
139,RestlessRust,No Revelation Here,6,30 November 2001,"""End of Days"" is not a bad movie by any means.  But it isn't a good movie either.  While we do get to witness some surprising tenderness from Arnold Schwarzenegger, who plays a Secret Service-style body guard who has (recently?) lost his wife and daughter, his accent causes his angry dialogue to seem more scripted than genuine.  Still, if that were the worst problem this movie had, I would call it a success.  But the flaws of the movie are much broader.One big problem is the predictability of the plot.  The story, which follows a woman, Christine (the movie is full of semi-symbolic names), chosen to bear Satan's Spawn (shades of ""Rosemary's Baby"") and the attempts of various non-Satanic agencies to prevent that.  And while I understand the motivations of the Christians in preventing this union, Jericho's (Schwarzenegger) reasons for doing so are not so apparent.  He doesn't believe in Satan, and Christine indicates she would probably mate with the incarnate Satan willingly, so he isn't even really preventing a rape.  And while we're on the subject of plot holes, Jericho's rescue of the man whom Satan posseses seems pointless (except as a plot device) since we later learn that Satan can use any person he chooses, not someone pre-chosen, as Christine had been.  But, of course Jericho must save him so he will be in the right place to learn about the plot.  And of course he will continue to be in the right places to stop the bad guys just in the nick of time.  And of course every time he turns a corner there will be a horde of zombies. Etc.The biggest problem, however, is the directing.  Predictability can be overcome with clever directing.  But a close-up of a sliced apple practically screams, ""Hey, something's going to happen with this,"" ruining any potential suspense.  The action scenes are also presented in a very straightforward way, keeping us constantly a step ahead of and, thus, slightly distanced from the intensity of the moment.All in all, ""End of Days"" is passable entertainment, a typical apocalyptic thriller, easily forgotten over a relatively short period of time.  There are no major theological observations or ground-breaking theories.  The movie tries for nothing more than simple entertainment value, and in that attempt alone it fails.  Just not by much.",End of Days

I guess he figured everyone would see a movie about the end of the world with the year 2000 approaching. I would have rather watched Armageddon again then this mess. Arnold fights Satan with no help from anyone religious. Arnold instead uses guns and sheer will to defeat the Dark Angel. Yeah Right!! I understand this movie is Sci-Fi, but it is totally bogus. The acting is terrible. Kevin Pollack looks like he can't wait for the scene to be over. Gabriel Bryne gives a decent evil performance, but fails in other areas due to a bad script. Robin Tunney (with short hair) is a lovely little lass, but even after she knows what's about to happen to her, she still looks confused. Why didn't they just jump on a plane and head East? The only thing that can save Arnold now is a new Terminator movie. T3 is suppose to be in the works along with True Lies 2. Jamie Lee Curtis is suppose to reprise her role. Both of these movies could be BIG for Arnold, but he must stay away from these bad scripts. Jean Claude Van Damme should have did this movie. It's more his style. In any case, stay away from this movie. Wait for it to come to video. It shouldn't be long.",End of Days

144,punctate,Good comeback for Arnold Schwarzenegger,8,27 November 1999,Arnold Schwarzenegger is back after that awful film Batman and Robin; he plays a hero this time around. Jericho Cane (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a depressed excop who must protect Christine York from Satan. Gabriel Byrne makes an interesting Satan who try's to mate with Christine York before the year 2000 starts. References a lot to the Bible story where Satan becomes free from his cage every thousand years since that is what the film is about. The film is effectively scary in some parts the rest is the action packed and gory just what I was excepting to see. The film is a complete time capsule upon itself; it will be dated by the time reaches video. I would suggest that you see this movie now otherwise this was defiantly a good comeback for Arnold Schwarzenegger.,End of Days
145,KillerLord,Not a Buyable Plot!,6,4 October 2008,"The media hyped this movie far too much. It said that Arnold, after facing all kinds of enemies in his reel life, was now ready to face his greatest enemy ever - the Satan himself. This media report did manage to create interest in the movie. One would really begin to wonder how it would be to see Arnold in a movie involving the Satan himself. And my God, is the movie shallow. The movie just fails to engross you completely. At no point of time, are we convinced about the plot and the concept. In fact, there is nothing new to this movie in the form of a story. You have a chosen one, a lady chosen by the Satan himself to bear the child that would reign hell on Earth. And then you have a guy who is capable to fighting with his heart. In the form of a Satan, you get somebody who can urinate and light a fire, someone who has sex with whoever he wants. And then you have Arnold who can fight. Look what the Devil's Advocate did to the character of the Satan. We could buy him, understand him. There is no such thing here. Heck, even Lucifer in the Constantine movie was a likable character. The Satan here fails to impress. He neither makes us feel amused nor scared. Overall, the plot of the movie is not tight. The screenplay is slow. The action is meager. Arnold simply does not fit the bill to be the one who can stand up against the Satan. You would not be losing much if you managed to not see the movie, honestly. There is nothing much here. All in all, it could have been a better movie had it not gone for its own interpretation of the coming of the Satan on earth concept. A bit more depth, perhaps, a couple of sincere references to the Satan concept and the movie could have been more appealing. All in all, not a great movie to watch.",End of Days

147,Rainfox,A show of faith,10,25 June 2000,"* * * (3 out of 5)End Of DaysDirected by: Peter Hyams, 1999
This is Arnold Schwarzenegger's alleged comeback, after almost three years of recovering from heart surgery and Batman and Robin. You decide which was worst.
Me, I have never remotely understood what the fuss was about. Schwarzenegger was and is a big stiff lacking even the most basic acting tools, who has moaned and groaned his way through so many dimwitted and expensive Hollywood vehicles that I have lost count.As an actor he leaves so painstakingly much left to be desired, that I wouldn't know where to begin. Ah-nuld, as he is lovingly dubbed by fans and critics alike, really is an institution. He's like a computer game. Like one of those `shoot-em ups´. What you get is what you expect. Every time.
So watching this movie on opening night in a cinema full of Arnie buffs (blue-collar, white males mostly) really was something of a shock. Some were boohooing sporadically after just ten minutes. Why is that? Easy. Because this movie bravely presents Arnie in a new light. He puts one foot out of his typecast cocoon  lo and behold  he gets jumped by his own fans.
Do they care that End Of Days is clearly his most original and homogenic work since the first Terminator? No, they squirmed in their seats because they wanted big brawn, lots of guns and a bunch of stupid one-liners (hasta la vista style) from the get-go.
As if they were asking: Arnold always delivered in the past, so what gives? The funny thing is  End Of Days does deliver.
It delivers, and in a much more subtle and relaxed way than any of his past movies ever did, including James Cameron favorites Terminator 2 and the overly loud, sexist and ludicrous Bond rip-off, True Lies from 1994.
The difference being that End of Days actually has an issue worth more than an abrupt macho statement and that it sets its own pace early on. It effectively blends horror and gore with straight-faced and classic Ah-nuld mega action, spiced with both humor and even adventure. While the entire recipe is old and sometimes annoying (Kevin Pollak's constant comic comments can be a strain) it never comes across tired or contrived.
Confusing as it may be (and occasionally funny: do not start to decipher either time zone logic or how 666 is suddenly 999 and thereby 1999), End Of Days seems oddly fresh throughout.This is mainly because the movie steals left and right and with such haste that you are busy lapping it all in. There are connections to many movies (most notably Rosemary's Baby, Omen, Blade Runner, Seven, The Matrix), but director Peter Hyams moves forward in his own admirable and unique style and lends End Of Days a rare continuity.Especially considering the weight he is carrying and has to balance out here, and Ah-nuld  mind  you  he's a load if there ever was one.
Has his acting improved? Not really, and his accent is still as bad as it ever was, but his engagement is loose and the focus on him is lessened, and this kind of low-key approach is very fitting.Our man is trimmed at 52, and he is still the star, sure, but backed by such an effective film-noir (some wonderful scenery of New York City) and some good sparring from Kevin Pollak, Rod Steiger and especially Byrne, he really doesn't halt the proceedings to the point where you start to get annoyed.Byrne as Satan is a steal. Once more we are reminded of past movies (Al Pacino in Devils Advocate), but his performance is both hypnotic and provocative. He also seems strangely at ease against Schwarzenegger, and the two share the movie's greatest moment. Together in Jericho Cane's (Arnie) apartment, the two engage on a verbal battle regarding faith. Great stuff indeed.A question I was armed with beforehand was: does Ah-nuld just kick the devil's butt? Does violence overcome evil? And if so I would be ready to crucify (no pun intended) End Of Days right there.That would clearly be on the terms of the old Schwarzenegger movies then. No, again the movie is well rounded. There is a whole lot of shooting going on as the devil has taken over Byrne's human body and is therefore somewhat fragile, but always with the sense of something grand and invisible lurking behind the curtains.
Subsequently the ending  a nice touch that is dished out perfectly by Hyams  is all about faith. It is about temptations and traps, about life and death, about holding ship when everything else collapses.While it may seem clichéd (a priest even goes: `It is in our darkest hour that we must show our real faith.'), End Of Days addresses an issue of faith, not necessarily in terms of Christianity nor Satanism, but one that is universal thus making the movie both somewhat poignant and rewarding.
Jericho Cane is rewarded too  so to speak. By whom or what we (luckily) never learn. End Of Days doesn't stray from the initial path. Well done.
So is End Of Days simply an apocalyptic thriller or a doomsday shootout? Well, both actually, yet it is also beautifully filmed and scored and while it has plot-holes the size of Wyoming, this Ah-nuld vehicle is frankly entertaining as hell. Pun intended.",End of Days
148,bullions27,Need less drama from Arnold...,6,30 October 2000,"Some of the moments in the movie were great, if not a bit ""freaky"", and it all involved the villain in the movie. The orgy scene between him and a mother and daughter and the way he toys with Arnold's character by recreating the murder scene where Arnold's family gets butchered; very graphic, and convincingly evil. Gabriel Byrne plays this villain, a subtle but violent when necessary Satan. Arnold plays a special unit cop with an overused storyline. Without telling to much, he's a widower now living in the dark recesses of his apartment brooding everyday and contemplating suicide. Unfortunately for Arnold, he needs to get his head back together fast enough so he can shoot and blow up whatever supernatural sh** he just got himself into. The problems I had in this film were Robin Tunney's character and Arnold trying a tad to hard to act drama. For Arnold, some moments when he goes into a lapse and flashes back to his family  I had to shake my head and turn away not in tears but in annoyance. I know what he can do. He COULD have done it with less physical emotion. I asked myself that whenever Arnold breaks down. He cranks out some good one-liners, classic, e.g. all to Satan ""I want you to go to hell."" ""You son-of-a-b****!"", but it's just those moments of drama that spoils it. Robin Tunney could have done more for what she was given, and it wasn't much besides playing a complete damsel in complete distress. Some of the lines she spouts were without conviction. I didn't believe her until way later in the end but by that time I couldn't care less for her character.I wouldn't rate this as high as some of Arnold's previous action films, but it's certainly better than Last Action Hero. The story isn't all too intelligent. How else do you fix a problem besides bigger guns?
Regardless, I'll see a new Arnold film simply because Arnold is in it. And as long as it doesn't involve him dressing up in a comic book get-up or doing family comedy, he's got my money even if it turns out mediocre like End of Days.",End of Days
149,padiyark,"Not a bad movie for a rent, but definitely not a movie for theatres",5,30 April 2002,"In short, this was a mildly entertaining flick.  Arnie tries to act, and does a reasonable Job.  Gabriel Byrne does the devil schtick, but almost reminds me of Al Pacino's John Milton.  The plot runs amuck when we see the devil destroying so many things with a flick of the wrist, but yet does not destroy Arnold.  There are so many situations where Arnold is let go by the devil, you almost wonder if the devil is as cunning as he appears to be. Otherwise, decent action scenes.  Not your best religious thriller, but ok if you can get it at your local library.",End of Days
150,MadReviewer,`End of Arnold' Would Be More Appropriate,4,5 May 2001,". . . or the beginning of the end, anyway.  I'm sure that Arnold Schwarzenegger will continue to pump out a few more crappy action movies in the next couple of years (`The Sixth Day', and God forbid, `Terminator 3'), but his heyday is over.  `End of Days'  certainly doesn't demonstrate anything innovative -- or for that matter, good -- to indicate even a slight hope of positive things yet to come.`End of Days' is about the quest of a man named Jericho Cane (Schwarzenegger), who's seeking to stop the Devil (Gabriel Byrne) from impregnating his unwitting, chosen mortal bride (Robin Tunney) and creating Armageddon, or the End of Days.  When it comes right down to the nitty gritty, the story isn't any more complicated than that.  Unfortunately, weird explanations involving the Church, sects of Vatican Knights, prophecies, and other jumbled up pieces of nonsense keep getting injected into the story to foul things up.  Add that to many never-satisfactorily explained plot holes (if Arnold's part of a privately owned security agency, and not a government agency, how come he's allowed to wield so much firepower without anybody batting an eye?), and the story's nothing but an incoherent mess.  It actually would've been better if `End of Days' had pared down its moronic story and jacked up the action and violence -- at least there'd be a lot less nonsense to explain.  The movie almost comes across as though some executive had an idea for a movie:  Arnold versus the Devil . . . and then used some Mad-Libs style mechanism to create the necessary script for shooting the film.  The action's okay, but nothing great, and certainly not enough to make up for the long, boring stretches of dumb dialogue and aimless story.As Jericho, Arnold Schwarzenegger's supposed to be an alcoholic suffering a crisis of faith, a very complex character . . . and that becomes the problem.  Arnold's classic action heroes aren't complex, they're simple-minded macho men with a hatred of evil and a penchant for violence. `End of Days' needs a simple guy to take on the Devil and beat him to a pulp -- instead, the hero is this supposedly complex guy who doesn't garner much pity from the audience, and ultimately is very uninteresting and unsympathetic. As Christine York, Robin Tunney is a pretty face with nothing to do, which is a shame, because the character has lots of potential. Christine has the `gift' of seeing visions, but instead of the visions actually being useful -- such as seeing into the future, or providing insight into what's going on -- they only produce cool but useless images of evil-looking things.  Heaven forbid such a gift might be used to propel the story in an original direction.  Gabriel Byrne's Devil chews a lot of scenery but is ultimately all flash and no substance (and surprisingly incompetent).  Kevin Pollack as Chicago is perhaps the only saving grace of the film -- he's funny, and he actually moves the plot along in slightly intelligent ways -- but he's not in the film enough to redeem it, or to even make it mildly entertaining.If you're in the mood for a good Schwarzenegger action flick, rent `Predator', or `Total Recall'.  `End of Days' stinks, to put it mildly.  Do yourself a favor and avoid this piece of insipid nonsense.  Grade: D+",End of Days
151,superboy478,666 is probably the number of times I've mentioned End of Days,7,3 May 2002,"I personally found End of Days to be a mediocre movie. The audience hadn't seen Arnold Schwarzenegger do a movie in 2 years and I bet they were looking for a heroic and super come back.The movie begins in Vatican City during the year 1979 where the Pope is explaining to his people how the unborn female child of the New Year will grow up to carry Satans child. He also explains to them that she must live and not be harmed. Then, the movie cuts to ""6 hours later"" in New York City where a woman is having her child in the hospital. Now what freaked me out about that scene was that the nurse who delivered the baby works for Satan. When she claimed that she was going to clean the baby up, she actually takes it downstairs to the basement and has a Satanic priest do a ritual by cutting a rattle snake open and using its blood to expose the child to evil. I found that to be in poor taste.20 years later in New York, just a few days before New Years Eve, there is a brief sequence where Satan rises from the sewers of the city and posesses a man (Gabrielle Byrne) and his body. Next, the unexpected happened. We see Arnold for the first time in a long time. He plays a stressed out security guard who's wife and daughter were killed on Christmas Eve. He and his partner (Kevin Pollack) arrest a former priest who has a cut out tounge. He claims that the end of days will occur on New Years. He also tells them about a GIRL named Christine York (Robin Tunney) who is Satans chosen one, the priest says that if Arnold and Kevin don't protect her, she will cause the destruction of earth.I think I've said enough about this movie and I think that they should have made Arnold's character more heroic and stronger than what they did.

154,Yonhap S,A wasted potential. Tsk!,4,7 January 2000,"This could have easily been a very good Arnie film, but I, like my friends, felt that the film's potential was wasted with very poor direction.  End of Days plays itself as a truly serious film yet the plot and its development doesn't allow us to take it seriously.  The characters are all not very developed.  I couldn't care Robin Tunney's situation of living for the past 20 years dreaming of making love with Satan.  Arnold plays the kind of broken hero that usually suits Bruce Willis, and he plays it well, too bad the script degenerates and doesn't allow further exploration.  The writers could have played up the Faustian deal some more by not making Arnie's character, who's supposed to have a lost faith in God, into a totally determined ""say no"" guy from the beginning.  Instead some silly stuffs have to crop up and taken seriously (and executed ineffectively) like the truth about 666.  Also plot developments happen and then never explained especially how is it that Thomas Aquinas could talk without his tongue.  The climax is obviously shoe-horned so that it is faith that will eventually defeat the devil.  Earlier in the movie, it is mentioned that the devil will choose a particular mortal to take over and only that mortal can impregnate Robin Tunney.  The movie Armageddon also had huge gaping plotholes, but at least the movie was fun.Gabriel Byrne's performance of Satan having a talk with Arnie is one of the highlights of the film.  It was a good scene although it begs comparison with a similar (and better) scene found in The Devil's Advocate. 
The verdict: 2 of 5 stars.  I can't believe I enjoyed this less than Wild Wild West.",End of Days
155,GluStick,Very great movie. I'm sick of people saying that it sucks.,9,19 December 1999,"How can you not like this movie? It has tons of f/x, funny lines, amazing action sequences, and all the rest. Not to mention, Arnold Schwarzenegger back on screen. I thought that it was one of the best of the year and the best century flick out. It's actually the only one out but oh well. This is ten movies in one. The plot is cool. Satan comes to town and searches for his bride. The role of Satan is played pretty good by Gabriel Byrne but I would've liked him to be a bit more wild but I guess that's how Satan is though. Just really messed up but keeps his cool. I remember seeing the trailer and being so blown away that I just could not wait for it to come out. I thought the thing with the all the church benches fliping over was amazing. I didn't even see it until about a week ago. What I saw made me want to battle the devil too. The action was so huge and Arnold was so cool with all those guns but the end was just a little disappointing. I was there was more gun-fire at the end. I did find the end a little sad. I won't give anything away but it's not exactly your typical Schwarzenegger ending. I also thought Arnold did a great job. He was very good and more human and I like that in action movies such as Die Hard and Daylight where the hero is like you and me. I just love this movie so much and I am really mad at everyone who didn't like it. Come on, this may be the last Arnold action movie. Enjoy it while you can. If you haven't seen it yet, go now. It has great f/x. I loved the train sequence. Also, the battle at the end was a great pyrotechnic scene. The soundtrack just intensifies the mood. I loved the new song from Guns N' Roses called Oh My God. It just clicks and makes this a huge actionfest and gets that end-of-the-world feeling down right. It feels like Strange Days or something.

156,robsellke,"Unnecessary graphic violence, some poor acting, but interesting story and some good segments",5,24 July 2000,"I've never really been a fan of Schwarzenegger, and ""End of Days"" doesn't really change my opinion.  Arnold plays Jericho Cane, a present-day New York security agent who's family has been murdered and lust for life has been squandered.  One day he is doing a routine security job for a wealthy Wall Street banker (Gabriel Byrne), when all of the sudden, a man starts shooting at the banker from a fire escape.  The assassin turns out to be a tongue-less, crazy priest, desperate to get away from the security agents. He later turns out to be a semi-good guy who was trying to rid the world of the Antichrist, who'd infected the body of the banker.  Now this scene doesn't make sense for several reasons, in that, even if the priest had shot the banker, he wouldn't have died, because he can't be killed by any weapon, even holy objects.  Also, why would a simple Wall Street banker have gun-toting security agents clearing the way for him like he was the President?  Anyway, Saten is back on Earth for a few days, right before the turn of the Millennium, to find a woman to impregnate and bear his child. This would mean the end of the world as we know it, and that's why the priests don't want this.  Jericho finds this ""chosen"" woman before Saten does, and he tries to protect her.  The movie leads up into about fifty different climaxes at the end and left me feeling rather bored, not exhilarated.  Anyway, the movie is predictable, violent, graphic, and unintelligent, but for a Schwarzenegger film, it wasn't half bad.  I gave it a five out of ten for some decent scenes and a somewhat interesting plot.",End of Days
157,L. Lion,unoriginal dreadfulness,3,19 January 2001,"Arnold Schwarzenegger has (quietly) been on one of the losingest of losing streaks that any major star has had recently. Eraser, Batman and Robin, and then End of Days were all among the ten worst movies of their respective years (with B 'n R carrying the honors for 1997 in a Battlefield Earth-style runaway). Compared to the above, The Sixth Day was a major comeback.End of Days manages dreadfulness in any number of ways. The script is littered with cringe-inducing lines (including several scenes with the pope in Rome closely following the situation as if he is getting the half-inning reports on a baseball game). The action scenes are witless and unimaginative. Schwarzenegger is hopelessly miscast as a suicidal ex-cop who has lost his faith. A man with his ego has no understanding or feeling for what loss feels like, and it comes through in his performance in every scene, most notably when he is a)about to commit suicide and b)regaining his faith in God. Peter Hyams' direction seems to call for the draining of urgency or drama from any scene, and none of the cast shine. Robin Tunney is especially empty as the hapless vessel upon which Satan's lust will be vented, but Kevin Pollak is also miscast in the Tom Arnold role. Only Rod Steiger manages any degree of dignity as a priest who is able to quietly provide exposition.The plot? In 1979 a baby girl is born under the Eye of God (a full moon with a brow caused by a comet). As everyone knows, this means that she is meant to mate with Satan on the eve of the millennium and then bear the antichrist. This nooky (it is later explained) has to occur between 11 PM and Midnight on December 31, 1999 EST.Fast forward to 1999, December 27. In a chic eatery investment banker Gabriel Byrne is tracked down by a transluscent flying beasty that has emerged from the sewers followed by a series of gas main explosions (if you missed these explosions while in the popcorn line don't worry - there will be at least 20 more). The beasty is of course Satan, who takes possession of Byrne in the bathroom. Coming back out, he kisses and gropes a female diner (her husband goes 'Hey!') then walks out of the restaurant, which promptly explodes (told you so). Satan, in Byrne's form, will then contact his loyal followers in Manhattan, of whom there are thousands based on the number of extras that will later be dispatched. The Satan worshippers don't seem particularly bright - one of them is stepmother to Tunney's Christine, and it still takes Satan three days to find her. Satan displays his mercurial displeasure with them by doing things like punching through their heads. He also gets to bang their wives and daughters together, in what this movie presumes is shocking eroticism. It's not, not in this movie.So how does Arnie get involved? He's playing a security guard hired to protect Byrne/Satan when a mad priest tries to cap Byrne. He tracks down the priest's lair and puts two and two together by means of the screenplay. Why he would be interested as a rent-a-cop is beyond me, but sidekick Kevin Pollak doesn't question it, which in this movie is enough.In any case, Arnie winds up shepherding Tunney from the bad guys and the bad good guys (a sect of Roman catholic priests called the Vatican Knights who want to kill her and her unborn baby before she can be impregnated, certainly against the Pope's views on abortion). Of course, in the meantime he will be challenged by the devil, lose the girl, cap off a lot of people, be involved in explosions, and get crucified. Somehow, the police are fortunately not around when all this fun is happening.The biggest failing in all this witlessness is the portrayal of Satan. Byrne isn't compelling, but he doesn't have much of a chance given the mechanics of the script. Satan's approach to finding his bride is pretty much like that of the terminator - just keep looking and killing the people in your way. Nowhere does the film give Satan the benefit of knowing all men's weaknesses, powerful charisma, Satanic cleverness, an ability to dodge bullets or kill Arnold Schwarzenegger just by wishing it was so. Satan is supposed to be virtually omnipotent - I mean, the guy is fighting God, right? One rent-a-cop should be a laughable matter. But not for this Satan. Want to get away from him? Fill him full of holes and then peel out!I thought Eraser was the worse movie, but this one is simply a dumb reason to blow things up in a very unoriginal way. If you have to have your antichrist, Stir of Echoes, Stigmata, or Lost Souls will all do you better. If only Robert De Niro's Louis Cyphre could have shown up - the whole plot would have been over in 15 minutes.",End of Days

I am not saying that they were all great, but I liked the action he provided for a movie.The story line seemed a little too typical for this type of movie. You have an ex-cop who lost his family to a bunch of bad cops. He wants to die. He is a heavy drinker. Now working as a security agent, he somehow gets wrapped up in an investigation that deals with the protection a girl from Satan. Anyone in their right mind would know how this movie was going to end.This was a very different direction for the type of work Arnold has previously done, which in a sense is good. Rather than doing all his films as someone who is always so sure of himself. He takes the part of a ""drunken ex-cop"", who is angry at the world and would rather die than go on.

161,Lumpenprole,"meh, but good for some giggles",2,6 November 2002,"spoilers - I'll always remember this film for having the quickest punishment-of-a-woman-for-enjoying-sex scene that I've ever seen in a horror film.  Usually an obligatory woman has sex early in the film and then is run down and killed by the monster somewhere in the middle.  Playing Satan on earth, Gabriel Byrne's first dastardly deed is to tongue wrestle and grope a woman in front of her dining companion in the middle of a crowded restaurant.  There's a second of her appearing aroused as Byrne walks off and then the next shot is of the entire restaurant being consumed by a fireball as Satan nonchalantly moves on.  Too bad the rest of the film doesn't go in for that sort of brevity.This is one of those movies that has a lot of exposition, but probably would have been much better without any at all.  End of Days basically does a time-out intermittently so characters can explain to Arnold what the point of the next scene is or who so-and-so was.  And the explanations make the plots of 70s/80s satanic horror films like The Omen and The Prince of Darkness sound lucid and downright scholarly.  At one point Arnold doubtfully asks if the apocalypse is really scheduled to account for Eastern Standard Time - for a brief second the movie seems to giggle at it's own absurdly inadequate end times scenario, but then earnestly dives right back into explication as meaningless as star trek technobabble.I had a bad feeling when I first saw Se7en that Finch's effective use of urban dark and decay was going to influence a lot of people to make a lot of movies where characters seemed to be stumbling around the in the dark for no reason.  End of Days is one of those films.It's a bad action film that runs long cuz some stale horror movie cliches got shoehorned in.  Or is it the other way around?  It's not scary and the action is so-so, so it fails on two levels.  Byrne is okay.  Arnold isn't different from any of his other films (does anyone really want him to be?), but in this movie you have to put up with the tremendous poor taste (or sacrilege I guess) of seeing him going through the motions of being a Christ figure.  He's even crucified, in case the J.C. initials failed to tip everyone off.",End of Days
162,jtwcosmos,End of Days (1999),8,8 June 2011,"""They relax me. You want one?""""No thanks. I drink.""This is the story of how the world ended. Almost. It is the story of people coming together in unlikely circumstances, joined in a fight to stay alive and sane (even if for some of them it may be too late).The movie starts with the main character pondering whether he should do what the title says, right there. That would have been original! And probably would have satisfied a lot of the people who didn't like the movie one bit. At all.The start is fast paced, full of characters, it is thrilling and intriguing, strange things are happening everywhere. Strange things that almost go unnoticed, in all the commotion that surrounds one of the most important events in recent history: the beginning of the new millennium.The actors do a great job, in my opinion. I mean... it's Arnie... what did you expect, Shakespeare? And he is good, actually. Very good. Gabriel Byrne is convincing, without being too obvious, Robin Tunney is good, and Kevin Pollak is annoying.The visual effects are great, there are real fires and real explosions (and there are a lot of them). The music is a mix of church music and hard rock (or something), a bit repetitive, maybe.The direction is good, all actors do what they're supposed to, in order to create a full picture. On the downside, the camera work is not all that mind blowing, but it has it's moments. The lighting is good and the sets are big. No complaints there.The story is a bit strange and a lot of people complain for it being childish, but I found it entertaining. I only hated that they eliminated one of the characters very quickly, taking away one dimension that was important for the entire feel of the movie. Plus they couldn't decide if this was a horror movie or not. There is some gore, but very light, and there are no scary moment.End of days. A good action movie. 8/10.",End of Days
163,kevin-167,Spectacular special effects can't makeup for muddled storyline,6,15 December 1999,"This is one movie that has some very impressive visual effects that will blow you away. The story and acting however, are another story. Robin Tunney is obviously a limited actress and shows it. For most of the movie she runs around hysterical and, as a viewer, you almost wish her character would bite it. Kevin Pollack is wasted in a thankless supporting role. Arnold is still Arnold, but he doesn't have much of a script to work with. Gabriel Byrne is awesome as ever. He plays the part of Satan perfect with an evil cunning that makes you wonder how evil can seem so cool. At times the story was confusing as you are left wondering who was who when they switch from one time setting to another. I still do not understand that when ""evil"" is supposed to take over at midnight, it is only midnight is that one city. Did the prophets prophecy that it would happen at Midnight Easter Time?

I'm taking about the brutal violence and overall tastelessness of the movie (Arnold starring in it makes it all the more awesome). No, I'm not a degenerate fiend or anything, my point is with all the brouhaha over Columbine and all the apologists and hardline conservatives blaming the entertainment industry and trying to advocate change in what we see, what we hear, and how we think, this movie spits in their face and does it's own thing. You can't change an already jaded society with a capitalist mentality and where MTV has replaced the need for parents. So let the blind lead the blind and the able-minded will strive. Hyams fuels this fire beautifully. To all you people who whine ""oh man, the plot sucked blah blah blah"", all I have to say is if you couldn't tell from the previews that the story was a tough act to follow to begin with, you need some serious self-evaluation. This film is meant to be enjoyed for it's sight and sound and ever so classic one liners from God....er, Arnold. So stop tearing it up for nonsensical reasons and don't be so wishy-washy when it comes to big budget films!Rating: a much deserved 10/10",End of Days
165,Workin_Man,I Was Surprised,8,25 February 2006,"When I first saw this movie, I was surprised. It was a lot better than what I had been lead to believe. This is a truly moving film. I believe in god more than I used to. This movie has influenced me. I am very glad I saw it and I know you will be too.End Of Days is about a creature known as Satan. He has come to New York inside of a man's body in search for a girl. If he finds this girl and mates with her between 11:00 pm and 12:00 am on Dec. 31, 1999, Satan will be released into the world and the world as we know it will cease to exist. It is up to a cop named Jericho Cane to stop Satan from finding this girl and saving the world from the wrath of Satan.This is a well made movie that I definitely recommend to anyone who believes or is fascinated by this type of stuff. If you are a believer, then you should see this movie at some point in your life. If you are not a believer, I still think you should see this movie because I believe it will make you believe in god and have more faith. It really moved me, and I believe it will move you in some way or another.The verdict: This is actually a very well made film that will at least help you believe in god and faith.8/10",End of Days

It has a little bit of True Lies (Arnold, an aviation chase, and a likable buddy), Terminator (trying to save the innocent ""chosen"" woman from the unstoppable evil guy). Unfortunately, it's only about as good as those other thrillers with supernatural encounters in the NYC subway tunnels, Ghostbusters 2 and Mimic.An hour into it, when I was fighting every urge to head for the lobby, a little humor started creeping into it and it became a bit more watchable.

167,Psycho Mantis,Arnold can do much better!,6,23 October 2001,"The movie with they year´s coolest title turn out to be a bit of disappointment for us Arnold-fans, and not the big comeback I hoped for. Here he plays an ex-N.Y. cop on the verge of going insane, after a terrible incident some time ago, when his family was brutally murdered. Against his own will he is dragged into a problem that contains a thing as simple as the end of days. The Devil comes to N.Y. at New Year´s Eve 1999 to find his bride, and if he succeeds with impregnating here before the new millennium arrives, the world will go under. Why? I don´t know, the movie didn´t really explain that part.The critics weren´t really nice to Schwarzenegger and his movie when it came out, but it´s not all bad. It contains some decent effects, lots of action and a rather good performance by Arnold. It´s a very dark film, in the same spirit as ""Se7en"" for example, when the whole world seem to be going downhill. Is it really worth saving? Unfortunately, the movie doesn´t really treat this subject that much, because Arnold´s character doesn´t really want to save the world since he is so depressed himself. The Devil reminded me a bit about Arnold´s nemesis in ""Terminator 2"".  He is impossible to kill and just keeps on going, even if you shoot him numerous times. The difference is that the Devil and Gabriel Byrne aren´t half as cool as T-1000 and Robert Patrick were in T2. It feels a bit like Arnold´s trying to repeat the successful formula that was T2. But ""End of Days"" is nowhere near the classic James Cameron-epic. Schwarzenegger tried to make his comeback with the science fiction ""6th Day"" instead, and once again he didn´t succeed. Even if that movie is definitely underrated and far better than this, but that´s not the case here.
""End of Days"" is okay, but not more. Arnold can do much better!* * ½",End of Days
168,kidwltm,At least it tried...,4,7 July 2003,"Throughout watching ""End of Days"", I got the sense that the film makers were perhaps trying to make this unique to the average Hollywood action film. They failed, of course, but you have to give them credit for trying. Peter Hyams actually tried directing this time, instead of just churning out another flat action film.  He attempted to inject atmosphere into the movie by darkening the lights and adding tons of blood.  This method can work if used correctly (see ""Se7en"") but here it just feels like a cheap trick to try and scare us. Hyams is a decent action director, and offers nothing more here than basic shoot outs and fight scenes, except for the lackluster, sub par f/x end ""battle"". As a photographer, Hyams demonstrates actual ability, displaying some good frame work and movement, but it is nothing above solid work.Screenwriter Andrew Marlowe is the film's greatest enemy.  At parts, the script actually shows the makings of good religious thriller, and at times it even shows some quasi-intellectual thought (the Temptation scene between Arnold and Gabriel Byrne), but these small pluses are choked out by a river of negatives.  Generic dialogue/characters, gapping plot holes, and convenient plot points that just happen to point all the characters in the right direction are just a few of the standard Hollywood black holes Marlowe's screenplay falls into.  The shadow of the good movie it could have been faded very quickly.The film surprisingly has a good cast.  Arnold, still possessing that larger than life attitude, tries to play a depressed, on the edge cop with no more than average results.  Stick to be the invincible hero Arnie, it's what your good at.  Gabriel Byrne is the strong point of the ensemble, bringing a nice air of cynicism to the role of Satan.  In a villainous role ripe for overacting, Byrne restrains himself and it adds a bit more menace to the character.  Kevin Pollak, as normal, is able to bring at least a few chuckles to the movie, but he's done better.  Also look for a stellar small role from Rod Steiger.Hyams looked like he was trying to separate this from the faceless mass of Hollywood action films.  He was heading in the right direction, but had neither the script or originality to take it there.4/10",End of Days

Yes, I know a lot of people dumped on it but they either took it too seriously or have an illogical hatred of Schwarzenegger.  Sure, the plot wasn't that great, but it's an action movie you're not supposed to focus on the plot.  And yes, Schwarzenegger can't act, but neither can Keanu Reeves yet he has attained a statues akin to a demi-god among American movie watchers (I don't get it).

 Moreover,Arnie's character is so unlikable that I was starting to root for Satan. When the movie ended, most of the audience (including myself) left disappointed. My pick for the worst movie of 1999.",End of Days
171,Xex-Arachnid,there's redemption for this movie yet,5,29 August 2006,"When I had first seen this movie I hated it, I thought it played part in Arnold's down going career as an actor.But 6 1/2 years later, I seen the movie again with different eyes and a fresher perspective.If you take out all of the Millennium hype surrounding the movie (which at that time, if you remember people was swinging off of the Y2K jockstrap which I thought was cheesy then)and the Catholic overtones, you have a great movie.It's a dark movie, with dark overtones, and the one thing that actually scared me was not the devil and his tricks but his followers because if you remember, they were never really shown (except for those few police officers and hospital attendants). They were just a bunch of silhouettes and subconsciously that says to me that you really will never know who's a true devil worshiper.Out of all places, Satan choose to bust out a fault pipe in NYC for some prophetic coochie, or rather the stars which were aligned for such events to take place.Gabriel Bryne was an excellent devil and so was the Governator's role as 'Jericho', the half suicidal cop who marinates himself at night with hardcore boozing.There are always three things that always annoys me with these types of movies and that is:1. Why is it, that the Catholic church (one of the most corrupt organizations or religious institutes) has to be the all knowing authority on demons and devils? 2. Do you ever notice that Hollywood always try to add more sinister-ism to devils, demons and other infernals by making them so horrible and powerful, that their victims have no will of their own? Case in point: Gabriel Brynes character has no choice to be the vessel for the devil because the alignment of the stars makes this so.and 3. despite annoyance #2. the good guys always win, and purity prevails although some possessed person has to die through it.But if you take out those 3 things, you have a good movie.One of my favorite scenes is when one of the priest flings forth a big silver crucifix telling the devil to get back before the devil takes the cross and jams it through his skull.One of things that are left for me to chew on is since (in this movie) every thousand years the devil gets to leave his hell to do nasty with some virgin maiden, that means 1999 wasn't his first time, nor will it be the last, and I don't know about you but if I'm locked up for a thousand years looking forward to only one day of freedom, then please believe I would have a full proof plan in succeeding my goal.In summary, with the dark overtones and the relevant filth and corruption of humanity, it would of been more climatic if the devil did get to impregnate the girl. And on that thought, I give this movie a 5 rating now instead of a six-sorry.",End of Days
172,greenforest56,"Almost, but not quite",7,22 December 2008,"This movie could have been better than it was. For the first ¾ it was a good picture, depending more on drama than action. But the last third it decided to become 'Die Hard  with a Vengeance 2"". If they had shortened this some what it would have stayed a very good picture. I guess the film makers felt they had to go BIG because we were, after all, fighting the Devil. Unfortunately, this was their undoing. It became just too much: too graphic, too violent. And this was unnecessary because they had done a good job of establishing the evil of Satan previously. Turning Schwarzenegger into a Christ figure was a stretch, to say the least. The profanity, such as it was, added nothing to drama, character, or conflict. It, too, was unnecessary. Also, if you know anything about theology, well, let's just say you'll do a little squirming in your seat. But then, Hollywood has never been too interested in theology.. just utility.Lastly, although a good idea, Jericho's story of struggle, redemption and salvation didn't quite work  too dramatic. Some very good themes here. Good solid writing, especially, the one liners. The film makers almost made it, but, they just went a little bit over the top  and dropped the ball.Still, a good picture worth watching, just disappointing because, with a little restraint, it could have been much better.",End of Days

This burned out boozer with a three days beard would be better left to Bruce Willis in ""Die Hard 4"". The plot is very good, if you are smart enough to understand the logic. For instance, why was the comet above the moon only noticed by the priest at the Vatican? Such a big comet should have been oserved by astronomers several months, if not years, before it reached that size. Answer: because it was not a physical phenomenon, it was a vision, revealed only to that particular priest. And so on, films about religion or the occult have their own kind of logic, and I think this one has a very coherent logic. But it's definitely not a Schwarzenegger film, I would put Bruce Willis as the hero and Nicholas Cage as the Devil.",End of Days

The movie was quite dark, it didn't live up to the hype, but then again there wasn't heavy promotion for this so i guess it was a smart idea so then it might do better.

No devastating Y2K virus, no second coming of Jesus. No Satan returning to rule/destroy the world. This movie explains why; because when the Devil did show up, Arnold fought him off with a collection of machine guns and rocket launchers.That's the premise of this film, anyway, and it depicts the Devil escaping Hell per a prophecy that says he will be free at the end of 1000 years. Satan inhabits the body of actor Gabriel Byrne, a good choice because the man is indeed talented and plays the character with a certain smugness that I imagine the Devil would have. The cast overall is very good, including Arnold as the stereotypical ""lost his faith"" cop and Robin Tunney as Satan's virgin sacrifice.The movie never really makes clear what will happen if Gabriel Byrne manages to 'consumate' his relationship with Robin Tunney; just a few vague references to a lot of people dying and what the Devil calls a 'New Beginning.' Needless to say, this is not a movie you should see for the plot.If you do see it, see it to watch some reasonably entertaining good-versus-evil action with Arnold in full action hero mode; if you take it as that and not too much else you're in for a good enough time.",End of Days

179,icelandknight,Disappointing movie about Armageddon.,2,20 January 2002,"""End of Days"" was a HUGE disappointment to me. It starts like it could be a great movie, I mean, it stars Arnold Swazenegger (?spelling) How could it flop?Well, for one, the leading character's motivation lacks purpose. First, he's about to commit suicide, then that negative angle of his personality is completely scrapped... and the new motivation is often totally unfounded. He doesn't believe in God, yet is ready to believe there might be a connection between what's going on and the Bible! After reading what is referred to as a ""football score"", he immediately gets the connection to a verse in the bible, which he finds straight away, or course? Of course: UNLIKELY! There is a bit of excitement while the tongueless priest /assassin is being chased and a hint of the atmosphere in ""Seven"" or ""NBC's 'Profiler'"" as they go through Tongueless's living quarters... and find his tongue in a jar.Throughout the movie, as expected, Arnold, unfortunately, too often has that unconvincing look of fear on his face. It's like that OVER-USED mouth gaping in most kid films. Actors these days just seem to have that ""fear face""... but it gets tired and unconvincing when you've seen it umpteen times. One can imagine the director: ""OK, Arnold, now do the scardie face!"" CUT! That's a wrap. The movie also unashamedly tries to portray Arnold's character as some sort of Chirst figure, crucified (for a bit) downtown by the devil crowd... All this without establishing the character as THAT kind of character.It's seems directors, in increasing numbers, have forgotten that the audience need to have a reason to admire a hero, pity him or sympathyse with him... There is no character building taking place in this movie. - OK, we get a little pathetic glimpse at him moping and grunting over a music box, but you can't base a whole character around ONE concept... as I said, the characterization is, at best, SHALLOW.Even the sequence of events is poorly built up. With no reason or buildup, alone, the head priest just pops up and saves him off this cross. No-one comes to tell the priest where he has been seen, the priest just conveniently pops up to save him. I felt this was a bit too much. Especially, after seeing Arnold's character dangling, a-la Jesus, and the priest is made to cross himself! - As if Arnold's character has suddenly become some kind of ""Saint"". That's something this movie can't make him... They never do the background, how can they expect us just to swallow a half baked potato!In this movie they never really establish any real motivation, just portray a chain of events. I felt myself saying ""WHY!!!"" when suddenly Arnold's character starts reading the wall of an obviously insane priest... and even less plausible, starts looking for a girl who's picture he finds in a jar in the priest's fridge. COME ON! - Why would he! What about his JOB? He gets ONE assignment in the start of the film, then what? Is he unemployed again? Who is paying for his time to research WHY the priest tried to shoot a Wall Street Banker? Who asked him to? This is an example of how a lot of little missing pieces render this film irritatingly boring to thinking people. I expect then, it was probably made for the ignorant many?Considering the powers they hint that the villain has (the devil), that villain makes absolutely NO use of these powers! At one point he's bending reality, at another point he's just walking in a threatening way! Why not bend reality WHILE walking in a threatening way! and just capture the girl he's after! It's ridiculous... About as ridiculous as the GIANT devil in the movie ""Spawn"", close enough to crush Spawn but saying to his army of little guys ""Get him!"" instead of just crushing him, himself! Duh! If it was just one time, fair enough, maybe the villain is as stupid as the director thinks the audience is, but one gets the feeling they purposely make him fail just to drag the movie on... and on.About as ridiculous is, when Arnold's character has witnessed what little damage normal weapons do to this villain... he still has that scene where he goes down to the place he is supposed to ""work"" (but this is never established in the film) and arms himself with all sorts of weapons and ammo (complete with the typical military background music, and he doesn't have to answer to anyone about it! Convenient & ridiculous!): exploding bullets, rockets, handguns, pump action bazooka, more ammo, more weapons, etc. Who are these for? Killing off innocent civilians who can't help themselves but follow a more powerful person? - Is this our hero? - Who's out to kick ass cos his ass got kicked? Is this what they think a ""Jesus"" type hero would do? - in the middle of a ""religious-type"" of movie, and after establishing this villain is WAY beyond being blown up, this scene was VERY out of place.For me, the whole movie was like this. Shallow, considering the subject matter (and $ wasted!!!), predictable plot, with no unforeseeable twists, obvious and pathetic attempts at symbolism which was very out of place in this movie. Shallow characters with NO credible motivation to take on what they did. A powerful villain rendered impotent at convenient times... This movie had so much potential... but was probably hampered by executives? - It leaves one asking: How come movies aren't DEEP anymore? How come millions of dollars are being wasted on crap like this? Have the directors of movies today ever seen any GOOD movies and examined what makes them GOOD movies? I propose lots of trips to film schools. Quite frankly, with the amount of experience of the people involved with this movie, I expected a better film.",End of Days

He didn't play his self confident, all powerful super-hero like usual. Instead, he was a lot more fragile, both mentally and physically. This seems to be the right direction for Arnold, especially since he can't keep that Mr. Universe physique up forever.

Blood, breasts, and beasts-- this one's destined for Joe Bob's drive in rather than the shelves of critics everywhere.",End of Days

Some movies look beautiful and have an intelligent script, i.e. ""The Mummy"", ""The Matrix"", ""Deep Blue Sea"" or ""What Dreams May Come"". Others look beautiful and have a boring script, i.e. ""Armageddon"". Unfortunately, ""End of Days"" is part of a new class: beautiful movies with a dumb plot. There are a lot of things that do not make sense or they are not explained: why does the restaurant blow up after Satan leaves? why would the character of Miriam Margolyes, after being such a caring mother for over fifteen years, turn in a murderer? why can Satan walk into a church just like that? Questions, a lot. Answers, none. Should I mention gratuitous nudity? It does not make the movie more watchable. You probably know this but most of the time, looks do not go with talent. Robin Tunney is not an exception.Yet the special effects are flawless, and there are are some funny scenes as well. My favourite of them all is when Miriam Margolyes beats up Arnie. Well that, you do not see every day.But, I still cannot recommend this movie. If it made more sense, maybe. But in this state, no.

191,johncusacksback,A muddled mess of a movie.,4,25 July 2003,"*1/2 out of ****An under-written, over-produced, muddled mess of a movie. This is first and foremost an action movie, much like most of Arnold Schwarzenegger's movies, with the story taking a backseat to the action, but in a movie that has its hands in christianity, satanism, the end of the world, and where the devil himself is one of the key characters, that probably shouldn't be the case. At first, the story seems as though it might be somewhat ambitious or interesting, but it's not. It's pointless, unbelievable, and I imagine very insulting to some religious circles. As far as the action is concerned though, it's pretty good and is probably the only reason to sit through this movie for two hours. There are some decent performances. Arnold gives it his all, but is severely out of place in this sort of movie and Gabriel Byrne brings some life to the movie, but, for the most part, none of the actors are convincing enough to make us buy what is happening. I'd recommend it to fans of Arnold and 1970's Charlton Heston films.",End of Days

He does have a lot of helpful talents in the movie.Although I was not used to Arnold in this kind of movie, he's usually playing the role of a secret agent or a killing machine, but this time he's just a bodyguard.

Evil given form is apparently a slightly horny, smirking man who wisecracks and leers. He spends the film killing his henchmen (I'm so sick of villains doing that) and random people he bumps into by use of buses and magic dynamite. How boring is that? Satan is given a human body and he behaves like a teenager who's read the Anarchist's Cookbook too many times. Ahnold is NOT back.

It was so blatantly obvious that this movie was borrowing, if not stealing, many ideas from older horror classics.  Same old Satan vs. God story, except the producers think you throw some fancy special effects and Arnold Schwarzenegger and they'll draw a big crowd.  I knew I should have run out on this one.  As an atheist, I was horrified by how the movie soon turned into these long discussions on religion, God, and ""Book of Revelations"" material.  Unless you are a die-hard believer in the darker side of the christian religion, you will find it hard to sit through all of this.  I've seen all of this sort of ""revelations"" material in many previous movies, and it never seems to get any more interesting with the next flick.It was cool to see those two fellas from ""The Usual Suspects"" come together, as both are great actors, but the overall movie was just dull, and the amount of religion thrown onto you is much overdone.

Arnold's script choices have been going downhill for a while, but Gaby hopefully has a few more good ones in him yet. But this ain't one of them. The story is so ludicrous it isn't even funny. It seemed the movie couldn't make up its mind what it wanted to be and dithered between various genres before giving up in resignation. Arnold is just plain terrible. Never seen him act worse. Robin Tunney looks scared a lot but doesn't do anything else, and Gabriel Byrne is feeble as a devil and didn't give me anything like the creeps I got from Al Pacino's legal diablo in Devil's Advocate. But then maybe he realized what a disaster he had got himself into and couldn't be bothered.The score was even more cliched than the dialogue, with Satanic and heavenly choirs alternating ad nauseum. Gore was gratuitous and the effects were just there to try and convince you that it was worth your $12.And that ending! How can such a screenplay get the nod from studio bosses? This isn't even mediocrity, it's BAD writing. Any student would be thrown out of film school with a script like that. This film is WORSE than Damien Omen III. And that's saying something.",End of Days
204,warren-1976,It Depends On Your Perspective,9,4 June 2009,"End of Days gets a bad rap, but I think a great deal of this is due to its initial premise. It's extremely 'cool' to be anti-religion these days, so big-budget movies with a core religious theme tend to get unnecessarily slammed. I'm not religious myself, but I do often enjoy supernatural and religiously themed stories, due to the themes and issues they frequently explore. So its success all hinges on whether you can accept a plot guided by supernatural religious elements or not. If you can, and you enjoy action movies occasionally, you'll probably enjoy End of Days.Arnold plays a depressed ex-cop turned high-level body guard with a suitably tragic back-story. Some people will enjoy his performance, others won't. Again, it depends on how you come to this. If you are expecting a versatile actor who changes personality with every performance, then you won't enjoy it. If you like Arnold, because he is exactly what he is, Arnold, then you'll probably have a ball. After all, who ever hired Charlton Heston or Humphrey Bogart or Christopher Walken to play a part in any way other than the specific way they do? You don't hire such actors because of their chameleon-like acting abilities, you hire them because their sheer screen presence is such that they stand out from the crowd and you enjoy seeing THEM in the role. As such, you either relish those actors in their parts, or you you dismiss them as wooden or bland. It depends on the viewer.The director, Peter Hyams (2010, Outland, Timecop, The Relic), has a tendency to enjoy very dark cinematography, and in this case it suits things perfectly. There are lots of scenes lit primarily by flames or torchlight, that set the tone. Meanwhile, John Debney's (Cutthroat Island, Passion of the Christ) score is also one of his best, and probably one the most effective 'demonic' soundtracks since Goldsmith's Omen trilogy. I would be remiss not to mention the effects work as well. Having watched the DVD special features, I was extremely impressed with how much old-style artistry and craftsmanship went into many of the effects. There was a great deal of miniature work involved, which is too often sidelined for less effective CGI these days. End of Days used a careful blend, only really using CGI where necessary.End of Days is a great roller-coaster ride of a movie, entirely suited to the date it was made for, and has a surprising amount of depth. Under the action and excitement, it's really a story about the main character's redemption, finding himself again, and discovering a meaning to his life after all he thought he had lost. It's also a classic good versus evil tale. To top it all off, we get a surprisingly touching and moving finale, which perhaps left a lot of people on too much of a downer, yet I found it the perfect conclusion to the story.All in all, End of Days is either a love-it or hate-it movie. It's not perfect, but I thought it was an excellent film, and one of Arnold's most interesting characters. If you don't mind religious themes, enjoy larger-than-life characters and adrenaline pounding action, then chances are you'll probably have a fantastic ride.",End of Days

In-between the brief naps I was able to enjoy while watching this superb, moving, cinematic tour-de-force, I was most touched by the amazing pyrotechnics that were a dominant force throughout the picture.  Fire everywhere, all the time - fire, flames of burning people, subways and stray animals.  This film is no place for marshmellows and Mr. Schwarzenegger proves that in every single scene whether he is taking on the devil himself (Gabriel Byrne)or slapping about the complacent Rod Stieger playing Father Kovak.  I imagine that Steiger was so impressed with Arnie's incredible skills that he was speechless in his presence both on and off screen.Is it not enough that we have endured Schwarzenegger films for what seems like the past 50 years - when will this guy lose the Austrian accent?  He mumbles through the entire film and always seems lost in front of a camera.However, Gabriel Byrne as The Man (the devil) is very, very good and is the only reason to rent this bomb.",End of Days

It seems like he's not even trying. He lost his punch. Usually he hams it up with a lot of feeling. Compare this to his part in The Amityville Horror. In both films he plays a priest. In the former, he acts with urgency and heart as he tries to save a family from their demise. In the latter, it's supposedly the end of the world yet he's highly ho hum about it. As for the rest of the film, it's just ok. The villain could've been made to be more scary instead of suave - maybe less dialogue and some slow motion walking through crowds to some eerie Background music.",End of Days

There are some moments you can smile or even laugh, but this is not a comedy. An ex cop and a bodyguard for hire, A.S. gets into a plot which if it fully succeeds it will bring the End of Days (sorry). Yes, far fetched, but, very well acted from everyone. You just know they enjoyed making this film. There is lots of violence, some creepy sexual acts, bad language and depressing themes. Visually beautiful and audio that manages to be perfect for the film. Special effects were at the time it was released amazing and even now most of them look almost as good as then.

Perhaps my expectations were too high for this movie, but I couldn't help but be disappointed.First off, I'm not going to complain about the plot holes.  You don't go to a Schwarzenegger movie and expect Citizen Kane.  As long as the action flows along in a more or less logical fashion, I'm happy.  That does not happen here.  All of the action sequences are recycled from other movies that did them ten times better.On the plus side, the special effects are nice to look at.  Gabriel Byrne obviously has fun playing Satan.  Everything looks nice and dark.  Arnold almost saves the movie with his presence.  He's got some nice one-liners, and he gets to do some actual ""acting.""

There was really no reason for this excess and I found it detracted from the story.

215,Chronus,The end of expectations,6,29 December 1999,"End of DaysThis is one of those movies that could have been one of the best pictures of this decade, but is instead a disappointment. And a big one. Arnold Schwarzenegger chose another fine script, and his acting, together with Tunney´s, is what keeps this picture from falling completely into the abyss. The Austrian Oak is now becoming a very good actor, at last. He has been improving enormously since he shot Eraser. He´s now showing other facial capabilities and does not rely so heavily on his physique anymore. As for the movie and its story... We´ve seen similar stories before, and some of those stories (particularly one with Demi Moore and Jurgen Prochnow, The SEventh Seal(??)) are very good, very effective.This one mixes two genres: the religious mistery and the action thriller. Some may think these genres do not mix, but I think they can mesh perfectly if the director pays attention to details. That´s the problem with End of Days. A matter of details.
ATTENTION: THE FOLLOWING MAY CONSTITUTE SPOILERS...A matter of details. Yes. We can never believe this story is about the devil (who takes on a human body and has super-powers (absorbing bullets, going through seas of flames unarmed, surviving falls from 20 stories buildings) if the devil, and its human form, with its super-powers, cannot survive a train crash, or cannot avoid a fall from am high window...Sometimes he is superpowered, at other times he is not. It´s ilogic, and removes all credibility from the story.The director (Peter Hyams) chose a path dictated perhaps by merchandising or today´s trends: bang-bang, noise-noise, non-stop physical action. He chose to shock viewers, to awe them, instead of making them think and climb to their seats in fear. The Devil pisses oil or gasoline, wow, he smashes heads with a single strike...he knows everybody´s thoughts but cannot foresee or know the location of the girl - he has to beat Arnold´s character up or has to lure him into a sentimental trap in order to get that information.Maybe it´s just me, but someone in Hollywood thinks we (the viewers) are not up to the task of understanding complex ideas in a movie, so that very powerful someone shoots us with shallow scripts and movies.The motiv of this picture is great, the beggining is also great...but all these things become of little importance when all the shooting begins and the Devil´s followers turn into an enormous mob out of the blue.Robin Tunney is very good in her part; Gabriel Byrne is an average devil (compare his intensity with Pacino´s in The Devil´s Advocate) - he is an outstanding actor - and the rest of the cast performs well.
Special effects - solid, but normal.The soundtrack is very good and adds interest to the movie.The one thing that redeems the movie is the last scene: Jericho fighting the devil the only way he can...The ending is superb, unlike the happy ending so common in Arnold´s movies.I rate it a 6 out 10.",End of Days
216,hatsunemiku-27340,Arnie's Horror Story,6,11 September 2017,"Arnold Schwarzenegger's career path changed in the 90's. He began branching out into comedies as the era of macho action faded. His success in that endeavor is a matter of opinion (I think Jingle All the Way was the best comedy he did). But in his filmography of the time is a stand-out, an action/horror movie that was less Predator and more Exorcist. End of Days was the End of Days for Arnie's acting career for about a decade as he focused more on politics and the movie itself was so critically panned that you can see why Arnold may have disappeared from Hollywood for a while. Perhaps he saw that his time was up and he should move on to trying new things. After all, one of the reasons we love Arnold so much is that he will try anything and isn't afraid to fail.And End of Days is a testament to that, I mishmash of genres and ideas that for all intents and purposes shouldn't work. There's a bit of The Exorcist mixed with Y2K conspiracies with a touch of The Mummy's brand of action/horror. There's a bizarre dynamic of typical cop films, Vatican drama, and over-the-top action. Arnold plays a sympathetic character,albeit a two dimensional one, who also happens to be a bad ass killing machine with little care for property damage or manslaughter charges. It's a film that is constantly morphing into something else, providing what turns out to be a good popcorn flick despite all the flaws.Arnold plays Jericho, the typical washed up cop whose family was killed by robbers. During a routine job he is pulled into a world of demons and holy men, a war between good and evil to prevent the end of days. Satan walks the Earth to have a child with a young woman and herald in the apocalypse on Y2K. The Vatican wants to kill the girl to prevent this, Jericho decides he wants to defeat Satan and save her. Thus he faces off with Satanists, members of the Vatican, and eventually takes on Satan himself.The movie is grungy and ugly in a way that compliments the plot. It reminded me a lot of the horror/action comic books of the time. The direction is pretty standard and to tell the truth, the majority of the film is pretty run-of-the-mill. The action is nonstop but none of it is original. The acting is typically pretty bad, though Arnie gives a decent performance by his standards and Gabriel Byrne is a ham as Satan. The only really bad performance was Robin Tunney as Christine, the woman meant to have the devil's child. She was a God-awful choice for a female co-star and even if Arnie isn't giving his charismatic best, he looks positively stellar beside Tunney.What I liked about the movie pretty much comes down to subject matter. I'm a sucker for this kind of religious horror film, especially if done in a more urban fantasy type way. I liked all the ideas presented even if they weren't cohesive enough to make the movie anything less than awkward. But as the definition of a ""turn off your brain"" film, it works.Another thing I want to point out is that the ending doesn't cop-out. With an ending like the one in the film most movies would go for some sort of ham-fisted plot device to present a happy ending. But instead, End of Days sticks to what happens and feels so much more refreshing for it.End of Days isn't a memorable movie, it arguably isn't even good. But it's a ton of fun and propelled by some silly performances and a script that moves at a breakneck pace. It's formulaic and does nothing new, it's not even scary to tell the truth. But there's a lot of entertainment to be found in it and even if Jericho is two-dimensional, it's nice to see an Arnold Schwarzenegger character with a modicum of backstory, emotion, and motivation.",End of Days

218,rob-177,The story is there but the acting isn't,7,30 December 1999,"The movies plot was an interesting one. Especially coming up to the new millennium it really got viewers (including me) minds thinking. The whole story is about the devil coming to earth 3 days before the end of 1999. He then takes over the body of a new Yorker (Gabriel Byrne) and goes in search of his bride.Arnie somehow gets caught up in the action and is out trying to save this so-called bride from her end. Although he finds it hard and challenging I'm sure you all can figure out what happens in the end.So as you can see the movie does have the potential to go somewhere. But unfortunately the acting was terrible. Arnold Schwarzenegger tried his best but I think that this role was too much of an emotional role for Arnold to play. Kevin Pollack played Arnolds sort of sidekick in the movie, he was preety good at it due to him being able to put some humor into his role.
Gabriel Byrne was by far the worst I have ever seen him. Not that I've even seen him in anything before. He didn't scare me for a second and I always thought that Satan was a dark scary character but in this he was a sex-freaked gambler.Overall I think it is just worth seeing but don't expect too much. If you are an extremely religious person then I warn you not to see it due to many people being hung by holes in both their feet and hands. In the end I gave 'End Of Days' a 6/10",End of Days
219,Nick_Milligan,"Violent, trashy, gratuitous, brilliant",10,29 April 2000,"End Of Days is a very enjoyable film. It is packed full of over the top gore, sex and violence. The plot is very trashy and thin, but you find yourself enjoying this movie, although you realise that you probably shouldn't be. The performances are very good, with Schwarzenegger looking right at home amongst the mayhem and one-liners. Byrne plays the smooth, seductive vessel of Satan with great ease and makes good of a very simple script. Also, the movie contains work by the great Stan Winston, who has done creature effects for all the great Sci-films. If you are a fan of Schwarzenegger or just love an action-packed film, do not miss Arnie as he battles his greatest opponent ever. The Devil.",End of Days
220,matpinckney,One of the best...,9,1 March 2003,"Arnold Schwarzenegger's comeback film, 'End of Days' absolutely made an impact on film that year. While watching it, I kept seeing images that stood out, and that I remembered (The Man (Gabriel Byrne) looking at Christine (Robin Tunney) in the car, Jericho (Schwarzenegger) looking around the reverend's home). This film is one of Arnold's most serious, most dramatic, and most dark. He plays the character of Jericho Cane extremely well (crying over his daughter's music box for eg.), and keeps his performance constant throughout. The ending of the film, *POSSIBLE SPOILER* where Jericho drops his weapon in favor of faith is hugely powerful, accompanied by the haunting choir music that is the film's background. *END SPOILER*Kevin Pollack's character, Chicago, acts as light comic relief, but also gives some of the great lines in the film (""It's official. I'm never sleeping again""). He also provides a great performance in the more dark, serious parts of the film.Robin Tunney is perfect as Christine York, with the character having a very vulnerable edge, and the relationship between her and Jericho forming an almost father-daughter relationship.Finally, Gabriel Byrne's portrayal of the man is amazing. He gives the character a certain edge, which makes Satan seem almost accessible at times, but can quickly become terrifying in an instant.The script is strong, and the special and visual effects are amazingly impressive.9/10",End of Days
221,Hprog,Good for us this didn't happen!,7,3 January 2000,"In this movie, we find the classic action features, fun situations and Schwarzenegger playing the tough guy the way he knows very well how to do it. But this isn't everything about this film, besides, it contains some horror and suspense items that make it definitely a great entertainment. We have such a good actor like Gabriel Byrne playing the Devil, reminding me sometimes of Al Pacino on The Devil's Advocate, only that Byrne didn't develop the character that much, he just did whate he had to do and very well. Peter Hyams is on charge of directing and cinematography (as usual) making a good job, specially dealing with all those special effects. Acting in general isn't such a great thing, but anyway, the movie is a great entertainment and I recommend it for that. Believe me, it has some truly scary moments, and once again, thank God this didn't happen at all!",End of Days
222,strogger,Not classic Schwarzenegger but enjoyable nonetheless.,10,15 December 1999,"I was a little disappointed with End of Days as I was expecting an all out actioner (like Predator for example) but Peter Hyams seemed to be more interested in the atmosphere of the movie than the action. I must say I really liked cinematography and set design. The fights and action sequences are more subdued than other Schwarzenegger films such as Predator or True Lies. I think the action scenes required a director with more panache. But, I did love the fight in rain, It was strange seeing Arnie really get beaten down. The traditionally heroic characters he plays mean this scene has a real impact.It would be hard for anyone to claim this film had a good script. I would have preferred if the filmmakers had gone the whole hog and left out the traditional on liners and made the film really bleak. What we end up getting is a muddled narrative which is a means to an end for Peter Hyams to play about as Cinematographer and for Arnold to try a more challenging role. I cant help thinking that had Arnie's I Am Legend movie not fallen through we would have had both great cinematography and an interesting role for Arnold, plus a terrific story.So in summation I would recommend End of Days to all Schwarzenegger fans, you will find much to enjoy but everyone else might be disappointed in the weak script.",End of Days

As far as action films go, this year has been pretty bad, but ending the year with Bond and End of Days, has really improved things.

Sounds familiar?  (Then again, this could just as well be Predator III--in fact, there is a small touch that will indeed remind the perceptive viewer of the first one, IMHO still Arnold's best movie.)Pros: very good visual and great sound effects; very good acting by Gabriel Byrne; some genuinely suspenseful moments; adequate action (but not as much or as intense as in the aforementioned films)Cons: faulty internal logic; characters that are too unusual/artificial/undeveloped to believe; Arnie's acting",End of Days
226,Dark Scribe,Great expectations but...,6,24 December 1999,"End of Days was an all too common victim of over hype, which detracted from the film itself. This was one of Arnie's better pictures of late, not in the class of Terminator 2 or Eraser, but the closest he has done in a while. Substantial gore and special effects were balanced by an average-to-good acting performance from all concerned, Byrne in my eyes was a decent choice as The Dark Prince and he carried the part quite well. Full marks to Hyams for the unexpected ending, but it was not one that Arnie was suited to as viewers will no doubt see. The scene of Arnie taking on the mob in the alley and the temple scene evoked pleasant memories of Eraser and Terminator 2, but such parallels were too fleeting and too few. All in all, a decent movie, perhaps a little disappointing, but for what may well be Arnie's last foray into this genre (grey stubble throughout duly noted) not bad at all. 6 out of 10.",End of Days
227,wadew1,Good Action movie that doesn't deserve to be trashed,8,4 April 2001,"Arnold does some good work in this movie. I liked his role as a suicidal/alcoholic/wiseass.

Arnie(to his best friend) ""Stop being such a P*SSY!""Also, a good performance was put in by the guy who played Satan. The way he blew up the van....very creative.The only thing i didn't really like about this movie was the ending. I would have liked to see Arnold win in a different way.Overall and 8/10. Didn't deserve the bad press it got. There are other action movies like this one that are so much better received for some reason. Religion's a very sensitive subject, so maybe that's where the negative stuff came from.",End of Days
228,Basf-2,"2000, the beginning of a new era",6,2 December 1999,"In fact this movie is totally ridiculous. But that's not uncommon these days with big budget blockbuster Hollywood action- movies. The story is too silly to take serious, witch should not be a problem when it is told convincingly, but some turns in the plot are too unlikely. But if you like movies with lots of explosions and shoot-outs with enormous guns, and don't mind about the plausability of the story, you might like it. The movie is a mixture of all kind of other movies, maybe in a homage to those, or maybe just because of lack of inspiration of the writers. The last option is the most likely. I saw references to Terminator 2 and Predator ( both also with Arnie in the leading role), The Usual Suspects, Rosemary's Baby, The Exorcist III, The Devil's Advocate, Speed, any James Bond movie, The Night Of The Living Dead, and even Monty Python's Flying Circus ( ""Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition""!). The film once more shows that Arnie is in fact a very bad actor. He is playing a part that should have been played by Bruce Willis ( on the other hand: it's in fact better for Bruce that he's not in this mess...) The only actor that does a good job is Gabriel Byrne, but he's not as good as Pacino in The Devil's Advocate. In the scene where the two main characters meet in Arnie's apartment, Arnie is completely played of the screen by Byrne. Finally: what a shame that Arnie will never play a bad guy again, now that he is a big Hollywood star. He was at his best as a mean murdering robot in Terminator 1!",End of Days
229,General Comment,Entertaining movie,9,11 December 1999,"Arnie goes back to his roots, so you know what to expect. Lots of action, sharp one-liners, big budget special effects. And you get the feeling that, in Satan, Arnie has finally met a worthy opponent.Gabriel Byrne is excellent as the fallen angel, oozing malice and evil confidence. Hyams direction is sharp, and you'll find yourself sometimes shocked, sometimes revolted by the turn of events.The plot does contain a few flaws, but if you can ignore these you're in for an entertaining couple of hours. I would recommend it to all action and fantasy/sci-fi fans.",End of Days
230,draftyrafters,Arnold Good. Movie Bad.,1,6 December 1999,"There is very little of redeeming value in this movie.  The plot-line, a translation of the book of Revelations so loose its laughable, is made even more unbearable by clunky and melodramatic dialogue.  Although Arnold Schwarzenegger does some of the best character work in his career here, it is muddled by lopsided drama and action which just plain isn't.  The pace of the show, despite the multiple and gratuitous violence, still never surpasses a struggling limp, and the movie is forced to rely on stunning special effects (I'll admit, they're good) and some big names (Gabriel Byrne and Kevin Pollack) to boost viewership.  Byrne's performance as Satan seems phoned-in, and the spiritual struggle of Arnold--which could have saved the show, were it better written--is lost in a deluge of dramatic explosions, dopey double-crosses, and flammable demon pee, only to be revived at the last moment in a sort of ""oops, almost forgot"" by the directors, writers, and, unfortunately, Arnold himself.",End of Days

Arnold finds out about the whole deal though strange occurances.Arnold then finds himself in a battle against pure evil its self.

234,FrankG47,One of the worst movies ever made to man.,1,25 June 2011,"There is nothing beyond god awful to describe this film.I have to wonder if the writers of this film really believed in Y2K or the world ending because the dialog and plot shows how rushed the script was, maybe they used that as an excuse for when the movie would be accepted as terrible, they would have some kind of excuse.The film opens with these priests discussing that some biblical person was born today, and they are on the planet. They then argue like typical religious nuts who are mentally disturbed, about weather they should murder the baby or not, even knowing they can't find it. Then the Pope declares they will NOT kill the baby. First off why even discuss it if it's clear you can't find the baby? Are you going to go through the name it's given to you in some 2000 years ago, and start secretly murdering every one on the planet with that name? But you believe in God and are peaceful like God is made out to be right?So the baby is born and these weird Satan guys take her from the delivery room and have some snake blood put on her. This also begs the question. if the evil guys were there when the baby was born, why not take her then and raise her to be prepared for her destiny?So then we see some weird cloud come up in New York City, go into a bathroom and suggest itself into Gabriel Bryne. I guess it's Satan. So he goes out and kisses some woman in front of her husband before walking out of the place and having it explode. Guess the director figured we were bored this far in the movie, so they give us this useless action scene to get our attention again.So when we do meet Arnold Schwarzenegger he's a suicidal down on his luck cop, that has mental problems. To show his job, we have a senseless action scene, someone shoots at Gabriel Byrne. Arnold hangs from a helicopter and we sit there a mindless action scene we know nothing about or care about, except for the Y2K, December 31st 1999 posters, papers, everywhere I guess to remind us a million times what this movie is about.So far into the movie, if you're not bored you probably feel something is really wrong and this movie is going to fall apart at any second.The cops find the guy who was shooting the guns and he's some mentally disturbed priest with his tongue cut out. So we meet the grown up baby again, who hallucinates some very strange scene on a bus just so we can hear a 4 letter word over and over, since this film has to be explicit. We learn Arnold's name is Jericho Cane. Well why don't we just name him Moses? At this point it sounds like an angry 13 year old wrote this after bible study one day. So while we have to see Arnold Schwarzenegger crying his eyes out (And for the record, this also shows how easily he cannot act a serious dramatic role) Gabe Bryne, I mean Satan has a weird nasty fantasy that exploits that 4 letter word we had to hear earlier, and to give us something of entertaining to people who are bored out of their mind so far.Then we also get a stupid scene of Satan running into a kid with a shirt that says ""Satan Rules"" and in typical Satan fashion, he lets him die by a bus accident. I don't understand what this scene was meant for. Was it suggested that people who listen to ""Satanic Music"" should die? Why not just have a kid wearing a shirt of ANY heavy metal band and have them die since the writers of this film have an obvious problem with some group of individuals out there who may listen to dark versions of Heavy Metal.We learn that Christine York is who Arnold is looking for, I mean Christ can you get any worse names than this? This is where the movie starts to officially fall apart. This is the moment when plot hole after plot hole after plot hole after plot hole become so many holes that I can't list them all so I'll make it short.The dialog in this movie is more laughable than anything. You have Arnold's one liners that get all serious and sound stupid like this one.""You're a choir boy compared to me! A CHOIR BOY!"" (Not he's saying this to Satan, I can't imagine a more stupid, rushed line in history of Arnold's terrible one lines)Arnold survives some things that no other regular human being would survive. (Rioters beating him to death, and crucifying him, falling from a window a dozen stories high, some how managing to survive many explosions that would have killed anyone not in the movie) There's a church that ""Satan cannot see"". Arnold don't believe in God and blames him on his problems for no apparent reason. Satan does some out of character stupid silly things. And the list goes on. I can't list them all but you get the flow.The movie tries as hard as they can to build you up to the ending. Yeah we're ready to get it over with! NONE of the characters are very likable. I guess they tried to build up some momentum at the end and fix some plot holes, but it still didn't work. Actually the ending is rather laughable. You couldn't imagine you were laughing so hard you were going to cry at seeing Arnold do some of the worst acting ever in his career.",End of Days

I can be very realistic when it comes to movies and performances, so it's not like I'm exaggerating. I think it's a shame this movie only gets a 5.2. This is without a doubt Arnold's best performance ever. I'm giving this movie 9/10 for everything: the acting, the directing and the writing. Yes, the scene where the priest turns the 666 upside down so it would be 999 is a bit off, but then again it's good entertainment. Director Peter Hyams did a very good job.

After such abominable failures as ""Jingle All The Way"" and ""Junior"" (remember - ""I don't know if it is a boy or a girl, so I will just call it Junior!""), Schwarzenegger marks a brilliant return to form, albeit without the lame jokes and the bulging biceps. He seems to have made an about-turn in his approach to making films, although to some extent it is sad to see the Arnie of old leaving - he seems incapable of handling serious roles because of his inane stupidity and sheer size. Still, in the short-term, this particular film was pretty good - SFX were startling in places, Gabriel Bryne was brilliantly casted as the Devil, and the whole set up was consequently infinitely better than Arnie's last incarnation, ""Eraser.""",End of Days

Thus, after 1000 years, we're on 1001, or 2001 and the millennium starts, not on January first 2000 but January first 2001. I say this because the mistake was made in the movie. Now, the real thing.The movie was really cool and entertaining. I thought that it would be an atypical Shwartzennegger (or whatever he spells it) movie, with a few heavy action scene and the rest of the movie a theological thriller or something. Man was I wrong! The action is very near from non-stop, and what's more, its really good, altough there are maybe too much explosions in my taste. The direction and special effects are excellent (after seeing Satan in his true form, I can't wait to see the Balrog in Lord of the Rings!)On the other side, the story sucked alot. First, the inversed number of the beast sounds more like an excuse to set the movie on the edge of the ""millennium"". Also , it is said at one point in the movie that Satan can only copulate with Christine because she was born at a time X, and that he could only possess Gabriel Byrne body, for the same reason. But he ends up possessing Arnold (its easier to spell this)! And the suicide of Arnold, altough it is very typical of movies featuring demons (like Fallen Angel or the devil's advocate) was far from necessary: five more second controlling himself and Satan would have lost and depart for another millennium. Also, it is quite unlikely that he'd have time to reproduce during this short amount of time (especially since steroids cause sterility).But it's much fun to see, so I  gave it a 7",End of Days
249,MikeT-9,No Comeback for Ah-Nold,5,29 November 1999,"On the heels of ""Batman and Robin"" - Arnie's worst action movie of the decade - comes his second worst: ""End of Days."" This is supposed to be a stretch for him, showing a more serious side, but its still a formula action movie with so many cliches, badly written lines and preposterous/non-sensical scenes that it boggles the mind. Can't one of the highest paid stars in the world find a script that isn't a re-hash of every action movie of the past twenty years?Some examples: 1) Arnie as the burnt-out cop. You can tell this because he holds a gun to his head in the opening scene and drinks beer and pizza shakes for breakfast. Never mind the fact that he delivers the rest of his lines with an annoying ""what-me-worry"" attitude that never suggests that he's on the verge of suicide.2) Kevin Pollack as the wise-cracking sidekick. Every action hero has to have a pint-sized, ever-smirking partner to provide comic relief. Too bad he doesn't provide any here.3) The rules only apply when its convenient. Guns don't hurt the devil...unless there's no other way to end the scene. Somehow, I don't think the devil would have so much trouble fighting one guy with a machine gun.4) Don't kill the good guy when you've got him trapped. Let him live so he can be a further pain in the ass.There's much more than this that's wrong with the film. The action scenes are edited in ""confuso-vision"" - I assume to create a sense of chaos or something. But here it just make the action unclear and unsatisfying.
Why Peter Hyams was chosen to direct is beyond me. The guy's OK - nobody expected much from ""TimeCop"" or ""The Relic""- but choosing him to helm a big-budget action movie with an A-List action star is a questionable decision to say the least.

Well, superimposing The Revelations upon our world and playing along with the rather narrowly self-centered (e.g. by ignoring all other calendars on Earth) view that Earth ends around the change of millennium, is a plot that either has the potential to entertain a lot, or to fail miserably. Well, to me End of Days worked - I was entertained!The acting, under the difficult and limited conditions that an action film imposes upon the actors, was excellent. Especially another superb performance by Gabriel Byrne, who is playing a marvelously convincing Satan, and really steals the show.Actually, before going to watch the film, I was most afraid about precisely how convincing it would be to see a mere human (be that Arnold or anybody else) fight the Big Bad Dude Himself ... it sounded too ridiculous to expect anything like a fair fight, right?! Well, it isn't .. fair, I mean! Enough to say, that the vices attributed to Satan, and so subtly exposed by Byrne, plays a rather important counterpart to the raw power he exhibits. Also the effects are, of course, smashing and very inspiring for anybody writing stories or plays. Finally, the manuscript, despite a few typical errors and inconsistencies as could be expected for any treatment of such a fantastic topic, is actually very good.And, oh, btw.: The Christian world 1000 years ago feared that Judgement Day was nearing with the change of millennium .. sounds familiar ...?! Well, nothing's changed really!!!!",End of Days
251,Umblezi,A nothin' film,4,26 March 2000,"This is one of many films which cost heaps of money to make, have one or two well known actors in it, and rely largely on action scenes and special effects. The problem is, the special effects are not brilliant, so audiences just go, ""Yeah, so a restaurant blew up- I've seen it before."" Films such as 'Titanic' and 'The Matrix' astound people, and can somewhat justify the exorbitant costs that go into making their special effects. This is simply another action flick which few can muster up the energy to get involved in. Especially when the plot is so crappy. The only commendable aspect of this film is Gabriel Byrne's portrayal of the devil, but still, the script he has to work with is so poor, that he cannot save this waste of money. And what about the climax of the film, when Satan has about 15 seconds left to impregnate the girl. The audience is supposed to be on the edge of their seats, wondering if he'll do it, but all they're thinking about is how on earth Satan is going to root her in 15 seconds. They would have had to speed the film up to Benny Hill pace. That actually would have added to this outstandingly mediocre film.",End of Days
252,terminator33,One of Arnold's better movies,10,12 May 2000,"I think that this movie is one of Arnold's better movies, though a lot of people think that this is his worst movie. This film is not deep or insightful but it is entertaining. I like what director Peter Hyams did with the films atmosphere he keeps it dark and brooding. I think that Arnold Schwarzenegger while he has some weak moments turns in his most accomplished performance in a film yet. He has considerably more dialouge than usual, and he tries his best to develop his character. The action sequences in this film are not top notch but are fun none the less. This is not one of Arnold's worst movies, I think it is one of his best. I give it *** out of ****.",End of Days

It's true that the movie was pretty bad, but not necessarely because of Arnold. True it's not his kind of movie, but he wasen't all that bad in it. What was bad is that they modified the movie so that it still has the Arnold feel to it. If they would have signed Kianu, Pitt or even Willis, the outcome would have been much better. I do beleive that the movie had some serious potential.",End of Days
254,clydfrog,Just too dark,4,29 August 2001,"My roommate rented this movie on DVD and I agreed to view it even though I wouldn't have picked it up for myself. This movie seemed a bit to evil for my taste from what I could see in the previews. The movie was a definite good verses evil movie and anyone could tell who was the good guy and who was bad. The movie is self explanatory in the title. Schwarzenegger saves the world from eternal damnation, who would have thought? The things I found distasteful about this flick are the fact that Satan had way too much power than should have been portrayed. It seemed to me that only Jericho (Schwarzenegger's character) could defeat Satan and God had the power only through Jericho. It seems to me that if Satan is who he is and Jericho is only a man the odds of Jericho winning were much less than the movie portrayed. The special effects on the other hand were quite good and the detail of the story as well as religious background and information were interesting to contemplate although most were false. The character that Arnold played was good for him and it showed a little more of the inside of his character rather than his usual `muscle-bound-brute'. Arnold's character had his own personal problems in this movie that made him seem more real. This was the first time I had seen Gabriel Byrne in a movie since `The Man in the Iron Mask.' Byrne is the girl that is the main supporting actress in the movie but I won't let you know what part she plays for viewing sake. Needless to say her role in `End of Days' was a bit more dramatic.",End of Days

I've always liked Kevin Pollak and he's back to playing the quirky little fat man character that he does so well. Arnold was.... well, Arnold. I've never really expected Brando-esque acting from him, but he's certainly got the goods when it comes to movies like this.If you like action peppered with some laughs, then this is a movie for you.",End of Days

After reading a bunch of reviews and with past experiences with Arnold, I was not expecting much, but I really enjoyed this movie. I was a big fan of Arnold when I was a kid but in the past 10 years or so I have gotten tired of his movies with the exception of Terminator and Predator. Until now, I really think he did a good job in End of Days. I thought the story was pretty good, above average, the acting was ok with the exception of Gabriel Byrne who I thought was excellent. What I most liked about this movie was the cinematography and the action scenes. I really liked the shots of New York city. Put all this together and I thought this was a very entertaining movie, I was completely into it. I also believe this is a spiritual movie at least for me, it really had me thinking about religion.",End of Days

I happen to like AS, but this review isn't about him, or even the movie, but the story. While there were some gaping holes in the logic, both theological and rational, the essence of the story had real potential. Envision this story with another lead - Willem Defoe just as a possible example - and tone down the wild effects, extremes and fire power - the essentials of the story would still make great - or at least semi-great- story telling! If you are a fan of powerful emotional fantasy with lots of room for theological yearning, this tale has enormous potential that it just missed achieving.

261,Morlock-2,No brain but a whole lot of fun.,6,25 November 1999,Arnie's back! End of Days is an actionpacked supernatural thriller and it sure gives you the ride that is promised. Arnold fights satan in Predator-style. There are many plot-holes and stupid scenes. Gabriel Byrne as satan actually urinates gasoline when he's about to blow up a car. That's rather strange...but I guess Satan can do these things. I'm not saying this is a great film...but it beats the hell out of Eraser(which truly sucked). Enjoyable action-movie.,End of Days

And I won't even mention the physically impossible jump between two moving subway cars.Still, despite the silly antics, this movie accomplishes its primary goal: entertain. Arnie isn't the world's best actor, but he manages himself nicely here and makes up for Batman & Robin. Gabriel Byrne totally rocks as the Devil and everyone else is window dressing.Fun and brainless, and the scene where Arnie gets the crap kicked out of him by a dwarfish old lady is an instant classic.",End of Days
263,binanno,hmmm...no.,3,26 November 1999,"Let's see here.  Peter Hyams sets out to make a movie about the millenium, regarding the return of Satan to Earth and the so-called End of Days. Sounds interesting enough.  Unfortunately, any kind of mystical, demonic atmosphere the film tries to create is undermined by bad acting (Ah-nold especially), hokey humor, and ridiculous events that drive the story. Imagine the Devil's Advocate made into an action movie, stripped of its symbolism, and aimed at action movie audiences.  Gabriel Byrne does a god job of portraying Satan, but the character itself is hugely flawed, and his valiant effort is made in vain.  I went into this movie with medium to low expectations, and did it meet them?  Check out the one-line summary for the answer.",End of Days

For example: with all of his supernatural powers at his disposable, the 'prince of darkness' has limits that are silly and inconsistent from one story line to the next. And the 'hero's weapons against this super-power?  You guessed it!  A variety of guns and exploding projectiles.  Give me a break!It takes the viewer a constant 'leap of faith' from one premise to another, with only a few such events that made any sense at all. The special effects were quite good, but the story content with all of it's props (priests, the church, satan worshipers and scenes of 'conflict' between supposed good and evil, the special effects) are unable to tie the overall picture together and rescue it. don't waste your money. This is a seriously flawed film. Truly, 'enter at your own risk!'",End of Days
265,moviegoer99,Arnold's Best Film in years if not ever!!!!(May contain spoilers),10,25 April 2000,"Where do I begin?  I rented this film due to relentless anticipation and anger at myself for missing it in theaters.  I didn't know much about the plot, just Arnold vs the devil.  And I was blown away!!!! This movie has everything:  Great Acting, Action, Suspense, Drama, and Comedy!!!  One of Arnold's best acting jobs where he's not a total gun wielding shooter. Gabriel B. as the Devil was good, but a little tame and often humerous at times.  Al Pacino would have been better.  Kevin Pollack is probably one of the most underrated actors today.  He brings intentional humor to the film and in some ways is a ""hero"" in this movie.  The film's story is great, though many people were offended by the religious aspect of the story(churches being destroyed, etc.:  Big Deal!!) And the only REAL Problem I have with Arnold is in the end he goes back to getting the Terminator type weapons (missle launcher) and goes after satan, even after he says ""The only thing standing between Satan and the girl, is my 9mm"" (Yeah Right) this could've been worse, next time just get your 9mm and a shotgun.  Very few mistakes in the film's continuity (mostly minor, unnoticeable) Music is good (can bearly hear the soundtrack through the noise of the film) great dialogue (best line in the film:  Arnold:  You died for nothing, you just bought them more time.)  Great ending except for the 10 sec. or however long it is that satan has to knock up the girl, talk about pressure!!!  Anyway on a scale from 1-10 I give this film a 9.5 Arnold a 9 (best work since T2). And the story a 10.  best in it's genre!!!Don't miss this film. And one other thing:  Last Action Hero wasn't that bad!!!!(It was for kid's for god's sake)",End of Days

I found plenty of humor in End of Days as well and that was great.  Just a little too sappy for my taste.  It seemed to be trying to be all things to all people. The special effects were pretty good and the suppporting cast, especially Gabriel Byrne were believable. But the story line is weak and I felt the writers took the easy way out.  I wanted to know, for instance, where all the other religions of the world were while the catholics were trying to save us all from the devil.  Weak.  I found lots of other weaknesses in the story but to comment on them might be considered spoiling.I rated this film 5 - for Arnold, Kevin Pollach, Gabriel Byrne and the special effects crew.  It's an actioner and the action was great!  Most Arnold fans will like it.  Just dont expect it to answer any of you questions about.... Well, you'll see.",End of Days

Unfortunately this film will only really be for the die hard Arnie fan's to enjoy. The film is set at the turn of the millennium, hence the end of the world story that ensues. The plot is full of weaknesses, as if the creation of this film was birthed by someone somewhere realising that they could make a film that combined the threat of the end of the world with Swcharzenegger taking on Satan. On paper this does sound an exciting prospect, full of potential, but the film takes itself too seriously. With a slightly more lighthearted approach the film would have resulted in more of an adventure, something more entertaining. Instead End of Days has a dark horror feel, and apart from a few trademarks Arnie quips (and even these aren't great), it is also not much fun. Bryne's Satan is quite good but a underused, and the special effects are of a poor standard considering in the same year The Matrix was also released.The finale is more than a little predictable and when the film ends it felt to me like a missed opportunity, especially as it was one of Arnie's final action films.",End of Days

271,TheKyle,Ahnold is back?????,5,5 December 1999,"I am occasionally a fan of eye candy action films, and I had a lot of hope for this one. After all, Arnold is the apparent king of the action genre. I was stoked to see Gabriel Byrne play ""The Man"" (Satan). I was even curious to see Robin Tunney (who I have always thought was under rated).What I found in this film was instead was a mess of references. 1) Gabriel Byrne in a suit and overcoat, urinating in public at night and the slow motion scene of him dropping the cigarette. 2) The closeup of Kevin Pollack face lit up shortly before he meets apparent doom. 3) The priest's reference, ""The greatest trick the devil ever pulled..."" I was left wondering what Hyams was trying to do with such overt references.Unlike many of the contributors here I found the fx to be tedious and redundant. I was irritated by the overused fireball and explosion fx. Been there seen it done better.While I enjoyed Byrne's performance, I feel like the script never really gave him the chance to do much. He never quite got the malicious glee that Nicholson ( Witches of Eastwick) and Sydow (Needful Things) made so integral to the character. I blame this on a script that allowed him lots of action sequences but few opportunities to act.Arnold...Yeah uh huh when I think of action stars that can pull off the fallen hero archetype he's at the top of my list...suuuure. A.S. is woefully miscast in a role that would've been much better served by Val Kilmer, or half a dozen other actors.Robin Tunney has too much physical vitality to pull off the wounded introspective victim. Hopefully she will at least gain some visibility from this project that will lead to more credible work.In the end, the film tries to make some vague statement about the strength of faith, but it is quite simply too little too late. I would say this project is supremely mediocre and should be avoided unless you have seen everything else at the multiplex.",End of Days

Sure this isn't the serious role that Arnold promised, nor is it a particularly well written film but in terms of wild action, great stunts and wicked FX, End of Days hits the mark. Essentially, it's a big budget, professional horror movie with Arnold going head to head with the prince of darkness (played with over the top relish by Gabriel Byrne), and not letting anyone stand in his way.  The film also stands as a personal triumph for Arnold, this being his first film after his heart surgery, well, he shows no signs of fatigue, this is the big guy we all know and love.

But unfortunately, this is another Ah-nold film that can't make up its mind which direction it's going to go in.  Instead this movie is half-baked and indecisive - when it could have been much scarier or much funnier.  The script was the weakest part of the film, especially the plot.  Not that Ah-nold's films tend to be that believable to begin withespecially when his accent seems noticeably thicker - but this action for the sake of action in his films has compromised the films.  In an Ah-nold film - it's not good when the acting is better than the plot and the script.  I mean there was no tension in the film because there was nothing believable to begin with - just weak action and cheap one-liners.  It's okay to entertainjust make a better product.For example, the Helicopter scene was a pointlessespecially when Ah-nold and Kevin Pollack's characters are supposed to be protecting The Investment Banker  whoopsie! End of Days was somewhat disappointing but the second half of the movie was much better than the first part - mostly because it was funnier.  The best that I could say about End of Days is that it was both more enjoyable and funnier than the two worst movies of 1999 - THE PHANTOM MENACE and WILD WILD WEST.  I guess that the main reason I was disappointed is because I got this movie to go as a double bill with Paris, Texas because I needed a more upbeat `bleak' film.",End of Days

275,Booth-1,so-so Schwarznegger,5,30 March 2001,"End of Days is not the comeback Arnold was hoping for I'm afraid. It's a routine satanic horror movie/action film. Arnie is actually pretty decent as the suicidal ex-cop turned bodyguard who becomes the reluctant savior of humanity. Kevin Pollack makes way too many wisecracks as Arnie's sarcastic partner and buddy. Robin Tunney is ok as the potential mother of Lucifer's child,yet the role doesn't require her to do much but look scared and confused. Ah yes,Lucifer,that role is played by Gabriel Byrne who is a fine actor but isn't very effective here. He seems to be a combination of Al Pacino in The Devil's Advocate and Robert De Niro in Angel Heart but is nowhere near as good as either. There are lots of big scale action scenes and visual effects but they are wasted on the routine and formulaic story. It's too bad about Arnold,he used to be the king of action but he lost his way somewhere down the line. I really hope he will again make movies as good as the Terminator films,Predator,Total Recall,etc. End of Days doesn't match up to Arnie's eighties heyday.",End of Days

It deserves more than what it's already got.Arnie does a great job in this movie. It's one of his best in my opinion. It sucks when he gets killed and stuffs up the ending. The ending could have been better in my opinion. Arnie actually acts properly in this movie. In movies like Kindergarten Cop, Predator, Terminator 1+2 and True Lies he didn't really do that much acting...just getting a gun and killing people.
Gabriel Byrne also does a good job like always. He plays the devil better than Al Pacino does in the Devil's Advocate. He provides a lot of comical moments in this movie. The scene in Arnie's joint is cool.

No, not only very good, but absolutely fantastic! He always has this diabolic smile on his face and looks really cool with it. Even if I don't consider Schwarzenegger a very good actor, he wasn't bad in this film. Sorry, but I can't understand why people think this film is bad. I give it 8/10. The action-sequences and explosions are great, the whole story and script also. As I said, Byrne was the right choice in this film to play the devil.

I went to this movie, and I wanted big, I wanted bad, I wanted world-spanning, I wanted drama and conflict and Armageddon and a final showdown between the forces of heaven and hell, and, by God, I wanted to see Satan lead a holocaust of such fury that the living would envy the dead.Instead I got a couple of burning buildings and a subway train gone accordian.It's an above average action movie...

Maybe it was my mistake to see this right after ""The World Is Not Enough"", but there was a HUGE difference in the quality of the two movies. While TWINE had awesome gadgets, a great plot, and one heck of a final fight, End of Days was just the opposite. Arnold has apparently forgotten how to act (though I've got to give credit to Gabriel Byrne for giving the part more depth then it really had) and some of the cinematography was among the worst I had ever seen. The special effects themselves were pretty cool.There are logic and plot holes in this movie that I could drive a semi through as well.

Don't try to deny it.But there is one thing I've noticed in several of the other comments that I had to respond to. A lot of people seem to think it was dumb that Satan didn't just kill Jericho while he had the chance. After all, there were a dozen occasions in the movie where he could have just ripped the guy's head off and had sex with Christine without interference. What those people don't seem to get is that Gabriel Byrne's character was NEVER THE ONE WHO WAS SUPPOSED TO IMPREGNATE CHRISTINE. It was JERICHO who was destined at birth to be the biological father of the Anti-Christ. That's why Satan hired that particular bodyguard in the first place: to get him involved. That's why he didn't possess Jericho earlier in the movie: because Jericho wasn't yet ready to serve as a vessel. That's why, as he was leading Christine to the altar in the church to rape her, Satan/Jericho told her ""Everything is as it should be"". Old Scratch needed this guy to be alive and with Christine at the big moment so he could possess him. That seemed like a pretty obvious conclusion before the movie was half over, but I guess not everyone could see it even while it was happening.",End of Days

As a Christian, it often frustrates me that Christians are portrayed in the movies as either psychotics or idiots. While there certainly was a share of both in this movie, the ending got Christianity right. There's Arnold, bruised, battered, broken, bloody, beaten, in a church, waiting for the devil to show up. He throws down his gun, drops to his knees and pleads to the statue of Christ ""I can't do it. I need you."" That's right - it's not Arnold's muscles, guns or even accent that defeat the bad guy. It's Christ! I never thought I'd see something like this in any kind of secular movie, let alone a Schwarzenegger shoot-em-up.

In order not to be captivated by the Philistines, the wounded King throws himself upon his own sword. Arnold didn't have a sword, but this scene still imparts a deeper meaning to the film: the war the Evil wages against the humankind is still impossible to win, but it exacts a great toll... Needless to say, the resemblance between Jericho and Christ is also striking: both offered themselves up to save the humankind.

It's certainly better than his efforts as Mr. Freeze in Batman and Robin (it was just a horrible film altogether, inevitably). I'm a big Arnold fan, ever since I saw his old Commando movie, but the star who really shines in this film is Gabriel Byrne. You can tell that he either took the role with a sense of importance or just really enjoyed it and had fun, because he pulls of the Satan role very effectively. It's amazing that this man can play a character as sinister as that and turn around and play a priest in Stigmata, both to such effectiveness. Aside from these two, the rest of the cast is on par. The female lead is good but doesn't present strong starpower, and I don't expect to see her in many more films as a lead. The rest of the cast is supporting and very insignificant to the story, which is ho-hum.Overall, the film is in the middle. Not cream of the crop, but not a stinking pile of dung. Arnold fans will enjoy it. Those intrigued with the Book of Revelations and biblical mythos will enjoy it. Best advice: watch and decide for yourself.

Other user comments go more into details; I would just like to complain that Hollywood should really learn again to put more effort into the stories and less into stunts and special effects. Even if the latter are not bad, they are not a surrogate for hollow plots, and would profit from clever ideas at the basis of a movie. ""Terminator"" and ""Predator"" are Schwarzenegger action/special effects movies with such ideas underneath, ""End of days"" much less so.",End of Days

The movie has lots of potential; big name action star (Arnold), a credible sidekick (Kevin Pollack), a beautiful young ""damsel in distress"" (Robin Tunney), decent special effects, and an intriguing plot. The movie has elements of being an action movie and elements of being a horror movie. Unfortunately, it fails at both.  The movie had just enough going for it to keep my attention.  However, at the end of the movie, I was scratching my head in bewilderment.  This is the type of movie you rent (DO NOT BUY--SAVE YOUR MONEY) to kill a few hours on a Friday or Saturday night.",End of Days
298,Mike-969,Getting better...,7,26 November 1999,"Being an avid Arnold fan, I naturally raced out to see his much anticipated ""triumphant"" return.  Unlike many, I loved much of his early work, including Commando, Running Man, even Raw Deal.  His documentary, Pumping Iron, was excellent as well.  Total Recall, the Terminator series, even Red Heat - all I enjoyed despite his ""acting"" abilities.  These movies were simply entertaining; they are not meant to evoke some cathartic experience. However, as his salary ballooned and his focus shifted away from traditional action, the quality of his work deteriorated.  Examples: Jingle All the Way, Junior, Last Action Hero (an insult to Arnold fans everywhere), and Batman and Robin.  However, End of Days does somewhat repair the damage.End of Days does provide a worthy action vehicle for Arnold's talents.  He speaks some great one-liners and has some good action scenes. Unfortunately, the script is poorly written (shocking given the staggering budget of this flick).  Commando is the tightest, most logical script on par with Gone with the Wind compared to this script.  First, Andrew Marlowe, the scriptwriter, does absolutely no character development whatsoever.  Not that it is expected from an Arnold movie, but it is nice to know who the hell the character is.  If I hadn't read the reviews ahead of time, I would have had a difficult time determining that he was even a security guard for Gabriel Byrne.  The action just starts, no explanation.  Then, periodically, we have some ridiculous plot points drawn.  I think Marlowe spent a weekend searching through his Gideon bible from a hotel room trying to figure out how to make his storyline make sense.  For example, the 666 meaning 999 and then, just add a 1.  Figuring out that Christ in New York means Christine York and that there is only one Christine York in a city of over 9 million people.  Please...  Then, you get Arnold just making dumb decisions , which is usually out of character for the action star.  For example, when Arnold disconnects the subway cars during an action scene, he does so from the wrong subway car and then, jumps to the disconnected car with Christine York.  Why didn't Arnold simply disconnect the subway car from the other side, the side with Christine York in it in the first place?  Things just don't make sense.  Finally, the ending is not very good.  Predictable and been done  before.Despite these criticisms, this movie does entertain.  Without Arnold, it would be sitting on a shelf next to Mars Attacks.  However, Arnold makes this movie.  Hopefully, this is the beginning of better movies to come.",End of Days

Peter Hyams clichés, natural/dark cinematography, fast editing, pulse-pounding soundtrack are clearly print on the film.

I mean, in Terminator it was convincing to keep John (or Sarah) Connor alive, in order to save all mankind. The girl in EoD, however, was a danger as long as she´d be living!

I enjoyed watching it and did not get the feeling that I had been there and done that.  I had read some of the other reviews here at IMDB and everyone has a right to their own opinion, but if there is anything that could be said against the movie is, that the character of the Devil is watered down.  At times, watching the character was like seeing a Vampire horror movie and none of the blood suckers had fangs.

Sadly this film panders to the lowest common denominator and reduces Arnold to a bellowing, grunting, face contorting muscle that just knows how to shoot guns and blow things up.  In a cliche last moment (and at one other time), that was predictable from the start, we see a glimmer of the actor that has proven he is more than what he got paid for early in his career.

Ninth Gate: Noir-ish, intelligent, nicely scored, atmospheric, excellent acting (Johnny Depp, esp), beautiful scenery, good cinematography, funny one-liners, intellectual, minimal foul language, thought-provoking. The only fault is it that a few people didn't understand the open-ended ending and said the movie was ""crappy"" because of that and there were a couple of questionable scenes.End of Days: Overly violent, liberal use of foul language, NO musical score except for a poor attempt at a commercial soundtrack that was only heard when Gabriel Byrne stalked around NYC as Satan (but all you could pick out was Korn's Jonathan Davis unintelligible screaming), sex that had nothing to do with the plot, violence, incredibly predictable, violence, and did I mention lots more violence? I guess some of the special effects were good but that's about it.Well, maybe I'm wrong but I thought Ninth Gate was far more interesting, quirky, original, and intelligent.

312,nicholas-turner-326-51288,Ahnuld in top form!,8,28 March 2012,"I don't know about other people, but I rather enjoyed End of Days just because of the ridiculous concept.End of Days did impress me with its dark and ominous atmosphere. The mood was decidedly creepy and on occasion gets rather disturbing. Hyams conjures up some pretty evil and demented scenes, although not as disturbing if you've seen the recent pictures with similar undertones. The action is orchestrated with style and vigor, especially the whole subway-bit and the scene with Arnold dangling from a police helicopter. Byrne's performance as Ole Nick himself is very understated, but one gaze conveys as much evil as Pacino did with a whole monologue. Who said less is more? Kudos to Stan ""The Man"" Winston for the icky demon at the end, although it could have done with some more screen time.End of Days does however suffer because of the premise of merging action with heavy religious themes. The broody atmosphere suffers when the action kicks in and Arnold starts blasting away with his machine gun. This was kind of distracting and at some times seemed rather ludicrous as well. Also, poor Arnold has to do away with evil all by himself, action-hero style, which somehow conveys the wrong message to me. End of Days is also pretty derivative and the whole ""Satan takes a bride""-premise has been done much better before, even when it was delivered as a comedy aka The Witches of Eastwick (Jack is still to date the best Devil...). But since End of Days is such a dramatic departure for Arnold, the movie shouldn't be compared to classics like The Omen and The Ninth gate at all. Instead, enjoy it for what it is: well-produced escapism. Lots of action, gore and some shivers-up-your-spine imagery. Thanks, Arnold, you did it again!!!",End of Days

Unfortunately the movie didn't end there and we had to suffer through the next course of Satanist massacre (who thought of this plot?).

A not so American-ish film (which is a compliment coming from me, believe me). Only real shortcoming I guess is the connection to the millennium-change, which gives the film a bit short lifespan.

322,Toth-3,GREAT COMEBACK!,10,14 December 1999,"I was reading a lot of comments further down the page on how so many people just didn't like this movie. I find it hard to believe, especially how they are coming up with all this technical BS. Who cares! It's an Arnie movie! You don't exactly go into an Arnie movie looking for the perfect plot, great acting, etc. You go in for some gun fights, explosions, and Arnie kicking the living c**p out of somebody. Well, at least that is what I go in thinking. This movie surprised me with the deep plot and Arnie actually doing possibly his best acting as a human (excluding the Terminators). The first hour and 50 minutes of the movie was excellent, but there were a few holes and the ending was mediocre, but oh well, nothing can be perfect. A few things I didn't care for too much in the movie, was, I didn't think that Arnie's partner (Pollack) got enough time. He reminded me a great deal of Tim Arnold in True Lies, but they didn't really develop him enough. It was just basically, he's in and out. If they added another 30 or so minutes it might have been a much better movie, but then again, that might have caused this nonstop action movie to drag just a bit, because how much action can you possibly stuff into one movie. This movie also has some excellent scenes, I am not gonna spoil the ending for people who haven't seen it, but it was sort of a disappointment. I was expecting something HUGE to top everything off, but instead, we got something much less. That, in my opinion, is what made this movie a Very Good movie instead of an Excellent movie. This movie is #4 on Arnie's all time list behind the Terminators and Predator.",End of Days

Arnold Schwarzenegger, who is supposed to play an alcoholic, does an okay job of acting.  However, because Arnold is soo in shape, I found it difficult to believe that he is an alcoholic (no bear gut, he was just not clean shaven, this does not make me believe alcoholic, it makes me think. . .gee this guy doesn't like to shave).  Gabriel Byrne the handsome Irish man does a Magnificent job, as usual!  What an interesting move to go from a priest in Stigamata to the Devil in End Of Days!  He plays both parts with amazing belief.  Although, I do wish they had decided to have Mr. Byrne play Lucifer with a thick Irish accent emphasis on thick. No one would every think the Devil would be Irish.  American, yeah but not Irish!

It's sad that the last 1/2 hour has to result in the standard arnie 'uzi 9mm' finale. Arnies interpretation of a depressed cop is to bow his head and sniff. i thought he had a bad cold for most of the film. Dreadfully scripted, Arnie is called 'buddy', 'dude' etc for 95% of the film and then suddenly we hear him being called by his real name of Jericho Cane (where do they get these names from??).

Arnold mantles the reluctant good guy character in the form of ex cop, who lost wife and child, who stumbles on a solution to save the world. Good special effects, and I like the theological explanations the movie gives to explain the whole apocalypse thing. The first time I saw this movie I remember thinking that is was a fantastic movie the entire time. Then the last ten minutes rolled along and the movie went from great to typical.

The sheer absurdity of the climactic battle, in which Jericho (Arnold) does terrific damage to Satan with bullets and far larger projectiles, left me breathless with laughter. Everything is clichéd, predictable, stupid. Nothing makes sense and while the action is quite fun it's preposterous in a movie about personal salvation.To abandon this critical framework, as a piece of insane cheese, this is one of the greatest ever movies of the kind. Its prudish covering of body parts in sex scenes, indulgence in trashy visuals (tongue in a jar; eyelids stitched shut; and the early warning glimpse of a fetus in the credit sequence), ridiculous sentimentality, and utter unwillingness to make sense place it in a category few turkeys ever break into.Worth it all: the crucifixion of Arnold",End of Days

331,Arisenandawakened,My First Movie Review/Revisions of Message Board Posts,1,22 April 2007,"How about renaming the first message board post about this movie, ""The Only Enjoyable Aspects of an Otherwise Steaming Pile of Human Fecal Matter"" instead of ""Reasons Why End of Days is the Greatest Movie of All Times"". That would actually be true. The list posted is truly indeed, the only fine points about this crap of a waste of an hour and a half of my life of a movie. I was laughing out loud as I was reading through the reasons that person listed. Absolutely hilarious. Here's what I think. Arnie gave the Devil hell. He single handedly killed a Predator. He defeated evil clones of himself. A couple of times I might add. Once in the future and once in the future on a distant planet. Took out the whole of the Columbian drug cartel and guerilla terrorist cell, all the while as a forced to resign fireman. He survived the most heinous murderous reality T.V. show full of professional killers. Saved his one and only daughter from evil plotting terrorists. Not only once, but twice. As Hercules, he played the half-god son of Zeus. He was the baddest Barbarian in the all lands. Trained to be a killing machine that could take on evil sorcerers and sorceress in his sleep. Not to mention, he was the sole savior of little John Conner and the whole human race, once more, on multiple occasions. But he couldn't please all those voters. Damn those Cali taxes and pot holes... What were they thinking? Who cares. ""End of Days"" is crap. I actually think it made me stupider for having sat through it. Whether it be stupider from the actual movie itself physically draining my intelligence. Or perhaps stupider just in the fact that I did not avert my eyes to such immense amounts of runny, chunky celluloid diarrhea. Avoid this movie at all costs. It will make you have an embolism. Blood vessels in your brain will burst. You will bleed from your eyes. Those dollar bills would be better spent being used as toilet paper than being used to pay to watch this movie in any way. Even if you only spend .50 on a DVDR to rip this movie, there is a body of water somewhere you could make a wish on that would be money better spent. Just to explain a little more... I went to see this movie when it was released because it had such a remarkable soundtrack. Talk about blind bad luck. There were a few scenes that remain mentionable. Namely, the mother/daughter-Devil love fest. That was hot. LOL But that's all this movie was worth. A few good laughs at how horrible it is, is more like it. I was so enraged that I had paid good money to watch such horrendous, well everything, that I decided that the theater was going to let me watch a good movie for free. So, while I was exiting the local movie megaplex I managed to dart into a nearby theater to watch ""Sleepy Hollow"". Thank the powers that be for redeeming my faith and reminding me that not all Hollywood movies are complete trash. Some directors actually take pride in their work. Really. Thank you Tim Burton. However, I still feel that I am permanently scarred and somewhat retarded for having watched the entirety of what is ""End of Days"". I have not, nor will I ever, subject what little is left of my brain to the direct trauma and torture, of said movie again. It was a decision that I greatly regret, that I had chosen Arnie over Tim Burton originally when I went to the theater to watch a movie. Never again will I make that mistake. It was an asinine decision, from the get I admit. But it was Gabriel Byrnes as the Devil. I mean..., come on! I thought that in no way could they mess that up... Again blind bad luck I guess.

There were gales of laughter (and groans) from the audience as the film lumbered through silly action sequences and contrived quasi-Christian rhetoric. Many awful scenes are strung together like a recycled heap of Seven, Rosemary's Baby, and The Devil's Advocate; without any of those film's merits.  Hyams' forced-angle camera destroys any rhythm the scenes could have had as his actors spin wildly to and fro, looking like children lost in Satan's theme park.

When you put together one of the biggest box office draws, Satan and lots of pretty impressive visual and sound effects. The story is pretty predictable but entertaining. Satan has returned looking for a bride who has been in safe keeping all her life for him to come and impregnate her. This is in order to bring the End of Days where he can walk the earth and rule supreme.It's a valiant effort to get Arnie into a more sophisticated character that does not just go around shooting people and blowing things up. He is actually trying to grips with himself much the same as Riggs is in the original Lethal Weapon. With a little more coaching I think that Arnie could have pulled it off. When we left my girlfriend and I commented that if the main character had been played by someone like Mel Gibson or Bruce Willis the film would have carried more weight to it.But having said that we thought that on the whole the movie was pretty good, so if you want to go out and be entertained by a good old action movie over the holiday period then End of Days is just the picture for you.",End of Days

I'm not even going to comment on the many plot holes because, hey, it's an action movie.  There's no sense of fun to the film at all and they let Arnold try to talk way too much.

Has it really been 35 years since ""The Pawnbroker"" was released?Arnold is, well, Arnold.  Without competent direction and a decent story, he's just a pumped-up Austrian peasant lost in the big city.

Overall I thought that Mr. Schwarzenegger didn't exhibit the passion (i.e. ""the hunger"") he presented in his earlier films and the acting of the other players was wanting; Mr. Gabriel Byrne has been much better is his other flicks like ""The Usual Suspects"". Mr. Kevin Pollak saved the day however on the acting front. The screenplay and direction were below par; the special effects were OK.

I was excited about this film, despite a lackluster trailer, because it used fancy technology called a website to engender a feeling of fear and interest within me.  Now I understand, this movie really DOES signal the end...of quality filmmaking. Where should I begin?Was it Peter Hyams, performing far, far below par, even for him?  Peter Hyams has always been a talented hack ('Capricorn One','Outland','2010','Timecop','Sudden Death'), but this time out it appears he was in the grip of a malaise not felt by a studio director since Irwin Allen barfed out 'The Swarm'.  I mean, this film LOOKS like it was made in the seventies, with big fake pieces of fake cement wall falling down, a big fake looking miniature subway train blowing up in a totally fake Japanese monster movie way, and big fake burning window panes straight out of an episode of 'The Big Valley'. Imagine the big fake falling rocks from 'Earthquake', cross it with the sets (the very SAME sets) from 'Soylent Green', and then imagine that every 10 minutes or so the budget included an crappy-looking cgi effect.  I refuse to believe that it cost 100 million.  Fake fake fake!  What good is an idiotic action movie when it doesn't even deliver the carnage?
Or was it the script?  Obviously written with 10 year old white boys in mind, and adults with similar mentalities.  All I'm gonna say is that I wouldn't be surprised if the Christian Coalition had co-funded this movie. The amount of strange, intolerant messages sent by this film as actually quite frightening.The soundtrack should be discussed, since it refused to be ignored!  It's as if the filmmakers said 'Ahem, this is really boring and fake, how can we make it seem important?  I know, a loud soundtrack with unwarranted menacing horn bursts!'Or how about Arnold himself?  I can't believe him, taking part in this film. I used to love him!  It was okay that he was kind of a bully, because he seemed so tongue-in-cheek.  All it tells me is that he has no idea of what quality is, and that he just lucked out previously.Ah, What's the point?  It sucks, hugely.  WWF fans will flock to it anyway.

The large bat-demon at the end did not have enough screen time, it just came up, kicked Arnie and went.Clearly they tried to make this as cerebral as possible but it just doesnt come off, Arnie cant act, he is only good when it comes to the type of environment created by James Cameron, not supernatural thrillers, he hasnt got the depth to act in this filom and so the mish mash of Thriller and action doesnt come off. 4/10 beacause it relies on a few nasty shocks and the familiar Gabriel Byrne-Kevin Pollack decent suporting actor jobs.",End of Days

Commando, Raw Deal, and Conan come to mind. But it seems that he's tried to be more serious since his career was mocked by The Last Action Hero.  That movie undermined everything that Arnold has stood for to me for his entire career.  Since then, he has yet to utter the most recognized Arnold phrase ""I'll Be Back.""  His movies are becoming more ""legit"" and less ""campy.""  I've always found campy to be a term used by people who enjoy watching sludge, but don't like to call it such. (i.e. horror movies that are funnier than they are scary)  He attempted to continue his standard style with True Lies, but everyone seemed to see through his barrage of smooth-neckbreakings, perfect aim combined with unhittabillity, and stream of comedic lines.  Since then, his movies have gotten further from what typical Arnold fans appreciate, but without normal movie fans taking him seriously.  Therefore, people have decided he's fallen.  He's moved from where he succeeded to more actual acting, even the occasional unfunny comedy.  End Of Days is NOT a typical classic Arnold movie.  This movie is dark, creepy, and GOOD.  This is a good movie. While Arnold has, finally, shown he can actually do some real acting, this movie really wasn't a role for him.  He does a good job in this, but the role didn't really fit him.  I mean, c'mon... a man is drinking himself to death... and he looks like THAT?  I doubt it.  I personally would have chosen maybe Bruce Willis.  That said, I think this is one of the best movies Arnold has done, by true movie standards.  By Arnold movie standards... its not really the same thing.  Considering what else he's done since Terminator 2, this was pretty outstanding.  Junior, Jingle All the Way, and the much-maligned Batman & Robin were all steps in the wrong direction.  This was a good movie that didn't really appeal to anyone because, A: its not a real Arnold movie, and B: it has Arnold in it; it can't be good.  If you watch this with an open mind, you'll enjoy a typically brilliant performance from the ever-versatile Gabriel Byrne, who played Satan immediately after playing a priest, both impeccably.  If you're a extremely religious person, you'll probably be offended by it, as it says things people don't like to hear about their religion.  If you don't go in looking for a kill-fest, or expecting action-slop, you'll see a dark, noir-esque, scary film.  overall 8.5 out of 10",End of Days

I'm an Arnold fan, and the concept sounded goofy enough that it could be fun. Also no matter how bad it could be, it could never be any worse then the abomination Batman & Robin. I rented this on VHS about a week after it came out at Blockbuster. I heard the mixed reviews, but it's a Schwarzenegger film, they're never Oscar gold worthy. So I popped some popcorn and sat down to watch it.To my surprise, it was actually good. Better then the average Schwarzenegger film. Sure it didn't have all the typical Schwarzenegger quirks, and gimmicks, because for once it tried to be more then just a Schwarzenegger film. For that I respected it. However it still wasn't perfect, you had plot holes, you had some bad dialog, some bad acting(Robin Tunney), and they pulled their punches at times and didn't push it further. However it was still entertaining.The original script for ""End of Days"" was darker, and more graphic. Also the film was to originally be directed by Marcus Nispel, who directed the remakes for Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Friday the 13th, and Conan. I can just imagine how much more graphic, longer, and inappropriate the mother/daughter threesome with The Devil would have been. However that version would have starred Tom Cruise in the title role of Jericho Cane, Udo Kier as the Devil, and Kate Winslet as Christine York. With Robert Englund as The Satanic Priest, and actresses Shannon Tweed, and Christina Hendricks rumored for the roles of the Satanic Priest's Wife, and Daughter. Ah what could have been.In the end it was still a decently entertaining film.

Apart from them making the common error of setting the turn of the century/millennium a year too soon in 1999, the year 2000 is only the last year of the 'accepted' second millennium of the Christian era, we now know Christ was born around 6BC; and the 'arbitrary' time reference point hinges around Greenwich, not Arnold.

I guess some of you fans can miss some heavy weapons and rapid-fired action but, instead you get a more balanced performance with some minor flaws in the plot and great lines in some of the dialogues.

Did you really have to make a movie about these rather obvious topics?Poorly written (Did the screenwriters even bother to read the Bible, or just a few lines of Revelations?), embarrassingly acted, and ineptly directed, End of Days is one of the worst films of the decade. Schwarzenegger, whose appeal I've never truly understood, delivers one of the least compelling performances of what was never exactly a brilliant career. Rod Steiger (another mystery to me) proves, with his one-note delivery, that A) his best days are WELL behind him (Like, 1966), and B) he really needs the money.I'm trying desperately to think of anything appealing about End of Days, and I am just plain drawing a blank.

I had some big problems with this movie though.First, you have the script which is terrible.  Then you have the rip-offs. If you have seen Usual Suspects(also starring Gabe Byrne and Kevin Pollack), Devil's Advocate, Empire Strikes Back, True Lies, Predator 2, Speed, Rosemary's Baby, and even South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut, then you have seen all the scenes in this movie.  I was especially upset when an EXACT quote from Usual Suspects was used and a slightly different scene to one in Usual Suspects happened in the movie.  Gabriel Byrne, as Satan, has a dialogue with Arnold that looks like it was stolen from Devil's Advocate and then turns into Empire Strikes Back's Climax with Arnold hanging out his window.Other little things that bothered me were the names of the characters like Christine York(of which Arnold guesses is the identity to the woman in a totally unrealistic and idiotic way), Thomas Aquinas, and Jericho Cane. Now, I am an athiest so I had no problem with what others may interpret from use of religion in this movie...but it was just DUMB!AND FINALLY...The Kicker for me was the line that went: ""TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT, WHAT YOU REALLY REALLY WANT.""This movie should tell Hollywood to slow down and look at itself.  The fact that this movie is totally unoriginal and a movie as original as Being John Malkovich can be in theaters at the same time really shows me that there is junk and there is greatness in movies still.  I am tired of remakes of great movies coming out and movies that rip-off entirely from what has been successful in the past.

Arnold puts forth his usual, physical, charismatic performance.  But the plot, the supporting characters, the theme, the whole movie - well, just stunk.  I would almost have preferred staying home and watching Red Sonja and Junior.Arnold, Gabriel Byrne and Kevin Pollack are all very good in End of Days. However - there was just something lacking?!  When you leave a movie of this magnitude and all that's on your mind is - ""what about that,"" or ""what about this,"" versus, ""why don't I get back in line and see it again?!""

372,skinny-12,How about buying a good script before you start?,5,2 January 2000,"I have to say that I went to this movie with fairly low expectations and unfortunately I was not wrong. Yes, the special effects are good as usual but if the producers had spent just a fraction of that money on a good script, this could have been something above average. I personally think that Arnold is wrong for this story. It requires a strong (i.e. charismatic NOT physically strong) actor to drag the main character into the story, and in my humble opinion he just doesn't pull it off. The rest of the cast is doing a good job.  Kevin Pollak (as the cynical partner) add a little extra to a roll that I personally would have liked to see expanded. Robin Tunney, C.C.H Pounder, Rod Steiger and Udo Kier all make good performances and Gabriel Bryne is excellent as the devil (when he is allowed to act the roll).Thus you have a (generally) good cast and a big budget so why doesn't this movie lift off? In my opinion it's because the story (and maybe the producers) doesn't dare to show things in more colors than Black vs. White. There is no gray scales whatsoever. Why is it that American films so often seem to think that Evil must be portrayed as an absolute evil? Bryne's roll should have been so much more convincing if he had been allowed to play it more ""dark gray"". By giving the devil more of a human character you will actually be more scared of him since he will be less predictable and more like yourself.  There is an attempt to do this with ""the White side"" but unfortunately it fails, still that intention was good. (What could have made this even more interesting would have been to include a few atheists in some of the scenes, completely unaffected by the whole thing since it is based on faith...)So, if you feel that you have some spare money and like to see good special effects then maybe this movie is for you.

Arnold struggles through his lines and the action sequences are generic and over-reliant on explosions, gun play, and computer generated effects.  The plot is silly and rehashes the trite and much over used cinematic story line of God versus Satan.

Every time ""The Man"" comes onscreen, a religious type song is played, which got old after the first five times you see him, and of course all of the heavy songs by big bands are played at odd times most likely so you will notice them, not to compliment the movie.

383,garnet_steen,A real disappointment - overblown digital action without dramatic impact.,4,26 November 1999,"Synopsis:  Save your money and splice together Commando with The Devil's Advocate, whose last scene with Al Pacino and Keanu Reeves makes me embarrassed for Arnold and Gabriel Byrne.Many people have complained about Arnold's recent films (Eraser et al.) but End of Days ranks as one of his worst.  I put it down there with the Last Action Hero in the category of trying to do something beyond a straightforward action film, but without having the courage to marry that enviable goal with a decent plot, a logical story-flow or credible acting.When you watch an action film, there is a certain immediate suspension of disbelief - the kind that lets the viewer accept the absurd A-Team-style action sequences of an earlier Arnold film like Commando.  But when you see a dramatic film - even a dramatic-action film, the picture needs to make sense.  You know, those little things like plot, motivation, character development etc...End of Days ultimately fails because it doesn't make sense.  It also fails because it doesn't play to Arnold's considerable strengths as a performer. Without giving too much away, I was constantly asking myself questions like, ""Why does Satan need a bodyguard?  Why is Rod Steiger still alive after Satan has killed everyone else in the church? Why are they crucifying Arnold instead of killing him?""Keep in mind, I'm not questioning the obvious action sequences, or why Arnold's boss let's him gear-up a la Commando for the final showdown with Satan, without even asking why this drunken, deadbeat, ex-cop who hasn't reported in for a couple of days needs a rocket launcher. That's par for the course.In the end, End of Days would have been much better if it had aimed lower and been a straight-ahead action film with lots of Arnold screen time, a few new corny Arnoldisms (""I'll be back"" etc.), more action scenes, fewer digital effects and some decent second-string villains for Arnold to vanquish.Alternatively, it could have been a really interesting film if it had tried to build on the dramatic tension the film tries to create in sequences like the long discussion between Satan and Arnold.  But alas, that would have required a decent story.",End of Days

Nonetheless, another fine performance from Byrne.Kevin Pollock delivers a great performance as Canes' partner in arms, Chigago, providing some fantastic comic elements to the movie to loosen up the audience after one of the man tense sequences.Robin Tunney *most memorable as Sarah Bailey in ""The Craft""* is Christine York, the doe-eyed damsel in distress who has been selected by Beezlebub to bear his child. Although she is not given much more to do other than look frightened or run screaming, she was quite good working with what she was given.So, with the new millennium coming up within less than 3 days, you could think of this movie as: A) A sign of doom B) A ""welcome back"" vehicle for Arnie or C) A joy ride filled with good special effects, intriguing topics and actors having a ball playing their characters.I give ""End of Days"" **** out of *****",End of Days

It is sad that they (the directors) wasted the brilliance and wonder for a film that would otherwise be a total masterpiece. Not only did they mess up good film concepts but they also tried to make a worthless image of the higher power; I don't believe that Jesus would ever allow Satin to kill numerous amounts of human beings. If End of Days was going to get any larger rating, it would need to have a person of higher power fighting off evil (like in Constantine). But in a way it doesn't matter to me because the fact that the storyline revolves a newly resurrected Satin is completely disturbing.

""End of Days"" takes place right around when 1999 was coming to an end and many people thought the world was too. Well in the film the Devil(Well played by Gabriel Byrne)must mate with a chosen woman who could bring the earth to an end. So, it's up to burned out cop Arnold to stop this plot from happening.The movie has a very goofy story only teenagers would find brilliant, but the movie does have lots of big loud action,great performances,and is well directed by Peter Hyams(Sudden Death,A Sound Of Thunder).",End of Days
396,darlyl_lulyco,Movie overall good,4,9 February 2021,"The movie overall was good. Is just that Arnold Schwarzenegger wasn't that great of an actor and that ""Agnus Day SONG!!!!!! Just annoying "". That's it, you can watch the movie because is great and entertaining, but Arnold....... that acting, was awful and the ""Agnus Day"" is something else.",End of Days
397,fvillalobos75,So bad you wish you could laugh about it,1,1 August 2002,"Let's summarize how dumb this movie is with two details : Arnold to Antichrist : ""Let's see who is meanest"" said with a straight face. And you can tell they were not trying to be funny.How do you think Arnold will battle the evil of all evils?Blessed Water, A crucifix, a priest..nooo! with a bazooka, yes not even Satan expected it they're so clever.After an engaging beginning (which reminds you of Devil's Advocate) it goes nowhere. Somebody get me those two hours of my life back. Don't ever watch it, rent it, lest buy it.",End of Days
398,squiauhtlazollin,A millennium has finished and IT has left triggered its prison,8,27 March 2002,"A millennium has finished and IT has left triggered its prison. Without late it has returned to the Earth to demand it like its everlasting kingdom. For it it must fuse its meat with the one of maid that their followers have prepared in the capital of the sin: New York. There one goes of etérea, safe form of his triumph, because by the end of the century XX is plus which they watch downwards that upwards. But for his misfortune, it does not have count a hero: Schwarzennegger, who will make pay expensive his dare: with explosions, shots, train crashes and fights to by greater, the Austrian will make suffer most humiliating of the defeats to the one of the 666, that that not only dared to defy God but, total blasphemy, it wanted to make see his luck the loved star of Hollywood. Once again we confirmed that neither very same Lucifer can against the overpaid steroid coat. Impressive by its technical resolution, End of days, of the director Peter Hyams is, without a doubt, the best visual exercise of this effective craftsman, who in his hands has had the good one finished of jewels of the action like ""Sudden Death"" or films of made science affluent fiction like ""2010"" . With End of days Hyams it not only confirms why the studies trust estimated millionaires to him, but in addition revives the weak star of Arnold, that after turkeys as Batman and Robin and The protector did not see his. But there are some who yes will jump with End of days, and those are the religiously orthodox ones: how they would let do it, if in the Arnold film will be attemped by the demon, crucificado and finally it will finish crossed by an iron as it happened in the Gólgota 1966 years ago? Parallelism is too evident to avoid it, but luckyly the frenetic edition, grandiloquent music and the overwhelming special effects will cause that the analysis yields their site to the adrenalin. The director Peter Hyams obtains with End of days that we swallow the pill once again, although now we must pass through our throat the inflated volume of Schwarzennegger.",End of Days
399,kelly0719,Most likable Arnold movie since True Lies,10,24 December 2002,"""End of Days"" had its main character more realistic than other Arnold films, he was not invincible in this role, had suicidal tendency due to the painful lost of family and suffered from the guilt thereafter. Arnold portrayed this character with emotions that I could identify with, very real, and his acting was quite subtle at some scenes, I was not a fan until I saw this one, then consequently I bought it on DVD.The main problem about this film is its trailer, I don't know if the trailer on DVD was actually the theatrical trailer while it released, but it's very unappealing compared to the substance of this film to say the least.
On the contrary, the two MV on DVD are much better edited than the trailer, I am glad Terminator 3 will be released by Warner Bros instead of Universal Studio, at least WB knows better when it comes to promotion. It's a pity that ""End of Days""was much superior than it seemed from the trailer.
Other complaint is that the DVD reveals too much secret of the special effects making, it's terrific that those stunts were made very believable, and the CGI was great, but is it necessary to exhibit how they were made? It only reduces wonderment next time you see it, personally I would rather not know these technical things, and believe it's all actually happened (e.g. church explosions and train derailment).Other than those two mentioned above, this film is very good, its atmosphere is thrilling, Usually I hate to watch action films, especially overly violent ones. But Arnold 's acting in this film impressed me a lot and kept me captivated throughout the viewing, It's probably that I like to watch a more realistic character than superhuman ones although the latter are cooler.End of Days is my second favorite Schwarzenegger movie, btw he looked very good in this film, not changed a bit since I last saw him in Eraser except that his performance in End of Days is better than Eraser. He didn't look older after these years, he's more than double my age, but that's not the point, the point is he looks really great and charismatic, it's quite amazing.",End of Days
400,fivish,The ending is very special,9,5 March 2012,"The film plods along with the usual stuff that we have come to expect from such a story line. But, the ending of this film is very special. It is one of the few films of the genre that comes close to the nature of prayer and man being made in Gods image. Arnold prays to the effigy of Jesus for salvation but nothing happens. He realises that only his actions, killing himself (and hence the devil), would bring salvation. Only he could answer his prayers. This profound realisation is something that some religions fail to appreciate. I have many times recalled the ending of this film when trying to explain the nature of prayer. For this alone the film is worthy of merit.",End of Days
401,smetsch,Few highlights in this movie,5,26 January 2006,"I can't add much more than what's already been written. I thought Arnold did look bored at times, but he can still be imposing when needed. Gabriel Byrne was very good as Lucifer. I especially liked the scene when he planted one helluva kiss on an attractive woman at a restaurant. Sort of had the feeling that he was making up for lost time, that Satan doesn't get many chances to swap spit with an attractive babe very often down in Hades. Moments later, he snaps his finger and the place is destroyed by a huge fireball. A memorable scene. .. Also was surprised to see Satan resemble a huge dragon when he/it burst through the church floor. Kinda cool effects. Of course, Arnold triumphs in the end. The world will not see Satan's little kid running around New York City. And all is well. Not a great movie, but not an awful rental on a boring night.",End of Days
