0,SnoopyStyle,some minor laughs,5,20 October 2015,"Eric Keppler (Jason Sudeikis) and his friends from high school days continue to have outrageous parties at his family vacation home in the Hamptons. He is shocked when his father (Don Johnson) decides to sell the house. His slacker friend Mike (Tyler Labine) suggests getting everyone to have a Labor Day Orgy. Sue (Michelle Borth) has a secret crush on Eric. Adam (Nick Kroll) is a workaholic. Laura (Lindsay Sloane) has no confidence. Doug (Martin Starr) wishes to be a rocker instead of his regular life and has girlfriend Willow (Angela Sarafyan). Alison (Lake Bell) is a psychologist with a douchy boyfriend. Kate (Lucy Punch) and Glenn (Will Forte) are newlyweds and nobody wants them to join in the orgy. Eric falls for Kelly (Leslie Bibb), the real estate agent selling the house.I love almost every actor in this movie. I didn't really find much of it all that funny with the exception of the Punch-Forte pairing. At first, I couldn't figure out if they're actually playing twenty somethings. They act so childishly that it does take a good while before I got comfortable with them as older slackers with jobs. It's a functional comedy and then they get to the orgy.When the group gets into an argument, I was hoping that it gets interesting. It could have dived into their relationship dysfunctions. Instead, they dive into the orgy. It has some minor laughs at the expense of better exploration of their friendships. Overall, this is not terribly funny and despite the orgy, this is not terribly edgy either.",A Good Old Fashioned Orgy
1,nogodnomasters,THE LAMEST GENERATION,8,16 October 2018,"Eric (Jason Sudeikis) lives in his dad's summer home. He loves to throw parties for his circle of friends. He opts for his last party of the summer to throw an orgy. The gang which is at first reluctant is goaded into it because their generation missed out on the sex because of AIDS. They are ""the lamest generation.""Meanwhile the house is on the market and Eric has suddenly developed feeling for the realtor (Leslie Bibb) which did nothing for the story.The humor was hit and miss, but usually near the mark. There were some great scenes such as when the newlyweds are upset they weren't invited to the perv inner circle. I thought the orgy itself was anti-climatic as the writers needed to have a sex scene, but didn't know how to write one without much sex and still be funny.A me-too sex comedy, slightly above par.F-bombs, sex, nudity male and female (Dee Dee Rescher, Jon Stafford, Angela Sarafyan of ""Twilight"")",A Good Old Fashioned Orgy
2,paul_haakonsen,A great comedy for an adult audience...,7,17 January 2012,"Alright, well ""A Good Old Fashioned Orgy"" is basically all that you would want from a teen comedy, except that it has been spiced up and has a more mature content. Same recipe as a teen comedy, except it is meant for an adult audience. And it worked out so well. Especially because ""A Good Old Fashioned Orgy"" was more than just your average comedy. It is also a heartfelt movie about friendships and accepting one another for your unique personalities and coming to terms with yourself and life.I was genuinely surprised by the depth of this movie, because I had initially just thought it to be yet another comedy that comes out of Hollywood by the dozens every month. And I am glad that I did sit down to watch it, because it really was a great movie.And what made this movie so great, aside from the nice story, was of course the cast. They had really put together some nice actors and actresses for this movie, and the on-screen chemistry between then was working so well. The one who carried the movie, in my opinion, was Tyler Labine (playing Mike), he was hilarious and also had the most outrageous character. However, each and every one in the movie really did good jobs with their characters and in portraying them.If you like comedies that have a more solid foundation and story to it, you definitely want to check out ""A Good Old Fashioned Orgy"".",A Good Old Fashioned Orgy
3,StevePulaski,About as graphic as a sex-ed video,8,28 December 2011,"A Good Old Fashioned Orgy has the title, idea, and premise that seems like either a straight-to-DVD film or a Netflix: Watch Instant bound film. Shockingly enough, this film had a limited theatrical run but failed to gross any movie. It concludes the long, wet, hot summer we've had of crude, bodacious comedies and very unorthodox setups in a loud and memorable way.The film greatly reminds me of the original American Pie film because its characters are nice enough to like, sentimental enough to believe, and quirky enough to remember. It is hard to believe they'd all agree so broadly to take part in an orgy when they've all been friends for so long. Putting plausibility behind me for just a few small circumstances I can say that I laughed longer and louder at A Good Old Fashioned Orgy than many films this past summer.Eric (Sudeikis) is an adult who never grew up. He continues to have loud and lewd parties at his father's beach house where odd antics and scantily clad women flood the place. When his father announces plans to place the house on the market, Eric devises a plan with his seven buddies to have one final event Labor Day weekend to conclude the house's legacy.They come up with the idea to have an orgy. The plan is suggested by Eric and his best-friend Matt (Labine) who gives a likable Chris Farley performance as the off-the-wall, rowdy man who knows how to have a good time. At first, the group of guys and gals, which include Lake Bell, Nick Kroll, and Angela Sarafyan, are disgusted at the idea of having limitless sex in a room together, but slowly adapt to the underlying positives of the idea.Still, the concept of the orgy never made any sense to me. Taking part in the even with strangers is dangerous and doing it with friends could have some unintended consequences, which is why the idea of them all agreeing to the event, especially the guy with the girlfriend, is a little far-fetched.Apparently, from my research and understanding, directors and writers Alex Gregory and Peter Huyck have been working on this idea since 1997. Surely if picked up by an ambitious studio, this would've done pretty well in the late nineties since many late night comedies, such as American Pie and Dazed and Confused, were hitting the scene. Sadly, in limited release in 2011, it won't due too much good.One other minor quibble is the film seems to have neutered itself. I'm not sure if this was because the writers were so happy to get this picked up they decided to water it down as much as possible so as not to cause controversy or because of its fear of getting an NC-17, but for whatever reason, despite the title, A Good Old Fashioned Orgy doesn't pack in the sex and nudity you'd believe. It seems kind of odd that a film with such a broad and daring title wouldn't want to take advantage of the possibilities and potential behind it. I think the film sort of makes up for it with the number of discussions on ""new positions,"" ""sex swings,"" and toys though, so it pays big in the dialog field.A Good Old Fashioned Orgy is sort of like good old fashioned comedy from the nineties revived in 2011. I've always enjoyed juvenile, sophomoric humor in the vein of films like Bruno and Grandma's Boy. They're a hard thing to accomplish since humor is a tricky thing to achieve. I've said it before and I'll say it again; this doesn't score well in the highest denominator of comedy, but it succeeds in the denominator it is in.Starring: Jason Sudeikis, Leslie Bibb, Lake Bell, Michelle Borth, Nick Kroll, Tyler Labine, Lindsay Sloane, Lucy Punch, and Will Forte. Directed by: Alex Gregory and Peter Huyck.",A Good Old Fashioned Orgy
4,KineticSeoul,Watching this movie was like watching a party go down that I want no part in,4,11 October 2014,"I just don't get how people can actually find this movie to be funny. I just found it gross all around. Sure it's raunchy, but just because a movie is raunchy doesn't make it good. I was bored with this movie. Watching this movie was like watching grown ass men act like immature teenagers, except it isn't funny at all. Sure the dialogues are crude, but it just came off more disgusting than it actually being funny. So yeah, this movie is crude and raunchy, that basically sums up this movie. The plot is basically about a frat guy that just want to keep on partying and thinks about taking it to another level by having a orgy party. I wasn't amused and this whole thing became a rubbish experience. Watching this movie was like watching a party go down, that I just did not want to be a part of...At all.4.6/10",A Good Old Fashioned Orgy
5,Hellmant,A Good Old Fashioned 80's Sex Comedy!,8,1 February 2012,"'A GOOD OLD FASHIONED ORGY': Four Stars (Out of Five) 80's style sex comedy done right! This movie may not have as much sex, nudity and raunchy humor as some might be expecting given it's title but what it does have to offer is much better and more fulfilling in my opinion. Jason Sudeikis gives his best performance to date and makes a great leading man, heading up an outstanding ensemble cast with a lot of chemistry (which is a great deal of why the film really works).Sudeikis plays Eric, the leader of a small group of tight friends who came to love throwing big wild summer parties at Eric's dad's house. When Eric's dad (played by none other than Don Johnson) tells Eric he's selling the house Eric and his friends are devastated. The group decides to throw one last big hurrah before losing the house but want it to be something intimate between just the core group of eight friends. So Eric comes up with the idea of having an orgy! The movie was written and directed by Alex Gregory and Peter Huyck (a successful TV writing team for shows like 'KING OF THE HILL', 'THE TRACY MORGAN SHOW', 'FRASIER' and 'LATE SHOW WITH David LETTERMAN'). This is their first movie and I think they did a fantastic job. They kind of promised a raunchy sex comedy, which they somewhat delivered, but they also gave us a feel good movie about friendship, which also happens to be very funny. Thanks in large part to the cast, like I said, with great supporting turns by Tyler Labine and Will Forte. It may not be the movie some are looking for but it's a pretty good film nonetheless.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SILVr6aykQ",A Good Old Fashioned Orgy
6,thesar-2,An Anticlimactic Orgy,1,3 September 2011,"The funniest thing that happened during A Good Old Fashioned Orgy actually took place before the movie began. When I was buying my (uh) solo ticket to the Orgy, the elderly box office lady couldn't hear me say the title and asked me to repeat itthree times. On the third time, I said ""I want to see the Orgy!""Yes, I did say that and yes, there were people behind me. Thankfully, I gave them and myself the best (ONLY) laugh I would have for the next hour and a half.To be fair, I did laugh at that hour and half conclusion: as I couldn't wait to leave the theatre I got up quickly but as the credits rolled, they indicated ""funny"" finale credit scenes. There were two: the first was lame and the second seemed to take forever to show up. I actually laughed because I stood there to see if they would put something funny up on the screen finally. Alas, the second of two end-credit scenes was just as hideous as the entire movie.And to think, this movie was in limited release which usually means it's so good, they want to slow-roll it out and get good word of mouth out. Ha, well scratch that idea of happening. Perhaps it was suuuch a taboo title? Take that idea off the table as well – I'll explain more, but this has as much orgy action as a Kirk Cameron movie. Ah, yes, it's just because it's such a terrible movie, they might as well make a few extra bucks the unsold DVDs will net. (And that's really where this movie belongs in the first place, if not just cancelled all together.Whewa little bit of ranting there. You would too, if you were promised both comedy and an orgy and got a LAZY script, BORING set ups, DECADES-old scenes and a bunch of actually extremely talented actors who should know better but signed up for another paycheck. The tagline should've been: ""If You Saw Grown UpsSave Your Money This Time!""The story centers around, I'm guessing, growing older and trying to hold onto the past. Sound familiar? How this didn't star Adam Sandler and/or Will Ferrell is beyond me – yes, they would do a project like this; they're sell-outs too. So, when the house that holds ring-leader Eric's (Jason Sudeikis) parties is being sold, Eric wants a one-final-blowout and finally comes up with an orgy amongst friends.The writer/director duo, Adam Gregory and Peter Huyck only ask that you be patient, because the characters will be simply talking about this pending orgy for another hour or so (in a 1½ hour film.) There's so little nudity or sex (in a nudity and sex film) that Adam and Peter throw in a sex-club scene that throws the should-be PG-13 film into R-Rating status.Finally, the orgy arrives. And it's so tame; it's like buying a Playboy and you really just read the articles. Only Tyler Labine seems to want to get naked – that's a plus for people like me, but for the general public, they'd probably rather see someone else, I dunno, like the girls – this is targeted to horny guys that usually leave their brains at the door for this type of sex-comedy.To be fair, there are a few (VERY FEW) breast shots. But nothing you can't Google on your android phone when you're bored when the towel-wearing gang carries on during the ""orgy.""My guess on why the film's ""Big Finale"" was so toned down is that they either had little faith in the pointless and humorless script or they were too afraid to offend. Either way, they squandered such potential in the actors and chance to push the buttons even Adam Sandler, Kevin James and/or Will Ferrell actually haven't yet.I'd say to skip this trash, but it's very unlikely you'll catch it with both the minimal amount of advertising and theatres running it.",A Good Old Fashioned Orgy
7,cosmo_tiger,"Very funny movie with comedy like ""Change-Up"" More people would watch if title was different. I love it. I say A-",8,15 December 2011,"""People used to have them all the time, what happened to our generation? I'll tell you what happened...AIDS."" A close group of 30 something year old friends who have been friends since high school find out that their party house is being sold they try to come up with one last blowout party. After a few suggestions they decide on the most extreme one yet...an orgy. This is a movie that I think will only do well be word of mouth from the brave people who watch it first. I really loved this movie and laughed the entire way through. I think that the biggest problem this movie has is the title. If it was called The Last Party, or Growing Up or even Friends Forever I think it would have done better because most people are either too offended or uptight to see a movie with this title. I will say there is quite a bit of nudity and sex in this, but nothing outrageous and a little more then ""Hall Pass"" or the ""Change-up"" (which is the same type of comedy this is). Don't be afraid of the title or embarrassed to watch it, this is a very very funny movie. Overall, a very surprisingly sweet and funny comedy that fans of ""Change-Up"" will love. I loved it. I give it an A-.",A Good Old Fashioned Orgy
8,sandcrab277,utter tripe,2,30 May 2020,I watched this garbage for a while to see and hear michelle borth ... unfortunately for the writers they didn't use her talents at all ... on the other hand they wasted way too much effort on jason sudeikis who was a complete putz and flopped from the first words out of his mouth and apparently the writers have no idea about an orgy ... the women didn't act childish like the guys.,A Good Old Fashioned Orgy
9,Kamurai25,"Why don't more people have them, watch and find out.",7,30 March 2020,"Good watch, will likely watch again, and can recommend.While I think you should go into this with a somewhat open mind, I think you are if you're ready the review.There are honestly few truly kinky scenes and they're done on purpose with somewhat of a point. The whole thing ends up being a relatively healthy discussion about relationships and mechanics of increased intimacy in them.It's also pretty funny: this is a perfect cast of actors to play off of each other, and there too many for me to want to list off.",A Good Old Fashioned Orgy
10,itamarscomix,Surprisingly funny,7,29 July 2012,"Considering the premise and title of A Good Old Fashioned Orgy it has all the potential of being a low-brow, gross-out comedy, but that turns out to take up a very small portion of it. Thanks to a solid cast and a good script, it's actually a surprisingly mellow and heartfelt comedy about companionship and about getting older, and it's a great movie for people who grew up in the 80's and early 90's and enjoyed teen comedies from The Breakfast Club onwards. It's definitely much spicier than those movies - if sexual humor or nudity offend you, you should probably stay away. But it's not explicit, offensive or tasteless and the sex itself is portrayed surprisingly realistically. More than anything else, the characters make the movie work - they're rooted in stereotypes, but they're complex and realistic enough to not come across as cheap caricatures or unsympathetic jerks, and they're easy to relate to and get invested in, which makes the movie not just a funny comedy but also a rather sweet feel-good movie about friendship.",A Good Old Fashioned Orgy
11,abisio,The best comedy of the year,10,3 March 2012,"Don't you really miss when comedy did not imply using an stupid character (or making every character stupid through the use of alcohol or drugs) ? Don't you miss when comedies were really written with a real story and character development behind ?.Don't you miss when actors making you laugh without overacting or creating absurd and forced situations ? Well if you are the kind of person that consider THE HANGOVER or HAROLD AND KUMAR Christmas as sophisticated (or perhaps funny ) comedies then do not bother reading the rest (however the fact that you can read is a good thing; means there is still hope and your brain is still somewhat working).A GOOD OLD FASHIONED ORGY is about growing and even worse cutting ties with our gone youth. When two friends within a group, decide to organize an orgy as a farewell to their previous superficial and empty life style; things get really strange and every one of them expose very valid reasons for refusing or accepting the proposal.Events that follow, are credible and natural; because every character is perfectly but briefly developed (in order to maintain the pace).Things get not always funny; as it is in real life; but by the end, taking risk always has its rewards.If there is a low point in the movie; it is the orgy itself. There is no nudity or eroticism and during the event. It looks like writers and/or director tried to moralize the situation, making it look like boring.Well, it is not true. I lived something similar many years ago; and is one of my fondest memories. It is also a sad one because it really was a farewell and a change in my life.Please enjoy this movie; it really deserve it.",A Good Old Fashioned Orgy

13,bgar-80932,Not great,5,8 October 2020,This movie is stacked with funny people but most of their jokes don't land. They had a few funny parts but it's overall a non-funny comedy. Some of the characters are likable though. I'd say it's a pass.,A Good Old Fashioned Orgy

15,bob_bear,Oddballs,5,30 September 2012,"I neither loved nor hated this movie. It was mildly entertaining. Not many laughs. Good cast and production values hampered by a light-weight if not plain silly script.The basic premise -- that a group of longtime girl/guy friends would arrange an intimate orgy between themselves -- was not only inconceivable to me, I actually found the idea distasteful. Who would do that? Who? And would you want to spend 90 minutes in their company if they did? Well, apparently this affluent, and not very attractive bunch of 30-going-on-40-something New Yorkers think of it as an extension of their friendship (?!) and if the characters were less engaging -- the bromance between the leads works well, for example -- or I had, had something better to watch -- then I probably would have switched off. As it is, I stayed till the end.I just can't imagine who thought this was a good idea. Yes, I was expecting a sex-comedy about an orgy that goes wrong but not one between friends. If one considers their close friends as family, its a pretty gruesome concept IMHO.That the orgy eventually does go ahead is the most bizarre aspect. Not to mention the morning after when everyone is completely chilled about what took place. It's all bonkers and unconvincing but just a film at the end of the day...",A Good Old Fashioned Orgy
16,tecnogaming,Brilliant in every way!,10,19 April 2012,"Well, my review is not going to be long this time. This movie is all about having fun with friends and doing an orgy.Simply enough you say? well, NOT.This movie far exceeds the premise it takes, not only allowing us to see one the most complete comedies ever released but doing this with incredible deep at the same time.The movie takes a lot of time to build up the characters, each friend. There are a lot of them and each one of them is perfectly described, balanced and well developed. Perfect timing to relate each scene with each character, a premise that seems so preposterous from the start, begins to resonate with us through the whole movie and the movie pays, big time!If you enjoy a good laugh, sex, friendship values and a very well written movie, well, it can't be better than this, you absolutely must watch this one!The best thing about this one is how good the topic of friendship, sex and desires are treated. It is all very well developed, with enough deep but at the same time with such a light atmosphere that you will almost feel like you're there with them.One word of advice, the movie is brave, right from the start this is stated in it's title so, you must be open minded, if you are, you will love it, if you're not, well, it could be a disaster for you.10 out of 10, totally awesome feel good movie!",A Good Old Fashioned Orgy

18,dimarinc,A Good Comedy with a Great Cast,7,10 February 2012,"A Good Old Fashioned Orgy is a good, well intentioned comedy. The excellent cast and unique plot line make this a fresh movie entry. It was close to being an upper class comedy but it lacked the big laughs. I thoroughly enjoyed the entire movie, but it felt like friends just shooting a funny concept rather than many planned comedic ideas.The best strength of this movie is its cast. Everyone hits on all cylinders and contributes to the comedy. Tyler Labine was my personal favorite but being the SNL fanatic that I am, Jason Sudeikis played the cool guy extremely well and Will Forte was hilarious even as just a cameo. This movie doesn't get lost in the millions of similar comedies out there because the movie seems realistic. It feels like the natural progression that a planned orgy would bring in the 21st century.The only real problem with the movie was a lack of big laugh moments. This movie entertains and i constantly found myself laughing, but there was no big huge memorable joke or situation short of David Koechner's part. I think if a few more of those had been integrated into this movie, it would've been one of the biggest comedies of the year.I would recommend this movie to absolutely everyone. Don't let the name fool you, it's not a raunchy porno. Really short of about a 5 minute span there is limited nudity, but lots of lauhgs.",A Good Old Fashioned Orgy

The direction is REALLY bland, the storyline is simplistic at best, absolutely not much plot development and is as linear and simplistic as it gets, the acting is passable, and it 'tries' to be a comedy but it didn't make me laugh once. It certainly didn't arouse me with its naughty content. So it doesn't fit in either comedy or softcore porn category. And I have seen low budget hardcore porn funnier than this stuff which says a lot about how unfunny and boring this movie is. 3/10 for me.

21,themoviecouch,"Fun, if you keep your expectations low",5,23 June 2012,"Everyone knows that folks in the '60's and '70's did some serious swinging, and from what you hear about young people today, you get the impression that they only stop slurping each other's privates when they take a break to send each other naked pictures on their cell phones. So what happened to people like me, who came of age in the '80's and '90's? AIDS, that's what. We grew up hearing that sex was a scary, dangerous thing that could kill you. It didn't completely stop us from having sex, but it probably did cut down on the debauchery. ""A Good, Old-Fashioned Orgy"" is the story of a group of 30-somethings who set out to remedy that.Eric (Jason Sudeikis) and his group of high-school friends, which consists of several cute chicks and an assortment of dorky guys, have grown up partying at Eric's dad's beach house. When his dad puts the house up for sale, the friends see the end of not only their epic parties, but of the free, irresponsible chapter of their lives. (Which, given that they are about 30, they have stretched out pretty far, anyway.) Eric convinces the group to see the beach house off with one, last epic soire, a good, old-fashioned orgy between friends.You see the title of this film, and you figure it will be a fun sex-romp, and eventually it is, but they do take their time getting there. This is a story about 30-year-olds belatedly coming of age, so first they have to set up the many characters and their first-world issues. This is less a story about an orgy, and more a story about people realizing that they can only stretch their adolescence out so far, and I wish the film had either done a better job exploring that theme or just focused on the sex. In any event, it's a moderate amount of fun. Sudeikis plays a funny, charming ladies' man, and Tyler Labine is pretty good as his fat, crude sidekick. There's one really funny scene that makes the whole film, where the guys do some research in an underground sex club. Basically, much of the movie is a less good- looking, less funny version of ""The Hangover."" Also, in keeping with the modern trend, there are more naked, male buttocks on screen than naked, female breasts, and my wife points out that the male buttocks aren't all that great. ""A Good, Old-Fashioned Orgy"" is fairly fun and funny, but if you are looking for soft-porn you will do better with ""A Game of Thrones.""2.5 stars out of 5",A Good Old Fashioned Orgy
22,Kalamata,What do you call an R-rated film that should be rated PG-13?,5,2 July 2012,"So, why am I giving only 5 out of 10 to A Good Old-Fashioned Orgy? For that, I have an answer: they screwed it up. That is to say the producers and the director screwed it up. First of all, there are a lot of funny people in this movie, and there are some great throw-away lines that just melt off the dialogue spool until the simile runs out of its metaphorical fishing pole. And even though we have the same setup here that a lot of successful - if not great - R-rated comedies do (Hot Tub Time Machine comes instantly to mind: not that great a film, but good enough to remember instantly when talking about another comedy which is less successful), we do not have a really successful (i.e., it makes people laugh) movie. Something happened on the way to an R-rating for a basically PG-13 film. I can't pretend to know what happened, how it happened, or why, but it happened. And what you get is a very tame ""orgy"" that could have almost been on Lifetime save for one short boob shot from the lovely Angela Sarafyan. One. I can't remember a single other boob shot in the movie though there may have been one or two.So, clearly, other than language, we have a PG-13 movie. So why not clean up the language and just go for PG-13 which would, ostensibly, make more money because it opens up the movie to that magic demographic of 13-18 year-olds who, well, buy everything?Did Reed Hastings - the smooth-mover who built then destroyed Netflix - produce this movie? Aaaaarrrrgh.no, he did not. Peter Huyck and Alex Gregory did, and they are two really funny dudes who have produced some of TV's best series including the Larry Sanders Show, King Of The Hill, and Frasier. Did Reed Hastings direct AGOFO? He did not. The same producing duo directed the film as well. In other words the fault lies with them (yes, the company that financed the venture might have been pressuring them, but I don't know that for sure). And I'm left with the same conundrum: Here is a very lightweight R movie that would have fared better if it had done one of two things: 1. Gone for the R and made it a lot more naked, or 2. Cleaned up what little there is and get the coveted PG-13. What's there is just not strong enough for either. But lest you think I am hung up on a ratings thing, let me say that the storyline failed to punch up the jeopardy (whoa! Dad's going to sell the house, how can we stop that from happening? And then maybe written in three hilarious attempts to do that – all of which fail. And THEN plan the naked orgy party of ALL TIME! And then, for God's sake Peter Huyck and Alex Gregory, DELIVER THE GOODS! Make it happen, Guys, because what you've done is left a fish gasping on the dock and in grave danger of not working at all as a metaphor for the film's failure! Now that's jeopardy.But we never feel that we have an all or nothing situation happening here. Nothing that happens HAS to happen. And when they do have their orgy, the camera suddenly goes all coy on us. Some lovely people in the film who look good all over never even get down to bikinis, well maybe at the end, but nothing whatever sexy ever happens. And sexy is what the word ORGY promises! ORGY=SEXY. Simple lexical algebra. It's false advertising. And people break orgy rules like the guy whose girl does actually flash the only set of tots in the movie goes berserk and insists that she not be in the orgy after all. Wha? And it's downhill from there. Which is a pity because there was a lot of humor knitted up in that mix and if they'd only have spilled a little nuditynot metaphoricallyonto the screen they might have ignited a minor hit. At least a 7-star hit from me.",A Good Old Fashioned Orgy
23,rsol55,Offputting racist themed party at the start,2,9 June 2020,"I don't know why they chose to open the party with a racist ""White Trash"" themed party at the opening of the movie, but it was very offputting. The movie is from 2011, and by then people knew that putting racist stereotypes and caricatures in movies is not acceptable.",A Good Old Fashioned Orgy
24,phoenix_risen,Waste of time (possible spoilers),2,27 January 2013,"Given the talent that signed on to do this film, one would expect a really funny and memorable ride. Unfortunately, that is not what we got.The story follows a group of well-off 30-something's and their first-world problems which culminate in the form of losing their party spot, a summer home in an upscale New England area owned by Jason Sudeikis' father, for which they pay nothing for. After some initial complaints about the unfairness of the situation, they plot to hold off the realtor until they can have their final Labor Day party which is, as the title suggests, an orgy.None of the characters are ever really fleshed out (no pun intended). They're an eclectic mix of boring people with largely unrelatable issues. Jason Sudeikis essentially plays every other character he has ever played, but it doesn't work here because of the overall mood, the complete lack of actual conflict, and slow, grinding pace of the movie.Unfairness is not losing your free party spot. Unfairness is having to watch Tyler Labine in this movie while Reaper, a show where he actually dominated and meshed perfectly with his cast, got canceled.In the end, every possible personal issue every character even remotely hinted at is sorted out and all the actors cheer wildly and hug each other. Audiences are supposed to connect to this emotionally and feel happy, but it ended up being extremely uncomfortable and left me cringing. The actors should all get Oscars for having to shoot those scenes and appear genuine.In the end, this movie is an hour and a half that I will never get back.",A Good Old Fashioned Orgy
25,alexsupertramp123,Better than box office numbers suggest,8,9 June 2012,"I stumbled across this movie, since it features one of my favorite comedy actors, Jason Sudeikis. Were it not for the good reviews it had here, I would probably have overlooked it.You can best sum this movie up as grown up version of American Pie - it's about a group of people trying to expand their sexual boundaries and their funny and sometimes awkward way of dealing with it. Yet the humor is definitely more subtle and mature. The actors do a good job, especially Sudeikis and Labine, and have a good group chemistry. The sex scenes aren't more explicit than in most movies nowadays - less than you would expect from a movie with the word orgy in the title.I'm sure had it been named 'One Last Party"", it would have done better. Worthwhile watching it.",A Good Old Fashioned Orgy
26,gibo2000,You'll split yourself!!,8,13 December 2011,"Firstly you have to be really open-minded to watch this. Even though the Orgy itself features in the movie, the whole story revolves mainly around the planning, personal opinions and feelings of the characters regarding the topic. The Humour was fast and witty. There was a bit of nudity featured but nothing to get upset about if you're open-minded enough to watch this Movie to start with. In General I found it highly entertaining and would recommend it to anyone who isn't going to be deterred by their religious beliefs or conservative upbringing. There were definitely a few scenes where I found myself gasping for air due to hysterical laughter. This is the New-age guys. You don't have to believe in it - but it was a blast! I loved it!!",A Good Old Fashioned Orgy

28,sphered,What a refreshing surprise,10,13 December 2011,"The reason why I'm choosing to watch a comedy is to relax and have a good feeling at the end of the movie. Well this is one of the very few comedies that improved my mood significantly. It was so refreshing that I feel like going out for a drink (it's 3AM here), like I just got out of the bed. Despite the ""ORGY"" word there's nothing obscene about this movie. It has some really funny lines, funny characters, the story is really cool - talking about real friendship and sincere relationships.I think that the only ones that don't like this movie are people without friends.",A Good Old Fashioned Orgy
29,chilly_aquarius,Really DUMB movie!!,4,23 February 2012,"This movie has very dry flat humor and is very boring and predictable. Just a view funny scenes, but really standard jokes. The movie is like dry white rice or like soup without the vegetables. My mate fell asleep during the movie!!! It's very slow in story line and has no character...you're constantly feeling like waiting for that ""okay, now it's coming""-moment. But than the movie has ended leaving you with a strange unfulfilled feeling. The scenes of the orgy were exaggerated and so fake. Also very bad, unconvincing acting. I rate this movie a 4 out of 10 for the effort the producers have put in. But it's definitely not a blockbuster. Don't go to this movie, waste of money, time and energy.",A Good Old Fashioned Orgy
30,bgreddly,Funniest (and most surprising) movie of the year,10,22 September 2011,"Reading the reviews for this film, which range from very positive to strongly negative, I was intrigued to see what the disagreement was all about. After seeing it (and it wasn't easy, as it was a bit of a drive to the nearest theater showing it), I totally understand what it was that divided the critics. For the haters, it seems they assumed a movie with the word 'orgy' in the title (for some reason they ignored the 'good old-fashioned' which made it clearly intentionally silly) would have to be a dumb, sex-filled romp. When it turned out to be a really smart and sweet exploration of friendship through the device of group sex, with minimal raunch, there seems to have been confusion and even anger. For those who didn't find the movie funny, I have no idea what movie they saw. The screening I went to was packed with laughs, but the movie actually goes a lot further than just hitting the comedy (which it does brilliantly). It's a generational movie about adults who grew up in the shadow of AIDS, ergo a sex comedy about people who are afraid of sex. The more we get to know the group of friends, the more we care about them and their journeys, in addition to the comedy of a group of neurotic New Yorkers trying to pull together a night of reckless sexual abandon. It works on multiple levels and is far smarter than you might expect it to be (which is what a lot of the positive reviews have pointed out).I'd compare this movie more to The Big Chill than one of the American Pies, and the cast is one of the strongest ensemble comedy casts to come along since Dazed and Confused. It's a movie people are going to be watching and talking about for years to come, so check it out now while it's still in theaters because seeing it with an audience really adds to the experience.",A Good Old Fashioned Orgy
31,LynxLy,More subtle than expected,7,18 January 2012,"At first glance I thought this would be another raunchy fratboy type flick but it was actually a bit different and pretty good. Sudekis came off like one might suspect as the ringleader. His buddies are varied enough to make it more realistic than most let's-grab-some-babes comedies. They are all a little bit interesting to include the gals they chum around with. The gist of the plot is that these lifelong friends plan on throwing an orgy on Labor Day weekend and the film is all about the summer that leads up to it. For the most part it plays relatively clean considering the title of movie but it has the right amount of skin, sex and toilet humor while it remains a cohesive movie with a concise storyline. Most in this genre don't... most veer off into dirty joke marathons or a parade of fake boobs with no discernible plot. Tim Koechner? is hilarious in the raunchiest part of the flick and the rest of the cast does a decent enough job of acting but no award winners here. The scenery is fantastic throughout and it's definitely the place you want to be for the summer (I believe it's the Hamptons but not sure). My only real knock on this was the chubby sidekick guy. He's there as a comedic go-to guy and he doesn't always deliver and they should have gave him a little better identity than the typical party animal nitwit that always show up in these flicks. The girls are a little more true to life perhaps and are as funny as the boys for the most part so I give it credit there as well. And oh yes, the eye-candy factor gets an A but don't expect this to be an out and out flesh-feast. A good amount of nudity but not rampant like late night Cinemax. The ending is semi-predictable but it doesn't matter in this one. In the end you don't feel like you've wasted time like, again, so many other fratboy-ish comedies --recommend.",A Good Old Fashioned Orgy
32,craigman1211,Stupid but funny,7,19 December 2011,"This movie is not for the serious minded, and as the title suggests, not something you would see with your grandmother. The premise is ridiculous, but its actually more original than one of those national lampoons movies. Its stupid funny, and some of the well placed jokes actually made me laugh out loud. I would say this is a movie to see if you its something you see on Netflix or HBO, although I don't think I would buy it, and renting would be only if there is nothing else to see. If you are into those Eurotrip kind of movies, this will be right up your ally, and actually seems to be made for an older crowd which is a nice change of pace.Give the fact that it seemed to achieve exactly what it wanted and that it didn't have horrible or distracting acting, I would give this movie a solid 7. Its not the best movie I have ever seen, and I doubt I will recommend it, but I don't feel like it wasn't worth my time to watch and at several points it is actually very funny.",A Good Old Fashioned Orgy
33,kristukaz-866-704135,Do not read ANY reviews if you want really to enjoy a movie! Personally I liked this one :),9,17 January 2012,"I watched this film and I was just amazed how I liked it :) First of all - do not read any comments about movies that you are going to watch ANYMORE! Do not be judgmental based upon comments because seriously- a lot of things depends on your mood, taste and environment. Well, that's my story with this one :) I just didn't read any IMD reviews I just went and watched :))Surprisingly,it was really funny. Funny a lot and in really many ways :) I think there wouldn't be any person which wouldn't find in a movie a place not to laugh from :) And I think it's one of the best movies that I saw recently.Movie is made really simple, and actors are really god and I do not agree that they looked silly in the movie. If Sandler would perform -it would be cheap and really tasteless movie, but now... There are also places to think about, it's not just some kind of dumb, without moral movie, in my opinion it had really clear message and personally it gave me thoughts to think of what could I do in my life (and it's really not about orgy :D). So in my opinion the movie is based on funny moments because after all it's comedy, not some kind of drama or whatever where your brain must work, but there are some great serious thoughts in there.Next, I actually learned lesson not to judge about the movie from the title. Guys, which are looking for real orgies- there are sites for that and for criss sake - it's a comedy with bunch of good actors, so you think there are going to be a lot of hookers, nudity and etc? WAKE - UP. Seriously, I'm angry, because really- it's a great movie that contains everything what for comedy is essential.Thought it;s not a dumb comedy :)But, why 9 out 10? Because there were really scenes when they were too long... But hey, what kind of movie doesn't have it? So, I recommend to all my friends to watch and I believe you'll find it as a ""not for nothing time spent movie"" :)",A Good Old Fashioned Orgy
34,solotaroff,Don't listen to the haters,10,4 September 2011,"People are really split on this movie. The haters are all either people who are offended by the idea of group sex, annoyed there wasn't more T&A, or (strangely) both. They seem to forget that this is a comedy, and a comedy should be rated by one thing only: how funny it is. This was really really funny.I don't know how a movie like Hall Pass which had at most 5 laugh out loud lines could do better than Orgy which had at least 50. Just goes to show that movie success is based more on marketing than anything else.The one criticism I have is it suffers a little Ferris Beuller-itis. Am I really supposed to root for this spoiled white rich kid? Once the movie gets going though you quickly forget this and just hold on for the ""ride.""",A Good Old Fashioned Orgy
35,eatdrinkmerry,Really funny and refreshingly real...,10,29 September 2011,"I love all the comedians in this movie (SNL, The League, Talladega Nights, MacGruber)and thought that this was going to be a fun film with a bunch of ridiculous one liners and some wonderfully uncomfortable situations. I didn't expect to like it so much, have it be so much fun and for it to be such a great story about friendship. And the craziest part is that in the end it really seemed like a bunch of friends could actually pull off an orgy and it might actually not be too weird afterward. Genuinely inspirational. With this bunch of funny folks I can't wait to see the DVD extra bits.",A Good Old Fashioned Orgy
36,johanna-oudiz,A good old no-brainer,6,7 January 2012,"OK, last night I needed a break. The day had been hard, I had zero energy, I didn't think I could watch an entire movie. That's why I picked ""A good old fashion orgy"". I thought, well if I fall asleep during this one, no big deal. But it was actually much funnier than I expected. The group of actors were quite refreshing with some faces we know (Lake Bell from How to make it in America, Jason Sudeikis from SNL).What most surprised me were the dialogues, I thought it was witty and well written, I laughed a lot. Also, it was not as obvious as I had expected so you actually want to know how the orgy is turning out. Unfortunately there was one scene too many where the main male characters go on an orgy observation mission that provides way too many visual details. Special mention to Rhys Coiro for his douche bag character, it was just awesome to see Billi Walsh again! So, if you're in the mood for an easy to watch, no brainer movie, A good old fashion Orgy will do the trick.",A Good Old Fashioned Orgy
37,oristian,A must-see on par with Wedding Crashers and The Hangover,9,9 February 2012,"This is a delicious story about staying young through our quest for the ultimate party with our closest friends. As a guy in my 30s, I don't like when movies with super-young 20-somethings are painting the picture that my best times are behind me. This crew reminds me of my friends - not your stock characters, but a sweet mix of nerdy and sexy that's especially endearing the more you know them. And as the title may or may not suggest, there's a real earnestness to the way each of these guys (and gals) considers the possibility of getting it on with their best mates. Realizing that the smart dialogue moves pretty fast, I had to revisit some scenes to savor some of the subtleties. Killer casting and great writing all around. I'm going to have to buy this movie because I think it's on par with the likes of The Hangover and Wedding Crashers and it's not just all about dudes.",A Good Old Fashioned Orgy

39,theoxys,Not Good,3,20 October 2012,"The film is quite funny. But the story in this film is not that great. Sue Plummer (Michelle Borth) have feelings and love for Jason Sudeikis (Eric Keppler), and they have sex. But why Sue Plummer (Michelle Borth) have sex again with Tyler Labine (Mike McCrudden) if Sue Plummer (Michelle Borth) has feelings for Jason Sudeikis (Eric Keppler). And Jason Sudeikis (Eric Keppler) having sex with Lake Bell (Alison Lobel). But Sue Plummer (Michelle Borth) has no jealousy.So Sex for funny? So if you have a boyfriend/girlfriend do a orgy sex, and having sex with their respective girlfriend/boyfriend having sex again with someone else, it is something stupid. Close friends do orgy sex with each other? it sounds so crazy and not good. So this movie is not worth it in for exampleIf the story in this film, Sue Plummer (Michelle Borth) and Jason Sudeikis (Eric Keppler) like each other and have sex. And do not have sex again with her ​​other friends, the film is good.a friend is a friend, So you can not having sex with your friends.unless you love each other. You can making love only with your girlfriend/boyfriend. But not like in this film story. you can do a sex orgy, but only if done with your boyfriend/girlfriend. and not having sex with someone else after having sex with your girlfriend/boyfriend at a orgy sex Thats my opinions",A Good Old Fashioned Orgy
