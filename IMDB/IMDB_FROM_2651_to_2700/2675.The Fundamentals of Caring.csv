0,MartinHafer,This film demonstrates that 'direct to Netflix' is NOT a bad thing at all.,9,26 June 2016,"A few days ago, I watched a horrid film that was produced for Netflix...""The Do-Over"". So, when I saw the latest film to come directly to Netflix, ""The Fundamentals of Caring"", I was very apprehensive about it. Would it be yet another sub-par film or would it show that Netflix can make a product every bit as good as you'd see from larger and more traditional outlets? Fortunately, it a very good film and I am glad I forced myself to watch it.The film stars Paul Rudd as Ben, a man whose life is in shambles. His marriage is over and his child has died. To deal with his grief and failing career as a writer, he decides to become a home health aid...a rather low paying and thankless job. His first assignment is an interesting one...Trevor (Craig Roberts). Trevor is not a typical movie young man with a disability, as he's neither noble nor a complete jerk....the two stereotypes that seem rampant when films actually bother to show disabled characters. Instead, he's incredibly sarcastic...and some of this sarcasm is his way of dealing with disappointments and fears. In this sense, he and Ben actually have a lot in common as both are afraid to get on with their lives. But it's important Trevor do something, as his Muscular Dystrophy means a shortened life...and Ben hopes to put some more 'life' into that life. So he plans a bizarre roadtrip...a trip to see some of the kitschy roadside sites in America. In particular, a long trip to see the world's deepest granite pit! While this hardly sounds exciting, the trip offers quite a few twists and exciting turns...including their hooking up with a foul- mouthed young lady (Selena Gomez) and a pregnant women trying to get home before her baby arrives (Megan Ferguson).The film is a delightful slice of life...and I hardly ever use the word 'delightful'....so pay attention! Much of this is because the script by writer/director Rob Burnett does a great job of avoiding the usual clichés as well as making the characters and dialog interesting. The story is based on a novel by Jonathan Evison and the cast do a great job of bringing his story to life. In particular, I absolutely loved the job done by Roberts as Trevor...he was just terrific and manages to more than hold his own opposite a strong and capable performance by Rudd. The fact that Rudd was so good was no surprise. The fact a relatively unknown actor does a great job and isn't overshadowed by him is. As for Gomez, she is also quite good. However, I should warn folks expecting the nice Disney Channel star, as here she is very hard- edged and her vocabulary is decidedly non-Disney!! Overall, it's a very strong roadtrip film that left me very impressed and wanting more. Well worth seeing.",The Fundamentals of Caring
1,SnoopyStyle,Selena actually funny,6,20 February 2017,"Ben Benjamin (Paul Rudd) is withdrawn and struggling after a tragedy. He is avoiding his wife Janet who is desperate for him to sign their divorce papers. Elsa (Jennifer Ehle) hires him to care for her bitter, rude, sarcastic son Trevor (Craig Roberts) who has Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. Ben and Trevor go on a roadtrip to see American roadside attractions and Trevor's absent father. Along the way, they pick up foul-mouthed hitchhiker Dot (Selena Gomez) and pregnant Peaches.Paul Rudd is playing sad in this one. He still retains some irreverent aspects but his sad core suppresses the humor in the early going. Selena Gomez turns out to be the funniest one in the bunch. It has a group of broken characters played by appealing actors. It's aiming for quirky depressed heart-warming and it's mostly fine.",The Fundamentals of Caring
2,morrison-dylan-fan,We Care A Lot.,9,24 September 2016,"After watching the mind-bending Sci-Fi indie movie Coherence on Netflix UK ""recommends"" came up of a ""Netflix film."" Despite having a great cast,I was surprised by how little promotion the flick had received,which led to me getting ready to find out the fundamentals of caring.The plot:Searching for a new job after the death of his son and his wife trying to get him to sign divorce papers,Ben decides to train and become a care giver. Unaware about being given a difficult client,Ben goes to meet Elsa,who wants Ben to look after her 18 year old son Trevor,who suffers from Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Accepting the job offer,Ben soon finds Trevor to have a taste for dark practical jokes. Finding Ben to not quit over his jokes,Trevor slowly starts to become friends with Ben. Seeing Trevor waste his life in the house all day,Ben decides to show Trevor how much he cares about him,by taking him out to the great outdoors.View on the film:Meeting the guys at the crossroads, Selena Gomez gives a great performance as Dot,with Gomez wrapping Dot in a Punk attitude which keeps a caring nature undercover. Spending almost the whole movie with Trevor, Paul Rudd gives an excellent performance as Ben,by Rudd sometimes stepping back in order to build a real friendship with Trevor,and joining the raunchy one liners with a dramatic weight which comes into focus as fragments from Ben's past appear. Breaking him out from being a ""charity case"" Craig Roberts gives a fantastic performance as Trevor,with Roberts giving Trevor's comedic lines a snappy delivery,that are underlined by Roberts gripping Trevor with a nervous excitement over going on the open road.Breaking down viewers expectations in his adaptation of Jonathan Evison's book,the screenplay by writer/director Rob Burnett rides a rich black Comedy line over Trevor and Ben's relationship,with the harsh jokes and outrageous physical comedy burning any halo of ""charity"" off Ben and Trevor's relationship. Going out on the road, Burnett rolls out a wonderful road movie which keeps the jokes flying whilst gradually casting a touching friendship in Ben and Trevor's abrasive friendship,as they both discover the fundamentals of caring.",The Fundamentals of Caring
3,bombersflyup,Watchable.,4,10 March 2019,"The Fundamentals of Caring has likable characters, it just doesn't deliver as a comedy and is unconvincing.Jennifer Ehle stood out in the limited appearance for me, as Trevor's mother. Because Trevor needs constant care and has no time to himself, I like how he has the poster on the living room wall and is watching some female television host as the norm. People seem to hate on Selena Gomez. Didn't mind her, the character's rather convenient for Trevor though.",The Fundamentals of Caring
4,phd_travel,The best kind of indie movie - funny and moving,10,29 October 2016,"The best kind of indie movie is one that gets you to like the characters in a short space of time. It's quite an achievement that all the characters are endearing in this movie. The humor is spontaneous and laugh out loud and the touching parts are moving without being overly sentimental.The story about a man (Paul Rudd) whose young son was killed in an accident becomes a caregiver for a teenage boy with DMD an incurable muscular wasting disease. He takes him on an interesting road trip and along the way they come across a bunch of characters including a hitchhiking girl played by Selena Gomez. The situations are in turns funny and moving. The acting is good too. Paul acts kind and damaged without overdoing it, and the disabled young man Charlie Roberts delivers his funny and sad lines well. Selena is quite likable here.Glad that Netflix shows these quality indie movies.",The Fundamentals of Caring
5,siderite,Feelgood road trip movie,8,11 March 2021,"It is a film you've seen before, but the details are what matters and in this they create a pleasant feelgood road trip. Paul Rudd actually played his role really well, with a depth that you only realize after the film is over. So what is it about? This kid has muscular dystrophy and needs care, so Rudd's character takes the job and then convinces the otherwise recluse kid to go on a drive to see some random sightseeing landmarks he was fantasizing about. On the road they meet some people that they take along and live life fuller, finding themselves.What probably differentiates this film from so many others in the category is that there is no artificial drama somewhere in the third act, some threat or some unexpected catastrophe that makes it all tense. It just progresses naturally and makes the characters shine. There is no big moral at the end, nothing gets solved, it's just a story of personal growth. Probably the weakest link was Peaches, who had the potential to be a more complex character, but in the end had just a few scenes. Hopefully the book does her justice.In the end, good job for a movie in a genre I usually care (heh!) nothing about.",The Fundamentals of Caring
6,Hellmant,Who doesn't like Paul Rudd (I don't believe people like that actually exist)!,10,7 July 2016,"'THE FUNDAMENTALS OF CARING': Five Stars (Out of Five)A Netflix original drama flick, based on the 2012 novel 'The Revised Fundamentals of Caregiving' (by Jonathan Evison). It tells the story of a writer, that becomes the caregiver for a disabled teen; after he suffers a major personal tragedy. The two bond, and go on a life-changing road trip together. The film stars Paul Rudd, Craig Roberts and Selena Gomez. It was written, co-produced and directed by Rob Burnett (who's best known as the Emmy award-winning executive producer of the 'LATE SHOW WITH David LETTERMAN'). Burnett's 'Worldwide Pants' production company also produced the movie. It's gotten mostly favorable reviews from critics, and moviegoers alike; I found it to be an absolute masterpiece (definitely the best thing Netflix has ever released)!Ben (Rudd) suffered a major loss recently, and his wife (Julia Denton) wants a divorce. Ben isn't ready for that though, and he refuses to sign the divorce papers. He takes a break from his job, as a writer, and learns to be a caregiver. Ben then takes a job, for $9 an hour, as the caregiver for a disabled teen, named Trevor (Roberts). In order to get Trevor to break his obsessive routine, and leave home for once, Ben convinces him to go on a road trip. The two's lives are forever changed by it.The movie is heartbreaking, hilarious and tremendously inspiring. It's everything I look for in my favorite films! Rudd has never been more likable, in a movie; and who doesn't like Paul Rudd (I don't believe people like that actually exist). Roberts' character takes a little getting used to, but he's great in his role as well. It's also cool to see Gomez playing someone tough, and domineering, for a change. I think Burnett has definitely found his calling, as a filmmaker; not that the 'LATE SHOW WITH David LETTERMAN' isn't classic TV too. It's an outstanding film, for anyone that loves movies; I've seen it twice, and I can't wait to see it again. It's definitely one of the very best films of this year!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/- KJTB5KGois",The Fundamentals of Caring
7,ThomasDrufke,"Contrived, Clichéd, but an Enjoyable Buddy-Road-Trip-Comedy",6,10 July 2016,"The Fundamentals of Caring is neither a good or a bad road trip movie, nor is it quite the movie I expected. It's another average installment in the tiring genre of road trip buddy-comedies. Fortunately, there's much more underneath the surface for this Netflix original film.Starring Paul Rudd as the charming but also very guarded caretaker (Ben) and Craig Roberts (Trevor) as a vulgar late teen with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, the film brings their unwilling bond on a road trip that will change their lives forever. Forever is strong, but the events certainly change both of their perspectives on life. The plot is predictable and far from extraordinary, but the message and themes of adventure never grow tired.Much of the major plot points regarding Ben's past and Trevor's future are easy to predict within the first 15 minutes or so, but I appreciated where the story goes from there. It also doesn't hurt that Roberts and Rudd have great chemistry, with Rudd clearly showing just how good he can be at balancing drama and comedy.The middle act is benefited by an uncharacteristically unplugged performance from Selena Gomez and a few other surprises along the way. Those surprises, however, make for some of the more contrived moments, and even painfully on-the-nose emotional arcs, but the performances really carry you through the weaker scenes. Gomez plays a hitchhiker and love interest for Trevor. Both of which feel forced for the sake of the story at first, but I grew to enjoy this daring career choice for Gomez. It reminded me a whole lot like Kate Hudson's Penny role in Almost Famous.This film is just fine for what it is, and that's a pleasant cable watch (in this case Netflix) for a Sunday morning. With a brisk run-time and fun performances from the cast, the majority of the contrived and clichéd elements can be forgiven.+Rudd's charm+Comedy picks up once they get on the road+New role for Gomez-Contrived and forced moments-Nothing really new here6.8/10",The Fundamentals of Caring
8,lesleyharris30,"Subtly Acted and Heartwarming,",8,12 June 2017,"The Fundamentals of Caring is a great movie with a very well developed plot and a terrific cast. It deals with a lot of heavy issues, but manages to handle it in a way that is very tame and is never too much for its audience, such as disabilities and the main character having lost his child. It balances out comedy and drama incredibly well, it has moments that had me snickering, as well as moments that brought a tear to my eye, and I never felt like either was overbearing. I was not, however, very fond of Dot and her contribution to the plot i have absolutely no problem with Selena Gomez' performance, I just did not care for the character, she felt like an unnecessary love interest in a movie that really would have been more powerful without one. I preferred the portion of the road trip that was just Ben and Trevor, and probably would have given it a nine, rather than an eight, had it remained that way. The highlight of the movie had to be the undeniable chemistry between Paul Rudd and Craig Roberts, their characters relationship is a pleasure to watch and see develop. It is sweet and pure, some of the best acting I have ever seen from Rudd, certainly the most subtle and realistic, while Roberts has terrific characterisation in his part, as well as some stellar comedic dialogue that he delivers immensely well. It is a heartwarming 90 minutes that brought a smile to my face. Dramatic, but never too much to handle, and very funny, The Fundamentals of Caring is worth the watch for anyone looking for a good comedy drama. A carer is put up to the tasked of taking after a boy with a special illness. When he finds out how long it has been since he has been out of the house, he decides to take him on a road trip. Best Performance: Paul Rudd",The Fundamentals of Caring
9,secondtake,A warm idea that isn't pushed and pulled very hard--feels sorta good!,5,4 August 2016,"The Fundamentals of Caring (2016)A sweet, uncomplicated movie. Paul Rudd is solid if a bit restrained (though he has a handful of great lines), but the younger counterpart played by Craig Roberts is really sharp and funny. They way they support and redeem each other is the whole of the movie.There is an attempt to add some depth, from the straight up mother who overplays her custodial role to a couple of people who get picked up along the road trip, both quirky but neither very convincing in the larger story. They are all add-ons that have little depth. Too bad.Yes, this is a road movie, with some well used ideas about finding weird Americana along the way to discovering yourself. It's fun, sure, but you'll find enough predictable parts to make you wish someone had take some chances. By the time they get to the highlight (which is a literal low point—you'll see), both of the add-on characters are pushed to extremes that don't resolve well.I enjoyed the movie in some simple warm way, but don't expect brilliance. I think, in a way, brilliance was not the idea, but something more sincere and heartfelt. Hate to feel like I'm bashing a feel-good movie, but it's really the movie-making and writing, not the sentiments, that are the problem.",The Fundamentals of Caring
10,DarkVulcan29,Well made bittersweet film,9,31 July 2016,"Ben(Paul Rudd) a former writer running away from a personal tragedy, takes a job has a care giver, becomes one to Trevor(Craig Roberts) a young man with muscular dystrophy, how has a very self serving sense of humor, has the two start to bond, Ben decides to take Trevor on a road trip, in hopes to get him a taste for a little adventure, they meet up with Dot(Selena Gomez) and Peaches(Megan Ferguson) along the way.An entertaining film, that is good at being dramatic, but never forgets to be funny either. Rudd and Roberts are great together, there performances are good because they very real, making you forget that there just acting. The road trip part is also great it. Although Selena Gomez is good in spots but in other parts her acting spots her acting seems non existence, Megan Ferguson is pretty memorable has Peaches.",The Fundamentals of Caring
11,alindsay-al,A great mix of fun and drama,8,10 May 2018,"This film has Paul Rudd in the lead so I was interested in watching it, and I have now seen The Fundamentals of Caring and I actually really enjoyed watching this film. The premise of the film sees a man after suffering a personal tragedy becomes a carer for a disabled teenager and try and find himself again. As mentioned Paul Rudd is the lead in this film and he is fantastic in the role. he brings the humour to the role that you would expect but I was particularly impressed with his dramatic work in this film. In the last few years he has improved immensely as an actor and this film is one of his best overall performances. Craig Roberts plays Trevor the teenager Rudd is caring for and he is great in this film, the chemistry and relationship between him and Rudd really drives this film forward and is easily the best part of this film. Selena Gomez is in this film as sort of a romance for Trevor and she does a decent job in this film with a fun attitude bought to this film. However, there are a few characters in this film that were completely unnecessary and just poorly acted that took me out of the film. The story as mentioned before is at its strongest when it focuses on the relationship between Rudd and Roberts and it really develops really well and it is really well handled. Though as mentioned before this film has some elements in it that feels forced and unnecessary to detract from the overall quality of the film. The script is really good, the humour is obviously pretty funny having me laughing quite a lot of times. The drama though was also really well handled and saw me buying into the majority of the dramatic moments in the film. The style of the film could have been mishandled very easily but it is very well done, the mix of humour and drama really works and the pacing makes this film an easy watch. Overall this is a great journey to watch that will have you entertained for the majority and is definitely worth watching.",The Fundamentals of Caring
12,dierregi,Average drama-comedy,3,22 July 2018,"Paul Rudd is Ben, a depressed ex-writer with a tragic secret who decides to start a new career as a caregiver. His first job is with obnoxious Trevor, a British boy suffering from muscular dystrophy. What follows is a ""meet cute""/""take no prisoners"" kind of relationship, so popular in contemporary ""family movies"".Trevor is not a likeable guy, although suffering from a terrible and incurable illness, I found it impossible to sympathise with him. Ben is supposed ""not to get emotionally involved"" with Trevor, which looks like not requiring too much of an effort... but of course, he does get all fatherly.A Ben/Trevor road trip ensues peppered by several sub-plots, one of them about Dot, a foul-mouthed runaway who thinks she's the wisest girl on earth and - again, obviously - has a fling with Trevor.With the entrance of Dot I lost interest. She is - as described in ""Gone Girl"" - a ""cool"" girl, the type of stereotyped female that infests most contemporary movies. She is also a convenient plot device, ready to give Trevor his much needed sexual experience and to prove that ""cool"" girls have no prejudice - no matter how bad their language may be. A very ""indie' movie, from the look & feel to the straight to Netflix distribution",The Fundamentals of Caring
13,Kamurai25,Fundamentals of boo-yah!,8,7 July 2020,"Great watch, would watch again, and can recommend.I like a good ""road trip"" trope, and crossing it with a disability trope doesn't take anything out of it. Instead of the handicap being something that prevents the story (despite them actively saying so, repeatedly), it accents it. Yeah, he can't climb stairs, but that doesn't actually prevents him from getting to a 2nd floor, it's just the way they go about it is different, and this style of writing is throughout the movie. ""The Fault in Our Stars"" is another good example if you're trying to think of something.Paul Rudd does a lot of the work in this movie, playing well with Craig Robets from his chair, but each character is necessary and specific in their design, they each add something special to the mix to create this refined story of dark death and dick jokes.While I'm sure some fine the humor juvenile, the story is a juvenile story: it's about letting a (disabled) juvenile do something that a (non-disabled) juvenile would do.",The Fundamentals of Caring
14,leftbanker-1,Clichéd but Fun,6,30 August 2016,"A man looking to get back into life helps out a kid who never had a life to begin with. Sound familiar? We've seen this formula a million times but it still has some appeal and this film succeeds on a few levels. One bit of life the kid in the wheelchair could have used was a good ass kicking. I don't care how messed up your are, you still need to have manners and respect for others.Selena Gomez was absolutely the best choice for this role as the choice-as-can-be little tomato that represents the fantasy of every young male heterosexual, both with and without the use of all appendages.I liked the film right up until the part where we learn that he backed over his own kid, and then he peeled out on his still breathing body. What kind of father would do that? Simply backing over one of your own offspring is bad but why would he compound this sin by then revving the engine up to the redline before releasing the clutch to do a burn-out on the dying heap that is your first born child? Why? OK, I'm not sure all of that happened but they sort of implied it and whatever they led us to believe it was a stupid gimmick and completely unnecessary. As if the entire set-up weren't maudlin enough they just had to heap this on us in the end.",The Fundamentals of Caring

But that doesn't stop this from being a funny, entertaining, heart-warming movie.Paul Rudd is right at home (basically playing Paul Rudd) and everyone else is very well cast and give great performances.There is nothing new here but, despite the theme, it is the kind of film that washes away the troubles of the day for an hour or so and makes you feel grateful, rather than guilty, for what you have.The story is simple and the comedy is not particularly clever but it all just works.

First of all, I'd like to say that I am a fan of character development. Many good movies aren't great because their characters lack a real sense of attachment. The fundamentals of caring nails it on the head. Paul Rudd is a work of art in this film and quite frankly that surprised me. Selena Gomez pleasantly perfected her role as well which surprised me even more. I am not placing any spoilers but I will tell you that it shouldn't matter what type of movies you typically enjoy, you SHOULD enjoy this one. I am a 23 year old female, and an Army Vet so you would expect a guy like me to be into more manly macho movies. Well you'd be right. But as a fan of art and emotion, I respect movies like this. You will feel a way with the story that brings you everything from joy, laughter, pain, guilt and even fear. Its an emotional roller-coaster ride and I'll be riding it again in the front seat every time. Must watch movie hands down. I'll even say you should subscribe to Netflix even if it's only for one month just to see this movie. This definitely makes its way on my top 10, easily.",The Fundamentals of Caring
20,meydiana-65242,An Entertaining Comedy-Drama,10,18 October 2020,"An Entertaining Comedy-Drama
When I read Netflix's synopsis about The Fundamentals of Caring, I did not expect much from the movie. Given the somber premise, I thought it to be an incredibly mushy, overly emotional film. I have to say the movie exceeded my expectations greatly.First of all, The Fundamentals of Caring does well to avoid the tropes that one normally associates with the genre of the buddy comedy. It also pokes fun at the clichéd movie ""disabled"" person, one who is either larger than life or depressed with his life. What we get are two very original characters, Ben (played by Paul Rudd) and Trevor (played by Craig Roberts), who are just ordinary human beings.As original and well-written Ben and Trevor's characters may be, Dot (played by Selena Gomez) is not at all well-developed throughout the movie's run. More than Ben, Dot is the character that inspires Trevor to push past his limits and jump over his self-imposed hurdles. Although this is a crucial part of the story, the character herself does not contribute much other than blank expressions and explicit dialogues. This is both a fault of Gomez and of the movie's writers, as the character could either have developed so much more throughout the movie, or she could have had a smaller role in the scope of the movie.While the movie gets off to a strong start, it does not maintain this momentum as it progresses forward. It would have been beneficial for the writers to have stretched the movie's run-time in order to develop the climax more, as it felt incredibly rushed. While increasing the movie's run-time runs the risk of making the movie ""too long,"" I find that a movie that is too short in length sabotages its chance of leaving a lasting impact on its audience.Despite the flaws in the writing of the movie, I found that Paul Rudd and Craig Roberts were phenomenal as Ben and Trevor. Paul Rudd is normally known for his comic roles in movies like Anchorman and Antman. However, he manages to deliver a natural, sincere performance as Ben, a grief stricken caregiver. It is in the quiet, subtle moments of the movie that Rudd manages to convey Ben's suffering and what he's going through. It is these moments that demonstrate that Rudd has a great deal of acting range if it's channeled by his directors.While I have been familiar with Rudd's work, I was not at all familiar with Craig Roberts' work. I recognized him from his small roles in 22 Jump Street and Neighbors (And I had no idea he was British!), but not much else. This movie definitely shows what he's capable of as an actor, and I hope it serves as a suitable launch pad for future roles in his career. His portrayal of Trevor definitely surpassed my expectations, as he gave the character a sense of humanity and avoided going for the clichés.Overall, I would recommend The Fundamentals of Caring to anyone who appreciates a good comedy-drama. While the movie is not perfect, it features two leading actors who are at the top of their game.",The Fundamentals of Caring
21,bshaef,I Watched the Entire Movie Without Moving a Muscle',8,19 December 2020,The story and acting were awesome. I wish there were more like this one. I'd never heard of it and just wandered on to it by accident. First time I've ever seen Selena in a movie and was she ever good. Thank you Netflix. You scored a thousand per cent with this one.

22,ethanbresnett,Heartwarming and humorous in equal measure,8,4 August 2021,"The Fundamentals of Caring is a very enjoyable, heartwarming and funny road trip/buddy film.Paul Rudd never misses and was spot on in this film. He brought his usual comedic charm but infused it with a great warmth and depth which worked very well. His chemistry with Craig Roberts was a joy to which, with the back and forths between them so well scripted. They felt very real and were a refreshing take on someone with a disability. Roberts' performance was great, as was the supporting turn from Selena Gomez.The plot is very enjoyable. It's heartwarming, full of crude humour, and is just generally a nice ride to be a part of.At only 90 minutes long too this film is an absolute no brainer.

23,dansview,Sweet but Telegraphed,6,3 July 2016,"What exactly is Selena Gomez's talent? I never got that. Not on Disney, and not in this film. She looks like she's 13 and she's swearing like a sailor. It's awkward and forced. She brings zero nuance to the role of hitchhiking youth.How many times can we see Paul Rudd as an ineffectual loser? He plays it well though. I'll give him that. Or is he playing himself each time? The wheelchair kid was good. I liked his facial expressions. I believed them. Adding the pregnant lady and the dads, etc. was just too much for me. It was forced and cliché.I would love to have heard some dialog about the fact that nobody knows how long they will live, and we all have to cherish the simple moments. I would also love to see a handicapped person in a movie completely freak out and bark at the moon. Tom Cruise did it in Born on the Fourth of July and it was more than memorable.There is nothing unique or remarkable about this film. But I guess we have come to accept mediocrity in our ""art."" Having said all that, it was a likable movie, and I don't regret spending the time.Despite it being a road trip movie, the scenery was lacking in the ""wow"" factor. Nothing stood out.I do think the Rudd character went into care giving to find redemption. Not necessarily with kids, but with people. Watch it and you will see why. Speaking of that, the use of flashbacks were effective in this one.",The Fundamentals of Caring
24,patches89,Brilliant heartfelt film,9,7 January 2021,"Paul Rudd has been well known for his comedy roles and even in Ant Man it has lot of humour.

It hits a few emotional strings in a very uplifting way, I highly recommend watching",The Fundamentals of Caring
25,kaptenvideo-89875,Actual caring is better,5,2 September 2017,"A writer (Paul Rudd) retires after a great personal tragedy and becomes a disabled teen's (Craig Roberts) caregiver. When the two embark on an road trip, both of their abilities to cope with the real world is put under a test. Also appearing: Julia Denton, Jennifer Ehle, Selena Gomez et al. There's something enduringly endearing about Paul Rudd. He's only an OK actor, and he does way too many bland and generic comedies but I still find him cool and want to see most everything he shows up in. This is actually one the better ones. It's not really good, per se... but at least one of the less bland and generic ones. Based on a novel by Jonathan Evison, written and directed by Rob Burnett, produced as a Netflix original, it's a bittersweet comedy about not being a pussy and trying to live every once in a while. It has a heart in right place but looking back, I'd like to criticize more than applaud the result. Writer-director Burnett has tried definitely too hard creating an authentic and hip story to really get away with it. it would probably help if two of the three main female characters were more realistic or at least more compatible with the general tone, not as exaggerated and shallow as they are now. Also, Burnett seems to be much better at adding the story lines than working with them, so most of the stuff brought in gets carelessly thrown overboard at some point without proper development or closure. Well, at least the central story of taking a road trip gets enough attention. Rudd is charming as usual, but he doesn't quite have all the range needed for playing this character. He's fine most of the time because he speaks little and acting grumpy is easy, but all in all, it's easy to notice a certain lack of depth to his acting. Wish they used somebody more diverse actor for that role. The best thing here is Craig Roberts giving a quirky, deadpan performane as foul-mouthed disabled teen. Roberts is probably still best known for his breakthrough role in 2010's Submarine"", but this is certainly a good follow-up. I kind of felt him channeling young Edward Norton and young Joseph Gordon- Levitt, which is a good company to hang out in. ""Fundamentals"" is quite OK but it doesn't really hold together well, if you begin to think about it. But... there's still Rudd!",The Fundamentals of Caring
26,zac-04879,The Humour of this Quirky and Surprising Dark Comedy is Perfect,8,6 August 2021,"Even without its hysterical source of dark humour, Rob Burnett's film is delightful, gleaming, quirky and much more than just a simple road trip. There's many elements to class this movie as a must-watch comedy-drama. It all starts with the comical position placed in several spots, before moving towards the acting and story in general.A disabled teenager participating in a smooth road trip with his caregiver, alongside several dramatic and hilarious events definitely appears as average. Despite the typical storyline, The Fundamentals of Caring is actually a super fun and hopeful film. Watch this film not only for its touching themes and connectable characters, but for it's amount of catchy dark humour. There's pranks, laughs and friends.Another thing the film manages to include in order to classify itself as a heartfelt story is the presentation of quirky characters performed by Rudd and Roberts. Along with other characters along the way, Roberts and Rudd are magnificent together! They manage to portray the bright and gloomy humour in a way that makes the film a very moving and passionate surprise.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",The Fundamentals of Caring
27,SpoilerAlertReviews,A heartwarming and awkward road trip of a movie.,9,15 January 2017,"Big Network TV producer Rob Burnett directs his first feature length film since 2007's comedy, We Made This Movie. The bulk of his entertainment career has been as executive producer behind The Late Show with David Letterman and CEO of network televisions programs such as Everyone Loves Raymond and The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn. Based on Jonathan Evison's book, The Revised Fundamentals of care giving. Burnett Netflix original about a Teenager boy, Trevor, who suffers from Duchenne Muscle Dystrophy embarks on a road trip of discovery with his new, inexperienced carer Ben Benjamin who appears to have his own underlying, personal issues himself. Trevor is played by Craig Roberts and I'm finding it hard to judge his acting, because I have little experience of knowing people who suffer with that disease and I don't want to offend anyone by saying it he was amazing. I can, however, comment on his character, who is sarcastic to the highest degree, pessimistic yet humorous will it and quite the challenging person to care for. Paul Rudd is an absolute treat to watch as the struggling carer Ben Benjamin who's lack of experience doesn't match his perseverance of getting the job done. The chemistry between the two is touching and balanced, especially when Benjamin manages to convince Trevor's overprotective mother to allow them to take a road trip and strike off a lot of places off of Trevor's bucket list leading onto quite the adventure. It's a joy to watch their relationship grow and having a few other characters jumping on the band wagon along the way, such as Selena Gomez who plays a rather foul-mouthed free spirit young lady who's not afraid to voice her opinions. It's brutally honest which is refreshing and highly entertaining as egos and morals clash in the van. Impressively shot in only 26 days, it actually feels a lot longer than the 97minute running which is actually a good thing. It's doesn't drag at all as there's plenty going on. It's an often humorous, yet touching and thought-provoking story where all the characters get an education in life, changing their perspectives. It's a heartwarming, joyful journey with it's expected bumps along the way but coming to a lovely conclusion, certainly one of Netflix's must sees. Running Time: 9 The Cast: 8 Performance: 9 Direction: 8 Story: 9 Script: 9 Creativity: 8 Soundtrack: 7 Job Description: 8 The Extra Bonus Points: 10 for such a refreshing and slightly awkward road trip Blu-ray: Yes, would go next to films like 50/50 and Edge of Seventeen. 85% 9/10",The Fundamentals of Caring

29,Sasha_Lauren,A passable comedy-drama anchored by the talented Paul Rudd,5,20 September 2019,"This is a passable comedy-drama buddy-road trip picture. Paul Rudd plays Ben Benjamin, a ""retired writer,"" who is grieving from a personal tragedy. He becomes a caretaker for Trevor, a sassy, emotionally wounded teen with Duschene Muscular Dystrophy played by Craig Roberts. Robert's character can't move anything besides his hands and head, so he is in large part dependent on his caregiver Rudd, but that doesn't stop the incessent pranks Trevor pulls on Ben. It was tough for me to stick with the film because of the commercial and formulaic production style. The likeability, talent, and humanity of Paul Rudd as an actor is what kept me watching. In brief, Trevor leads a sheltered, regimented, limited life: a steady diet of crap TV; waffles and sausages for all three meals; handfuls of medications and supplements; a CPAP breathing mask over his face to sleep; a growing stack of unopened, unwanted letters from his father who abandoned him; and one three-hour visit to a park weekly. Sad stuff. What begins as a prank ends up materializing into a road trip in the Caretaker's van through the midwest to see cheesy natural wonder roadside attractions. Along the way they pick up Dot, a female teen runaway, (love interest for Trevor), played adequately by a fun Selena Gomez, and Peaches, a very pregnant, quirky woman played sweetly by Megan Ferguson. In the middle of struggling through this film, one of my favorite Leonard Cohen song played as part of the soundtrack; that song and the presence of Paul Rudd were the best parts of the film for me. If you like this type of ""feel good"" Hollywood fare or are a Paul Rudd fan, you'll probably enjoy this.",The Fundamentals of Caring
30,stonedraim,Aloha,7,30 July 2016,"**** May contain strong spoilers ****This is a review made by StoneDraim... and that means that if you want to read a probably different kind of review, keep reading....This is my personal experience, my personal point of view/perspective and my personal opinion... and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this world.Paul Rudd is doing a really splendid job as the care giver and diving right into the role. A thing that comes into my mind is if the director and the team behind this movie intended to softly and gently blend in Paul Rudds ""ordinary roles bizarre humour"" and let it almost shine even now and then in this motion picture? The scene with ""take a bite of the James, shall we?"" (about 28 minutes into the movie) is just hilarious, and Paul Rudd feels so comfortable all of a sudden in every aspect.The grey nuance that the whole picture is filmed in puts a sad tone throughout the entire production. What gives that feeling a push is the gentle music that comes with a ukulele. My mind came a little to the movie ""Frank"" (Michael Fassbender and others), where I were left with just a sad and tragic tone that made me feel so lonely.One liner of the movie: Girl: ""Cool f*****g sneakers..."" Craig Roberts: ""Mall.""All in all, this is a good movie. It gives a little entertainment and a lot of things to contemplate about and around. Do you like dramas with a good sense of humour and common sense, look this one up. there is a more than handful of really great laughs in there. Also to find, there is little hidden feel good touch surrounding ""The Fundamentals Of Caring""... they should have tweaked that up a couple of notches. To the negative side; ""The Fundamentals Of Caring"" feels too light and too thin to really take off as an heavy drama and tragic humour. One scene that really is going to stay with me is one of the final scene at the deepest pit... wonderful act by Ben Benjamin. Even if a dream is ""just"" to stand while peeing, it should be done...yes, it should be done. Magic movie moment, right there!Give Paul Rudd more good scripts and opportunities. He is one fine actor.Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Balanced and solid. The grey nuance makes it sad and lonely. Music tops off things so it delivers to the viewer. Sound and visuals more than in place. Solid production althrough! - The actors : Gives what the story demands, and a little more. They are all fine and in place. Great cast! - Entertainment : Sad and funny. A movie to watch and bring home. Made me feel more alive. One of those little special ones that probably will last in my memory, and one of those special ones that made me a little sad at the end, just to be mindboggled and thereafter start to laugh hard. ;) - Age : All ages.7,2 out of 10.

31,Harhaluulo54,"If the movie Untouchable (2011) had been awful, it would have been this movie",1,25 February 2017,"This movie starts off with our special-needs-bad-attitude kid asking the question ""how would you wipe my ***."" And it ends me saying ""well, I would take this movie's cover picture, wipe your *** with it and then put it in your mouth. So my question to you is, 'did the sh*t ever leave the ***hole?'"" The philosophical / life questions this movie raises are all sh*t. I don't mean this as an insult. I mean literally every time the characters say something ""smart"" it is always somehow tied to sh*t, *** or ***holes. Few times to pen**. It goes down your throat in such extend that at some point you start to wish you were watching South Park episode about ""The Poo That Took a Pee"" just to how less genital / urea related content in your TV. I already early on, after the first ***-related comparison - decided I would not like this movie. As the story advanced, I only came to once again realize that movies can -indeed- be judged in the first minutes. The story felt like a try- hard version of Untouchable without delivering anything except bitterness and bad attitude. More suitable name for this title is The Fukk-a-mentality of Swearing, just because they swear and talk sh*t so much that you find yourself doing the same. I have been temporarily corrupted by this.... sh*t. All in all I can't recommend this movie to anyone else except to those who think swearing is cool or have illogical obsession about ***holes. I mean, who needs thought-provoking, witty or sarcasm when you can just use the worlds ***, f*** and sh*t in so many different orders that it would surprise you. Insert few pen**es so the jokes won't fall SHORT. Nope, still not funny.** I had to censor down a lot of the words because IMDb won't allow me to use the same swear words this movie is filled with.

34,midas-jacobs,Not as cliché as it seems!,8,25 June 2016,"I mostly saw this movie because of Paul Rudd, and because I was curious if the movie was as cliché and cheesy as it seemed. Well, here is my opinion about the movie. Some minor spoilers might have slipped through!""The Fundamentals of Caring"" is about Trevor and his care-giver Ben. Trevor is a teenage boy, who is suffering from a disease that kills him slowly, and he can't walk, or move his arms properly. Now Ben wants to give Trevor a good time, before he dies.The directing of the movie was very good. Rob Burnett was responsible for this. He was really good, and surprised me. I thought that the director would also follow the cliché rules of a drama movie, but he didn't. He used his own style, which makes this movie stand out more. He used some cool camera movements, but at times I could notice that actors walked where he said them to walk too, which made it look a bit unnatural. The cinematography too was very well done. It wasn't the best I've seen but it was very good. The soundtrack however was less good. The music taste wasn't great, and it was poorly chosen. The editing too wasn't fantastic. I wouldn't call it bad, but it wasn't great either. I have spotted a couple of mistakes, and I don't look after them, so that says enough. An example is when Trevor and Ben are riding the van. Ben looks into the mirror of the car, and sees another car behind them. Then the shot changes and we see that there isn't a car behind them at all. The green-screen behind them was by the way very noticeable. The sound editing was well done, though. This too was well chosen. The acting now. On average this was fine, but that's just because one actress really drags down the average. But let's start with one of the main characters. The one why I decided to watch the movie. Paul Rudd. Rudd did a really good job at portraying Ben. He proves that he once again can play a more serious role, and not only comedy roles. He was very convincing and I think that he was one of the best actors in this movie. His counterpart was the actor of Trevor. Craig Roberts played him. He was very good too. His body language was very convincing and made me believe that he really was someone who was suffering under the disease that Trevor has. His emotional scenes were also done very well. His love interest was Selena Gomez. She played Dot. Before I went into this movie I knew that she had the acting capability of a potato. Yes I just compared her to a potato. And now that I've seen the movie I can confirm that that hasn't changed. She was wrongly cast. She didn't fit the character and almost every line she said sounded funny to me, because it was so bad. She is the one who dragged the average down. Peaches is also introduced in the movie. She felt like a forced character and I didn't really like her that much. The acting of her was a bit over the top too my taste. Megan Ferguson played her. The mom of Trevor was fine. She had some bad line-deliveries, but overall I wouldn't say that she did a bad acting job.The writing was also done by the director. Like I said in the beginning of my review: I was worried that the movie was going to be cliché and cheesy. And was it? My answer to that is: Sometimes. The movie has a story that has been told a lot of times before, a lot of times in a bad way, and sometimes in a good way. This time it was told in a good way. The reason why is due to the director, Paul Rudds acting and the dialogue. In the script there are a lot of jokes, something I didn't expect seeing, because of the theme of the movie. The jokes mostly contained black humor, the kind I like, and it was very funny. Sometimes they became a bit repetitive but still. The dialogue overall, except from the jokes, was good. This wasn't something top notch, but I liked it. Throughout the movie they also want to develop the characters a bit. This is of course a good thing. But it felt a but forced for me. It didn't really fall out of place, but seeing the same memory in bits and pieces for a couple of times isn't great. Also by sending Trevor to his dad they try to develop his character. This time it was done better and it wasn't so forced in. With the ending of the movie I was very happy. The ending wasn't your cliché ending and I was so happy about it. They took another route that fitted the theme of the movie perfectly. I am satisfied with it, in case you didn't notice already.In the end ""The Fundamentals of Caring"" was a great movie, with a good director, good acting - with some exceptions - and some good writing. This movie wasn't as cliché as I thought it would be and that's why I'm giving ""The Fundamentals of Caring"" a 7.75/10",The Fundamentals of Caring

Some story lines just don't make sense and serve no purpose (reason for Dot to run away, pregnant lady whose car broke down and just randomly joins the trip, it made it all a bit more unrealistic to me).As an aside, I thought that Trevor, who is supposed to be a teen looked way too old.But it's still enjoyable to watch. There are some fun conversations. I would think this movie is in the same category as The Fault in our Stars, or maybe TV show Dawson's Creek (showing my age here), with some sarcasm and cynicism.Anyway, I just like Paul Rudd.",The Fundamentals of Caring

44,LittleLotti,Better than expected,7,26 July 2016,"I love Paul Rudd, but honestly I've never been a huge fan of his movies. After watching Prince Avalanche and being thoroughly disappointed and bored, I had very low expectations for TFOC. I was pleasantly surprised. This movie is nothing groundbreaking or original, yet it was still so enjoyable and I think that's largely in apart due to the cast. Paul Rudd was perfect and his face showed all the appropriate emotions. His chemistry with Craig Roberts was fantastic. Selena Gomez did a good job too. I've never seen anything she's been in but obviously I know her as a Disney star and so it was a little weird at first seeing her play such an edgy character. The movie wasn't as predictable as I thought it'd be. I mean, again, it wasn't super original but it also didn't go where I thought it would. There were many humorous moments and I found myself smiling often. My only complaint is about one character/plot point that felt out of place to me(a pregnant woman). I know what the character's situation did for Paul Rudd's character but it felt unrealistic and just odd altogether near the end of the movie. I was thinking, ""Ugh, really?"" But it didn't tarnish the movie for me. This is a great film to watch on a lonely afternoon indoors. Just a note: there is a lot of swearing in the movie, which didn't bother me, but I know some people are turned off by that. You should still give it a chance.",The Fundamentals of Caring

A movie that can send you through a myriad of emotions and make you think about the world while at the same time make you laugh your head off. I have never seen tragedy and humor blended together so well. I am a huge Paul Rudd fan and I really feel that this is his best role so far. Many people know him as a comedian but his serious acting is also amazing. You will see a blend of both in this movie. The chemistry between Ben, Trevor and Dot was amazing, I loved every second of it and I didn't want it to end. The addition of Peaches, the pregnant woman was a little confusing to me and I questioned her relevance until the scene where she is giving birth and we finally see the full flashback of the tragedy that befell Ben's son. We simultaneously see his son's life coming to an end while this new life is beginning. I felt that the movie lost its momentum once Peaches arrived and when they confronted Trevor's father. The actor they chose for him was an odd choice, was he supposed to appear mentally challenged or was he just a jerk? And Trevor's mom did not appear to be the coddling type, I thought it was strange that she would have written him those letters.I was sorry to see Dot go off with her father but I was glad that Trevor got to experience a normal life and romance, however brief it was. I like to decide that he sees her again and that they perhaps ultimately end up together somehow. I did not really like that Ben resigned as his caregiver two weeks after their epic ordeal, but I guess what Trevor said about Ben trying to find redemption through him was true. I guess the point is that they stay in each other's lives. It is beautiful that he lost his son and essentially gains Trevor to replace that connection. I did not like that Ben told Peaches that having children is literally the only reason we are all here. I do not feel that is true and I feel that the movie even realizes that in the end. The point of us all being here is clearly human connection, not just between parents and children, connections of love and understanding between ANYONE. I would have personally liked to have seen more backstory between Ben and his seemingly heartless wife after the accident and more clarity on the accident itself. Ben seemed to blame himself for what happened but it seemed to be a freak accident. Was it really his fault, or was something wrong with that car? It looked like the gear shift was shaky and that he had put the emergency brake on too. So I don't really understand how that ended up happening.It was beautiful how all of them had suffered in some way on their own and how together they filled in ""the deepest pit"" that was in each of their hearts. I think the point was to show how beautiful life can still be even amidst all the unexpected sorrow.",The Fundamentals of Caring

A smile that we see time and time again and most notably surrounded by awkward feces changing jokes, awkward, unless you are into that sort of thing.

The character and I dare say the actor portraying him built up little to no cache yet we are supposed to ride and die with this stranger from the opening scene.

53,BlueFairyBlog,Easy to Care About,8,27 September 2016,"Novels about teenagers disabled or dying have become hugely popular lately. Looking at books like ""The Fault in Our Stars,"" ""The Beginning of Everything,"" and ""Wonder,"" it's clear that the way to engage with teenaged readers is to show differently abled people in a positive light. In that same vein comes this Netflix film, based on the book ""The Revised Fundamentals of Caring,"" by Jonathan Evison.The story follows caregiver Ben (Rudd) as he recovers from a personal tragedy that has left him unable to write or understand his pending divorce. He meets disabled teen Trevor (Roberts), a Welsh teenager with a morbid sense of humor and a sailor's mouth, and they each help one another cope with their issues. Trevor is fascinated with world oddities, and Ben proposes a road trip to see them all, and along the way they run into Dot (Gomez), a lovable hitchhiker. As dramedies go, this is a good one, fusing together the issues of living with muscular dystrophy and being a teenager.Craig Roberts has been one to watch since his great turn in Richard Ayoade's ""Submarine,"" and currently he is both acting and directing in a lot of great films and British television. He and Gomez have sparkling chemistry on screen, and it's a pity that she doesn't act more. Between this and ""Spring Breakers,"" Gomez has shown serious artistic growth in her acting choices in the past five years, which is truly amazing. Rudd is reserved yet charming, in the way that only Paul Rudd can pull off. He and Roberts are great together, playing off of each other's insecurities and tragic backstories.The weakest part of the plot is probably Ben's issues with his dead child. Not to belittle the grief and pain of losing a child, but it's not needed in this film. Ben could have had any other form of pain in his past and it would have been so much better. It can be argued that having that loss of a child creates a greater bond between Ben and Trevor, but really it's just added to make Ben seem more poignant and heartbreaking as a character. The child isn't even really mentioned throughout, and the flashback to his death is pointless and unnerving in a lazy way.Overall I find this to be a sweet and funny film, with themes that are important for teens and adults alike, but there's nothing new to the telling of the story. It is great to see a character with a disability handled in such a thoughtful way, but again, having that addition to the story doesn't mean it's doing anything altogether new or revolutionary.",The Fundamentals of Caring

56,FallonTimberlake2016,A great movie that should be put up with some of the best road trip films ever.,8,27 June 2016,"The Fundamentals of Caring surprised me for a couple of reasons. First of all, even though they started off great with Beasts of No Nation, Netflix has not made very good movies lately. With two bad Adam Sandler comedies and a mediocre Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon sequel, I started to wonder whether they were going to redeem themselves movie-wise. On top of that, this movie stars Selena Gomez, who hasn't made any good movies despite being relatively easy to look at.Netflix, you have been redeemed, because this was an exemplary film with great acting from Paul Rudd and very likable characters. This was a fun movie to watch what with there being dark humor and heartwarming exchanges between the main trio. Speaking of which, all of the three actors were great! As I said before, Paul Rudd took the cake for me. He stole the majority of his scenes in the film, which again solidifies his talent for dramatic roles and not just comedic. Craig Roberts made me laugh multiple times throughout the runtime with the delivery of his lines. I have not heard of him and am looking forward to more roles in the future. And yes, Selena Gomez actually gave a well executed performance! I have nothing against her, it's just that after seeing clips of the movie Getaway I was skeptical. There is an appearance of Bobby Cannavale in this movie that I quite enjoyed also.If you are looking for a movie completely purged of clichés, than this may not be the one for you. The backstory does help you feel for the characters, but has been seen in various other films.There is also a distinct lack of obstacles, but this does not deter the film from working its magic. The previous paragraph is basically all I found wrong with this film, and I was just looking for things to nitpick on. If you are looking for a good film to watch with your family on Netflix, The Fundamentals of Caring is perfect, and it is a shame that The Do-Over is significantly more popular than this gem.I give The Fundamentals of Caring 8/10 stars.P.S. Watching this with your family might be a problem because this does have a decent amount of language.

Not sure if this has been mentioned on any of the other reviews or boards, but I thought this film had a similar spirit to The Road Within, another fantastic and quirky road trip film. Some critics complain about the predictability of the film, but I couldn't disagree more. I never felt deceived or played to with clichés. There was a definite playfulness that I greatly appreciated. There was great chemistry among all the cast and I would highly recommend a watch. It's uplifting, hopeful, poignant and often at times laugh out loud funny. Based on a novel, the story is about a middle aged man who has suffered incredible losses and becomes a caregiver and gains a new perspective.

Not actually I just got distracted by her being there and her acting/character wasn't strong enough to keep me from getting annoyed.

Every member of the cast delivered performances as nuanced as the material allowed. The central relationship between care-giver and charge was handled with humour and humanity.I don't want to say too much, except that I really enjoyed the ride and I think it is one that deserves to be seen by more people.

67,audreyheler,Much more than just a ´road trip´,7,2 June 2020,"I hadn´t heard of that film, maybe had I not paid attention or was it eclypsed by higher budget ones who benefited from a great promotion.
Anyway, it was an extremely pleasant surprise to me. I had seen Paul Rudd in a couple of films but that´s it. Mainly in comedies. I knew he was talented but I had never seen him in a serious role. He appeared to me to be really good.
I had only seen Jennifer Ehle in Pride and Prejudice so it was nice to see her again in the role of the fragile mother who has to keep strong to take care of her son. I wished she had had more scenes but it makes sense that she wouldn´t as the film is not really about the mother.
Then comes Craig (sorry I forgot his last name) who plays the role of the teenager who has DMD, a disability that prevents him from walking. I was afraid during his first scene that it would be about showing the misery of being disabled and that this film would be about making us cry but no. His role is a very realistic one. He appears to be like many teenagers, sarcacstic, playful, sensitive, and we simply end up wanting to take care of him.
The role held by Selena Gomez is also very interesting. She plays a slightly rough yet touching rebel and, as I read in another critic, she simply owns the character.
The only part that I think we could have ´lived without´ was the one of the pregnant woman. The reason for her presence was not obvious to me at first, even far-fetched, but I understood it in one of the last scenes, which I actually did not like that much as it was a bit too made in´Hollywood´ for me.
This is for the actors and the characters.
Now, the story is quite simple: Paul Rudd decides to become a carer as his marriage is ending and he lost his son. He is therefore trying to find something to keep his mind busy. He is hired to take care of a disabled teenager who is constantly challenging his abilities to take care of him, until the day that he decides to challenge him to go on a road trip so he can learn to change his habits and grow.
As said it the title, it then becomes more than just a road trip, it is a journey through life with a disability, love, going through redemption, and caring for one another.

71,LaowaiGuy,Good film had a chance to be great,6,7 September 2016,"Quirky road-trip movies have a chance to become great films because of the many opportunities the characters have to develop as they get to know each other while they complete their journey. This is what made Little Miss Sunshine an engaging, humorous film full of troubled but lovable characters. Unfortunately, The Fundamentals of Caring never reaches these heights.In this film, the characters are fairly unlikable at first (as expected)but never really grow to be all that likable in the end. Craig Roberts does a fantastic job playing Trevor who is wheelchair bound with MS. Because of his disability, Trevor is given a huge leeway to be a jerk while pretending to have severe conditions that he isn't experiencing. This is forgivable when we are first introduced to the character, but becomes increasingly annoying as he jeopardizes a friendship to play dangerous pranks. I guess as a MS victim he has found very few other ways to amuse himself.Paul Rudd's character Ben is depressed due to a personal tragedy when he first meets Trevor. Through his unique style of care-giving, he and Trevor form a close bond due to his ability to handle Trevor's antics. He has a good heart and wants Trevor to experience life beyond his home and brief trips to a park. The road trip is the perfect opportunity to broaden Trevor's horizons.At first, Trevor's mother is strongly against the trip for safety reasons, but relents as Ben thoroughly explains their itinerary and safety precautions, though it still seems like a bad idea for a MS patient. They meet two characters while on the road to the ""biggest pit in the world"". One is Dot (Selena Gomez) who is a foul-mouthed runaway who claims to be 21. Her character has no redeeming attributes, but is probably the first young woman that Trevor has seen in many years. The chemistry between Dot and Trevor is forced at best, but he is infatuated with her despite her lack of charm.The other character they meet (Peaches) seems to be a completely unnecessary addition to the quirky party, but gives Ben a chance to be a hero of sorts.All in all, the film manages to give most of the characters a reason for the audience to root for them; at least for a little while.P.S. The producers could have actually filmed on location starting in Washington State and going as far as Utah. Instead they decided to film it all in Georgia. As a native of the Northwest it was obvious they weren't filming anywhere near the supposed locations. Also, the plug for the beef jerky sponsor .",The Fundamentals of Caring
72,thebc-86158,Hilarious and heartwarming and never leans to heavily to either side.,10,8 August 2018,"Ben Benjamin (Paul Rudd) plays a caretaker of Trevor (Craig Roberts) a teenager with Duschene Muscular Dystrophy (he can't move anything besides his hands and head) as they go on a road trip to see the world's largest pit, despite single mother Elsa's (Jennifer Ehle) warnings, picking up a quirky cast of characters including a rebellious girl who ran away from home named Dot (Selena Gomez) and Peaches (Megan Ferguson), a pregnant woman who's car broke down. The brilliantly comedic and dramatic banter between Rudd and Roberts is amazing and the supporting cast does a great job especially, and surprisingly, Selena Gomez.

The actors did a great job for the most part with what they had (except for Trevor's fathers scene, what in the world was that even supposed to be? ) but the script didn't really give them very much to work with. The direction and sound are very cutesy too, adding to the extremely saccharine feeling thats only cut by a couple crude jokes (that really weren't that funny or shocking to begin with) being repeated over and over again.It might be a good movie for a teenager or an option for someone who is emotionally in turmoil or unable to invest into an actual story and thus needs something familiar and comforting, but for someone looking for any meaningful content I urge to look elsewhere.",The Fundamentals of Caring

76,Medialawman,The Fundamentals of Caring by Wayne J. Keeley,9,2 December 2019,"Life is either a daring adventure or nothing at all. -Helen KellerThis is a difficult review for me to write. Scratch that. This is probably one of the hardest reviews for me to write. The film The Fundamentals of Caring (FOC) is about a young man with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The disease is insidious in that is a progressive, muscle-wasting disease that affects approximately one in 3,500 male children. The prognosis is never good. Most children don't make it out of their teens alive. There is no cure. There is no treatment other than perhaps steroids which only serve to possibly prolong muscle life.My oldest son, Wyatt, has DMD.So it is with a heavy heart and a critical eye that I came to this film. Rob Burnett, probably best known in the industry for being the executive producer of the Late Show with David Letterman, wrote and directed the film. It was based on a novel The Revised Fundamentals of Caregiving by Jonathan Evison. The film stars Paul Rudd, Craig Roberts, Selena Gomez, and Bobby Cannavale.Obviously, I have a love/hate relationship with the film and it is one that has been haunting me since I watched it. While somewhat predictable in plot, it is extremely powerful. Of course, thematically it goes well beyond the plight of just DMD sufferers and their caregivers and resonates with anyone facing a serious, debilitating illness. But this film is not only personal to those affected, but to their caregivers as well. Interestingly, caregiving is one of the jobs that novelist Evison lists in his bio.Fundamentals of CaringWith respect to DMD, the film is quite accurate. Almost all children affected by the disease are in a wheelchair by their pre-teens. There is a montage of shots showing the plethora of medicines and supplements that kids with the disease often take including deflazacort (a steroid comparable to prednisone given in the UK and Europe). The film also depicts sleeping with a BiPAP machine, a device used by the vast majority of the kids to facilitate breathing and sleeping. The only inaccuracy that I found were in the character Trevor's ability to move and raise his arms. Generally speaking, DMD sufferers who reach Trevor's age (twenty) cannot lift their arms. Additionally, his fingers would not be stiff and intractable. Indeed, for some inexplicable reason the disease does not affect small muscles in the eyes and fingers. Finally, if Trevor was on deflazacort, he would be significantly heavier. Even though deflazacort generally is known to have fewer side effects than prednisone, there would still be some weight gain.But these are knit-picky things and as a director and writer, I am cognizant that complete accuracy to real life with anything, much less the depiction of a deadly disease, is virtually impossible. The film works. That is the most important thing. If for no other reason, it works as a vessel for awareness for DMD. But, I am happy to say, it works on deeper levels as well. It represents a healing journey for all of the characters involved. Caregivers, like the people they care for, often are afflicted with their own demons and maladies. In fact, we all are journeymen and have our crosses to bear and frankly, life isn't fair. The film is both cathartic and inspirational.Without giving away too much, the story involves a writer, Ben, who, tortured by his own private demons, ends up taking a job as a caregiver to the snarky, disrespectful Trevor, a twenty-year-old afflicted with DMD. Trevor's dad left when he was diagnosed at three (a sadly common occurrence in DMD families) leaving his mother to pick up the pieces and carry on. Needless to say Trevor is bitter, sarcastic and, at times, irreverent. Who wouldn't be in his position? The number one item on his wish list is to pee standing up (yes, it's the little things in life). And speaking of pee, he manages to pee piss off every caregiver he has. It's initially a rocky road for Ben, but despite being warned not to, he develops a bond with Trevor. He plans a road trip with Trevor to visit the largest sink hole in the U.S. Along the way they pick up two female travelers: one a hitchhiker and the other a pregnant damsel in distress. Needless to say, the road trip is a metaphor for one's trip on the roller coaster known as life.Paul Rudd is an intense, insightful actor in every part he plays, whether it is the reluctant superhero in Ant-Man (see our review) or as the tortured soul in this film. He brings such a mix of vulnerability and strength to the role of Ben. Craig Roberts plays the DMD-afflicted Trevor to perfection. He captures and conveys the bitterness of his plight with the underlying quest for redemption and salvation. Selena Gomez was a wonderful surprise as Dot. She brought her formidable acting chops to the role and proved she has more than just a pretty face and a beautiful singing voice.Rob Burnett did a great job directing. There are no special effects, green screens, action sequences, etc. Just a story with real people in real situations with real flaws. All in all, it was a beautiful, haunting and engaging film. Please pay it forward.",The Fundamentals of Caring
77,smokeysmokeysmokey,Proof a film can be ruined with bad music.,4,24 July 2016,"Every time I tried to get into this movie that God-awful score would chime in.

Now, I've become accustomed to these things bothering me more than others, so suffice to say the music killed this film for me anyway.Thankfully the acting was quite good. Cinematography was generic. You know, don't use drones just because they are cost little now. It's not a car ad, it's a film. Put the camera where the story dictates, not where looks pretty. A great filmmaker can do both, but we can't all be great. The camera is a character: it should have a point of view. What are we saying with this angle? Ah, forget that, the people from the crane cam company are here, surely we need to use them?On the plus side the chemistry between Rudd and Roberts was great. Roberts was good as usual.

80,mickekarlsson1974,So awesome I can forgive the missteps from reality!,9,8 May 2021,"The biggest draw for me was Paul Rudd (because who doesn't like Paul Rudd?!).Besides seeing his ever young face in the trailer I didn't catch much else, except quirky sarcastic comedy about a kid in a wheelchair who takes a roadtrip.My face lit up when finding out about his condition!I worked as a caregiver, for five years, for a guy with Duchennes Muscle Dystrophy. We were the same age (he was one year younger than me) and just like with Ben starting to work for Trevor, this guy (we'll call him S) was the first person I ever worked as caregiver for... He was also the only one.He was an awesome guy, really funny, with a shaved bald head, a goatee and a spikey piercing sticking out underneath his bottom lip.We took roadtrips, went to music festivals, saw concerts and movies, went to restaurants (he even got himself drunk on a few occasions) and we once drove 500 miles across the country to visit a huge amusement park... I was adamant that we would ride everything that was physically possible for him to ride.He figured it would be the ferris wheel and nothing else, but I wouldn't have that! So we also went to the 4D cinema (you know with the shakey chairs and all that), and we rode the Rapid River, and the Flume Ride...TWICE!I never heard him happier than on that Flume Ride. Howling with laughter, screaming from the top of his very weak lungs: ""AGAAAIIIN!!!""I took a lot of photos during my five years working for him, shots of us headbanging to Ozzy Osbourne and Korn (while we were at the Hultsfred Festival), a cool shot of him together with Pablo Francisco when he was on tour in northern Sweden, both of us at the Dublin Zoo and out getting our buzz on during a Dublin Pub crawl (yes, even I got a bit blurry that night) - running across the cobblestones with him laughing in a tilted back manual wheelchair.And of course, the on-ride action snapshot I bought at that Flume Ride attraction, perfectly capturing him screaming with joy.My favourite photo I took of him was at the Hultsfred Festival. It was taken late at night - and It's just him riding his electric wheelchair about 30 feet ahead of me, right through a hoard of drunk partying people, the tubes and wires from his travel cpap sticking out around his silhouetted bald head as he rode straight into the setting sun. He looked out of place, and right where he belonged, both at the same time.My second favourite photo was a low angle shot I took of him in front of a backlit waterfall inside the Guinness Museum in Dublin. He looked like Professor X! 😁I turned all the photos into a book, titled ""When it was the most fun..."", and gave it to him on my last day working for him.I know he liked me, and he thought I was good at my job, but he also knew that I was quitting because I was getting tired of it, and that feeling would sooner or later lead to me NOT doing a good job anymore. I wanted to quit while I was still on his good side.So the title of the book meant exactly that, these were the fun moments - the rest of them.....not so much.(All the wiping scenes in the world doesn't come close to capturing everything that comes with caring for someone who is unable to care for himself).However, 'The Fundamentals Of Caring' perfectly capture the feeling of being left taking care of someone else, when you have ZERO experience of doing so.It deals beautifully with the topic of a fully functioning mind being trapped inside a body that just won't work anymore.And most of all it shows that the caregiver/patient relationship can be just like any friendship, with all that it entails in the way of exchanging looks, insults, giving care, cussing each other out, and pisstaking (both literally and figuratively).So, I can easily ignore every sidestep around some of the problems that makes certain parts of the story in this movie a bit improbable.It doesn't matter.The spirit of it is what matters, and that spirit is golden!By the way; I worked as a caretaker for S from 2007-2012, and he is still alive today - 46 years old.But sadly his muscles have seriously deteriorated during the past 10 years, and he is almost fully paralyzed today, using a cpap 24/7.I doubt he will make it to 50. 🙁",The Fundamentals of Caring

I read catch phrases such as ""a coming of age movie"" and ""road trip cliches"". None of that matters because this movie is not the kind you smack a label on, acronym to death or dismiss because you don't like Selena Gomez's comedic timing.This movie...this story... is several stories within one big story that anyone from any walk of life can find a piece of themselves in. Divorce, death of child, disabilities, low self esteem, lack of self worth, abuse, neglect, shame, absentee father, loss of parent, trying to find oneself, overcoming obstacles in life, stereotypes, war, soliders, forgiveness and on and on.You don't watch this kind of movie because Paul Rudd has great drama/comedy talent. You watch, listen, learn and takeaway from the story... your story, a friend's story, a stranger's story, anyone and everyone's story. Then when you least expect it you have your ""ah ha"" moment. For me...my ""ah ha"" moment? It's ok to be stuck for a moment like Ben, afraid of change and to leave my comfort zone like Trevor, determined to get to my Denver like Dot, to boast about my solider like Peaches and shake in my boots like Elsa at the thought of my ""baby"" going out into the world to experience life without me. For my daughter...just because your absentee father wasn't there for you in life it doesn't mean you didn't deserve better...hes the butthole...your still worth your weight in Gold and deserving of the love and support you received from your adoptive father.Give it an hour and a half, find your ""ah ha"" moment and share it with someone else. They'll be glad you did and you'll be better the person for it.",The Fundamentals of Caring

I've never seen Paul Rudd in a drama before, but he surely did nail this role. His character is a caretaker for children, and he starts caring for a handicapped boy who shares his thoughts about family. I've never seen a Netflix Original movie, excluding Calibre, that I can actually call: ""worth your time"". Selena Gomez is also in the movie. Although her character is a little aggravating and hard to like, she does fulfill her character arcs and grows from a broken and traumatized person, to a fixed and light-hearted person in the end. This goes for all the characters In the film as well. I also admire how this film is based on a novel, and has no narrator. Films like Ready Player One and The Kissing Booth, have unnecessary narration. The Fundamentals of Caring does not have this though, which makes it more subtle and easier to love. This film is definitely worth the watch and I'm giving it a 7/10.",The Fundamentals of Caring

I guess you'd watch this movie if you wanted to literally turn your brain off, process nothing and occasionally have a little chuckle, but surely there are better ideas out there we can give our time to? Don't even get me started on the acting too - Selena Gomez should be banned from acting after this.

95,kasperminator,An Entertaining Movie for the Casual Moviegoer,7,11 August 2016,"The Fundamentals of Caring feels like a mix between The Intouchables and Little Miss Sunshine, while not quite as good a film as the earlier mentioned it still stands strong as a lighthearted comedy with charismatic characters.The Film follows a movie recipe we all have seen before, maybe even too many times. It does a lot of right and some wrong, mainly that it just feels bland and unoriginal. The comedy is good however but do not expect a movie that will sit with you for longer than a day.The strongest part of this movie are the two main characters Rudd/Roberts. Their constant ridicule of each other is the main laughing track of this film. Luckily for us this is for the most part what the movie consists of, they do encounter some new characters on their journey but none of them are particularly charismatic. I'm especially having a problem with Selena Gomez's part, Selena who i think manages herself well in the more dramatic scenes absolutely lacks the comedic timing the rest of the cast has. Now this wouldn't be a problem if it wasn't for the fact that she has one of the more featured parts and a lot of jokes. The fault is also of course on the quality of these jokes from the writing department.All in all i would say this is an easy movie to enjoy and have a fun time with. More recommended to the casual moviegoer than the hardcore critic, best enjoyed with friends and family! (It does however have some quite dark and sexual jokes)",The Fundamentals of Caring
96,lifesaver584917,Perfect Time for a Film Such As This,10,21 July 2016,"I decided to give it a chance, Paul Rudd is in it, so it was worth attempting. With everything going on in this country, this was a refreshing reprieve. It's a simple plot, with a simple mission. It is the actors though, that give the kind of performances that make you connect with them that makes this so delightful. Every character introduced, for me, was unexciting. I kept waiting for the bad character or bad acting. Instead, just like people, they grew on me. Paul Rudd has always been an amazing actor for me since Clueless, but Selena Gomez, I didn't even know it was her until I looked at IMDb half way through. For the first time ever, I didn't think she was still a child. Sure her character had a mouth that kept up with guys, but it didn't seem like she was trying to prove a single thing. The chemistry of all the actors, the steadiness of the films progression, and the fricken' ability to get this many actors in one film that all have the ability to convey so much even when they are saying nothing, give it gander. I suggest giving this Netflix gem 21 minutes of your time, if your not intrigued into finishing it, you probably prefer money making movies over films that display actors showcasing their artistry.",The Fundamentals of Caring

Filled with every kind of cliché you can find in this type of movie - a horde of broken souls finding themselves with the friendship and love of each other, etc. Yet there way a kind of goodness in it - no troughs too deep to make one wallow in despair or pause the movie, no highs too high to break realism. Some feisty, unexpected bits even gave it the illusion of being a new experience. I suppose all in all it felt worthwhile, enough of something to feel like you've watched a movie and not wasted precious breath.

I truly enjoyed the mystery of what happened to his son carried through out the film, leaving us to feel the whole gravity of his death hangover is while another child was being born. The parallels of life and death making the moment all the more intense.

By making The Fundamentals Of Caring.,10,25 June 2016,"First let me say that I don't write reviews on IMDb often but after watching this movie and seeing how little reviews it has I had to write one. Just so that if there is any other soul looking here all confused if he/she should watch this movie or not. WATCH IT. JUST GO WATCH IT.Alright, so plot wise it doesn't have lot of characters who just pop in and out. It has a very simple story with simple cast doing simple things and that's the beauty of it. There is no over the top emotional scenes where the cast try hard to make you feel sad but there are simple doses of heartwarming scenes sprinkled throughout the movie which made my eyes wet. The cast was amazing. I have always liked Paul Rudd and have seen his range when it comes to acting but still he managed to surprise me in this movie. I did not expect anything from Selena Gomez but she tries and pulls of the role she is given. Craig Roberts does an excellent job like in the movie submarine (which I obviously came to know after I watched the movie with the thought ""this guy looks very familiar. Where have I seen him before"" running in my head the entire time.). There are two more main cast members whom I don't want to mention and give away story details does real justice to their characters too.I didn't know the director either but he has done a really good job with this one.All in all a really good movie.

Not really a movie for ""the whole family"" unless the youngest members of the family are also adults.After watching the movie sans children and adult content warnings aside, I can say that the movie is a wonderful, feel-good and uplifting movie.

Based on my experience working and caring for people diagnosed with physical disabilities, this movie is one of the best films I have ever seen.

Do not get me wrong, the main plot of the film was very good but I had an issue with the story behind Ben's home life when you don't find out the important features until about 20 minutes to the end. I would have preferred to see an after road-trip ending in Trevor's household rather than the way that it was done or to see how Ben was coping after he finally decided to divorce his wife or at a future placement.

123,katiemay-01684,Analyzing Disability in Film,8,22 November 2016,"Warning: This Review May Contain Spoilers!I would give this movie 8 out of 10 stars because it was a great movie. It contained elements of comedy, drama, and romance.This movie is about Ben (played by Paul Rudd) who is an aspiring writer in the midst of a divorce is hired as a caregiver for Trevor. Trevor (played by Craig Roberts) is 18 years old and has Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). Since moving to the United States from England, he has only left his living room to go to the local park once a week. After expressing his dream to see the world's largest pit in person, Ben and Trevor take the trip to make Trevor's dream a reality.The basic message the film was trying to convey was that dreams should be pursued rather than sitting around thinking about the dream. This film did meet this message in the sense that the movie was about the adventures Ben and Trevor had and the lessons they learned throughout the journey of seeing the world's largest pit. Rather than sitting around thinking about the pit, Ben and Trevor took action and pursued the dream despite obstacles or challenges.Throughout the movie there were perceptions of negative barriers and positive advocacy of the person with a disability. One example of positive advocacy was that the Trevor's personality was shown fully. This showed that even though he is in a wheel chair and has DMD, he is still a person with his own personality. A second example of positive advocacy was that during the encounters with Dot (played by Selena Gomez), Dot doesn't act any different around Trevor that she does anyone else even though he is in a wheel chair. One example of a negative barrier that was portrayed was before trip, Trevor was living by the same routine every day and his mom was too worried to let him leave the house aside from going to a local park once a week. This is a negative barrier because it implies that because Trevor uses a wheel chair and has DMD he shouldn't go anywhere outside the home or do anything outside of his routine. A second example of a negative barrier was that one character referred to Trevor by asking what his wrong with Trevor. This is a negative barrier because the character was seeing the disabilities Trevor has rather than referring to Trevor as a person first. Also, asking what is wrong with someone gives off a negative connotation of the person with a disability.I would absolutely recommend this movie to anyone. This movie is more than seeing characters overcome challenges that occur with a disability. This movie shows the audience that everyone has their own challenges to overcome in life whether they have a disability or not.",The Fundamentals of Caring

In my opinion the movie can't show very well a boy has DMD, because they have harder situation in this age.

I loved how they saved the part on Ben's story for the last part it made me want to know what happened so bad and the part where Ben pranked Trevor at the hotel got me so anxious and relieved when he said he was joking haha! Mixed emotions in this movie really grabs you in it and see from the characters perspective and I gotta say Trevor's behavior made the character really sophisticating but i'm glad that Ben as his friend and caregiver chose to stand by him and not give up is really wholesome. And by the ending when they got home I really wished that i got to see more of their bond and how Trevor's mom would appreciate Ben for really standing his ground on helping Trevor fulfill his dreams hence the situation he's in and I also really wanted to see what happened in his 21st Birthday haha!! But overall this movie made me laugh and right in the feels this movie is just mind-blowing and made me realize how lucky I am that I am able and also thankful for the people like Ben in my life who hasn't given up on me yet even if I myself can say, it is totally in for a sequel!!",The Fundamentals of Caring

The movie was released 27 June in 2016 on the streaming site Netflix. The movie has been nominated 3 times: Edinburgh International Film Festival and in Georgia Film Critics Association. for Audience Award, Best International Feature Film and Oglethorpe Award for Excellence in Georgia CinemaThe story is about a caregiver who was a writer named Ben Benjamin (acted by Paul Rudd) who took the job to help a teenager named Trevor(acted by Craig Roberts) who has a disease named: Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The disease makes him unable to walk and use all his fingers. It also can be dangerous if he doesn't get his treatment. Trevor has very dark humor and often pranks people around him that he's dead. But still, he hasn't gotten out of his house on more than one flight from the UK to the USA and that was because He and his mum needed to move. The plot of the movie is that Ben is trying to run away from his wife who tries to divorce him. So Ben comes up white idén that they are going on a road trip to the world's deepest pit and Trevor's dad who works as a gardener. Elsa Trevor's mum who works at a bank is very proactive and doesn't like the idea of letting her son go. But Ben persuades her. The next day Ben and Trevor get in the van and start driving. On the way, they met Dot and Peaches.Dot (acted by Selina Gomez) is a girl who wants to go to Denver to start her new life and Ben asks if she wants to go white theme. She says yes and the next day they met Peaches who got stock by the highway. Peaches is a pregnant woman who wants to visit her mum in Nebraska. on the way, they learn the importance of friendship and hope. One thing to is that you need to take chances or life will be boring and meaningless. One of Trevor's dreams is that he wants to pee while he's standing and that reminds us that something that is ovarian to some of us is a dream and unavailable for others.I think the movie is for an older audience like those over 13 years old and older. because it has some mature jokes in it that younger people wouldn't understand and the jokes bring much to the movie. In the movie, you have many different characters making it easy to relate to and that's one of the things that makes it a fantastic movie. And also I don't think anybody dislikes the movie, so I definitely should recommend this movie.I love this movie because it has a lovely message and pretty good acting, it sometimes overplays but it's barely noticeable. The humor in the movie is high class and the jokes always hit in a funny way. The second mistake I spot is that they don't follow the rodde sometimes like they can teleport. One sen tay are in oregon and in sen thay are in montana, then they are in oregon again. But besides that it's almost a perfect movie and just how easy to relate to.I would give the movie 9/10. I did not think it was a masterpiece because it's my favorite genre and in fact it is bassett on a book takes away the creativity. I highly recommend watching this movie if you haven't watched it yet.",The Fundamentals of Caring
138,maryannmeyer-46844,"Really, a non-disabled actor?",4,3 March 2021,"Paul Rudd and Craig Roberts did great performances.
However, I was immediately off out by the fact that they didn't cast a disabled actor. There are so few opportunities for physically disabled actors and the perfect one comes along and the casting director passes?I also found the dialog to be narrow minded and Selena Gomez'a acting to be just awful. More people felt sorry for Craig Robert's character than not and quickly made comments like ""What's wrong with him?"". He also just decided to not use a medical device at a given moment which I thought was a weird way to communicate his confidence.I agree with those that say this is a feel-good movie but there were major negatives. The writers had so many opportunities to better represent a minority community and missed the mark with the social components.",The Fundamentals of Caring

144,amyjuneau12,Not Your Typical Disabled Sob Story/Pity Party,9,11 July 2016,"I really enjoyed this movie, as the script was more original that most that feature a disabled/bedridden character. Trevor and Ben's relationship rang true and I missed them when the movie ended. That rarely happens for me with characters - in books or films. This is when I REALLY know when the writer took time to develop a character. The addition of the expectant mother felt a bit forced/contrived and Gomez seemed to flip flop between being a believable character and not so much. They are the only reasons I didn't give the film a 10.A side note and response to another reviewer that said the actor who played Trevor looked to old to be 17 - I disagree. If you were as emotionally/mentally distraught as his character seemed to be for much of his life - needing strict routine to feel safe, feeling abandoned by a parent, left out of society, all those can age a person faster on the outside. So, he was appropriated caste IMO.Overall, very enjoyable. A family film IF your kids are 15 and older.",The Fundamentals of Caring

146,OJKingsley,Fun comedy drama that works well but falls short,6,30 June 2016,"The Fundamentals of Caring is the most recent film to be released exclusively through Netflix and it certainly provides a new forward for the company. With previous films whose distribution rights had been exclusively bought, such as Ricky Gervais' Special Correspondence and the mess that is released by Adam Sandler, it is safe to say that I was very hesitant to enter Rob Burnett's adaption. Burnett's tale centers on the relationship between lonesome retired writer, now turned caregiver, Ben (Paul Rudd) and the disabled teen Trevor (Craig Roberts). It begins as a simple buddy flick with both elements of comedy and tragedy but as the story progresses we follow them as they embark on, what is ultimately, a self-healing road trip through bizarre landmarks to 'The World's Deepest Pit'. On their journey they meet a batch of new characters, such as the rebellious Dot (Selena Gomez), and as they travel to their destination we learn more and more about the nature of the traveling duo.Now both Paul Rudd and Craig Roberts do a wonderfully respectful job with their roles. Roberts in particular, as the immobilized Trevor, really shines and is able to use his natural smartarse attitude to liven up each scene. Whether it is committing to fool Ben into believing he is choking or the sombre reaction to receiving his father's letters, he in many ways comes across as what Dot calls 'an Asshole' yet you still oddly like his presence. Rudd does a good job portraying a man that has been broken but it is through his conversations with the other characters where his performance comes to life. In fact, the conversations between characters is where Burnett's film really shines. I always find it amazing how through some of the most pointless conversations between characters is often able to make them the most memorable, and in this film these moments are pleasantly scattered throughout. Such scenes where both Ben and Trevor exchange repartee become some of the most immersive sections in the story. As Ben attempts to persuade Trevor to try the classic American road snack, a Slim Jim, these moments become extremely valuable in furthering both the characters' development and also the viewer's connection to the story.Though the film does offer a range of comedic moments that are executed thoroughly well, there is also a good amount of drama to accompany it. This aspect in most cases works, however during the opening of the film it is partly subdued due to the viewers lack of info. We open the film by understanding that Ben is training to be a caregiver and that he is also concurrently going through a divorce due to some unknown reason. The viewer is able to understand that he is depressed through the exaggerated gloomy looks he gives however it becomes hard to connect with him due to our inability to understand why he should gain any form of sympathy. This party is due to the fact that the film is an adaptation, where unlike a novel you must use alternative means in order to portray the thoughts of a character. To tell you the truth I had no idea that the film was an adaptation and thirty minutes in I was thinking that they would've been better off using this story as an idea for a piece of literature. What saved this concept from sinking the film however was the change of pace in the story. As the characters set off on their road trip the tone of the film becomes completely different. It no longer becomes a story entered on a depressed man undertaking a caregiver's job being confined to a house as he takes care of a boy. Instead it becomes a vast journey in which a man reevaluates his life as he illustrates to the boy what joy there is in the world.Visually and aurally the film doesn't excel or innovate in any unique and ambitious way but it works well. The cinematography stays relatively simple and standard following the likeness of some of the more recent indie films. A few instances use an arc shot that is set to dazzle the viewer as they spin round the characters taking in the unique landscape but the use of stylistic shots like this are relatively scarce. The music too suits the moments that they are used and helps build up the atmosphere created. The score particularly is very well composed in certain moments and really is able to amplify the intensity of a scene. The film occasionally at times uses flashbacks in order for the viewer to understand more of Ben's background and in these scenes the sound design really works well. These moments work in a way where the sound is isolated out and the score comes in a way where I myself as the viewer became almost in a light sort of trance.In conclusion, The Fundamentals of Caring proves that Netflix can distribute a solid story. The film in many ways attempts to mimic a similar vibe to such stories as Perks of Being a Wallflower but it falls short in proving itself to be a memorable tale. Bernett's adaption doesn't necessarily break any boundaries in the industry or solidify itself as an important piece of cinema but it remains a good heartwarming story to watch in the midst of all the recent blockbusters.To check out more reviews please take a look at https://okingin35mm.wordpress.com/reviews/",The Fundamentals of Caring

It's a shame because this simple movie, with its simple story is a wonderful find! Whoever wrote this script is an absolute genius. The characters are relatable and even though there isn't a ton of long and drawn out character development you're still made to understand who these people are and what drives them and you want to see them succeed!

148,tomoliverharrison-942-619898,"A bit disappointing, but watchable",5,5 August 2016,"I love a feel good road trip movie, or coming of age drama/comedy. I know they usually follow the same plot line, and are full of clichés, but if they nail the dialogue and the characters I don't care. I'm on board. Throw in a great (if predictable soundtrack) and I'm all over it.Little Miss Sunshine, Chef, The Way Way Back, Kings of Summer - I love all those films, which on paper are incredibly similar to this film. Unfortunately this film was bit of let down. As much as I love Paul Rudd, there was very little he could do with this script. It felt like Vince Vaughn doing his 20th romantic comedy playing the lovable loser. He phoned this one in.I didn't buy the chemistry between Paul Rudd and Craig Roberts. I didn't warm to Craig Roberts either. A minor point - his mother speaks with a ridiculous clipped faux English accent whilst he has a Welsh twang. Bit odd. The script just wasn't quite pithy enough, and as I didn't warm to the characters I found a lot of the clichés annoying. Sticking your hand out of car window and riding the air in wave... yawn. Also the soundtrack is awful. Truly, truly awful. It follows the usual road trip movies, bit of twinkly acoustic, bit of piano - no problem with that. It's just really, really poor quality. Like free demos bought off the internet. Really took me out the moment. It's not a terrible film, I just expected a lot more from the trailer. I know road trip movies are not everyone's cup of tea. If you're a fan of this sort of thing, you'll probably find something to enjoy from it, but don't go in expecting too much. It's an OK road trip film. Check out The Way Way Back instead. Very similar feel, just down right.",The Fundamentals of Caring

The whole cast was great and a lot of people were skeptical of how Selena Gomez was going to do but she really proves herself to be an amazing actress she played this character very well. Paul Rudd is always phenomenal and I really liked this character he played and Craig Roberts is hilarious and emotional at the same time and he will probably be the next big actor. It's a cute and short movie and you never get bored while watching it. The story line and script were great and I love the humor. And for me I was expecting the fundamentals of caring to be kinda lame and cliché especially since it didn't come out it theaters but it is far far far from that!!

It's a little dark but it will make you laugh and some times you might even see a piece of yourself in the main characters of the movie. Paul Rudd was really amazing in this film. His character was pretty real than most of his which are more comedy than drama. Craig Roberts an actor I have never seen was also amazing. Selena Gomez was a teenage girl with a lot of angst and trying to start over in life to get away from what she was.The relationship that Craig and Rudd had in the movie was amazing their friendship was extremely powerful.They both needed each other and in the end their friendship made them grow and learn more about life and love and the reality of all things good and bad.

152,juliebone,Underwhelming and Predictable,1,11 January 2017,"This review contains spoilers...but there is literally nothing interesting that could possibly be spoiled. If this was the first movie I ever watched, maybe I might have enjoyed it. However, seeing as every plot element was pretty much cut and pasted from every sentimental drama ever, it was just painful to watch. I wanted to cry at the funny scenes and laugh at the sad scenes. I have no idea why Paul Rudd agreed to a role he obviously didn't have any feelings for. There was little to no character development. He started out sad and boring and ended up less sad, but still boring. Craig is my favorite character, but that's not saying much. His acting was actually pretty decent, considering the terrible dialogue he had to work with. Of course, the second you see Selena Gomez, you already know they're going to have a fun, uncomplicated fling, because c'mon, he's dying! He deserves to have a hot, spunky, no-nonsense girl! And of course, instead of trying for interesting, humorous dialogue, she just swears a lot. How funny. But here's where I give it one star instead of two: After already being bored to tears with the most predictable movie I've ever seen, they introduce a pregnant character whose only contribution to the whole movie is to give birth at an unexpected location, just so Paul Rudd gets to be the hero and help her and have some sort of nearly-emotional moment.Pathetic, lazy writing.",The Fundamentals of Caring

After seeing this performance by Paul, I have a new found admiration of his artistic abilities. I think that the second time I watched this film I enjoyed it even more than the first. The cast quickly identifies with the audience by bringing a realism and quality performance (that's a nod to Salina Gomez for a brilliant capturing of her character and pushing it into the hearts of the audience).

It's a road-movie like many, but it is special to me. I went into to the movie without any expectations which made it even more enjoyable. Paul Rudd and Craig Roberts pulled this off exceptionally well to my opinion. I really liked their acting, in contrast with that of Selena Gomez. It wasn't good and she could've literally been replaced with any even slightly good looking girl. Her face and name were just used to attract more viewers, and I understand that but it's annoying.This movie makes you laugh out loud. I really enjoyed the humor, it wasn't forced or anything it felt quite natural actually. So, this is a typical roadtripmovie.

155,jeddickson,You can't help cracking a smile and having fun.,8,2 January 2017,"The Fault In Our Stars and The Trip come together in a hot, steamy mess to produce this simple movie, full of simple pleasures. Once again, Paul Rudd combines heart and feeling with humour as effortlessly and brilliantly as waffles and a sausage. Without doubt, the best part of the movie (much like Rudd and Segel's 'I Love You Man') is the well crafted bickering and banter between the two main characters, Ben and Trevor; Rudd and Roberts make you feel as if you are back hanging out with your best mate after school again. Gomez is (surprisingly) strong in support, delivering a great balance of sass and humour for the others to bounce off.Yes, like many American buddy-style film, there a are a few corny bits in there, but, if you haven't seen it, do yourself a favour! Treat yourself to a bloody good laugh, and revel, once again, in the ease of Rudd's humour and evident improvisation - ""Bite of the James, shall we?"".

The acting is top-notch, with Paul Rudd and Craig Roberts playing a depressed carer and disabled teen respectively. Both are excellently cast, but Roberts, a young Welsh actor, who I've not seen before, is particularly effective as the sarcastic young man who is a big fan of black humour. The revelation in this film, though, was Selena Gomez, who is a million miles away from her Disney persona of old. Her character, Dot, is very keen on swearing throughout, but this suits the role somehow and I found her performance very affecting at the end. Slightly corny in parts in its similarities to other films about disabled or terminally ill people, but it was still a very interesting and mostly original movie.",The Fundamentals of Caring

Many good movies aren't great because their characters lack a real sense of attachment. The fundamentals of caring nails it on the head. Paul Rudd is a work of art in this film and quite frankly that surprised me. Selena Gomez pleasantly perfected her role as well which surprised me even more. I am not placing any spoilers but I will tell you that it shouldn't matter what type of movies you typically enjoy, you SHOULD enjoy this one. I am a 23 year old male, and an Army Vet so you would expect a guy like me to be into more manly macho movies. Well you'd be right. But as a fan of art and emotion, I respect movies like this. You will feel a way with the story that brings you everything from joy, laughter, pain, guilt and even fear. Its an emotional roller-coaster ride and I'll be riding it again in the front seat every time. Must watch movie hands down. I'll even say you should subscribe to Netflix even if it's only for one month just to see this movie. This definitely makes its way on my top 10, easily.",The Fundamentals of Caring
158,AfkeFlaviana,The relationship of a disabled kid and his care taker is tested on a ridiculous road trip to the world's deepest pit.,9,29 June 2016,"This new Netflix original film that seemed to come out of nowhere was only a means of procrastination for me, so you can imagine my surprise when it turned out to be one of the best films I've seen in a while. Everything about this movie works. The characterization, the performances, the tone, I cannot praise it enough. Paul Rudd plays Ben Benjamin, a writer who, after suffering a huge loss, takes a class to be a care taker. He becomes the care taker of a disabled kid called Trevor. Trevor, portrayed by Craig Roberts, is an isolated creature of habit with a weird sense of humor. The two get along instantly and decide to go on a road trip to the world's deepest pit to get Trevor out of his shell and into the world. First of all the characters are all very interesting and even the smaller ones have quite some depth to them. Selena Gomez's character Dot has the one-sided character traits of a rebellious teen, yet her elaborate back-story and interaction with the other characters make it worth your while. Ben Benjamin has a complicated history that is slowly revealed to the audience throughout the film, but that doesn't affect the audience's view of the likable character we've come to know in the present day story. It only adds to what is already there, which makes for a wonderfully intriguing character. But the best developed character by far is Trevor. His humor and his relationship with Ben are ultimately what make this film great. His problems with his father and him growing up constantly worrying for his life are dark emotions wrapped together in a sarcastic, down to earth kid, who on top of it all is also a normal teenager. He is way more just the disabled kid.Speaking of his disability, I love how little this is discussed in the film. Trevor doesn't get sick to the point of almost dying, he doesn't have major problems with his disease, it's just there. Of course it is a big part of the film, as it is a big part of people's lives, but the film isn't centered around it. It is a movie about the relationship between a boy and his care taker, in which his illness plays no part. He might try to give Ben the finger and fail miserably because he's physically unable to raise his fingers, but the effect of this is comedic rather than sad. This adds to the lovely lighthearted tone of the film. Don't get me wrong, there are enough things happening in this film that will make you cry, but they aren't presented in a dramatic way. The reason the audience cares about what happens is because we care about the characters, who we've grown to love because of the comedy. While some of the events are truly tragic, the film stays away from sob stories. This lighthearted, upbeat tone is perfect for making the film accessible for a bigger audience and it also ironically makes the heartbreaking events more heartbreaking.The execution of the film definitely does justice to the wonderful story and the wonderful characters. The chemistry between Paul Rudd and Craig Roberts is what the entire film stands on, and it's perfect. Rob Burnett has done an amazing job in both writing and directing the movie. The shots used really add to the comedic tone and on top of that it's also just really pretty to look at. This is unexpected from a film that mostly relies on dialogue, and a welcome change from the generic camera work that usually comes with the genre. ""The Fundamentals of Caring"" is definitely worth your while. The interesting, almost tormented characters have such silly adventures are brought in such a lighthearted way that this film will have you laughing and crying at the same time. I would recommend this film to everyone!",The Fundamentals of Caring

The storyline was well thought out and the cast were well suited to their roles. It is one of Paul Rudd's best roles and Selena Gomez who I'm not a massive fan of is really good.

The impression I received from the beginning of the film versus the end of the film was the complete opposite. In the beginning of the film I did not believe it was going to catch my attention. But, by the ending of the movie I was wishing it was not over. In the movie, The Fundamentals Of Caring, 3 main critiques caught my eye. The first I can describe to you would be in the beginning of the film when Trevor and Ben first met. I felt as if this scene wanted you to have more emotions to it then what was perceived. When they were being introduced, Trevor tried to do as much as he could to make Ben realize he did not want to be Trevor's caregiver. But, Ben held out for all of the sarcastic emotion Trevor was portraying and that is what made them connect even stronger than they originally thought they would. Trevor responds to his mom, ""he's the one"" during the interview at the beginning of the film showing you that they will soon have a bond none expected. The background of the main character, Trevor, is what I am going to critique to you next. Although we know Trevor is in a wheelchair, the story behind him is something greater. When Trevor was three and diagnosed with muscular dystrophy his father decided that he no longer wanted to be in his life. With this, Trevor never really had a stable ""father like"" figure to give him inspiration. His mother always wanted Trevor to have contact with his father but his father never wanted anything to do with him. In result to this, Trevor's mother decided upon writing him letters as if they were coming from his father, which lead to an awful heartbreak when later in the movie Trevor goes to visit his father and figures out the harsh truth of his father still not wanting contact with him. Ben also has an intriguing background just like Trevor. Throughout the movie they show certain flashbacks that lead you to uncovering Ben's life story and figuring out why he portrays himself the way he does. Ben is currently separated from his wife but refuses to sign the divorce papers she is trying to push upon him. Later on in the movie, you figure out that the flashbacks lead back to the death of Ben's son. Ben refuses to sign the papers due to him never being able to get over the fact of his son's death, he feels as if she is all he has left of his son and he doesn't want to let that go. At the end of the movie with the help of Trevor and their experience with one another, he let go of all of the bad emotions and insecurities through a novel that he ended up writing based upon their time with one another.In result, by the end of the movie, they both realized that they have helped one another more than they have originally planned to do. Ben helped Trevor get out of his comfort zone by taking him to experience new things that he always wanted to but never thought he had the capability of doing. Trevor helped Ben in a way of showing him that trusting his love with someone else wouldn't come back to be a burden. Ben had to open up to Trevor to show him that he was there to care for him and protect him with the things he could not do for himself. The quality of this film was astonishing and I believe it portrayed many emotions that will catch future viewers attention as well.",The Fundamentals of Caring
165,patbourke,My first review.,10,30 January 2021,"I've never felt the need to review a movie as much as I have after watching The Fundamentals of Caring and seeing the metacritic reviews.
I've never been on such an emotional ride like I have with this movie. The characters are extremely engaging and you feel attached to their stories, even the shorter characters in the film. The film is filled with belly aching laughs but the real heart of the story is the sadness the characters feel that they help each other overcome.
There are moments in the film where even the most hardened emotionally viewers will find a lump in their throat.I loved every second of it and was sad and happy to see it end.",The Fundamentals of Caring
166,ashkilledthedj,A feel good movie!,8,21 August 2018,"Scrolling through some of the Netflix Originals you begin to wonder why on earth some of them are actually made! But this one caught my eye because I liked the cast and the trailer made you feel a sort of joy, I didn't expect to love this film as much as I did! 
I am a very emotional person and would cry at anything so if you are like me you might shed some happy tears. Paul Rudd puts on a fantastic performance as well as the rest of the cast, I think having such a small cast made it all that more heart warming and kept your focus on the plot.
Would recommend this to anyone who wants to sit and watch a good movie with a feel good story!",The Fundamentals of Caring
167,slljarvis,"Not funny, not caring, not worth watching",2,18 February 2017,"Where to start? The stars are for Craig who did his best with poor material, but not sure what a Welsh lad was playing at with an accent that seemed all over the place. Mother - accent and attitude grated from the first line she spoke - why not get an English actor or just let her be American by changing the plot a little, doubt it would have made any difference. I gave up 22 minutes before the end, when the second ""road trip"" character made an awkward appearance and the dialogue between her and Rudd was so stiff and unconvincing I just couldn't bear to continue watching. The ""caring"" by Rudd was totally unprofessional, and downright abusive at times, always deciding what Trev was going to do, never seemed caring. Manhandling a patient in this day and age?? Apparently it's supposed to be a comedy - had a little chuckle at the cheesy start in the classroom with the acronym. From then on all downhill, NOT funny just dropping in a naughty word now and again and joking about ass wiping. I think they missed an opportunity to have a fart scene with cigar-smoking Selena letting rip... (oh how hilarious, what a character that girl is) Maybe they did, after I switched off... I expect the pregnant woman didn't get through the whole journey with baby inside. I don't care what happened with Trev's dad. Waste of time.",The Fundamentals of Caring
168,rsracing-13370,Fun movie,8,20 August 2017,We were not sure what to expect when we started watching. We mostly enjoyed the human side. What we did not like was the fact that the movie was not shot in any of the states they were supposed to be in. Also a TPMS light on the dash can not be turned off by replacing a fuse. Repairing a flat tire or airing up a tire is the only way to turn off the light.,The Fundamentals of Caring
169,drevis-84088,Very good indeed,10,29 July 2018,"Stumbled across this title on Netflix after watching the series ""Atypical"". I don't normally take the time to write reviews but this is a great movie with some real heartwarming moments intertwined with moments of great sadness and genuine comedy. I find Paul Rudd either very good or terrible in his acting but in this he was a joy to watch. Some great supporting acting. You will not be disappointed if you watch this movie.",The Fundamentals of Caring
