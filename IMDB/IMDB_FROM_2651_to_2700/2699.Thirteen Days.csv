0,SnoopyStyle,great tense political drama,9,17 April 2016,"It's October, 1962, the Cuban missile crisis. Photos from the U-2 spy plane show possible nuclear missiles on Cuban soil. This sets off high level panic that almost ends with WWIII. The movie centers on the Special Assistant to the President, Kenny O'Donnell (Kevin Costner). The push from the military is for a full invasion of Cuba. However, the Kennedy brothers and Kenny push back.This is more like a brilliant stage play done with so much intensity that the audience is right there in the room. There are flashes of newsreels, CGI, and other footage to fill out the movie with the outside world. It is very much a political thriller inside the President's inner circle. It is tense despite the well known ending and event highlights. The use of Costner as a side character pushed out to be the lead is brilliant. It allows the best (but lesser known) actors in some of the most iconic roles around. Surprisingly, there are also flashes of humor. The acting is amazing. This is one of the best movies about those thirteen days.",Thirteen Days
1,Hitchcoc,Perhaps the Closest We've Ever Come,8,2 June 2011,"I was in ninth grade when upon arriving home from school, my mother told me we may in the middle of a nuclear war. The Cold War had reach its climax and a rash act by the Russian hierarchy shoved the gravest danger in the face of John F. Kennedy, still wet behind the ears. This film really captures some of the intricacies of that historical moment. While Kevin Costner's character is a bit much, we get to see the tension that existed in the global community and behind the closed doors of the White House. As the two powers parry and thrust, we realize the consequences. There is so much posturing in politics, but when the price is destruction, or at best, invasion, the stress meter goes all the way to the right. I have to say that the portrayals of the politicians of the time was nicely done (as was the military). We tend to oversimplify things in our smugness as Americans, but imagine having to make the decisions these men made. It is an ultimate chess match which has the face- saving piece hanging over it. This is all pulled off nicely. Also, I never knew what Adlai Stevenson's role was in all this. He just seemed like the intellectual presidential candidate that lost twice to Eisenhower. See this.",Thirteen Days
2,classicsoncall,"""Appeasement only makes the aggressor more aggressive"".",8,18 October 2016,"If you lived through the era, you knew things were tense. Average people were getting ready, preparing to meet their Maker. If anything, the film paints an even grimmer picture than anyone outside of the Kennedy Administration inner circle could have contemplated, with the entire world a stone's throw away from the brink of nuclear war.It seemed to me that the events as depicted in the story were fairly accurate historically. What particularly impressed me the first time I saw this movie, which was reinforced again when I watched it the other night, was how forceful John F. Kennedy (Bruce Greenwood) was in facing down his generals to avoid a military confrontation right from the outset. The same with Robert McNamara (Dylan Baker) as Secretary of Defense in his row with the Admiral who ordered the 'star missiles' to be fired as a warning.However of all the names mentioned in the story who were part of Kennedy's cabinet, along with the principal military leaders of the time, the one name that didn't offer a hint of recognition was that of Ken O'Donnell (Kevin Costner), who in this picture was accorded as much significance as that of JFK and brother Bobby (Steven Culp). I chalk that up to Costner being one of the movie's producers, and if I'm all wrong about that, so be it. I thought the character had an important presence in the story, but have to wonder if the real Ken O'Donnell would have had as much influence with the brothers Kennedy.Considering the real world paranoia that gripped the world during this thirteen day span of time during October, 1962, an interesting contrast can be made against the fictional story presented in 1964's ""Fail-Safe"", about an accidental launching of an American nuclear missile strike against Russia with no hope of retrieval. Filmed just a couple short years following the Cuban Missile Crisis, the story is a real nail biter with an unbelievable resolution intended to 'even out the destruction' between military super powers. If you haven't seen it, check it out.One note of irony in this film's casting, that of Stephanie Romanov as Jackie Kennedy. Although her mother was American born, her father was of Slovakian descent, with a last name that most anyone would mistake for Russian. I wonder if anyone connected with casting on the picture thought about that.",Thirteen Days
3,lee_eisenberg,US and USSR were equally guilty in the Cold War,6,31 October 2008,"Watching ""Thirteen Days"", I was never sure how accurate it was (it did seem kind of lop-sided). The movie does create a sense of tension, knowing that the world came closer than ever to nuclear annihilation. Around the fortieth anniversary of the Cuban Missile Crisis, I asked my Russian teacher (who was born and raised in Russia when it was the Soviet Union) what children there were taught. She said that they were taught how to care for a person injured in a nuclear blast. Basically the same thing as ""duck and cover"". The important thing to understand is that the United States and Soviet Union were equally guilty in the Cold War.Anyway, I do recommend this movie, understanding that I can't verify the accuracy. My favorite movies centering on the Cuban Missile Crisis are ""Matinee"" and ""Blast from the Past"". Starring Kevin Costner, Bruce Greenwood, Steven Culp, Lucinda Jenney (who co-starred in ""Matinee"") and Stephanie Romanov.",Thirteen Days
4,jboothmillard,Thirteen Days,6,1 December 2010,"I knew the leading actor of the film, but I had no idea what it was going to be about, only that the critics give it four stars out of five, so it sounded good enough to try, from director Roger Donaldson (Dante's Peak, The World's Fastest Indian). Based on the true events, in October 1962, USAF U-2 surveillance has discovered that the Soviet Union are taking nuclear ballistic missiles in Cuba, with the potential to kill up to 80 million Americans and destroy large bomber bases if put in operation. As President, John F. Kennedy (Racing Stripes' Bruce Greenwood) and his advisers, including Kenny O'Donnell (Kevin Costner) must come up with a strategy to combat the situation against the Soviets. Kennedy tries to stay calm and strong against the threat, but his advisers in the Pentagon are saying that he should consider a military strike on Cuba, which would cause an invasion. It is Secretary of Defence Robert McNamara (Dylan Baker) that devises the plan to create a blockade by the navy so Cuba and the missiles cannot reach the country. The Russians however ignore the blockade and to get involved themselves, and things start getting worse, but communications with the threatening countries after thirteen days do in the end come to a settlement. Also starring Steven Culp as Robert F. Kennedy, Michael Fairman as Adlai Stevenson, Henry Strozier as Dean Rusk, Frank Wood as McGeorge Bundy, Kevin Conway as General Curtis LeMay, Tim Kelleher as Ted Sorensen, Len Cariou as Dean Acheson and Home Alone 3's Olek Krupa as Andrei Gromyko. Costner, who you may remember was also in JFK, does do alright despite his rather silly Alabama style accent, Greenwood looks a little old to play a convincing Kennedy, but he does do well, and there are some small gripping moments that do reflect the realistic events during the Cuban Missile Crisis, it is I suppose a worthwhile historical drama. Good!",Thirteen Days
5,rmax304823,Night in the lonesome October.,7,30 November 2009,"It's October of 1962, our most immemorial year. President Kennedy (Bruce Greenwood) and his staff, including Bobby Kennedy (Dylan Baker) and Kevin O'Donell (Kevin Costner), discover that the Soviet Union is building intermediate-range nuclear missiles on communist Cuba, ninety miles off our coast, destabilizing the standoff between the West and the Soviet Bloc. Once operational, the missiles put Russia on our doorstep and can't be permitted to exist. What to do? The film shows us with reasonable clarity what was done. The US couldn't just sit there and do nothing. The White House drew up plans for a strike against the missile sites. But then the Soviets could just rebuild them. Therefore, another invasion of the island was required, which would in turn provoke a Soviet response elsewhere, probably against Berlin.One thing leads to another and pretty soon there is no more world left to argue about.How is the problem solved? Kennedy puts Cuba under a blockade, surrounded by Navy ships. Technically, a blockade is an act of war, so we call it a ""quarantine,"" because that word is not an act of war. Russian ships continue their approach.Neither the US nor the USSR is able to back down without losing ""honor,"" never mind any practical advantages. So an off-stage channel is opened up by the Soviets between their top spy in New York and the New York Times. The Russians are willing to consider a trade. They'll remove the missiles if we pledge never again to invade Cuba. (We'd done it the year before, in The Bay of Pigs fiasco.) Of course, it's not that simple. The real world seldom is. A letter arrives from Khrushchev agreeing to the deal, causing a great big sigh of relief in the White House. But the next morning a far less conciliatory letter arrives, backing out of the concessions agreed to in the first letter. Analysis reveals that the first letter was written by Khrushchev, but that the second had been polished by someone else. Has Khrushchev been deposed in a coup? Better put on the old kit bag again.But Bobby Kennedy comes up with an idea. How about if we only respond to the first letter? Does he mean we reject the second letter? No, just that we ignore it as if it had never happened.At a last-minute meeting with the Soviet Ambassador, Bobby Kennedy informs the Russians that we have some outdated missiles in Turkey that are scheduled for dismantling, and that, if necessary, Chairman Khrushchev can claim these as part of the deal, as long as it's never made public. That way, Khrushchev can satisfy the hard-liners in the Politburo without humiliating the United States.The problem is solved and everyone totters back from the brink of nuclear war.There's another, similar film, ""The Missiles of October,"" with William DeVane as Kennedy and Martin Sheen as Bobby. It's quite good, but it's made for television and lacks the production values and special effects of this version. The TV movie is dry and logical, and it tells us more about Khrushchev, whose huevos were also in a vice. This one carries more emotional weight since we get to know about the individuals involved.The final scenes are moving, as O'Donell stares from the window of his home the next morning, surrounded by his wife and children, bathed in the early light, and says wonderingly to himself, ""The sun came up."" It's not as tacky as I've made it sound.One of the more stunning features of the movie is the analytical plane on which these round-table discussions take place. No decision is made without brainstorming and without confirmation of beliefs, when that's possible. These people were careful, delicate, surgical in their decision making. The president alludes to Sun Tzu before Sun Tzu was cool. He draws a history lesson from Barbara Tuchman's ""The Guns of August,"" about the accidental beginnings of World War I. It's become a little more difficult to imagine such discussions in political circles today. Nobody seems to have gotten past the Cliffs Notes version of ""The Prince."" Too bad, too, because, as the French philosopher Henri Bergson suggested, a leader should think like a man of action and act like a man of thought. Somewhere along the line, that became ""Kill 'em All and Let God Sort 'em Out!"" and was printed on bumper stickers.The performances are all adequate, with Greenwood giving a decent impression of JFK. The other character all more or less resemble their historical counterparts -- more so than in the TV version -- although the characters and the event itself have faded so much in our collective memories that it probably doesn't make much difference anymore. Dean Rusk might as well look like Yosemite Sam.The people who probably most need to see this film are probably going to switch channels out of boredom. After all, nobody's head gets wrenched off in the second reel.",Thirteen Days
6,ma-cortes,"Historic movie about Cuban Missile Crisis with intrigue , tension and good performances",7,9 July 2010,"The 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis seen through the eyes of President assistant Kenny O'Donnell (Kevin Costner who hands perfectly the role )as trusted confidante and with significance importance of Robert Kennedy ( Steven Culp who bears remarkable resemblance )and of course President John F . Kennedy ( a solid Bruce Greenwood ) . This interesting film widely develops the Cuban Missile Crisis that was a confrontation between the Soviet Union, Cuba and the United States in October 1962, during the Cold War. The picture is packed with suspense , drama , historical deeds and is quite entertaining . It's correctly based on facts and the few sacrifices of accuracy are realized in the sense of of dramatic license . The motion picture is very well directed by Roger Donaldson who formerly worked with Costner in another suspenseful movie and also plenty of political intrigue titled ¨No way out (87) ¨ .Adding more details over the widely depicted on the movie the events happened of the following manner : In September 1962, the Cuban and Soviet governments began to surreptitiously build bases in Cuba for a number of medium- and intermediate-range ballistic nuclear missiles (MRBMs and IRBMs) with the ability to strike most of the continental United States. This action was subsequent to the 1958 deployment of Thor IRBMs in the UK and Jupiter IRBMs to Italy and Turkey in 1961; more than 100 U.S.-built missiles having the capability to strike Moscow with nuclear warheads. On October 14, 1962, a United States U-2 photo-reconnaissance plane captured photographic proof of Soviet missile bases under construction in Cuba.The ensuing crisis ranks with the Berlin Blockade as one of the major confrontations of the Cold War and is generally regarded as the moment in which the Cold War came closest to turning into a nuclear conflict .The US President ( Bruce Greenwood) , Attorney General Robert Kennedy (Steven Culp ),State Secretary Robert McNamara ( Dylan Baker ) and his military staff ( Bill Smitrovich , Ed Lauter , James Karen , Len Cariou) and general Curtis LeMay (Kevin Conway ) considered attacking Cuba via air and sea and settled on a ""quarantine"" of Cuba. The U.S. announced that it would not permit offensive weapons to be delivered to Cuba and demanded that the Soviets dismantle the missile bases already under construction or completed in Cuba and remove all offensive weapons. The Kennedy administration held a slim hope that the Kremlin would agree to their demands, and expected a military confrontation. On the Soviet end, Nikita Khrushchev wrote Kennedy that his quarantine of ""navigation in international waters and air space to constitute an act of aggression propelling humankind into the abyss of a world nuclear-missile war."" Fidel Castro encouraged Khrushchev to launch a preemptive first-strike nuclear attack on the U.S. The Soviets publicly balked at the U.S. demands, but in secret back-channel communications initiated a proposal to resolve the crisis. The confrontation ended on October 28, 1962 when President John F. Kennedy and United Nations Secretary-General U Thant reached an agreement with Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev to dismantle the offensive weapons and return them to the Soviet Union, subject to United Nations verification, in exchange for an agreement by the United States to never invade Cuba. The Soviets removed the missile systems and their support equipment, loading them onto eight Soviet ships from November 5–9. A month later, on December 5 and 6, the Soviet IL-28 bombers were loaded onto three Soviet ships and shipped back to Russia. The quarantine was formally ended previously on November 20, 1962. As a secret part of the agreement, all US-built Thor and Jupiter IRBMs deployed in Europe were deactivated by September 1963.The Cuban Missile Crisis spurred the creation of the Hotline Agreement and the Moscow-Washington hot line, a direct communications link between Moscow and Washington .",Thirteen Days
7,moonspinner55,"Two weeks in time worth reenacting, but film isn't very emotional or expressive...",5,8 July 2006,"The Russian-Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 as seen through the eyes of Kenny O'Donnell (Kevin Costner), political adviser to President John F. Kennedy (Bruce Greenwood). Tense chapter in world history ladled with testosterone-driven speeches and air-raids (courtesy director Roger Donaldson, who clearly sees this as man's business; he doesn't seem to want to know Jacqueline Kennedy or her reaction to the drama--instead she plans a party). However, the technical aspects of the production are first-rate and the acting is uniformly commendable. Though talky, overlong, and hampered by the changing cues of color to black-and-white, the film is still worth-seeing, especially for history buffs. ** from ****",Thirteen Days
8,blanche-2,In a word - WOW!,8,12 February 2007,"In 1962, the world stood on the brink of World War III for ""Thirteen Days,"" a 2000 film starring Kevin Costner, Bruce Greenwood, Steven Culp and Dylan Baker, with direction by Roger Donaldson. The story concerns the ""Cuban Missile Crisis,"" when the U.S. discovered that the Soviets had placed missiles aimed at the U.S. in Cuba.As someone who remembers the situation well, watching this was a profound experience in more ways than one. A good deal of dialogue was taken from actual Presidential transcripts, which made watching it even more impressive. Looking at it from today's eyes, ""Thirteen Days"" is a knockout.Donaldson focuses the film right where it should be - in the White House and in conference rooms, giving us only the subplot of Kenny O'Donnell's family life. For those posters who commented that O'Donnell was perhaps not a real person, yes, he was. It's impossible for me to believe that with a film that goes into so much detail and strove to be so factual, someone thought there was a made-up character. Try Google next time. Ken O'Donnell headed up Kennedy's presidential campaign and was appointed his Special Assistant when Kennedy won the White House. He was the most powerful of the President's advisers.Several things become clear about the goings-on at the White House in 1962: None of the military leaders thought the Kennedy administration belonged in the White House; if it had been up to the military leaders, the situation would have caused World War III; JFK turned himself into a pretzel in order to pursue a diplomatic solution to the potential conflict. Though discouraged almost at every turn, JFK still would not allow the shooting to begin, pushing instead for an embargo against Cuba.There is plenty of tension and excitement in this film. One of the best scenes is Commander Eckerd (Christopher Lawford) and his team low-flying over Cuba taking photos, and a U-2 pilot trying to avoid missiles chasing him. But most of the tension and excitement takes place in the meetings as the President and RFK struggle for answers and play for time. The mix is therefore ideal: drama, some aerial excitement, and a little humor as Adlai Stevenson gets the better of the Russians in an OAS meeting.There's also a look at the reaction of the country - also very accurate. Yes, people piled into church, cleared the grocery shelves of everything, and stocked fallout shelters. We all watched the President on television. In fact, as he talked, my mother thought he was about to declare war. It was a terrifying time.Kenny O'Donnell's role in all of this may have been somewhat exaggerated to make it a palatable role for Kevin Costner. Costner does okay in the part. Boston accents are very difficult to do without them sounding put on. It's very difficult to do accents in general and make them organic to the character. A few have succeeded: Anne Bancroft in ""The Miracle Worker,"" Paul Newman in ""Somebody Up There Likes Me,"" little Natalie Wood in ""Tomorrow is Forever,"" Travolta in ""Saturday Night Fever,"" and of course there are others. Jane Seymour and Joan Collins can easily pull off being Americans. All British actors can do a southern accent, since the southern accent started off as a British accent. Costner lays it on too thick and it's a distraction. But he certainly isn't bad in the role.The casting people merely wanted to suggest JFK and RFK. In Steven Culp, they found a young actor with similar features to RFK. He does an effective job, given that it's tough going to portray such a famous person. The most successful in the film is Bruce Greenwood as JFK, who tries to keep the accent from overpowering the dialogue. In the President's television speech, I'm sure he imitated JFK's every single inflection and pause, and it's perfect. His JFK is a listener, very dependent on his brother's advice, and one who takes the burdens of the country on his shoulders like a cross. One of the posters here mentioned something to the effect that ""we are led to believe that JFK leaned heavily on his advisors"" as if this is a negative. Of course he did. Of course any President does or should. The final decisions belonged to him, and he had to be sure of all of the ramifications. Only an idiot doesn't hear every single opinion of value before he decides to launch World War III.The camaraderie between RFK, JFK, and O'Donnell is as unmistakable as their arguments and frustrations.Thirteen months after the Cuban Missile Crisis, JFK would be dead and O'Donnell would be riding behind him in the Secret Service Car. After a particularly tough meeting with the Joint Chiefs of Staff, O'Donnell insists that JFK sit for a minute, and JFK finally does. Worn out and not sleeping well, he laments about being President. ""I just thought there would be more good days."" In the end, we - and he - would have settled for just MORE days.",Thirteen Days
9,Quinoa1984,An old Fashioned Nail Biter,7,13 January 2001,"Thirteen Days brings back the good old fashioned (and I mean good) nailbiter film here and even if you know history (thus knowing the outcome), there is still some good stuff here.  Things that might've not been known to the average American back then now are revealed in thrilling tension that is only slightly eased by Kevin Costner who doesn't need to really be there (and has a stronger JFK accent that JFK does in this movie).  The look at the Cuban missle crisis here is the heart of the movie and it works pretty good.  Not great but good, and if your looking for a historical thriller, this is the one for the season.

10,tavm,Thirteen Days was a fine dramatization of the Cuban Missile Crisis,10,31 October 2008,"Earlier this month I visited my sister in Maryland, to see her first-born child, a boy, get baptized. While there, her husband showed this historical drama to me, my mother, and my other brother-in-law. We were all enthralled at the drama of what happened over 40 years ago being played on the just-unwrapped DVD. Seeing Keven Costner, as White House consultant Kenny O'Donnell, speaking in the same accent and mannerisms of the Kennedy brothers Jack (Bruce Greenwood) and Bobby (Steven Culp who I didn't recognize as the same actor that played Rex on ""Desparate Housewives"") made me almost forget his movie star magnetism. Also fine in their real-life roles were Dylan Baker as Robert McNamara and Michael Fairman as Adlai Stevenson. Director Roger Donaldson takes his time in depicting the title's events that, no matter what one knows of the outcome, still provides some suspenseful turns as well as also explaining how and why certain results became. I was especially impressed at how Culp as Bobby was seeming so impatient with the way Stevenson as a UN ambassador was slowly taking his time with the Soviet premier. Maybe Donaldson was a bit much with a couple of shots of the nuclear film footage inserted but overall, I'd say Thirteen Days was an excellent depiction of how close to World War III our country was during what must have been very tense days of October 1962.",Thirteen Days

O'Donnell (Kevin Costner) are in the hot seat as they struggle to prevent nuclear war,"" according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis.This is an excellent dramatization of the ""Cuban Missile Crisis""; probably, it is a more accurate, more detailed explanation of events than was given to the American public at the time. Interestingly, it focuses on adviser Kenny O'Donnell; as portrayed by Mr. Costner, he is almost as important a player as the Kennedy brothers. Writer David Self and director Roger Donaldson stick with what actually happened, or what conceivably happened; unlike Oliver Stone's 1991 ""JFK"", which also starred Costner.Too few organizations recognized ""Thirteen Days"" during awards season. It did best at the ""Satellite Awards"", with wins for Conrad Buff IV's excellent editing and Mr. Greenwood's fine portrayal of JFK (""Best Supporting Actor""), along with a nomination for Mr. Self's script. The art/set direction, Mr. Donaldson, and ensemble cast are also award worthy. Mr. Culp's arms-folded portrayal of Bobby Kennedy at his most serious is uncanny.

12,michaelRokeefe,Terrific! Powerful! Thought provoking!,8,27 January 2001,"This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. If you are looking for an action flick, forget it. This is a well written, witty drama about an historic two weeks in October 1962. The cold war couldn't get any colder. Too be exact, cold enough to be hot! President Kennedy(Bruce Greenwood), the President's advisor Kenny O'Donnell(Kevin Costner)and Attorney General Robert Kennedy(Steven Culp)deal with the placement of Russian missiles in Cuba.Culp may have played his part better than Greenwood. Both were fantastic in what I guess is billed as a 'Kevin Costner movie'. Costner's accent kept changing, but this did not really take away from the movie's impact.The cast is filled with very good character actors featuring Dylan Baker as Bob McNamara and Henry Strozier as Dean Rusk.

13,sunwarrior13,An Efficient Movie,10,15 September 2012,"Thirteen Days is a docudrama directed by Roger Donaldson about the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, seen from the perspective of the US political leadership. Kevin Costner stars, with Bruce Greenwood featured as John F. Kennedy.Donaldson teams up with Costner for another political thriller after both made No Way Out.After President John F. Kennedy is shown photographs from a spy plane detailing the presence of missiles in Cuba capable of obliterating massive areas of the U.S., he must immediately decide the most effective course of action for the country. With the aid of best friend and special assistant Kenny O'Donnell and brother Robert, the President must avoid a dire chain of events that could be dictated by General Curtis LeMay, who would rather take immediate action and invade Cuba. After initial reticence about leaking the information to the nation, President Kennedy eventually tells of the conflict, leading to widespread panic and a blockade of Cuba. With the aid of Robert McNamara and Adlai Stevenson, the leaders must find a way to alleviate the tension of the situation. The film is a good movie about a profound moment in world history.It provides more suspense than the car crashes and breathless chases of most action movies even though the outcome is known at the end.It has great performances from Costner and Greenwood,who was memorable as JFK.Also,it is easily the best film that Donaldson ever made.Overall,it was a highly competent and refreshing movie.",Thirteen Days

It's a treat to find a film of this type that educates while it pitches you into a world of political intrigue, to provoke real life thoughts even as the suspense takes a hold. Yes it's talky, of course it is, but these conversations are real and riveting. And while there's not a duff performance in the acting pack, Bruce Greenwood deserves special praise.

15,Theo Robertson,A Pinch Of Salt Please,5,2 July 2003,"I wasn`t born untill 1966 but I`m reliably informed that the whole of humanity was absolutely terrified by the events of the Cuban missile crisis. A great number of people watching the events of the Soviet convoy speeding towards Cuba were convinced the bomb was going to drop and THIRTEEN DAYS tells what was going on behind the scenes at the white house
Unfortunately I didn`t think the story was told as well as it could have been . It`s a film that`s too long for its own good and I can`t help thinking there`s been some tinkering with facts . John F Kennedy was weak and indecisive and was surrounded by hawks who were itching to start a war with the USSR ? And as shown here Kenny O` Donnell along with Bobby Kennedy were the only voices of reason at the white house ? Oh right so John F Kennedy had little to do with averting war did he ? THIRTEEN DAYS also feels similar to JFK at times but without any of the strengths of Oliver Stone`s movie , when the screen fades from colour to black and white there seems to be no reason for it while the stock footage is exactly what it looks like - stock footage unlike JFK. And talking of JFK it`s implied ( Though not exactly hammered home ) that John F Kennedy`s performance during the crisis is what led to his asasination a year later . Like I said watch this movie to make up your own mind but take it with a pinch of salt",Thirteen Days
16,Boba_Fett1138,Good view on possibly the most tense thirteen days of the 20th century.,8,24 January 2006,"Basically this movie is a great history lesson. If you want to know more about the cold war and the Cuba missile crisis in particular this is a perfect medium for you to start with. The movie is quite detailed and accurate even though of course some moments and characters have been 'over-dramatized' for the good of the movie and its flow and emotions.Even though you already know from start till finish how this movie is going to end, it still is a tense movie to watch. The story is build up well and makes the movie really interesting and compelling to follow. It perfectly captures the tension of the whole crisis and really makes you realize how close the world actually came to a WW III. It makes us aware of the fact that those 13 days in history should always be remembered and used as a lesson for the entire world now and forever. It's too bad that the movie becomes a bit too moralistic at times, especially toward the ending.Bruce Greenwood doesn't really look like JFK but he's a good actor, so he becomes believable enough in his role trough his acting skills. Steven Culp really does look like Robert Kennedy and on top of that he also is a great actor. I wasn't always happy with Kevin Costner performance but overall he did an acceptable job. There are some weaker moments which involves his character but I more blame those moments to the at times too moralistic written script.A bit of a disappointing aspect of the whole movie is its style. Roger Donaldson at times tries to be over-artistic and mixes the movie with black & white and color images. Perhaps he tried to copy Oliver Stone's style? Who knows. The cinematography was also disappointingly standard but thankfully the good editing saved this a little. Also the musical score by Trevor Jones is surprisingly solid.Overall it's a very good political movie that has some great tense and important moments in it and also works great as a history lesson.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Thirteen Days
17,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,As intense as it must have been to live it,8,26 November 2009,"I believe that this film comes as close to the viewer actually experiencing the immense tension those days as it is possible to get. Reviewers who actually did, please correct me if I am wrong. I did not remember many details about the Cuban missile crisis going into this picture; yet I was instantly captivated when it began. It is exciting and engaging throughout, and well-paced, so that while a lot of information and emotion is being conveyed and a lot of credible characters introduced, we're never overwhelmed, the movie doesn't lose us at any point. Production values leave absolutely nothing to be desired, and the many shots of military hardware are stunning. The plot is intelligent, intricate and well-told. Editing and cinematography are marvelous. Acting is excellent, and it seemed like those of the leads who ought to all went for the Boston accent(I understand that Costner's was poor, but at least the attempt was made). Every role is well-cast, as well. There is some humor in this, the amount and tone are appropriate, it doesn't try too hard and it's quite funny. There is infrequent moderate to strong language in this, and the subject matter is, obviously, rather disturbing. If you think a 13-year-old can handle it, then you can try to let them watch it. I recommend this to everyone, and I sympathize with anyone who had to live through the terrifying two weeks(and were old enough at the time to understand what was going on). 8/10",Thirteen Days

In the conclusion there is a half ass speech about the battle being fought by all countries yet all viewers see is Americans. Time is running out and answers are needed in this story set in October 1962 regarding the missile crisis. Kevin Costner stars as the political adviser. There is a military build up on a Cuban island and the United States President has only 13 days to come up with a solution. The first solution is to better train the actors with their ham handed accents. Directed with insight by Roger Donaldson who has made such dreck as Dante's Peak. He doesn't exactly improve by much here but perhaps providing a translator for every time Costner speaks. Costner appears to be speaking a language unknown to man. Sample dialogue: ""Roight, abbaut, noice, sugor, smot."" Translation: right, about, nice, sugar, smart. Costner reduces the role to a joke every time he opens his mouth. Bruce Greenwood overacts as the President whom we are suppose to applaud for his efforts. Perhaps in another film but here I could hardly find myself caring. Also with Steven Culp and Dylan Baker. Its over American attitude makes it difficult to sit through 13 minutes. Score: 3 / 10",Thirteen Days

I do not know how much of the film is factual, especially the fighting with the generals at the NSC, but the film documents who's who, and at what time events happened.

The film's flaws may also be its virtues as being fraught with over acting; meaningless family and other scenes designed to push emotional buttons; almost complete neglect of Johnson, Jackie, etc.; and unnecessary action sequence spice may all suffice to encourage viewing by younger audiences of which many may have never heard of the crisis.

21,sddavis63,Gripping Story Of A World On The Brink Of War,9,12 January 2002,"I'm not sure exactly why, but I tuned into this movie almost wanting not to like it. But there's very little to criticize in this extremely exciting story of the Kennedy Administration's response to the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962.The movie revolves around the relationship between Kenny O'Donnell (Kevin Costner), special assistant to President Kennedy (Bruce Greenwood) and the President himself. Also central to the story is Robert Kennedy (played by Steven Culp.) We get the impression that here are three men who may have dreamed of governing America, but who never expected to be in the middle of decisions as momentous as these. O'Donnell largely watches as Kennedy locks horns with a military that is willing to risk nuclear war by bombing the Cuban missile sites but also realizes that he has to develop a response that doesn't appear weak. There's an impression here of a military out of control, doing things without seeking the President's permission, not listening (or at least not responding) to the President's wishes. Finally, as a consensus develops around establishing a ""quarantine"" of Cuba, we face the suspense of Soviet ships looming on the horizon, and - even though history tells us how this turned out - there is real suspense.There's not much wrong with this. Perhaps one could criticize the accents used by Costner and Greenwood. Costner's fake New England accent was distracting to me and Greenwood just didn't sound like President Kennedy (in fact - I'll need to watch this again to confirm it - but at one point in the movie I thought President Kennedy spoke a few lines with a distinct Southern accent!) But that's really nitpicking. The end I thought was a bit anti-climatic, but aside from those minor points, this was a great movie, and everyone interested in the Cuban Missile Crisis or the Cold War in general must watch it.9/10.",Thirteen Days
22,paul2001sw-1,Days that Shook the World,8,2 September 2004,"In 1961, an inexperienced President Kennedy backed an illegal (and ultimately unsuccessful) attempt to depose Castro.  A year later, Castro struck a deal with Krushchev to deploy Russian nuclear weapons in Cuba.  It seems that Krushchev was determined to push the theory of MAD (Mutually Assured Destruction) to its limits: the theory said that both superpowers had to behave sensibly, as neither would survive a war: Krushchev, however, took an outrageous gamble for strategic advantage, on the assumption that the U.S. would still be unable to survive a war, and so would have to concede anyway.  For Kennedy, it was a tough call: he resolved not to tolerate the missiles, but through his actions had to appear both resolute enough to make it clear to the Russians that it was they had to back down, but also conciliatory, avoiding provocations that could have forced his enemy's hand the wrong way.  This balancing act was rendered all the harder by the presence of more gung-ho (or simply pessimistic) elements within the U.S. government, and the need to prepare for war, in case diplomacy failed. After two tense weeks, the missiles were withdrawn and although Kennedy's golden image has since tarnished, his handling of the crisis is still widely praised.'Thirteen Days' is a dramatic reconstruction of these events.  The story is told entirely from the American side, and takes the standard, patriotic liberal, pro-Kennedy line, so we get a lot of square-shouldered men striving manfully to do their best for their country; and a surprisingly aged Kevin Costner is unsurprisingly annoying in the central role of Kennedy's political adviser (Kennedy was a notorious philanderer, which may be why the drama focuses on another character, who can drearily be shown to love his family without invoking ridicule in the audience).  For all these flaws, it's still a gripping, blow-by-blow account of the military and diplomatic moves that constituted arguably the gravest moments humanity has faced.  The world, and Castro, survive to this day; Kennedy, of course, did not, and whether you believe Oswald or the C.I.A. did for him, opposition to his Cuban policy was undoubtedly (and ironically) a central motive in his assassination.  'Thirteen Days' convinces one how unjust that fate was.",Thirteen Days

Although the historical event has built-in suspense, the filmmakers manage to sap the excitement to some extent by rambling on too long and lingering too much on uninteresting details. The main problem is that the focus is not on Kennedy, but on O'Donnell, the cabinet member played by Costner whose importance in the crisis is exaggerated in this account. To make matters worse, Costner sports a laughable and horribly distracting Boston accent. Culp is also a bit too mannered as RFK. Greenwood, on the other hand, gives a finely understated performance as Kennedy.",Thirteen Days

25,howard.schumann,Has even more relevance today,9,17 June 2007,"Abraham Lincoln said in 1858 that ""a house divided upon itself cannot stand"". This prophecy almost came true during the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962 as President John F. Kennedy fought to avert war in Cuba against the determined opposition of his own military and Intelligence advisors. Dramatized in Roger Donaldson's powerful Thirteen Days, the entire world teetered on the brink of nuclear Armageddon for thirteen anxiety-filled days as the internal and external pressures mounted on both the President and Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev to keep the world from nuclear immolation.Thirteen Days stars Kevin Costner as Presidential Aide Kenneth O'Donnell, Bruce Greenwood as JFK, Steven Culp as Bobby, and Dylan Baker as Defense Secretary Robert McNamara and is based on the book ""The Kennedy Tapes: Inside the White House During the Cuban Missile Crisis"", edited by Ernest R. May and Philip D. Zelikow. When a U-2 flyover discovered two dozen SS-4 nuclear missiles in Cuba pointing to the United States, American leaders had a very short window of time before the missiles became operational to find a way to remove them. Kennedy, who until this time had tried to placate both the right and the left, was faced with severely limited options.Though different courses of action were discussed, the administration never questioned the underlying assumptions of the Cold War or the premise that the weapons were offensive rather than defensive and the film does not mention or discuss previous U.S. attempts to destabilize Cuba. With the CIA and the Pentagon calling for air strikes followed by a ground invasion, Kennedy knew that he could not afford to look weak or back down in face of the presumed Soviet threat. On the other hand, he was profoundly aware that an invasion would be met with Russian retaliation and probable nuclear war. His ultimate decision to order a naval blockade and a quarantine of Russian ships headed toward Cuba carrying offensive weapons was opposed by virtually Kennedy's entire national security apparatus.The film shows the bluster of Joint Chiefs Chairman, Maxwell Taylor (Bill Smitrovich), Air Force Chief of Staff, Curtis LeMay (Kevin Conway), Chief of Naval Operations, George Anderson (Madison Mason) and other military leaders clamoring for an aggressive response. After a meeting with the Joint Chiefs, Kennedy said to O'Donnell, ""These brass hats have one advantage in their favor. If we listen to them, and do what they want us to do, none of us will be alive later to tell them that they were wrong."" The conflict with the military and the CIA over how to handle Cuba would continue to dog Mr. Kennedy throughout his presidency and his overtures for rapprochement with Castro may have been a determining factor in his assassination.The film describes in detail the confusing Soviet response to JFK's quarantine demands and the meeting between Bobby and Soviet Ambassador Andrei Dobrynin (Elya Baskin) is the dramatic high point of the film. Also vital is the crucial role played by UN Ambassador Adlai Stevenson (Michael Fairman) in first proposing a diplomatic solution and in his strong defense of the U.S. position at the U.N. in confrontation with Soviet Ambassador Valerian Zorin (Oleg Vidov), much to the surprise of the Kennedy brothers who had decided he was ""weak"".Thirteen Days unfolds through the eyes of Ken O'Donnell (Costner) and centers on his role in providing counsel and encouragement to Kennedy, though his role is vastly overstated. Costner is adequate in the role though he is a wooden actor and his attempt at a New England accent becomes increasingly irritating. Both Greenwood and Culp have the Kennedy's manner of speech and body language down pat but give very little hint of the Kennedy charm, wit, strength, charisma, or overriding self-confidence. Regardless of its flaws however, the film is an absolutely fascinating portrayal of a pivotal time in history and an important reminder of the tenuous thread that holds our civilization together and how quickly it can be shattered.As John Kennedy reminded us in his speech at American University on June 10, 1963 quoted in the film, a speech that challenged Americans and Russians to rethink their attitudes toward each other, ""We all inhabit this small planet"", he said, ""We all breathe the same air. We all cherish our children's future. And we are all mortal."" It was a speech that has even more relevance today and the need to eliminate nuclear weapons is more urgent than ever.",Thirteen Days
26,Anonymous_Maxine,Excellent political thriller that goes to amazing efforts to stay true to reality.,9,16 July 2001,"One of the most important things about movies that deal with true historical events is that they take as few liberties as possible with the facts, and Thirteen Days stays amazingly close to what really happened. The 1960s are re-created with almost the same skill and precision as we saw in the great Apollo 13, and the tension created by the Cuban Missile Crisis, the event upon which the movie is based, is very successfully captured in the film. This is one of the best parts of the movie, because that tension is something that the government at the time tried very hard to keep the public from finding out about. The film is basically a behind the scenes look at how the government under the Kennedy administration operated with the Russians and with the press in handling the problem of offensive missiles seen in Cuba, within firing range of the U.S. The conflict is much more significant than just getting the Russians to remove the missiles, because the U.S military is doing everything possible to get authorization to fire upon Cuba and go to war. This is understandable to a certain degree, because the military spends so much time training for something like this so of course they're going to want to move on it, but it also makes the chief of staff in the film come off as a hot-headed redneck who just wants to blast the Cubans out of the water. John F. Kennedy was brilliantly portrayed by Bruce Greenwood, which is surprising because of his less than enviable iconography (yeah, he was that jerk in Rules of Engagement and that jerk in Double Jeopardy and, if my memory serves me, he was also that jerk in Disturbing Behavior). Kevin Costner stumbles over every line in the film, delivering one of the most badly mangled fake accents in film history. I personally think that Costner is a very good actor (I even liked Waterworld), but he was entirely the wrong person for the part of Kenny O'Donnell - his horrific accent overshadowed every other element of his performance.But as a political and historical thriller, Thirteen Days scores big. The Cuban Missile Crisis and the reactions of the government and the press and the public are re-created with stunning detail, and the results are outstanding. Even younger generations who were not born when the crisis happened can enjoy it because of its brisk pace and well-written script. Thirteen Days manages to avoid being a boring semi-documentary, yet retains its historical accuracy and achieves maximum effect.",Thirteen Days
27,thinker1691,""" I can wait till hell freezes over for your answer""",9,19 July 2007,"In the 1960's few realized how close the world came to Nuclear Winter. Even today, with all the resources at hand, fewer care who prevented the Third World War. One thing is certain, America was enormously fortunate to have had as President of the United States, John F. Kennedy (Bruce Greenwood) during those nearly fatal ""13 Days."" As the thinking man's president, Mr. Kennedy was lucky to have in his cabinet men of intellect and reason. His main confident was his younger brother, Robert Kennedy (Steven Culp) who proved invaluable as Attorney General. When the world learned of the Nuclear threat ninety miles away, Kennedy came to rely heavily on his political adviser Kenny O'Donald (Kevin Costner) who displayed cautious insight and prudent judgment in critical moments which could have proved disastrous had the Joint Chiefs of Staff gotten their way. Further, Kennedy was definitely fortunate to have selected as his ambassador to the United Nations, Adlai Stevenson (Michael Fairman) who stood toe to toe with Russian's Valerian Zorin (Oleg Vidov) and did not back down. The film is dramatic and terrifyingly accurate with dated Black and White footage and actual verbal scripts from hidden recordings from the oval office. What we know today is; had the Administration followed the prodding of the military, they would have initiated the Third World War as the Russian military in Cuba, actually had short range Atomic warheads at their disposal.

28,dfranzen70,Gripping real-life drama magnetically told,9,14 July 2001,"Back during the Cold War, life was a little different. Once the USSR became a major world power, there was an intense battle of wills on the parts of both the US and Russia not to get into another war. While previous wars had been fought using conventional warfare, it was common knowledge that the next one would involve nuclear weapons, and would probably be the last war anyone would see. In October of 1962, the Soviets planted missiles on the Communist island of Cuba, a mere 90 miles away from Florida's coast. Those of you who were sentient beings in 1962 must have been apoplectic when you heard that news. Imagine! The Red Menace, which had up till then been as distant as Mars, was now parked in your front yard, tooting the horn. It was probably enough to make you quake in your boots. Americans aren't accustomed to reacting in such a manner, of course; we're the big, bad tough guys of the world. And while up till then a full-blown nuclear attack might have seemed as unthinkable as the Cubs winning the World Series, all of a sudden it was very possible. And people were terrified. But by the time the public found out about the missiles, the White House had been working on the problem for a little while. This film captures the inner-circle machinations that President John F. Kennedy and Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy orchestrated to avert thermonuclear war. Was Krushchev seriously trying to initiate a war? Was he trying to scare the US? Was he basically saying, ""We can park these missiles right here and there's nothing you can do about it,"" basically making the US look bad to the rest of the world? It was among the most gripping time period's in the brief, eventful history of the United States. The future of not only the country but of the entire world was teetering, and one false move on the part of the level-headed thinkers in America would plunge it into the abyss. To complicate matters, there were two letters purporting to be from the Soviet leader: Were they both fakes? Was the first real, and the second a fraud? Should the US denounce both? And of course, there were certain military leaders in the US who wanted nothing more than to blow the Reds off the planet. The movie is filled with a virtual no-name cast. Bruce Greenwood plays the president, and he was convincing and powerful in his performance. Steven Culp plays Bobby Kennedy, volatile but shrewd, the ultimate diplomat. The only real ""name"" in the cast belongs to Kevin Costner, who plays political advisor Kenny O'Donnell. He has the same good-old-boy accent he sported in JFK, but he was a little more emotional than in most of his films. A good move on his part, I'd say. The madness of near-war is an infection to which these prime players seemed immune. It's movies like this that remind one that politics and war planning are not simple textbook exercises; they need to be cultivated from the heart and leashed by the brain.",Thirteen Days

The Cuban Missile Crisis of October 1962 escalated, climaxed and then reached its resolution so rapidly that the Doomsday Clock didn't even have time to adjust its setting, but, nonetheless, it is perhaps the closest we've ever been to destroying ourselves for good. Prior to watching Roger Donaldson's taut historical thriller 'Thirteen Days (2000),' I knew very little detail about the Cuban Missile Crisis, but was familiar with its effects on popular culture. Two years afterwards, Sidney Lumet and Stanley Kubrick independently released two similar Cold War thrillers – 'Fail-Safe (1964)' and the satirical 'Dr. Strangelove (1964),' respectively – both of which clearly attempted to reproduce the mortal political situation in which young President John F. Kennedy then found himself (and both films proposed that next time we may not be so lucky).'Thirteen Days' gives life to events that would otherwise, to a belated onlooker like myself, have seemed mere historical footnotes on paper. Only by returning to the proper time and place can one truly appreciate the despair and uncertainty faced, not only by the political leaders holding eleventh-hour meetings in the White House, but also the stunned citizens who would stock up on supplies in preparation for what must have seemed the inevitable. A historical drama like 'All the President's Men (1976)' is magnificent precisely because it succeeds in spite of a foregone conclusion, and 'Thirteen Days' similarly keeps the atmosphere exhilaratingly tense. Most of the film's action unfolds in the stuffy board-rooms and elaborately-decorated rooms of the White House, and this is where it should have stayed. Unfortunately, Donaldson too regularly cuts away from the primary decision-makers to visit American jet pilots, navy boat captains, and even the Cuban missile-workers, thus only partly representing the Presidents' continual frustration at having so little information on which to base his decisions.The story itself revolves around Special Assistant to the President Kenny O'Donnell (played by Kevin Costner with a dubious Bostonian accent), and so presenting the Crisis from the perspective of a reasonably passive, impartial spectator. Bruce Greenwood (most recently spotted in the Bob Dylan biopic 'I'm Not There (2007)') is excellent as JFK, whose (relative) youthfulness is consistently scorned by the reactionary military commanders who seem intent on undermining his authority. Steven Culp, who has a little Brad Dourif about him, is also outstanding as Robert F. Kennedy, without whose matter-of-fact input his brother could never arguably have got along. Unjustly neglected on its original release, 'Thirteen Days' is a fascinating, and often terrifying, historical account of the Cold War's most dangerous fortnight of hostilities – hostilities not necessarily characterised by gunfire or missile strikes, but by the threat of something so much more widespread and devastating. In making his strategic decisions, President Kennedy walked a tightrope above the threat of nuclear war, and we can only be thankful that he kept his balance.",Thirteen Days

About Costner's Boston accent; at least he tried. Not everyone can be Meryl Streep. I'm a Southerner, so if he murdered the accent, I cannot tell.

Clocking in at 2 1/2 hours, its not that its boring, its just that it gets a little redundant.  Okay, Costner is frightened, I got that already, the 26th time.  I don't need him getting on line for confession or telling his wife to get ready for the unthinkable to realize that this was an extremely serious time in history.  Show me someone else having anxiety, he can't have cornered the market on that particular emotion. Possibly more time would have been better spent showing Joe Sixpack and his family and their reaction.  99% of the movie takes place inside the White House, it might have been nice to open it up a little.
But its all still really fascinating.  The politics and the politicians, the assuming you know what the enemy is doing, the power struggles, the second-guessing..its all right here. All the casting is fantastic.  Bruce Greenwood is not doing a party imitation and even gets in some subtle references to Kennedy's chronic bad back, without making a big deal of it.  Costner's accent was overdone at times but he is, for better or worse, the soul of the movie and you see a lot of it through his eyes.  All the supporting actors are great, but I enjoyed Christopher Lawford's couple of scenes the most.  I had assumed when I saw his name in the credits he would be playing his father Peter, who he resembles, but he does not.  He's also in on the only laugh supplied by the movie - a pushy White House receptionist gets off a funny line, which is much appreciated.

However, there are some drawbacks that really bore and makes it hard to resist until the long movie finishes. By portraying mindless militaries who want to bomb other countries as if it were a sport (yes, it is correct, they are like this) it does not mean, as the movie suggests, that Kennedy was a wise man. Indeed, the film is too permissive to the false understanding that it it reasonable that the United States consider as their right to invade other countries with military airplanes without being shot, or to claim that Cuba does not have long-range missiles while their ally Turkey has. Indeed, the United States does not seek peace, as the ridiculous speech in the end suggests, but an advantage in their imperialism. Soviets are portrayed as dumb and mischievous as if the film had been made 15 or 20 years before, during cold war. Therefore, a musical score that brings spectator to heroism was also a disturbingly misleading.

35,Spleen,A smart games-theory thriller,9,11 February 2002,"There's not a lot wrong with this film, and what IS wrong is, so to speak, quarantined - it's all somehow connected to Kevin Costner.  It's Costner whose tin ear prevents him from adopting a convincing Boston accent.  (I didn't know it was meant to be a Boston accent - I had to ask an American - and I still don't have a clear idea of what a Boston accent is meant to sound like, but I know phoney when I hear it.)  It's Costner whose greeting-card musings about sunsets jar with the intelligence elsewhere. It's Costner whose family we're forced to watch.  The actors who play his wife and children faced a thankless task - they must have known that they were only accessories, to be paraded in front of the camera for no better reason than to let us know that Costner's character HAD a family ... what kind, who constituted it, what they felt about him and what he felt about them didn't matter; all that mattered was that the family be there, so we'd know that Costner wasn't one of those shifty single types.  I don't know what prompted the director to show us the family itself rather than a photograph of it.  An indefinable sense of duty, perhaps.The story of the Cuban missile crisis is as tense as almost any other, and, Costner-related lapses aside, the film sticks to the story and understands what it is that makes it tense and exciting.  (We even get a clear idea of the pressures that Kruschev would have felt, even though the action never leaves the Americas.)  So absorbing is ""Thirteen Days"" that, although I saw it within 48 hours of the attacks on the Pentagon and the World Trade Towers (the shock waves were of course felt over here, too), I didn't think of current events once.  If I had I would have been struck by the differences. The Russians placing missiles in Cuba was, of itself, harmless: the danger lay in what the action MEANT.  The terrorist attack was of itself horrific, but it meaningless, which mean's there's no real story to tell (except perhaps the subsequent one of a president so dazzled by the idea of revenge that he was willing to turn an extradition dispute - an extradition dispute! - into a war).  Watching ""Thirteen Days"" it seems as though the story was just THERE, waiting to be told ... that the people making the film might have ruined it if they'd been stupid enough but didn't have to do very much in order to tell it successfully.

Kevin Costner sounds more like JFK than the person playing him.  This is not to say Kevin's er accent is off. (like Robin Hood) Since I never even heard of Kenny, I doubt I can make a judgement call on how bad Kevin's voice is.This movie would be great for a history report.  (bearing in mind that not everything this movie is... is true.)  In the end, I really found myself loving this film.  There's a quality to it that isn't like other films out there.  Perhaps because it's a history piece.Either way, the dvd will blow your mind.  It's got historical footage up the wazzooooooo.... deleted scenes and the works.  Not bad for such a film. (and no it doesn't star any hunks in this movie) Highly recommend renting/buying this dvd.

38,marcslope,When statesmen were statesmen,7,22 August 2006,"Considering that the Cuban missile crisis has already been pretty picked over dramatically (there was also a good early TV-movie, ""The Missiles of October""), and that the movie is mostly talking heads, this docudrama manages to whip up quite a lot of nail-biting tension in its two and a half hours. Its prime pleasure is seeing '60s icons humanized: JFK, RFK, Adlai Stevenson, and even Dean Rusk are presented as smart, responsible, thoughtful men who must agonize over the veracity of the information they're being confronted with and struggling to come up with a suitable response. (Today's neocon bunch undoubtedly would have escalated to full war in a heartbeat, and we probably wouldn't be here.) They lose their tempers, they despair, they disagree, but they're genuine statesmen, and colossuses compared to what politicians have become. As are the media: Walter Cronkite, in actual footage, shows a class and dignity unknown on today's airwaves or Web pages. Costner has been criticized for his faux-Boston accent, but I found it true enough, and anyway, many of his best moments are silent: He does a lot of acting with his eyes. It actually helps that Bruce Greenwood doesn't look much like JFK: It helps viewers concentrate on the man rather than the icon. I suppose the dramatization is a bit sanctimonious: The script is unambiguously on the side of religion and ""traditional family values,"" and Roger Donaldson keeps inserting footage of nuclear explosions, as if we couldn't remember what all the fuss is about. But it's a handsome and stirring account of crafty, wise political diplomacy, the likes of which we may not again see in our lifetimes.",Thirteen Days

What might have turned a little dull, is a tense emotional drama. I liked it.",Thirteen Days
40,jhclues,Takes You To the Brink,10,15 July 2001,"Throughout the Twentieth Century, misjudgment-- the failure of one side to extrapolate the position of the other side-- has resulted in every major war from WWI to the Korean conflict.  And no one was more aware of this than President John F. Kennedy, when in October of 1962, photographs taken by an American U-2 spy plane uncovered the existence of Russian surface-to-surface missiles being deployed in Cuba; missiles with a range that encompassed every major city in the U.S., with the exception of Seattle.  `Thirteen Days,' directed by Roger Donaldson, is a chronicle of two of the most intense, significant weeks in the history of America, as well as U.S./Soviet relations.  Thirteen days that came down to a twelve to twenty-four hour period that could have changed the world as we know it today.	Working from an intelligent, well-researched and accurate screenplay by David Self, Donaldson takes you behind the closed doors of the White House and conference rooms in which the fate of the nation was ultimately decided. The outcome is, of course, a matter of history, but the process which led to the final conclusion is intense, riveting drama that in the end illuminates just how close the world was brought to the brink of nuclear war by the Cuban Missile Crisis.  	Much of the tension in the film is derived and enhanced by the fact that it only gives the perspective of the Americans; but rather than making it a stilted, biased account, however, it becomes an objective, thoroughly engrossing presentation, and the fact that the viewer knows only what Kennedy knew puts you in the room with him, so to speak, and allows you to experience the process of assimilating the information, of extrapolating with Kennedy and ultimately making one of the most monumental decisions in history.	The story unfolds through the eyes of Kenny O'Donnell (Kevin Costner), special advisor to the President, long time friend of the family and a trusted member of the Kennedy inner-circle.  The film accurately establishes O'Donnell's position without embellishing his role simply for dramatic effect; he serves as something of a `tour guide,' through whom you gain access to the drama playing out behind the curtain.  That he is a close friend of the Kennedys is reflected in many scenes in which O'Donnell, Jack and Bobby are alone together.  And since the story is told from O'Donnell's point-of-view, naturally his is a significant role; the film very subtly goes to great lengths, however, to establish the fact that within the conference rooms or during the meetings in the Oval Office, O'Donnell is kept at arm's length and, though present, is not a direct participant.	Costner gives what is arguably one of the best performances of his career in this film, successfully capturing the essence of O'Donnell in an understated, subtle way that works extremely well and serves the story effectively.  He's clearly the star of the picture, though much of what he does is on the sidelines, which keeps the focus on Kennedy and the magnitude of the situation at hand.  Costner has drawn criticism in some quarters with regards to the distinctive New England accent he affects in the film, but the criticism is unwarranted; you have only to hear a tape of the real O'Donnell to realize how accurate Costner's portrayal is, up to and including the accent.	Donaldson and the producers of this film realized that for it to really have an impact, the roles of JFK and RFK, especially, had to be cast with great care; for the film to be believable and to maintain that focus on the story, the Kennedys had to be believable, otherwise the effect would be significant to the point of distraction.  And their meticulous efforts and hard work paid off.  Bruce Greenwood gives an excellent performance as John Kennedy, from the accent to the body language and mannerisms he affects that so defined him.  And Steven Culp is perfect as Bobby, imbuing his performance with nuance and an eye for detail that convincingly brings him to life.  	The outstanding supporting cast includes Dylan Baker (McNamara), Henry Strozier (Rusk), Frank Wood (Bundy), Len Cariou (Acheson), Bill Smitrovich (General Taylor), Kevin Conway (General LeMay) and Kelly Connell (Salinger). During the strife of the Civil War, the nation was preserved because the right man, Abraham Lincoln, was in the right place at the right time; and in retrospect, the same can be said of John F. Kennedy and the Cuban Missile Crisis.  As Kennedy said, if we fail to comprehend the Soviets, and they don't understand us, the result will be tragic; and though the controversy of politics is inescapable, and there will always be two sides with opposing views, this film succinctly demonstrates that in this instance, it all came down to the decision of one man who proved he had the vision and the determination to do the right thing.  And anyone who disputes it need only be reminded that, in fact, that is the Sun you see shining through your own window every morning.  I rate this one 10/10.",Thirteen Days
41,dglink,Excellent Depiction of Cuban Missle Crisis,9,14 December 2016,"In October 1962, the United States and the Soviet Union were on the verge of war over Soviet missile installations in Cuba. Based on President John F. Kennedy's tapes and a script by David Self, Roger Donaldson's outstanding film, ""Thirteen Days,"" effectively recreates that tense Cold War period. Told from the perspective of JFK's White House, including the president; his brother Robert, the Attorney General; and the Special Assistant to the President, Kenny O'Donnell; the film is largely dialog driven. Evidently based on actual conversations, cabinet meetings, and confrontations between the administration and the military, the proceedings have the ring of truth. Kevin Costner, who also co-produced, heads the cast as O'Donnell; his effective low-key performance communicates the stress of his unique job situation and the toll it takes on his family and private life. In one particularly effective scene, Costner stands outside a church, where a line of parishioners are waiting for confession; a sign says that confession is available throughout the night, and, after a pause, Costner joins the line.Bruce Greenwood and Steven Culp play John and Robert Kennedy, respectively; both actors bear a passing resemblance to the Kennedy brothers, and, with Boston accents, they quickly submerge themselves into their parts, and the leads are well supported by a cast of pros, who portray a who's who of Kennedy administration officials familiar to any Baby Boomer who lived through the Camelot era; among them, Dylan Baker as Robert McNamara, Michael Fairman as Adlai Stevenson, and Len Cariou as Dean Acheson are worth mentioning.Although the film's ending is already part of history, ""Thirteen Days"" remains engrossing, often tense, suspenseful, and fast paced. An excellent score by Trevor Jones punctuates the action, and the footage shifts from color to black and white in a seemingly arbitrary manner; however, whatever the intention, the shifts neither add nor detract from the movie. Stock footage depicts civil defense preparations, and shots of nuclear explosions foretell what could occur if the negotiations between the U.S. and the Soviets had failed. Donaldson avoids claustrophobia by cutting from the White House to action in the skies over Cuba and events at sea as the U.S. blockade of Cuba takes effect. An excellent film that is well made and well performed, ""Thirteen Days"" is more than a history lesson; it is a warning as well. The film would make a good double bill with Costner's earlier Kennedy movie, ""JFK.""",Thirteen Days
42,CharltonBoy,Gripping political drama,8,15 March 2002,If kevin Costner has any sense he should stick to films such as this and JFK because it seems to be where he has found a happy medium. Having said that although Costner is very good in Thirteen days the best acting performances come from Bruce Greenwood and Steven Culp who play john and Robert Kennedy respectively . I must admit i knew very little about the cuban missile crisis before seeing this film and i never realised how close we really came to war with the Russians. The way the film builds up the tension of the American political system and how they try to plan every eventuality in the conflict is superb and makes two and a half hours fly by which is always a sign of a good film for me. The dialogue is fantastic and really shows how Kennedy not only had to battle against the Russian's but also against people in his own Government. Good Stuff. 8 out of 10.,Thirteen Days

It does not sentimentalize the Kennedies or even over dramatize a very dramatic and dangerous moment of history. The actors and the props both look right whether it's a Dean Rusk ringer or a 1960 style desk telephone set. And the story captures the very real tension that gripped the world that autumn. At the same time it does not portray JFK as the saviour of humanity as have so many other accounts.

Whilst poetic license will clearly have been taken with the script, it's quite clear that the world was clearly on the brink of nuclear war during the Cuba missile crisis. Had events taken a slightly different course many of the people on this site wouldn't have been born and those that were would have lived in a very different world.Like most films based on real events this film has got to make up for the fact that most viewers will know the ultimate outcome. The good thing with this film is that most viewers will not know the detail, so quite a few of the scenes do retain an element of surprise. All the leads put in a sound performance, but it's the story itself that makes this a good film. 8/10.",Thirteen Days
45,Danusha_Goska,"Gripping, Intelligent, Moving Political Thriller",9,28 February 2006,"""Thirteen Days"" is a gripping, intelligent, moving political thriller of the kind which is all too rarely made in the US any more.You may be thinking, ""Do I want to watch this? How can I get involved in the plot? After all, we all know how the Cuban missile crisis ended -- neither Kennedy nor Krushchev dropped the bomb."" That's what I thought. I thought a movie whose suspense hinges on whether or not the bomb will be dropped would bore me, given that I know how events turned out.The movie is well made, though, and I was gripped by it from the first scene. I really was on the edge of my seat.So, yes, even though these are historical events, the film is highly suspenseful.It has more to offer than suspense, though, something very important in these waning days of George Bush Jr.'s second administration.The film depicts the most powerful men in the world struggling NOT to flex their power.They have the bomb -- and they don't want to drop it. They have evidence that America's arch enemy, the Soviet Union, has weapons of mass destruction a few miles off America's shores, in Cuba -- and they don't want to invade Cuba and overthrow Castro.They could bomb the missile sites in Cuba, but they don't want to, because they know that that would turn world opinion against the US.They stayed up late at night worrying about any American fighting men whose lives their actions might imperil. They stayed up late at night worrying about any innocent civilians in Cuba who might be collateral damage.You get the picture. These men are depicted as the opposites of George Bush, Donald Rumsfeld, Dick Cheney, et al, who wanted to use America's power to destroy, world opinion, and casualties, be damned.Every scene in this movie is an education in how power can be used to restrain itself.Too, there is a behind the scenes look at how advisers, the joint chiefs of staff, and cabinet secretaries jockey for position and work, by hook or by crook, to advance their point of view. There are a couple of really interesting screaming matches.There are similar hints at what was going on in the Kremlin at this same time. There are spies and counter spies, and analysts trying to figure out who is in charge in Russia by, for example, analyzing letters the White House is receiving -- did Krushchev write these letters? Or has there been a coup? The film is full of eye candy. There is archival film footage of aircraft carriers, submarines, missiles, rockets, planes ... if you are an ordnance nut, this is the film for you. There are, of course, recreations of all those hot fashions, the skinny ties and pastel dresses, men and women wore in those days.The cast is great. Bruce Greenwood and Steven Kulp look a bit like JFK and RFK, but don't have their charisma. (Who does?) Dylan Baker is especially good as Robert McNamara. Kevin Costner is Kevin Costner, which, for those of us who like Kevin Costner, is a good thing. His accent is a bit wobbly, but I forgot about it after a while, I was so involved with the movie.At the end of the movie, one of the very powerful men whose work we have been following breaks down in tears. I did, as well, appreciating how much this movie stimulated me to think, and moved me, as well.Strongly recommended.",Thirteen Days

Strong B-list actors Bruce Greenwood and (especially) Steven Culp are superb as the Kennedy brothers, determined to find a political solution to the unfolding situation, despite unrest among their military advisers. David Self's script allows a few domestic interludes, to emphasize the effect of the disaster on ordinary lives, and Donaldson keeps things moving swiftly along, clarifying a wealth of details with economy and grace. All the key incidents are reproduced, including a nail-biting moment following the introduction of a US-sanctioned blockade of Cuba, when American warships prepare to fire on Russian tankers steaming toward the exclusion zone. How much of this is strictly accurate, and how much is emphasized for dramatic purposes can't be guessed, but THIRTEEN DAYS does a fine job of educating viewers unfamiliar with this momentous historical incident.",Thirteen Days
48,Pedro_H,Cosner gets up close and personal with the Kennedy's,7,6 October 2002,"*Spoiler Alert for those that slept during history lessons*A recreation of the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis told from inside the White House. History on film. Deep breath. Pause. First they want to you to write essays about it  at school, now they expect you to pay for it at the box office!
I am Mr Average. I know as much about the Cuban Missile Crisis as the next Mr Average. Maybe slightly more due to my Longman Chronicle of the 20th Century - a great book, not only allows you to learn about history it also doubles as an exercise weight.Given that we ALL know that the world didn't have World War III we are left with the ""how close did we come?"" as the central question.
Kevin Cosner is the star of this show as the (special) Kennedy presidential advisor and Bruce Greenwood and Steven Culp star as John F Kennedy and Bobby F Kennedy respectively. I don't understand American accents, so I am not (unlike other reviewers) able to say whether they are authentic vocal performances.We don't see the Soviet authority - merely the top spy (worked out by Cosner in a spare moment!) and ambassador. How serious were the Soviets? Were they playing games? Were they trying out a new and ridiculously young President to see how far he would go? Don't look for answers here.
Did Kennedy struggle to keep control of the military? The film says yes - but I'm not sure about this either. Without this another plank of the drama is removed, leaving us even more dramatically threadbare. Certainly the CIA didn't trust Kennedy and his habit of disappearing with women (putting him out of contact with them) left the US exposed for short periods.Missiles in Turkey were removed, as part of the final deal, only the American public was not told about it for quite some time. Some argue that America was going to remove them - as they became obsolete - on cost grounds, so little was given away in the long run. Here the film fudges and seems to give the impression that this may have been the intention - but a final decision had not been taken. Great history doesn't always make great drama and I'm sorry to say this came across as a bit sterile. Good effort though. Maybe we would have been better off with a documentary - especially if we had the Soviet side of things.",Thirteen Days
49,kenandraf,Missiles Of October was better,10,21 August 2001,Not as good as the tv mini-series MISSILES OF OCTOBER.Not as accurate or as well acted.The only thing better with 13 DAYS in comparison are those great modern special effects featured for the action battle/recon sequences.Watch 13 DAYS for those cool sequences.It would be nice to just insert those sequences into MISSILES OF OCTOBER.Even as a condensed version of MISSILES OF OCTOBER it does not stand up due to the overblown role of Costner's character.It would have been better if the JFK actor/character in 13 DAYS was written in to be truly the lead of the movie.But it was a missfire when the producers decided to make Costner's character the lead and underplay the great JFK.You cannot tone down or underplay JFK without loosing points in any movie featuring a story revolving around him.He was too big of a personality.It was a bad Holywood compromise for Costner's name.It robbed the movie of it's chance to be a classic.Try to catch MISSILES OF OCTOBER first before seeing this one (only for said action sequences).Still worth a look as a backup to said tv movie(which is one of the best TV movies of all time).Costner fans will love 13 DAYS for sure.......,Thirteen Days
50,virek213,On The Brink Of Nuclear Armageddon,10,2 September 2002,"Based on that period known as the Cuban Missile Crisis, THIRTEEN DAYS is a brilliantly crafted and well-acted political drama that reminds us of just how close we were in October 1962 to the brink of a nuclear Armageddon.When faced with incontrovertible photographic evidence that the Soviets have placed strategic nuclear missiles in Cuba and aimed them right at many East Coast cities, including Washington, President John F. Kennedy (Bruce Greenwood) is faced with decisions and options of enormous and staggering proportions, all of which could determine the existence of the planet. He, his brother Bobby (Steven Culp) and trusted friend Kenny O'Donnell (Kevin Costner), have to balance the possibility of losing politically if they cave in to the Soviets or setting off World War III if they act too aggressively.The result is one of the best historical and political dramas seen in some time; and the fact that it's based on actual events, albeit slightly fictionalized in the transfer to film, makes THIRTEEN DAYS all that much more powerful.Although the heavy Irish-Americans accents of the three leads may be a little distracting, Costner, Greenwood, and Culp do very fine jobs with their roles. The direction of Roger Donaldson (NO WAY OUT) and the screenplay by David Self (THE ROAD TO PERDITION) are both intelligent enough so that even those who don't remember the Cuban Missile Crisis too clearly or who were born too late to see it as only a footnote in history books will be both spellbound and want to read more about this unique and chilling period in the history of the world. Among the other great things about this film is Michael Fairman's great portrayal of UN ambassador (and former presidential candidate) Adlai Stevenson. His showdown with his Soviet counterpart at the UN General Assembly is a classic moment in recent film history.For those who like politically-charged films like ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN and SEVEN DAYS IN MAY, THIRTEEN DAYS is the ticket. Even if political dramas are not your thing, this film should still be seen for the great acting and the story that is on display.",Thirteen Days
51,the red duchess,It's all in the subtext (spoiler in final paragraph),5,22 March 2001,"13 is an unlucky number.  The Cuban Missile Crisis took place over Hallowe'en.  Although '13 Days' prides itself on its historical verisimilitude, its willingness to capture the repetitive tedium of high-level diplomacy at the expense of more glamorous angles such as Marilyn or the Mafia; its insistence on 'documentary' paraphernalia - precise dates, detailed intertitles giving names and full ranks; despite, in other words, its factual materialism, there is another, concealed world underpinning that of linear history; an older, immutable world of superstition, omens, ghosts. After all, the day after Hallowe'en is All Souls.There is a brief, telling shot in '13 Days', when in montage we catch a glimpse in Cuba of a female soldier helping out in military operations.  In the free US, the women organise parties, answer the phone, or deliver documents.  I'm not trying to make a tiresomely pedantic p.c. point: this is the milieu of the film, a macho milieu where men in suits hold the world in their hands, while their wives wait expectantly by.  In recent years 'men' (white, Ivy-League men) have felt beleaguered and emasculated by, among other things, the rise of women in the workplace. Although '13' is about the most frightening fortnight in history, when the whole world seemed on the brink of extinction, it is an oddly comforting, nostalgic film.  it shows a world where Ivy Leaguers call the shots, where privilege, education and the old boys' network are a good thing.  It is a macho fantasy, not in the Arnie/Sly sense, but in the more plausible, general, pseudo-liberal one, where prevarication, talk, ideals and thoughtful male common sense can win out over earth-threatening crises. 
Although the film reveals how perilous American democracy is, not from external threats, but from within, with military coups seemingly only a hysterical tantrum away from success, it shows that Ivy League 'reason' can prevent even this.  The film wants to turn back history - by setting the film in the present tense, it can ignore context.  An audience can infer Camelot corruption from allusions to Jackie, Vietnam, etc. but only if you bring historical knowledge with you.  Like RFK, it can deny everything.  Despite all the revelations about Camelot in the last four decades, '13' is pure hagiography.  Kennedy's weakness is praised as sanity. 
The film tries its best to excise ideology - there are no harangues about the Free West  or the dangers of collectivism (the phlegmatic anti-Reds are obviously military and mad); this is pure professionalism, the political equivalent of a heist movie.  Of course, this anti-ideology is itself an ideology - by showing the film from an American point of view, it normalises the American system, even while pointing out its flaws. 
In any case, it finally betrays its thriller conventions; unlike the similarly macho 'The Insider', it has to inject its emphasis on dogged process with artificial all-American uplift - the Adlai Stevenson Show at the UN; the religious sentiment that washes over the final quarter.  '13' ultimately reneges as a thriller: you can't keep extending deadlines and expect an audience to feel dread, no matter how willing they are to suspend disbelief.What saves '13' from bing another reactionary tract is its final image, the film's three heroes like gods in the sun, Kenny holding the football that connects him to a glorious past, his future, and his son, his country.  It's also a sign of failure.  He was once a sporting hero, now he's two rich kids' lackey.  This ambiguous image focuses not  on the men, the real men who had to negotiate the previous fortnight's anxieties, but their shadows, making them insubstantial, ghostly, reflections of an unseen reality.  This points to Kennedy's assassination less than a year later, and the end of this ironically 'innocent' period of American politics, pre-Vietman, pre-Nixon.  But it also asks how much substance did the previous 145 minutes have, how much was its way of looking at history and America as dead as the men walking off.  Of the two films made in the immediate wake of the Cuban Missile Crisis ('Dr Strangelove', 'Fail Safe'), '13' takes its stylistic cue from the flop.  But then, I'm very superstitious.",Thirteen Days
52,redkiwi,Anything is possible!,8,25 March 2001,"I've had a long running joke with a friend for a long time that goes ""Anything is possible -- Kevin Costner might make a watchable film!""This man has more to answer for than most for the unadulterated c*** he has subjected us to down the years.

In fact, I found it riveting and have seen it a couple of times since.The film is the true life story of the Cuban missile crisis, which I always thought happened at the same time as the Bay of Pigs crisis, but I was wrong. The script writer takes special care in every single scene to (a) set up tension (b) explain what's going on and why that's important. So despite all the complexities, I never got lost.Meanwhile, the story itself is fascinating, and the fact that it's true to life means that unlike most of the action flicks I see, it actually has some meaning. The only negative I can think of is those overdone Boston accents.

Director Ronald Donaldson keeps the pace moving and the tension high and you can feel what it must have been like inside the white house at this crucial juncture of history.

55,CinematicInceptions,Decent political drama.,7,23 May 2017,"This was one of the less sensationalized historical movies I've seen, though it surely took some liberties in the pacing of the escalation of the Cuban Missile Crisis and some of the political debates that took place. That said, the movie did an impressive job at keeping the level of drama at a palatably high level while having the majority of scenes involve nothing more than actors debating in a room. This is good because it gives a better sense of how the actual events played out and is a testament to how diplomacy rather than military engagement won the day in this period of tension. On the downside, it will not be easy for those who are not familiar with the Cuban Missile Crisis and Cold War tensions in general to understand. It has the feel of an action movie, but since it's the Cold War there are not any actual battles to depict, although there are a couple scenes of reconnaissance and military suspense.I do not agree with the choice to make Kenny O'Donnell the protagonist. He contributes very little to the decisions being made, and is little more than another strident voice in Kennedy's ear. The story is all about weighing the odds and deciding the best course of action, so it does not make sense for the main character to not be a part of that. The logical choice for the movie's hero would have been JFK seeing as he was the leader who said yes or no to every proposed course of action, although this may have been problematic since he's almost portrayed as perfect like the fictional presidents in Roland Emmerich's movies. JFK does deserve a great deal of credit for avoiding catastrophe under great pressure from many sides, but I think they were a little too generous to him here. The one who I thought should have been given the most attention is Bobby Kennedy. He doesn't have the same power as his brother, but he is the one who strikes the pivotal deal with Russia, and I think that moment in the movie was downplayed because Bobby wasn't made to be important enough. All of the actors overact a bit in their parts, and the fake Boston accents are pretty bad, particularly Kevin Costner's atrocious inconsistency in diction.The actual suspense factor for the audience is greatly lessened by the fact that this is historical; we know by virtue of the fact that we are sitting and watching the movie that nuclear war did not ensue. However, each scene does a good job of the ""how"" overcoming the ""if"" as the dramatic question of every given complication. It's not about ""will nuclear war be avoided?"", it's about ""how can nuclear war be avoided?"". This makes it a good lesson for how to prevent similar tragedies in today's world. A historical movie about nuclear war actually ensuing would make exponentially more money than Thirteen Days made, but it would lack the resilience of the human spirit that is on display here.In terms of the actual events, I see nothing blatantly inaccurate, but there was probably some manipulation of the time line of when everything happened. By this, I do not mean that events were shown out of order, that wouldn't make sense. Some of the more personal moments with Kenny and his family like when he gets called back to the White House five minutes after getting home and when he goes to his son's football game were probably contrived. This isn't really a problem or a bad choice by the writers, but I thought those scenes detracted from the overall movie. I think the writers did a good job making sure the characters addressed all sides of the very complex implications of the characters' actions. Whenever a decision had to be made, they had to factor in whether the press knew, how the military felt about it, how it made Kennedy look, how Russia and Cuba would respond, and whether it would weaken the US's diplomatic position. The periodic use of black and white seems to be done to imply that the movie is really historically accurate, but I don't think it worked well. Sometimes black and white scenes work like in Casino Royale or Memento, but here it just looked weird visually and was distracting.I would recommend this if you are willing to pay attention to dialogue and can follow a somewhat complicated plot pretty well. It's not a war movie and there is no real action, but if you like war movies this may appeal to you. If you just want to know more about the Cuban Missile Crisis, it's probably not a bad place to go if you don't want to do any hard core research. I would recommend not watching it in one sitting because it's pretty long and you may want to backtrack a couple times just to remember the exact situation. The pace is pretty good, but not enough that it will keep your attention for a straight 145 minutes. It's not a great work of cinema, but it's made with care and should engage you at least a little. Overall Rating: 7.5/10.",Thirteen Days
56,iohefy-2,Riveting Movie,8,8 January 2001,With a cast of mostly unknowns this is a riveting movie and very well acted. Kevin Costner is excellent in his role and the whole production is one that is well worth the price of admission.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie which kept you on the edge of your seat,Thirteen Days
57,chrisbrown6453,"Thirteen Days was a wonderfully acted, wonderfully told story about the 13 days of the Cuban Missile Crisis, a time when the world almost came to an end.",8,18 July 2001,"Shown through the eyes of presidential aide Kenneth P. O'Donnell (Kevin Costner), we see the inner workings of President John F. Kennedy (Bruce Greenwood) and his closest advisors as they try and find the best way to end a potentially devastating showdown with the U.S.S.R. In October of 1962, the U.S., during a regular mission photographing Cuba, spotted a missile buildup by the Russians. The missiles were powerful enough to kill 80 million Americans with only 5 minutes of warning time. President Kennedy had to decide quickly what action to take. With his trusted aide Kenny O'Donnell and his brother Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy (Steven Culp), and others such as Robert McNamara, Adlai Stevenson, McGeorge Bundy, Dean Acheson, Dean Rusk, and many more, Kennedy needed to figure out the best course of action. If he allowed the Russians to aim these missiles at the U.S., the United States would be placed in a potentially deadly situation. If Kennedy allowed the military to attack the missiles and destroy them, what would Russia do as a response? If he waited too long, would Russia simply attack the U.S.? If he backed down and agreed to take down U.S. missiles in Turkey, would the U.S. then look weak to the rest of the world? For such a young President, Kennedy had a lot of tough decisions to make, in a short amount of time, with the world hanging in the balance. I wasn't alive during the Cuban Missile Crisis as it occurred, so seeing Thirteen Days was like having a history lesson at the same time as having great entertainment. Even though I knew that we didn't end up in World War III, there were a lot of things I didn't know. I won't go into any of the specifics, but I never fully understood how close we came to destroying the planet. The tensions of the time were brought out successfully by director Roger Donaldson. You could see and feel the sweat on all the major players as each minute ticked by. Bruce Greenwood did a tremendous job as the young President Kennedy, showing how Kennedy was strong enough to stand by his morals and values, even as his most trusted advisors were urging him to go to war. At the same time, Greenwood was able to portray Kennedy as someone who needed help and was able to turn to his brother for guidance. Kevin Costner did a good job as Kennedy's presidential aide. I especially liked his boston accent.  Costner was a strong personality that worked well with Greenwood and Steven Culp. I believed that the three of them were friends for 15 years and that they trusted each other with their own lives. Other acting standouts to me were Dylan Baker as Robert McNamara and Michael Fairman as Adlai Stevenson. Even running at almost two and a half hours, I was always at the edge of my seat, wondering what was going to happen next. Like I said before, I wasn't even born yet, nor was it something I ever learned about in school, so I had no idea what was going to happen. It was nice being able to get deep inside the mind of these important people during this crucial time. Of course, I have no idea if what was said during these meetings was actually said in real life, but I'd like to believe that at least the outcomes of the meetings were true. I'm a big fan of these kinds of dramatic films based on real life events. While being entertaining, they also have the ability to teach you about history. Reading about these situations in books isn't nearly as enjoyable as being able to watch them on screen. I think screenwriter David Self did a great job of bringing these real life events to life on the big screen. He made it historical but didn't bore you with too much talk or information. Along with Donaldson, he gave you what you needed to know, and let the actors bring you into the action.
So overall, I thought Thirteen Days was a great film. Well acted, well directed, well written, nice musical score and very entertaining throughout. And if you happen to learn something along the way like I did, then even better.",Thirteen Days
58,rowmorg,The 20th century got worse and worse,7,16 September 2013,"Its pretty shattering when Kennedy says he just read ""The Guns of August"" (by Barbara Tuchman), because it reveals what a nightmare the 20th century was. I remember that Friday night in 1962 going to bed wondering if I'd get up in the morning. It was truly ghastly to feel that the whole civilised world could be blown to bits by lunatics like Gen. Curtis Lemay and Gen. Lemnitzer. Of course, the war party ultimately won by Kennedy getting assassinated, something that traumatized my whole life and has never been resolved. Gen. Lemnitzer got promoted to run the whole of NATO and the hideous Gladio programme that distorted European politics. All those guys are still there and they faked the 9/11 events to promote more war in the 21st century: it's so sad that the US public gets lied to again and again, and just laps it up or turns off. Kennedy was the one guy who had a chance to turn over a new leaf, and it was stolen from him --- and from his brother. This is a very sad film, in view of what transpired: although, sadly, few Americans are aware of what happened afterwards, or even before, such as the Bay of Pigs fiasco that led directly to this trauma, and got Lemnitzer fired by Kennedy. We now know that Kennedy was corresponding with Kruschev throughout.",Thirteen Days
59,Rammstein-2,Gripping and fascinating,7,8 October 2001,"A fascinating and very exciting dramatization of the events in the crisis that brought the world to the brink of nuclear war. Truth and drama are splendidly mixed and filmed with harsh straightforwardness. Artistic freedom is sure to have been taken, but it's hard to know where and to what degree - at any rate, the political advisor Kenny O'Donnell sure is one major hero in this film and I have heard some voices stating that he never played that pivotal a role. It doesn't really matter though. The Cuba crisis remains a great example of how potentially lethal (and global) conflicts can be resolved with the pen rather than the sword, and someone is sure to be a great hero. It is also interesting to note that the president of the USA is not always so in control of the might at his disposal. After all, he's only human.",Thirteen Days
60,glgioia,13 Reasons Not To See Any Movie With Kevin Costner,5,25 January 2002,"Only Kevin Costner would have hubris enough to insert his mug alongside modern day legends JFK and RFK on a DVD case. Open up the case, and Costner is a one man wrecking crew that completely weakens an otherwise powerful film. I don't know if his Kenny ODonnell character is real or fiction, but he manages to make that point irrelevant. From his Forrest Gump type omnipresence to his truly not to be believed Mayor Quimby/JFK accent, Costner does more damage to the Kennedy brothers legacy than an unexpurgated Marilyn Monroe documentary. Is any reasonable person expected to believe that ODonnell's wisdom was the final word in the drama of the Cuban Missle crisis? No, but Costner in his advanced stage of megalomania overlooks this slight detail, in order to make a film in which HE appears to save the world. Again, its a darn shame. Great subject matter naturally, and it scores big on historic drama. If only he had had the courage and humility to simply produce this movie, and left himself as a minor character, or better still, out of shot altogether, this would probably go down as one of the better movies of its time. But his idiotic totally inappropriate appearances rob this film of any sense of realism, and consequently relevance. The tragedy of the failing Hollywood system is well represented in this film and its defining use of error in motion at all levels.",Thirteen Days
61,ozthegreatat42330,Outstanding thriller. Plenty authentic,9,5 March 2007,"Not looking at this as history but as a film, I find it an outstanding production. Even though it was obviously meant as a Kevin Costner vehicle, I found the performances of Bruce Greenwood (John Kennedy) and Steven Culp (Robert Kennedy) to be magnificent and perhaps the best renditions of these two people in any film. The resemblances were uncanny and they allowed the humanness of these two men come through. This made this film for me, as much as anything. The other performances were also well done. I have read some negative critiques of the actors by some people and they seem to forget that the people shown here were involved in a terribly tense and trying situation. I remember these days well, because I was in Berlin at the time when the wall went up and was with my father, a soldier, when all of these events were happening. I remember that October with a terrifying clarity even now. And the scenes of what happened to solve the crisis as shown in this film is very close to me. I highly recommend this film to anyone who wants to know about the days when the world almost ended.",Thirteen Days
62,JayPatton88,Excellent film,8,3 December 2019,"Historically accurate, great acting, factual plot, one of Kevin Costner's best acting performances",Thirteen Days
63,arieliondotcom,Political Intrigue of Nuclear Ptoportions,10,13 December 2009,"It's amazing how suspenseful & thrilling this movie is when you not only know ""how it ends) but studied it in school as history & may have even lived through it. It's the behind the scenes account, based (according to IMDb) largely on recordings Kennedy made of meetings during his Presidency...ironically a practice that would be the downfall of his arch-nemesis Nixon years later but I digress. Incredible acting by all involved, though Costner is a bit stilted just reprising the same role as always only this time for a real person. The casting is outstanding and the ""Bobby Kennedy"" role made the whole movie. My large Italian family was enthralled with the large Kennedy families My parents were too naiive to know they'd hate the Kennedy politics but we were big fans of he Kennedy's as peopleAs a study of psyches, as a study of history, as a sheer drama or suspense this movie is a success of nuclear proportions.",Thirteen Days
64,Mitch-38,Above average portrayals-Lopsided Film,7,30 January 2001,"I'll be the first to admit, I love history and international politics. That's the primary factor that drew me to THIRTEEN DAYS. Yes, since Kevin Costner was in it, I figured JFK would be lionized (and he was). No poolside parties in this picture. The situation is extreme. The most glaring distraction away from this motion picture, is Costner's Harvard-inspired, jackhammer-to-the-skull accent. The fact that it fades in and out does not help. The portrayals by virtually a whole troupe of players is exceptional, with Steven Culp as RFK, the standout. Michael Fairman was excellent as Adlai Stevenson (uncredited role no less!). THIRTEEN DAYS explores the certain factions within the US government, and tactics used to address the crisis. There is little or no action sequences to speak of, yet through a well written script, there is a great deal of tension. What would have made THIRTEEN DAYS more interesting, would have been the exploration of the reasoning and motivations for the Soviets to place missiles in Cuba. Was it over Berlin? Was it over our missiles aimed directly at them from Turkey? I'm sure Premier Khruschev didn't provide Cuba with this kind of heavy duty equipment on a whim. With access to people near Khruschev (of those times) easier during these times, this would have balanced the film out. His son became a US citizen not too long ago.
Why not present both sides? The only people who present only one side (as the Soviet government did many times in its past), is indicative of those who have something to hide. Why not show both sides playing global chess? It would have made for a more resoundingly fair minded film.
THIRTEEN DAYS is recommendable and good in spots, it just should have been better.",Thirteen Days
65,Ric-7,Unnecessary Star,5,2 January 2001,"Kevin Costner's character was totally unnecessary to this film.  We could have done without the attempt to turn the Missile Crisis into a personal drama.  The attempt to make this episode universal managed to trivialize it. Those same themes were dealt with more cogently in ""Fail-Safe,"" both the film from the Missile Crisis era, and the recent live TV broadcast.  I was hoping (against hope) that some new perspective would be added, and for a while, it appeared as though the Adlai Stevenson storyline would be pursued. I was wrong.  Instead, we got more of the Costner family.Also, Costner should avoid doing accents:  not only does he do them badly (see, e.g., ""JFK"") but it is patronizing to assume that everyone from a given locale must have an accent.  I've known a few people from the Boston area, and no one sounded like that.Also, I want to know if it is possible to have a spoiler in a comment on a docudrama?  Possibly there are some viewers who might not be aware how the crisis was resolved.",Thirteen Days
66,jessie-39,"Great movie, Glad I didn't know how close we were...Bush?",9,18 January 2001,What a wonderful piece of history. I am glad that I didn't know how close we were to war at the time. It was frightening enough with what they told us in 1962. As I was riveted to the movie because I knew the characters and the history I drifted away for a moment and thought in horror...about Bush being in that position. Heaven help us! All of the stars were right on in their portrayal. Kevin Costner was great as Kenny O'Donnell as was Bruce Greenwood as President Kennedy and Steven Culp as Bobby Kennedy. If you were there you should not miss this movie. Certainly as Oscan contender.,Thirteen Days
67,len-21,8 on a scale of 10,8,31 December 2001,"I would like to give this movie a 9, but I just can't quite pull the trigger. I liked it a lot. It had the advantage of being the type of movie (political thriller) that I prefer. I can also say that there was never a single moment that I thought about how long it was or what time it was or if it was almost over.However, I admit that I was close. I feel that they could easily have cut out 20 minutes and it would have been a better, tighter, more intense thriller. Also, I was turned off by Costner's poor attempt at a New England accent. Interestingly, it was much less obvious by the end of the film.But, it has one big advantage - the fact that it tells a true story. It is truly amazing how close we came. The fact that we can watch the story 40 years later with no fear of realizing the ramifications adds a unique level of interest and suspense. Overall, it was well worth the time.",Thirteen Days
68,Geofbob,Entertaining and instructive,8,30 April 2001,"This  is  an engrossing, thrilling  movie, that sucks you in from the start. It is clearly of great interest to those of us old enough to remember  the Cuban Missile Crisis, the fear while it lasted, the relief when it was over. But the recent spat between the US and China over the spy plane gives the film added relevance for the younger audience; we can be sure that there are much the same arguments between Hawks and Doves in the White House and Pentagon today as in  1962. The film rings most true in showing how few certainties there are when it comes to engaging in or avoiding conflict. Peace prevails eventually, but as much by luck as by judgment; some of President Kennedy's wisest decisions are when he acts indecisively.  Bruce Greenwood graphically portrays the President's confusion and exasperation when faced with conflicting advice, and his mental torment as he contemplates starting a war that would kill millions, while trying not to appear weak. Some find the movie over-reverential to the Kennedies; but this may be because its makers realise more than most the debt owed to the President, his brother and others in ""Camelot"" for striving to avoid war during this crisis.At the same time, whether accidentally or intentionally, the film also demonstrates the difficulty the  US often has in seeing itself as others see it, an attitude which the rest of the world finds amusing at best, and scary at worst. How could the American Government not have realised all along that its missiles based in Turkey would be as much of an affront to the USSR, as the potential Cuban missiles were an affront to the USA? In the discussion of  a possible pre-emptive strike on Cuba, there is a glaring absence of any reference to the Cuban civilian casualties that would ensue, or to the negative impact on America's reputation abroad.       On the acting and technical sides the movie is excellent, with great performances by the whole ensemble (but especially Steven Culp as Bobby Kennedy); and with exciting air and sea action sequences interspersing the inevitable long stretches of talk. Often criticised Kevin Costner  is more than effective as Presidential Aide, Kenny O'Donnell,  particularly in the domestic scenes with his family. However, the need to keep Costner at the centre of the movie perhaps led to a couple of flaws. Close as O'Donnell might have been to John Kennedy in younger days, would he really have had such free and easy access to the President, and such a casual relationship with him?  Even harder to accept is the role the film gives O'Donnell in persuading airforce pilots to play down any encounters they had with Cuban anti-aircraft fire. Would highly trained and disciplined servicemen have taken much notice of an unknown voice on the 'phone, claiming to be a White House official?
Such niggles aside, this is a great movie, containing important lessons, and is a credit to Hollyood. Now, how about a Russian movie, telling the story as seen from Moscow?",Thirteen Days
69,Starbuck-13,Impressive,10,11 April 2001,"This movie is a  wild ride through 13 crucial days of modern history. Though over two hours long, it does not get boring for a single minute and though you know how everything will turn out in the end, you can't avoid sweating because of all the incredible tension.This is an excellent portrayal of diplomatic finesse and big international politics. The end was near, and it was due to some bright people on both sides that we can still live happily in our world today.
After somehow failing in  the Science Fiction genre, Kevin Costner has returned to glory with this masterful history lesson. All I can say is thank you for this thrilling experience and may your next project be  just as right on target again - history has lots of thrilling episodes, you should find one that suits you just as well!",Thirteen Days
70,enochsneed,Lacking in drama and doesn't ring true,5,22 March 2009,"This film is supposed to portray the struggle of the Kennedy administration to face down the Soviet Union and avoid nuclear war. It's a momentous subject but this telling falls flat.First, I don't buy the scenes of Kenny O'Donnell sharing the intimate discussions of the Kennedy brothers and offering stern and weighty advice. When you see the old photo's of Jack and Bobby at the White House they look a very self-sufficient little unit - not the type to need any kind of 'Special Adviser'. I particularly feel Bobby's role in the crisis has been undervalued here.Second, there are only two real moments of drama in the whole film: Adlai Stevenson being told to ""stick it"" to Ambassador Zorin at the UN and rising magnificently to the occasion, and McNamara losing his grip in the Pentagon when a warship fires flares at a Russian freighter.The final scenes of O'Donnell with his family thinking of what might have been are a rather feeble attempt to give 'meaning' or a human dimension to the crisis. Unfortunately history doesn't have meanings, it is just a series of events.A better account of the story was given in the Martin Sheen mini-series ""Kennedy"", generating far greater tension. Martin Sheen also made a much more energetic and charismatic JFK. Bruce Greenwood is just bland and colourless.",Thirteen Days

72,xbrad68,PRESIDENT JACK KENNEDY FANS WILL LOVE THIS MOVIE,10,26 June 2004,13 DAYS in OCTOBER 1962 was an agonizing time for PRESIDENT KENNEDY. He had just discovered that the Russians had satellites capable of emmitting cosmic rays against individuals on earth just strong enough to cause pain. JFK also discovered that the Russians had put nuclear missiles in Cuba. The military urged attacks against cuba but Bobby Kennedy suggested a blockade or quarantine around cuba. The first time I felt the pain in my side was at a computer lab at a college in Sudbury Ontario. I was working at the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory at the time. I never felt the pain underground in the observatory at 6800 feet down. At least there is some relief from cosmic rays underground. Bruce Greenwood shines as PRESIDENT KENNEDY who delivers solid leadership. Kevin Costner gives a great performance as Kenny O'Donnell the special assistant to the PRESIDENT. President Jack Kennedy fans will love this movie. I believe that President Kennedy is still alive and is the shadow President with President George W Bush.

74,Snowgo,Pure Propaganda...Bad Direction,2,2 September 2015,"There are two major aspects of this movie that I reviled: 1.) It is pure propaganda, just for the sake of creating ""good guys and bad guys"". I am surprised that Hollywood, in the year 2000, produced such a re-visitation of a 1950's way of thinking. The movie did not, for one second, admit that the U.S. had medium range nuclear missiles in W. Germany, aimed at Russia and had a similar strike time reaction-window as that which had the U.S. government tearing their hair out and running around like sissies. How do we think the Russians must have felt?! Now, today, the U.S. missiles are in Poland... 500 miles closer to Russia!! This movie is so one-sided that I would have thought it was manufactured by the Department of Defense or the U.S. Marines. It is abyssymal and inexcuseable. The second facet of Thirteen Days that I found unacceptable (and made it unwatchable, for me)was Kevin Costner's crazy, warped, overdone accent. Now, I was born and raised in Boston. I spent the first 50 years of my life there, beginning in 1957. I have never hear anyone speak like Costner did in this picture. It is as though he was trying to do ""President Kennedy times two"". If I were the person playing JFK in the picture, I would have turned to Kostner at one point and said, ""Why are you talking like that? Are you trying to mock me?"" Evidentally, Kostner figured he was the star of the movie and did everything he could to attract attention to himself. honestly, his ""accent"" is the biggest direction gaffe I have ever seen in a movie. It was just insane.",Thirteen Days
75,medrjel,Is Costner out of his league or what?,1,9 June 2002,Oh brother. I have seen better acting (overall) in a grade-school play. It's the return of the Bostonian's from Australia as Coster et all destroy any semblence of seriousness for such a difficult moment in history. It's sad when a dramatic moment comes up and you laugh at the way people are talking. I know how Kennedy talked. I lived up in that area for many years. The accent would be laughable if not so sad.A movie isn't always as good (or bad) as it's weakest link. But when the link is so obvious.... MST3K would reject this movie it's so bad.,Thirteen Days

Movies like ""Thirteen Days"" and ""Open Range"" show that he hasn't lost his touch after disasters like ""Waterworld"". ""Thirteen Days"" tells the story of the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, with Costner as Kenny O'Donnell, an aide to President Kennedy (Bruce Greenwood, in an uncanny performance); O'Donnell was the old university roommate of Attorney General Robert Kennedy (Steven Culp, also fabulous). Costner's character has been beefed up, both to further the drama and to give Costner a bigger part, but it works well. O'Donnell functions as the normal man amongst extraordinary figures. JFK, RFK, and O'Donnell are the lead players on the American side, and come into conflict with the hawkish Joint Chiefs, led my General Taylor (Bill Smitrovich, who plays a lot of military roles). Another notable performance is that of Michael Fairman as Adlai Stevenson. Even though the conclusion is well known, the film manages to keep the audience guessing about what happens next.

80,vishal_wall,Eye opener for those who think America means 'Peace',8,25 August 2006,"On October 13th 1962 Americans found that Cuba has acquired nuclear missiles from USSR and they will be operational in a few days. It was basically a problem USA created by deploying missiles in UK, Italy and Turkey and brought the whole world again at the brink of nuclear war. 'Thirteen days' is the story of Pentagon and White house during one ofthe biggest crisis of 'cold war'. The story has three protagonists who in the history have gone down as 'Irish Mafia'. Movie is pretty accurate as far as incidents and people are concerned. Movie depicts how war-loving American administration is.JFK is a complex man to deal with in a film. Although people say that Bay of Pigs was planned before he came into power he took full responsibility of its failure. He sent 18,000 soldiers to support south Vietnamese government, formed Allaince of Progress to aid south American countries which of course meant to bring south American countries under American imperialism and designed a similar program called 'Peace Corps'. Its difficult to find out what's good or bad in these plans as America is a country whose base is propaganda. They drop a nuclear bomb and say it was for the best of human race and drop bombs in the name of 'liberation'. Still JFK was a man with a thinking brain. He called King's wife in 1960 when King was in jail. I'm bound to think that intentions of JFK were not as imperialist as rest of the nation's. The other important characters are Robert Kennedy and his college friend Kenny O' Donnel who is adviser to the President. Robert Kennedy is known for criticizing Johnson's government for Vietnam and supporting civil rights movement and Kenny is one of the earliest Vietnam Critic. This film is basically showing these three thinking men in the middle of war mongers. I think it was a difficult job but Roger Donaldson did a good job. Of course Americans call JFK 'weak' because he didn't rage a war on Cuba. Too bad he did not kill innocent people!! That's not patriotism in their eyes. I think its a good script and OK acting. Bruce Greenwood as JFK was very good. He kept playing around with his coat button like JFK. Steven Culp as RFK was very good too. Thank god there wasn't any attention payed to Jaquelin Kennedy. Actor or original can't stand any of hers. Kevin Costner was just OK. I think he didn't realize that he is not doing a regular Hollywood macho-man stuff. Its a good history lesson for American people who think that America is all about peace and liberation. Movie clearly shows that the only reason JFK didn't strike was that he was not sure if he can stop Cubans using nuclear missiles. I think although Cold war was a farce a weak country like USSR held USA for 40-44 years while other countries stood up on its feet. If there was no USSR USA would have literally killed the whole world in the name of liberation. I think cold war was a blessing in disguise. We must thank Gorbachev for disclosing his cards at the right time. Its funny when you see a dwarf like Ronald Regan talking with a visionary like Gorbachev and saying ""we have created history"". History will tell who created history and who accidentally became a part of it. At any rate its a film to watch if you are a history freak rest is Hollywood Jazz. 8 on 10.",Thirteen Days

Until the final frames - when JFK addresses the White House staff - I expected another critical problem to emerge.  These `wrinkles' kept me perched on the edge of my seat.  I was naïve and 11 at the time.  This is a movie not to be missed.The President's Special Assistant (Kenny O'Donnell aka Kevin Costner) tells the story.  He connects you intimately to the Kennedy White House, the early 60s military machinery  balanced against faith and family.  Every emotion kicks into gear over the course of the film.  At the end of the day, you're thankful the man in the oval office was a smart fellow.  We need smart people in that office.  There's a thing called `heart' sprinkled liberally throughout.  Performances are thoroughly believable, as though this is unfolding here and now. Greenwood and Culp are plausible Kennedy brothers after all their predecessors, a tough job given the liberal supply of Kennedy film.  Your heart pours out for the insiders who knew how close the world came to the brink.  Then please, join me in becoming a little cynical about the government's `world safety' report veracity going forward.  Thirteen Days shows you why the government, the press, and the people need to be in constant check and balance to be effective.A football metaphor weaves effectively through the film, though the teams are cliquish at best.  Ex-Harvard quarterback Kenny O'Donnell now serves as a linebacker for the Kennedy team.   He's an insider; close  a (near-family) friend.   In a crisis, loyalty and teamwork to America's quarterback (JFK) is the prescription for sanity.  War zealots surround and abound.  Someone needs the cooler head  to be the wiser man  in a world where warfare is being redefined with weapons of annihilation.Minutia:  There's always something for a fanatic like me.  I spotted a bowl of Post's fruity Pebbles cereal at the O'Donnell breakfast table in the closing minutes.  I don't think these had been invented yet.  The thing is: If I have to dig `that deep' to find flaws with the film's presentation quality, it's a pretty darned good.  I am sure there are historical flaws, but this is close enough for government work.I'm still naïve, but no longer 11 years old.  Movies have to be well made / well told to satisfy.  An entertainment adventure you will enjoy no matter your age, gender, race, religion or political persuasions.  It rates 9 out of 10 possible points.  But unlike its Godfather intensity, I hope there's never a sequel to this one.",Thirteen Days
83,Stibbert,The days the Earth stood still...,8,22 December 2005,"Thirteen Days tells the story of what happened those thirteen days in October, 1962, the event that became know as the Cuban missile crisis. It follows president John F. Kennedy and his closest team and shows how they handled the situation.This is a well written movie. The plot is good and the characters as well. It's got suspense and thrill on the outside and the inside. A lot of dialog means you'll have to pay attention all the time, but this film really need all that dialog.The acting is good. Bruce Greenwood does an excellent job as JFK and Kevin Costner is good as Kenny O'Donnell. They bring out the feeling and humanity in their characters and make them all much more alive.The cinematography is nice. Good composition and lightning. Most of the shots are nothing out of the ordinary, just plain good, while others are really nice. The editing is also very good. The way they mix black and white and color works very well and along with the occasional rough look of the color footage, it gives the movie a kind of documentary look. It kind of look like real footage from 1962.Trevor Jones has done a good job in scoring this film. The score fits the era in witch the film is set and it sets the mood and atmosphere very good.I would have to say Thirteen Days is a film that, in a good way, reflects what happened behind the scenes on those thirteen days. I was not born when these events took place and so it gave me kind of an insight into what happened and so I found it both entertaining and a little educational.",Thirteen Days
84,herrick416,Oh. Is that all...? TERRIFIC FILM.,9,26 January 2020,"Reminded throughout ""who KNEW it could be so hard ..? I don't know how I managed to miss this terrific movie until now. But here we are again, superpowers jockeying for position to claim peace. Back then the 2 superpowers, The United States and the Soviet Union where in at least one we know cooler heads prevail and quite possibly both. But so many near-misses
too many excuses to dump diplomacy that could have landed in mutual destruction and cost us the planet. As JFK so rightly and humbly put it ""I think we both won ...""
Rarely is a history lesson as entertaining as it is factual. I've learned that apart from the necessary embellishments this stuck pretty close to true. President of the United States, his Attorney General and his Chief Advisor are jobs where the wishy-washy need not apply nor the hotheads yearning for war to ignite. These 3 men may have argued each other's logic but never in question their shared deeply principled commitment to exhaust all options before going to war. Each took a turn at carrying out another's scenario to its natural conclusion where again they'd arrive on the unthinkable. There were others who used the unthinkable as a resort without stating the reality that it's our collective last resort. These men epitomize the great America where bullheadedness aims for peace and we the people admire (and therefore elect) a brilliance in intellect, character and tone necessary to keep it and us intact. Yes in October of 2020 hoping for something of substance to return in a principled government that respects the wisdom of shared power; that when an executive branch fails to recognize its limitations, the legislature and judiciary find the courage to defend our Constitution or otherwise own the weakness of acquiescence in the damage of a nation.",Thirteen Days

This film was one of the few movies that I actually went to see,when it was initially released and to this day it remains one of the few movies I will watch on Digital Versatile Disk more than once.When I exited the theater upon seeing this film I was asked by a women as to the film and I mentioned that it brought back a time when even my parents were still in this world. It was not so easy to understand that my mother and father loved this nation and its president and we as a people were made very much aware of the impending crisis that that attempt caused to occur.It also prompted me to tell this women I also remembered the assassination because then too a dramatic event had occurred that caused all to take notice and to pause as we were to lose a president.I was a young boy at the time and both events provided for an indelible impression.As to this very capable movie,it provides a very real appearance of we are there.I believe it is a worthy movie going experience and I recommend it.It is a very well done film,gripping tension,ever ending, unfolding drama.It was a moral buoy to hear the voice of John F.

86,anupviswanath,JFK & RFK the good souls of USA,8,18 December 2011,"The years between 1960-70 holds great importance to the US. Most of the revolutions and changes that were yet to come happened during this time period. Assassinations of Leaders like Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, John F Kennedy,JFK and RFK. I am an Indian(Asia) have seen several movies that deals or just scrapes with the JFK issue but none of the movies showed how good this man was or his brother. Bobby(movie) even though everyone says he is a fine man but no reels on the reality. This movie also shows how JFK & RFK wanted peace more than anything and how some of the generals or high officials disliked their NEED FOR PEACE as WEAKNESS. I say it takes a lot of courage to stand up to what you believe and fight for peace rather than go into war and ruin others life when the main guys who initiated this remains hidden in a thick fortress of shield. It takes a lot of courage and good soul to think about the farewell of millions of countrymen over power and show offs of STRENGTH. I think we need more of these of men than those who think peace is for weaker. JFK held the position in the most controversial and difficult times for USA. All the actors did a marvelous job and I personally think Kevin is a guy who cherishes and loves JFK and Bobby. As he did JFK related movies. All in all politics is shown at its best.",Thirteen Days
87,A_Roode,Very well done.,8,30 May 2006,"Poor Kevin Costner. I get the feeling that he just can't win no matter what he does. He gets slammed for being in films and not using an appropriate accent. Need we look any further than 'Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves'? When he does use an accurate accent, as he does in 'Thirteen Days,' he gets slammed for trying to elevate his game to a playing field dominated by more well liked method actors. I've heard an argument before that he should just stick to making westerns since, allegedly, they're the only films that he does well. Many would immediately argue that 'Wyatt Earp' cancels out 'Dances With Wolves.' I argue instead that people are just too hard on Kevin Costner and 'Thirteen Days' is a very good example of why he deserves a bit of a break.'Thirteen Days' was the fastest two and a half hours that I've sat through in a long time. The film was absolutely engrossing and very tense. Everyone knows what happens (or should be able to infer it since we'd all be dead right now if things hadn't worked out so well) but the writing and direction deserve great credit. They were able to transfer the tension from the historical situation and bring it to the screen with electricity. I think it works brilliantly well for two main reasons: 1. The viewer may know what is going to happen, but the characters don't. They are stressed, terrified and at the breaking point. One wrong move and the whole world is obliterated. If that isn't good drama, I don't know what is. 2. The film makers very wisely resisted the impulse to try and show things from the Soviet point of view. The strength of the film is the peril of the situation and the terror of not knowing what the other guy is trying to do. By filming from solely an American perspective and keeping both the characters and audience in the dark, this character driven movie excels.A second brilliant strategy employed by the film makers was in the casting. With the exception of Costner, there are no real stars. Instead there are more reliable, hard-working and chameleon-like character actors. Len Cariou, Dylan Baker, Stephen Culp, and Bruce Greenwood are just a small sampling. Greenwood plays JFK and excellently plays a man desperate for peace but surrounded by calls for swift military action. He sees the bigger picture where others don't, but may not be able to navigate the smaller picture without help. Dylan Baker is a doppelganger and his performance as McNamara is spot on.Highly recommended.",Thirteen Days
88,stefanhoeffllin,All the presidents men...,9,15 April 2001,"""Thirteen days"" describes the Cuba-crisis in October 1962. The world was at the edge of a third world war because the russians stationed their missiles on Cuba. The story is told from the perspective of Kenny O´ Donnell (Kevin Costner), the personal assistant of president John F. Kennedy (Bruce Greenwood). Costner plays in a reserved way this time. Though his name appears first in the credits,  I think that Bruce Greenwood and Steven Culp (as Robert Kennedy) are the stars of the movie. The similiarity of their looks - amazing! I can´t judge about the details whether they are correct or not, but as I´ve heard and read in critics and comments the movie is historic correct. The changes between black/white and color scenes give the movie the atmosphere of a documentation. But it´s also full of intimate and personal moments  -  e.g. when O´Donnell is at home with his family or when he is alone in the oval office, talking to J.F.K. Director Roger Donaldson´s movie (""No way out"", also starring Kevin Costner) is a breathtaking and impressive history lesson. You don´t want to read the dry facts in the history books?

89,mercury-26,Elmer Fudd saves the world,8,20 January 2001,"It's hard to imagine. The fate of the world in the hands of the Kennedy brothers and some joe named Kenny O'Donnell (Kevin Costner, sounding eerily like Elmer Fudd at times). These three were apparently the White House inner inner circle.My own knowledge of the events is fuzzy. I hate to call this film educational, but it's now the account of the Cuban Missile Crisis that I will remember. It makes me want to read more about it, to see what's true and what isn't. Hopefully others won't be so quick to accept the film as gospel and look upon it as what it really is: entertainment.Like any Hollywood movie with a Kennedy in it, Jack and Bobby are treated as infallible protectors of everything good. No other president has more stories surrounding him, more speculation about his personal life and beliefs. When Bruce Greenwood (in the best performance of the film) tells O'Donnell, kiddingly, that he wishes ""someone else were president"", we'd understand if he meant it. Hollywood has us believing the world would be a better place had JFK survived longer than three years in office. Kennedy's clashes with the military establishment is used for drama in ""Thirteen Days"", but doesn't take over the story. It's the cat-and-mouse game, the fact that these three men seem able only to trust each other, that makes the film so compelling.The Crisis is so important because it's the one time in history where the world really seemed to be on the brink of nuclear annihilation. There was a chance, however small, that something could go wrong. ""Cooler heads"" might not prevail. ""Thirteen Days"" takes you inside of it, giving you things like the White House staff's reactions to Adlai Stevenson's ""til hell freezes over"" declaration to the Soviet U.N. delegate. Even if things didn't happen exactly this way, you see what it must have been like. Accurately depicted is the weight of the situation. You can feel the life-or-death quality of each decision these men faced.Lest we forget that there are still enough nuclear weapons in silos around the world to destroy it twenty times over, the film is some timely food for thought.Grade: B",Thirteen Days

91,rastaban3,Great film of the 1962 crisis.,9,15 August 2001,"""Thirteen Days""  depicts the extremely tense moments during the cold war between the US and the USSR.  It also gives a glimpse of what might have gone on in the White House during that time.  I highly doubt the makers of this film had complete access to the records from this time but they may have had some.  I am also sure that many of the details of the events are still classified and will remain that way for many generations to come. 
Kevin Costner is excellent as at Kenny O'Donnell and shows just how close and how much influence a presidential advisor has with issues such as National Security and other policy matters.  I enjoyed the depictions of stress and out right fear that these events depicted.  This made the film seem more real.  I am sure that many people, who actually lived during this time, felt this brought back some memories.  The story of the crisis and the extreme care both nations took to try to resolve the conflict without resorting to the unthinkable is well presented. However, the film did not show that Kruschev was in a very difficult position.  At this time, he was already in danger of being deposed, which he was a year or two later, and he could not make any withdrawal from Cuba without something to ""save face"".  If he had not, he would have been deposed and things would, very likely, have turned out different. I also have to admit, I really liked the way the film depicts the fear that people felt during this time.  Many people felt this was going to start a war between us and the Soviets.  Wars of the past had started with much less reason.  I also like the fact that it showed that both sides were afraid.  In this situation, no one wants a war using nuclear weapons.  Overall, this is a great film and worth seeing (9 out of 10).",Thirteen Days

Only one major flaw - Kevin Costner's accent.  It was a major distraction as I watched the film and this picture could have been much better without this accent.  There would've been nothing wrong with him using his natural voice.Steven Culp hits Bobby Kennedy dead-on in looks, mannerisms and accent throughout the picture.  He has already played RFK in another film and I think Steven should play him if a film is ever made of RFK's life story.Bruce Greenwood has the accent for JFK alright, but doesn't really resemble him.  But this wasn't a serious flaw.  Not as much as the fake Bostonian accent of Costner's.All in all, a 9.  It'll go on my video shelf later.",Thirteen Days
93,consortpinguin,"A ""Must See"" Film",10,26 February 2001,"Thirteen Days is a ""Must See"" film for anyone, especially the younger viewers who not around during the Cuban Missile Crisis.  Not only is it an excellent depiction of the historical event that brought the world to the brink of nuclear war, it is an excellent movie as well.From what I have read, the script follows now-declassified tape recordings of the actual meetings in the White House.   It captures the actual drama that President Kennedy, his cabinet members, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff created in their arguments.In October, 1962, the United States discovered from reconnasince photos that the Soviet Union had deployed nuclear bombers and missiles in Cuba.  From this launching pad, the Soviets could hit almost any city in the U.S. within five minutes.  President Kennedy was at the vortex of the decision of whether or not to go to attack Cuba, which could have lead to World War III, which would have annihilated most of the population of the Earth.The Administration had to act within a matter of days before the missiles were ready for launch.  They also had to control breaking the news to the general public in order to prevent widespread panic.  Most of the principals, led by the military leaders, advocated a pre-emptive strike on Cuba, bombing all missile sites, followed by ground invasion to remove Castro.  This sentiment was widely held at the time, as we were in the height of the Cold War.  Both we and the Russians were ""testing"" very large nuclear weapons in an effort to scare the other side.  The tough speeches made by Premier Khrushchev made most of us think he really would attack us. In fairness, I'm sure the Soviet people really believed we would attack them.Although I was only 12, I remember the Cuban Missile Crisis vividly.  When I saw the President's speech on TV I thought we really would go to total nuclear war.  JFK wisely did not choose an immediate strike, and searched for options that would allow both sides to avoid war, and get the missiles out of Cuba.The film is told completely from the point of view of the U.S.  We have no insight about what is going on inside the Kremlin.  The Soviets were always ""inscrutable"" and in this case very frustrating as the few contacts we had seemed to be giving different messages, perhaps even ""red herrings"" to stall us until the missiles were ready.  Some of the cabinet even suspected that Khrushchev had been deposed in a coup.The director makes good use of special effects of U.S. planes on recon missions and our Navy ships stopping Russian freighters on the high seas. This not only breaks up the dialog, but shows that our Servicemen performed bravely in the face of a tough enemy.Overall this is an excellent film: historically accurate, suspenseful, brilliantly scripted with strong performances from the entire cast.",Thirteen Days
94,parker-53094,If You Like Cold War Era History / Intrigue - YOU SHALL WATCH THIS MOVIE !!,10,1 August 2020,"I understand that many people might consider the topic of the Cold War to be a snoozer. Ok, to each their own. But it is incumbent that I drive home a little factoid to those of you who fall into this category: Wherever you call home on this Earth, it is likely that you would not be alive today had the historical happenings presented in this movie not unfolded the way they did. And that might be a good reason to watch this movie.....perhaps! Just sayin...This movie is based on a true story. This movie covers a topic and a situation that affords little room for BS. It involves a close call where the bulk of the species, including humans, was almost vaporized or incinerated into extinction. I guess what I'm trying to say is that this movie is more important than Batman.This movie is packed with international intrigue, geo-political foreign affairs, the notion of Mutually Assured Destruction, and the complete structure of the word ""brinksmanship"" is on full display in this movie. In fact, the word Brinksmanship is defined by the Cuban Missile Crisis and is documented in this movie.I would highly recommend this unusually well put together movie to anyone who enjoys history and suspense. Further, this movie, and Robert F Kennedy's book 13 Days, should be on a mandatory watch list / reading list for ALL those pursuing a career in International Affairs, Political Science or National Defense, and for those who look to serve in the military of their respective nation. This movie is Suspense personified. Nobody, and I mean nobody, has had a bad day at work like JFK and his staff had for 13 days that October. That's but one takeaway I got having watched this movie, and having read RFKs book. What a stressful job that must have been! No, none of us knows what stress on the job even is when compared to this. Heart Surgeon- No. ER Nurse-no. Policemen-No. Combat Soldier-No. None.I so enjoyed this movie that I've watched it something like 70 or 80 times ! And that was after seeing it at the movie theater twice !In this genres, there is no better movie. This is not my opinion, this is a fact. The Hunt for Red October, a good movie in of itself, is a 5 cent joke compared to Thirteen Days. Thirteen Days actually happened. It was entirely unnecessary to introduce a spurious claim of authenticity in digital type at the beginning of this movie to sell you it's theme and content. YOU...are alive today because of the historical account given by this movie.Lastly, this movie, although primarily cast with B actors, is nonetheless unusually well cast. Costner is the only big name actor in this movie. Yet, the acting is A+++. They didn't miss a beat putting this movie together.I am dumbfounded that this movie is merely a so-called ""sleeper"", never to receive the acclaim it deserves. It covers a topic that should make the most hard-hearted amongst us fill their own shoes with yellow liquid. Where are people's heads at? What do they value? Ignorance of the historical account depicted in this movie is the same as being ignorant to the reasons why you currently exist ! Watch this movie ~ learn from it.",Thirteen Days
95,jmoney-2,The definitive big screen version.,9,9 March 2001,"Today's college freshman are not old enough to remember a world in which nuclear war was a constant threat, when the United States and the Soviet Union were constantly poised at the brink of mutually assured destruction. So, along comes the new movie Thirteen Days to show those young viewers just how perilously close their parents came to oblivion in October, 1962.
Considering the Cuban Missile Crisis was undoubtedly the most tense and suspenseful episode of the Cold War, it's somewhat surprising that it's taken nearly four decades for Hollywood to turn in the movie rendition. Sure, it's been done as a TV mini-series. But not until now, have we gotten the definitive big screen version.But here it is, precisely restaged by director Roger Donaldson. He shows us the behind-the-scenes plotting and maneuvering, the ways in which a small handful of men, and a small handful of moments, guided the fate of the human race. We see how the Kennedys, Jack and Bobby, micromanaged the chess game with the Soviets. The movie postulates that were it not for their overreaching control of the smallest details, their subordinate war hungry generals would have plunged us all into nuclear holocaust.
The movie's biggest fault, however, rests with Kevin Costner. Mind you, it's not Costner himself who's the problem -- his Boston accent is fine and so is his acting. Rather, it's with his character, presidential advisor Kenny O'Donnell. In real life, had O'Donnell done even half the things the script wants us to believe he did, then monuments should have and would have been built to the man. But Hollywood needs a hero, one character to embody both the sharp young minds who helped save the day and the average Americans who went to bed each night for two weeks, wondering if they'd live to see the sunrise.And so, the script turns O'Donnell into a Kevin Costner-type for us to empathize with. Still, this dramatic license aside, historians should have no major beef with the film.Besides, the real star of the movie is Bruce Greenwood, who brings John F. Kennedy to life more accurately than any actor who's gone before. Not only is his physical resemblance striking, but Greenwood masters the subtleties of the President's voice and speech patterns better than any of Hollywood's previous JFKs. He doesn't do the standard over-the-top Boston accent. That caricature doesn't capture how the real Kennedy talked. (To see what I mean, check out Robert Drew's 1963 fly-on-the-Oval-Office-wall documentary Crisis:Behind a Presidential Commitment, I'll wager a good sum of money that Greenwood did; he seems to base his performance on the Kennedy seen in that fine film.)Note: Sharp-eyed viewers will catch the real Kennedy on screen. JFK's nephew, Christopher Lawford, the spitting image of his father, actor Peter Lawford, has a small but pivotal role as a pilot sent on a mission to fly over Cuba.",Thirteen Days

100,Reb9,American History takes it on the chin again!,6,15 July 2001,"So now we know that JFK simply could not have handled the Cuban Missile Crises without the sage advice of Kenny O'Donnell!?  Bull! O'Donnell was more Court Jester than senior adviser.  He was a friend that JFK was comfortable with, who aided and abetted Kennedy's womanizing, and who was most probably not nearly so involved in the crises as this film would have us believe.  And where the hell was LBJ?  Lyndon was, after all, the Vice-President; and a loud, boorish, aggressive one at that.  He was a Hawk on the Missile crises.  To reduce the character to a couple of throw away lines is just plain silly.  Then there is poor, misunderstood Bobby, tired of being called ruthless.  Even Old Joe Kennedy said Bobby was ""the most like me, hard as nails"".  The military has been held up to disdain and ridicule in Hollywood for quite some time now, so that aspect should come as no surprise.  It is a shame that so many American kids will get a distorted picture of historic events from films like this and Pearl Harbor.  It is, unfortunately, just one more symptom of the continued dumbing down of the country.The more you know about the actual events surrounding the Cuban Missile Crises, the sillier this film will be for you.",Thirteen Days
101,mikel weisser,pulse pounding presidential pic,10,17 December 2001,"It is truly amazing the amount of tension Roger Donaldson manages to wring out of this 40 year old story of the Cuban Missile Crisis, even though we already know the ending. In the theaters this film was my choice for picture of the year for 2000 and on several top ten lists. Now on video, even at second viewer it remains awesome in its power to capture the moment when the world almost ended. Long time Aussie transplant, Donaldson re-teams with the leading man in his 1987 hit No Way Out, Kevin Costner,  who also serves as co-producer, to deliver one of the best build political true to life thrillers of all time. The film won several second tier nominations and picked up awards for editing and its peace content (from the Political Film society no less) plus an award for the man who is the real star of the film, Costner's broad as a baked bean ""Baaaaaw-stin"" accent aside. Canadian Bruce Greenwood is riveting, powerful and fascinating as the man of the hour, John F. Kennedy, a president with the fate of the world on his hands and a cabinet full of warhawks anxious to pull the trigger on their rack full of A-bombs once the Soviets started planting nukes in Cuba. Greenwood eerily channels JFK onto the screen both sounding and looking astonishingly like the 1962 Kennedy and Steven Culp as RFK is an equally impressive mimic.  At first it is almost impossible to focus on the action whenever Greenwood is on the screen, the impersonation is that uncanny. Many people, including Entertainment Weekly, championed Greenwood for lead and/or supporting Oscar nods and were surprised when he was left out.  But the success of the film is more a casting stunt. David Self's script skillfully converts anecdotes into actions and converts the sprawling events of 13 of the most documented days in world history into a comprehensible two and a half hour narrative flow. Donaldson and editor Conrad Buff (who picked up a Golden Satellite Award for his work here) work all the angles: mixing film stocks, jump and dissolve cuts, rapid fire editing during high tension scenes and a cute trick of fading from black and white to color during a scene which along with the photo-realism images of Greenwood and Culp often leave the viewer wondering if they're watching a movie or a newsreel (real tape of Kennedy speaking is mixed in so skillfully you can't always tell whether it's Greenwood or Kennedy speaking).  Donaldson does not take the potential of thermal nuclear annihilation lightly and neither does his film. With frequent legitimate shots of blossoming mushroom clouds (they blew up an awful lot of nukes in those days), Donaldson constantly reminds us what the stakes were when the cold war heated up to a near inferno and our two nations stood eyeball to eyeball hoping someone would have sense enough to blink.",Thirteen Days
102,escoles,Blinking in Private,8,14 May 2001,"There's probably some irony in the quality of Canadian Bruce Greenwood's portrayal of Kennedy -- he's very, very good, and it's the little touches (like casually grabbing hold of passing objects to stay upright, a reference to the legacy of Kennedy's intensely painful wartime back injuries) that make you feel he's stepped into Kennedy's soul. Though it's no surprise he wasn't nominated, it was Oscar-caliber material. Even as he challenges the Kennedy myth by playing him as a man who can anger and entertain doubt in private, he burnishes it by letting his Kennedy submerge all doubt behind perfect resolve whenever it's demanded: the mythic Kennedy nerve.Overall, the film plays a little fast and loose with persons and actions (though history seems largely unscathed, by contrast with Stone's JFK), so it's best to see this as parable, and see Costner's character as a sort of greek chorus to Kennedy and his cabinet. It's a wonderfully made film, though -- what may become a classic study in how to craft a thriller without physical thrills. The few battle scenes are inconclusive (they conclude in situation and briefing rooms) or end in more or less ignominious American defeat, and as I write this it occurs to me that's critical in the film's success: We're given images and rhetoric of taking punishment as a form of _standing ground_, of _not blinking_.",Thirteen Days
103,artemis_5,Kennedy Finally Gets His Due on Film,9,30 September 2005,"While the Kennedy administration had its share of scandal and improper behavior, movies about the Kennedys, and JFK in particular, have tended to focus too much on the details of a torrid personal life, and not enough on moments of triumph, such as the Cuban Missile Crisis. Then ""Thirteen Days"" came along, and dared to break from the mold. This is Kennedy at his finest, and while critics charge that ""Thirteen Days"" is just pro-Kennedy propaganda (JFK's nephew even has a role), historical dramas make for more intelligent movie-making than soap operas.Besides an intelligent topic, we have a well assembled cast, with particularly good performances provided by Bruce Greenwood as JFK (who manages to be convincing in spite of bearing no resemblance to any Kennedy, let alone JFK) and Steven Culp (who is making his second appearance as RFK on film, having previously played him in ""Norma Jean & Marilyn"" (1997). Unfortunately, I do not have the same feeling about Kevin Costner's performance, and I cannot help but to think of Jim Garrison (his character in ""JFK"" (1991)) every time his character, Kenneth O'Donnell, appears. It is as if Garrison had jumped into some time machine so as to better fulfill his obsession with Kennedy. That is the problem with using the same actor for two different roles in two different movies dealing with the same man. Nothing against Costner, he just does not seem to quite fit.Unlike many other films, this movie relies almost entirely on dialogue, with little action or romance, so it is not entertaining in the conventional sense. It is wholly about those conversations that happen behind close doors that shape human history, and much of the drama is played out sitting down.For those equipped for DVDs, that version of this film is especially desirable, for it includes archival footage and interviews which cast further light on the crisis; thirteen days in which the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. came to the brink of war over the U.S.S.R.'s placement of offensive nuclear weapons on the Cuban island. For those who know the outcome, the movie does not reduce the suspense, while those learning about the crisis for the first time receive a valuable lesson in diplomacy and military self-control.",Thirteen Days
104,Oblomov-2,Brilliantly done cold war drama,10,6 April 2001,"""Thirteen Days"" is certainly the best film that I have seen in the last 5 years and one of the best ever. Script, direction, acting, photography and sound are all top notch. Steven Culp is absolutely outstanding as Bobby Kennedy and surely deserved an Oscar. Bruce Greenwood as JFK is not far behind and almost all the smaller roles are played to perfection. Strangely, the only mediocre performance comes from Kevin Costner, who looks rather wooden most of the time. But the movie is a triumph of what I call ""straightforward storytelling"" which seems to be sadly lacking in these days of Tarantinos and Soderberghs. For me, the crux of the whole situation was the sequence where the President asks the destroyer commander, ""Captain, can you force that Russian sub to the surface without damaging it and without damage to yourself?"" In retrospect, it is a wonder that the world came through this unscathed.",Thirteen Days
105,cwpnewpaltz,"Action-packed, exciting. Now, if only it were true.",8,7 August 2001,"Nice job by Costner, understated in performance, probably because he didn't direct. But I don't really want to review the movie, which is good; rather I'd like to correct the history.The actual destroyer USS Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr. (DD-850), which intercepted the Russian freighter Marucla during the blockade, was towed out of the naval museum in Fall River, Mass and put to sea under tow for this movie. Two different numbers were painted on her hull, port and starboard, so she could represent two different destroyers in the blockade for the film, and the DASH helicopter deck and ASROC were disguised because they were a post-1962 FRAM MK II conversion. I'm pretty involved with her, as an ex-crewman: I was the CIC and Intelligence officer from 1965-67. During my tour, there were still plenty of old salts around who had been on board during the blockade, and they told a different story than the world knows and the movie tells.Their story is that the JP Kennedy was nowhere near Cuba when the blockade was instituted, but rather off Bermuda (1000 nautical miles, more or less); and as the freighters bearing missiles approached the island, the rest of the Navy was ordered to stand down so the JP Kennedy, namesake of the President's brother, could steam toward the island at emergency flank speed using the ""war sprayer plates"" for the boilers, always kept in the Captain's safe, and be there for the photo op of making the first interception.
At least the movie properly lays the blame for the chaos of two messages from Krushchev squarely on JFK and RFK's stupid idea of leaking the Turkey missile exchange gambit to a sympathetic press. And lest we forget, Sen. Kenneth Keating (R-NY) had been screaming about missiles in Cuba the previous December, but it was hotly denied by the White House until weeks before a mid-term election the party in power was widely expected to lose. Never switch horses during a crisis, they say...Indeed, the world little knew how close it came to catastrophe to satisfy JFK's political ambitions.",Thirteen Days

107,coy_dog0,"Good script, acting, poor direction...",7,25 August 2004,"This film has an excellent, suspenseful, nuanced script, and two great actors (Bruce Greenwood and the other fellow playing Bobbie K.) that suck us into the tense 14 days (where'd they get '13' from?) that made up the Cuban missle crisis. Unfortunately, this film suffers from two huge weaknessess. The director is unsure of himself, beginning the film with a very awkward (and obviously CGI) shot of a jet flying over Cuba that could've been handled in a briefing room discussion with the President (thus giving us the same information, but sparing us the gaudy CGI effects; B-grade acting of the pilot and overall 'shoe-horned in' feel of the whole scene. If this story was part of 'West Wing', the latter would've been filmed, and the results would've been far classier).   Overall, the movie looks cheaply lit, and we are subjected to useless detours in Black & White that have NO pattern and serve NO purpose. All the scenes with Kevin Costner's family are useless and were probably added in by Costner as a way of 'fleshing out' his character. Speaking of Costner, he is the other thing that nearly ruins this otherwise fine film. The simple fact is this: Kevin Costner is not a good actor, and he never has been. His role in 13 Days is BY FAR the worst (or best?) example of this. His Boston accent is atrocious, and one can only sit back and admire an actor like Bruce Greenwood for not bursting out laughing every time Costner opens his mouth.   In all honesty, I don't know how this guy still gets work, let alone the starring role in a fair-sized budgeted film like this. I think he deserves to be on the same has-been list as John Travolta (no more $20 M for him!) and Sly Stallone. No one likes Kevin's acting, but he just keeps on trucking like everyone does.   Ah well, enjoy the script... 7/10",Thirteen Days
108,DrEbert,Simply brilliant,9,25 August 2001,"Anybody who says facts are boring has never seen ""Thirteen Days.""""Thirteen Days"" portrays the factual story of the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962, mostly through the eyes of Presidential Special Advisor Kenny O'Donnell. (It has been dramatized at some points, obviously.)There are many good things about this film. First, it has a fine cast and excellent performances. Anybody watching can figure out who is Kennedy and who is MacNamara and who is LeMay. Furthermore, unlike most movies, ""Thirteen Days"" does not spend the first half-hour setting up or creating a background. It just jumps right into the story. Kenny O'Donnell wakes up, eats breakfast, kisses his wife goodbye, goes to work, and BOOM! learns that there are Soviet missiles in Cuba.Third, once the 143-minute-film grabs you five minutes in, it does not let go until the very very end. It isn't edutainment. It is a high-stakes thriller that happens to be a true story.""Thirteen Days"" ought to be used to teach the Cuban Missile Crisis to students.The tagline for ""Thirteen Days"" is completely true.

The acting on thewhole is very good and the history was enough to be a grippingstory.

110,Spod-3,Historical thriller diluted by melodrama,6,14 May 2001,"If only this film had been made by someone else. It suffers from an excess of 'Costerism'. Here we have the President of the mighty U.S. of A. being told what to do by his assistant? I wonder what the real Kenny thought of being promoted to be the C-in-C's boss? This silliness detracts from the real drama being played out by the Kennedy duo, trying to stop the unpredictable Ruskies and prevent the mad generals from staging their own version of Dr. Strangelove. I rather doubt the accuracy of their portrayal too; they are a little too red-faced, blustering and over-the-top to be in a straight drama. I wish I'd liked this more, but these things just niggle all the way through.",Thirteen Days

112,jjs402,Was I the only one moved to tears by Thirteen Days?,9,2 February 2001,"I'll agree with the other comments about bad accents, great Bobby and John acting, perfect characterization of others (subtitles were unnecessary for me), slightly too long, etc. It's a very good movie and you should see it if you know about history and you _definitely_ should see it if you don't know about history.The thing that surprised me about the movie was that I broke into tears. Despite a personal reputation as a cold cynic, I do get moved by war drama -- the Midway torpedo bomber scene, the Gettysburg climax of Pickett's Charge -- but this was a nearly bloodless movie.I think it was a reminder (or first expression) of the horrible fear and paralyzing helplessness I felt as a 12 year old. I still remember the tone of voice of the teacher who told us to be sure to watch the President on TV that night. I think that's the most fear I had ever heard in an adult's voice. (She didn't know _what_ was wrong, but she sure knew _something_ was seriously wrong.)I would have expected more comments from people roughly the same age about their feelings at the time and how the movie renews those feelings. (I didn't get the same reaction from the excellent Guns of October with William Devane's tremendous John Kennedy with a dead-on accent.) Maybe I didn't cry at the time, but I was very afraid. It was good to release those 39 year old tears.",Thirteen Days
113,MovieCriticDave,A must-see for a master-class in American anti-diplomacy,8,4 January 2017,"There's little debate that no post-WWII conflict came closer to a true nuclear engagement than the Cuban missile crisis - and rarely does a film work so hard and succeed so thoroughly in telling such an historical tale with substantial historical accuracy as ""Thirteen Days.""Starring Bruce Greenwood as a phenomenally on-point John Kennedy, ""Days"" tells a gripping chronological tale of both official and unofficial diplomacy that turned the crisis from one of war to unmistakable American success. Aside from a pointlessly overblown and annoying part for Kevin Costner as Kenny O'Donnel, ""Days"" is a wonderfully constructed piece that otherwise strives for historical accuracy from the American discovery of the Soviet-backed missiles in Cuba, to the masterful lecture by Adlai Stevenson in the UN, to the ""unofficial"" diplomatic offer to retire antiquated Jupiter missiles from Europe in concert with a pledge not to invade the island nation. ""Days"" wavers a bit with the needless interposition of nuclear test footage and the infamous ""drop and cover"" civil defense drills of the era, presumably as a way to punctuate a necessarily introspective and narrative view of the diplomatic back-channels and administration in- fighting undertaken to overcome the crisis. And the principals work too hard to master their New England accents, of which Costner's is easily the worst. From an historical perspective, those involved during the crisis insist O'Donnell's role is drastically overblown, and clearly Costner's participation seems contrived and self-important. Fortunately, the deft direction Roger Donaldson keeps the viewer engaged with the broader epic and the ultimate focus on Kennedy's wisdom and leadership in it's resolution, guided by the book of the same title written by Ernest May. ""Days"" isn't your typical action-adventure thriller, with heroic stars rolling down mountains and firing machine guns at virtual bad guys, but considering it's very real undertones and the reality it depicts, it surely merits the attention of anyone who lived through the crisis, or those now enjoying the fruits of its resolution.",Thirteen Days
114,kennarb-23010,Thirteen days,4,13 February 2019,One personal experience from this movie is that I am related to John F Kennedy. One great scene from the movie was when that guy showed up to his sons football game and seeing how excited he was that is dad was there. The filmmaker is telling the us about war. He is also telling us how crazy things got in the office. I knew that there was a war going on in this time of history. This part of history is not something that excites me. I have not seen any other movies in this time period. There was nothing in this movie that made me question historical accuracy. I have not seen other movies by this director. I have not seen any of these actors in other movies either. I liked how they all came together and played a part.This is not a movie I would have watched outside of school.

The guys they chose for these roles looked eerily like the real thing! I was a little fuzzy on some of the others, as I was only 7 when these events actually happened.2) REALISM: The movie didn't try to turn JFK and his team into demi-gods who single handedly stopped the Soviets, nor did they make Khruschev and the Politburo into some Empire-like meanies.Problem:ACCENTS: People have criticized Kevin Costner for his alleged Boston accent (admittedly fair to poor), but I had a lot more problem with Greenwood as JFK.

Whether it worked exactly the way it is shown in the movie is beyond my knowledge, but the way that is highlighted in the movie will serve as a number one example about how to do a thriller whose ending is public knowledge without losing your audience from the word go. In fact it´s a nailbiting suspense movie that´ll keep you at the edges of your seats.Number 2: After all that facts and fiction about the Kennedys (thank you very much Oliver Stone!), we tend to forget how young these people actually were when they had been given the power to preserve or destroy the earth. ""Thirteen Days"" reminds one of these fact and that´s another reason why this films keeps holding you in its grip from start to finish.""Thirteen Days"" is not a Kevin-Costner-flic. The main function of his invented character (how much it basically is a supporting role becomes evident in the major crises scenes, where he has to take the back seets) seems to be the one scene when his wife mentions that not only the Kennedys but he himself was also bright, to which he responds with deeper insight, ""no not like them"", thereby gloryfying them once more. Maybe that´s why ""Thirteen Days"" ironically reminds one of why Mr. Costner was considered a major star and acting force in Hollywood once.",Thirteen Days

The movie is about the Cuban Missile Crisis. It shows what the government had to go through and the choices they had to make for the U.S. The historical accuracy is very good most of what happens in the movie were actual events that happened. Roger Donaldson is the director of this movie. He does a good job with the actors and how they act. Something that I didn't understand was when the movie would change form color to black and white through out the film. Other than that it was just an average movie to me.

119,princesss_buttercup3,Almost the end of civilization as we know it.,9,19 June 2008,"I watched this movie today with a number of students from my International Politics class, and from the standpoint of a politics professor, this film was absolutely extraordinary. This is a movie about the development of foreign policy in a crisis; it spells out with brilliant detail the decision-making process of JFK's inner circle, the tension between the Executive Office of the President and the Departments of State and Defense, and the attempts by the Military Industrial Complex (namely the Joint Chiefs) to undermine the diplomatic approaches favored by the president. It highlights the conflict between military standard operating procedures (""rules of engagement"") and the better judgment/common sense of right-thinking human beings. It hints at conspiracies to (later) depose and otherwise get rid of both Kennedy and Khruschev from within for what turned out to be a very unpopular resolution with the hardliners on both sides. I especially like that the movie acknowledged the humanity of the individual decision-makers without getting too Capra-esquire or preachy.I can see why this film hasn't been a great commercial success. It is not your standard big studio fare. It's quite cerebral, and although it has some exciting pre-conflict scenes, it's not a ""war film"". (It reminds me a bit of ""Three Kings"" in that regard- both films were, in my opinion, mis-marketed. They both seemed to target the younger male action crowd, when both movies are really made for a more intellectual audience.) I liked how the Soviets were not cartoonishly vilified, as is common in a lot of Cold War era films. They were shown to be somewhat calculating and strategic, but not irrational or more importantly, inhuman. In fact, one of the most fascinating parts of the film is the revelation that both sides lack information as to the other side's true intentions. It was this uncertainty that back in October 1962, could have led to the end of civilization as we know it.The acting was solid (Steven Culp was very, very good as Robert Kennedy- so good, in fact, that I'm afraid he'll have a hard time getting cast in the future. There was audible gasp in the audience when he came on the screen and WAS Bobby). Coaster's accent was actually annoying (as an earlier reviewer noted), but it's forgivable in light of the moving, somewhat understated performance he turns in. It is the directing that takes the cake, however. From the moment the chain of events was set in motion, the tension does NOT let up. It actually feels like you are back in 1962 living through the events of those two weeks- honestly, there was nary a moment to relax until the resolution was wrought. I recommend this film especially strongly to high school and college age students who are too young to have any Cold War memory, as well as to those who lived through the era and may have forgotten what it felt like to come this close.",Thirteen Days

Actors were chosen who actually closely resembled their real-life counterparts, and the props and sets were spot-on. The producers even traveled to the Philippines to shoot obsolete jets of the early 60s, redressed to look like US Navy. One minor portrayal that really suprised was the actress playing Jackie Kennedy. Looked like Jackie, and amazingly she was able to speak in Mrs. Kennedy's sultry voice. Highly worth watching.

I am especially scared because after seeing how well JFK handled it makes it scary to see what Trump would or would have done.I have seen many of these actors before.

I enjoyed meeting the protagonists. I liked to watch the personalities of the main players portrayed as expertly as they were, and we can all be happy there was John Kennedy in the White House at the time. I was particularly horrified at the political sentiment portrayed by his Republican detractors, who absolutely demanded a missile strike, armed response, and a war.Let's hope events don't ever repeat themselves with a White House containing the present Resident.

The actors to this movie I have never seen them in any other movies, but they were good actors. The actor who played John F Kennedy (Bruce Greenwood) played a good role and I think it fitted him well. I like how this movie was very historical and it represents a good depiction of how the United States was. This movie is good for learning about the Cuban missile crisis.

126,Sailor-21,Disappointing,5,19 February 2001,"I found 13 days disappointing.I was in my 20's during the Cuban Missile Crisis, and well remember what a riveting event it was.  Everybody at the time knew that the world was on the brink of nuclear war, and everybody breathed a very deep sigh of relief when it was over.  The world had been so terrifyingly close to the Apocalypse!We'll never knew exactly how the crisis was handled, in Washington and Moscow, but I'm fully prepared to give the late President Kennedy and Secretary Khruschev full marks for drawing us all back from the edge of the abyss.  It was a horrifyingly difficult crisis to deal with, as the US-USSR stance had been highly adversarial for decades, there was no direct communication between the US and USSR leadership at the time, and both sides had military complexes chomping at the bit for a resolution of the problem through military means.I didn't find ""13 Days"" a satisfying re-telling of the story.  I found the script, casting and editing weak, and the movie about half an hour too long. The top military men were presented as intemperate juveniles, and all the top military and political figures (with the exception of the O'Donnell character) were completely lacking in subtlety, gravitas and depth.  Others have commented on Costner's now-you-hear-it-now-you-don't accent.What made the Cuban Missile Crisis such a horror was that neither side knew what the other was thinking or would do.  The movie lacked all sense of that.The movie also didn't convey how very concerned all we ordinary folk were about the whole terrifying situation.I give it 5 out of 10.",Thirteen Days

Director is able to maintain dramatic tension, even though we know the outcome, by neat plot twists. Furthermore, these are the two most credible Kennedy brothers I have yet seen, and I wish the focus had been more on them.For what it's worth, I remember the time and I never for a moment thought that we were close to war, because the Soviets were too far out on the limb. But maybe I was wrong.",Thirteen Days
128,Viator Veritatis,Can't understand the hype,4,26 June 2015,"Frankly, I regard ""13 days"" more like a high-end television movie than a serious docudrama. It is a very American product; viewers unaccustomed to the clichés of standard Hollywood filmography are going to have a hard time swallowing the extremes of overdramatization saturating every single scene of the film. Everything is boosted up to keep the spectator on the edge indefinitely, which may appear as a merit to the American public but easily relapses in cheapness and bad taste to those used to a more thoughtful approach.The way the story and the characters are developed is also standard Hollywood fare, with the black-and-white presentation of Kennedy as a national hero soundly rooted in the values of family, motherland and hard work, who regards his office as the highest duty and finally overcomes the warmongering ambitions of the generals.Looks like being cynical, or simply realistic, is not allowed in American mainstream productions.Even worst, the director makes no attempt to convey a picture of the political situation underlying the crisis, or to offer (even for a moment) the viewpoint of the Soviets and the Cubans. On the contrary, the first half an hour suggests the idea that the United States were the victim of an unprovoked, unilateral aggression. This is junk history. The reasons why the Soviets deployed the missiles in Cuba were 1) to retaliate for the US deployment of about one hundred nuclear missiles in Turkey and 2) to protect Cuba, after the CIA-orchestrated landing at the Bay of Pigs and while the US were practicing invasion forces as a show of strength on islands in the Caribbean. This was perfectly known to the Kennedy administration, and certainly must have played a large part in the conversations on how to deal with the crisis.As a blockbuster ""13 days"" may have its merits, but as a serious historical movie it has a long way to go.",Thirteen Days
129,bk-87668,"Great, intense and accurate",9,13 October 2008,"I'm a bit partial on this since the Cold War is a favorite subject of mine. However, despite knowing the details and also the obvious fact world didn't end in the 1960s because of a global nuclear conflict, the movie kept a tight grip. It was not boring at all even if it's about politics and talk. In fact, I bet it works as a nice primer on the subject and it might even spark interest if shown to those who mostly learn of the subject from school books.What I love about this movie is that as far as I know it's very, very accurate (if you don't count some little details seen and that kind of nitpicking). Still, it's as intense as JFK (that I bet most people agree invents a lot of stuff to make it interesting) and has similarly very interesting characters and scenes.For example, I found it fascinating how the film showed people machinating and filtering facts behind the scenes (something that doesn't really come through when reading about it), this time for the *good* of mankind. A sane person will want to forget about some little aggressions - like bullet holes in a fighter jet - when any justified retaliation or accusation could escalate into millions of people dying in an instant. Maybe that exact thing didn't really happen but it is entirely believable and I thought gives some ideas how the personality and gut instinct of the guys in charge is what makes everything tick - not the official actions and reports.Now that I mentioned JFK: apart from Costner, the two films have something else in common: using black and white footage mixed with color footage - and I have to say in Thirteen Days it didn't really work. The b/w scenes (that fade in and out of color) add nothing. I think the purpose was to underline significant historical details but considering how accurate the movie is that's overkill. Thus they only managed to annoy me a bit. Still a very minor flaw and the only one.The acting was top notch, although I have to reiterate that for me, the whole mood, intensity and factual accuracy takes the cake. Overall, very, very good.P.S. For more ""guys in a room and deciding of the fates of millions of people"" goodness, check out the made-for-TV movie Conspiracy.",Thirteen Days
130,DCBlank-5,Feels like thirteen days...,4,6 December 2000,"Good movies out of events in recent history can be done - just look at ""Apollo 13."" Unfortunately, ""Thirteen Days"" fails to grip the viewer like ""Apollo 13."" The fault lies in Donaldson's overly dramatic direction coupled with restrained performances. The movie becomes much more interesting in its last half hour, but, alas, it is too late by this point. Perhaps in the hands of somebody like Ron Howard this one could have worked.",Thirteen Days
131,rbatty-3,"Gripping, tension-filled",9,13 January 2001,"In October 1962, I was 11 years old and a 6th grader at Nottingham Elementary School in Arlington, VA, a suburb of Washington DC.  I still recall the terror that swept the school as we were required to store Metriacal (sp?) and bottled water in our lockers and practice bomb drills by diving under our desks and huddling in the hallways.  We knew enough about politics and international affairs to know that DC would be the first city hit with missiles, even though I do recall it was one of the first times I ever rooted for New York to win anything!The movie did an excellent job of recapturing this terror.  While flawed by an inept effort to put a Boston accent on Kevin Costner, the trio of JFK, Bobby & Costner (Kenny O'Donnell) worked extremely well together.  Bruce Greenwood (Double Jeopardy) played a very believable JFK, while Steven Culp did a fine job playing a less-than-impressive RFK.  You really felt the tension that JFK must have lived as he was making some of the most critical decisions that any president has ever had to make.The old, tired, military brass and advisors did a fine collective job of trying to convince the `damn Kennedys' that we oughta bomb em back to the Stone Age.'  Curtis LeMay was as scary as I remember him, and there was an excellent shouting scene between Robert McNamara and a Navy admiral.The movie proved that, like Apollo 13, you CAN make a gripping movie even though you know how it begins and how it ends.  9 of 10 stars.",Thirteen Days
132,Simon-109,Brave beautiful film,9,2 February 2001,"One of the user wanders how much more interesting this film would have been had it showed the motivations of the Soviets for placing nuclear war heads in Cuba. I believe that, on the contrary, one of the greatest merits of this film resides in not doing so. This way Thirteen Days places the viewer in the same position of the protagonists of the missile crisis thus creating a wonderful deal of suspense and avoiding the temptation of making a political manifesto, this for pure cinematographical value. From the historical point of view Thirteen Days teaches the new generations, and reminds the old ones, how brave, valiant and invaluable for the survival of the civilization itself JFK's behavior was, for which the entire world (including Russians and Cubans) should and will ever be grateful. This is a legacy worth preserving. After so many years, who cares about the bad guys anyway?Living in a country that is currently under the threat of communism and under great influence of Castro's regime, I would certainly had loved to see Castro trashed in a Hollywood production, but this would have been a too easy way out for the scriptwriter and certainly would not had made a better movie.I give Thirteen Days 9 stars. One star less for Costner's annoying accent.",Thirteen Days
133,woodiphora,Good TV drama with well-directed dramatic tension and some fine performances ... and Kevin Cosner,7,18 February 2013,"A good movie, with some excellent performances. Bruce Greenwood is utterly believable as President Kennedy and was a bit of inspired casting, and Steven Culp makes an excellent Bobby Kennedy. The latter's performance deserves special mention, I feel, as Culp is otherwise a relative unknown, someone who has a long list of walk on parts in numerous TV series from The Cosby Show to Grey's Anatomy, yet is not exactly a familiar name or face.As a drama it is enjoyable to follow and achieves real dramatic tension during critical moments, which is a tricky act to pull off in any story when one already knows the end (if not, Google 'Cuban Missile Crisis'!)I was not left with an impression of having watched a high end movie, it left more of an impression of a high quality TV drama-documentary. In short I liked it! It kept my attention all the way through, and I'm someone who easily loses interest if I feel the quality of a movie is becoming suspect, or it is simply boringly told.Kevin Costner ... his performance is good, I suppose, but ... what is it about the man? Towards the end of the movie I get the feeling he's trying to steal the show. He simply a presidential adviser, but as the political tensions escalate I feel Cosner is forgetting that the movie is not about him, but about Kennedy, nucleur missiles and a key moment in world diplomatic history. He should stayed in the background and trusted the abilities of Greenwood, etc. to carry the drama to its conclusion.Or maybe this criticism should really be directed at the writers or director. However, maybe I'm overdoing the criticism. Costner's a big name. If he'd been an unknown in his first movie I'd be praising he to the heavens.All-in-all a movie I'd recommend to a friend as a memorable drama which will leave a good impression and even educate one a little bit.",Thirteen Days
134,deejtee,Showed me why I was glad to be a child at the time of the crisis.,7,24 February 2002,"An interesting story line (presumably largely based on history) but came across as a bit too much of another vehicle for Kevin Costner to be the man behind the throne (cf JFK).There were some interesting concepts of just how much of the 'buck stops here' with the person of the US President and the way he did/does/can control the military machine. However it quickly became a 'good JFK' and 'bad military' cliche.In my cinema the last reel was projected with the framing wrong, so we saw the bottom 20% of the frame at the TOP of the projected image and hence the top edge of the image was central screen. Suffice it to say that just about EVERY shot on that reel has a boom microphone bouncing around above the characters. At first I thought we were meant to be watching documentary footage with the news-crews filming the protaganists, but then I realised we were just watching unprofessional cinematography.I give it 5/10 - they tried and tried hard, but didn't really succeed.",Thirteen Days

136,jpd-5,Gripping Story of 13 Days on the brink of Nuclear War,2,15 January 2001,"Thirteen Days provides us with an eyewitness account of the Cuban Missile Crisis; the two-week period in 1962 when the US and the USSR came perilously close to the brink of nuclear war.  Overall, Thirteen Days is entertaining with a strong screenplay and dynamic cast.  Days will not appeal to everyone, as most of the action is through dialog, and the movie is lengthy, so an interest in history is a prerequisite. The film provides insight on the conversations that are historic and others that may have occurred between JFK, his advisors and the members of the cabinet.Bruce Geenwood is excellent as JFK.  His accent is perfect.  Steven Culp portrays a very believable Bobby Kennedy.  Kevin Costner is adequate as Kenny O'Donnell The inclusion of Adlai Stevenson's oratory to the UN is excellent, ""I am prepared to wait for the answer until Hell freezes over"".The story is faithful to history by Hollywood standards.  John Kennedy is portrayed as indecisive and uncertain.  The military cabinet is depicted as sinister and suspecting Kennedy of being weak.  Kennedy was often weak and indecisive. JFK was a popular President, but he was not a strong leader. The military leaders had good reason to suspect Kennedy of indecision and cowardice.  After all, JFK supported the Bay of Pigs invasion, sending 1500 US trained Cuban Exiles to invade Cuba - until it failed.  JFK  would not commit military forces to support the invasion or extract the men when the invasion failed and many men perished or were taken prisoner.The screenplay does make reference to the disdain the military establishment had for Joe Kennedy (JFK's father and former ambassador to England).  Joe Kennedy favored appeasing Hitler in the late 1930s and later was an unwitting participant in the Russian occupation of Europe.  Plus, the military regime would have also known the truth behind the PT-109 legend where JFK botched up, lost his boat and several crew members.Thirteen Days ignores the US (Kennedy's) culpability in the Cuban Missile Crisis.  The US supported a military invasion of Cuba in March 1961.  When this failed, several attempts were made on Castro's life.  Castro and his Soviet allies had good reason to suspect the US was preparing to overthrow Castro, and therefore place weapons in Cuba.  My Country's behavior was less than exemplary in the Kennedy - Johnson era. I believe a smattering of the dynamics of North American politics might help younger viewers understand the tension and policies of the era.The film accurately shows the disdain that JFK and RFK harbored for Adlai Stevenson.  Although, the film makers do not mention that JFK set up Adlai to lie to the United Nations about the bombing of Cuba preceding the Bay of Pigs.  The Kennedy Administration was promulgating the lie the U.S. was not involved.  Adlai was not given an accurate briefing until well after his presentation to the U.N.  He was furious.  There was animosity between the Kennedy's and Stevenson from that point onward until JFK's death.What didn't work:  I don't care for the black/white segments and the amount of time wasted on O'Donnell's family.  Costner is a great actor, but accents are not in his forte'.All in all, Thirteen Days is a great movie and well worth the price of admission.  It reminded me of WHY we had the ""Tuck and Duck"" drills for Nuclear war in the '60s.7/10",Thirteen Days
137,drjeff21,Good Movie But These Events were Not A Triumph For JFK,7,21 October 2020,"This is a well-acted movie the does capture the tensions during the Cuban missile crisis. To some degree it also shows JFK's fecklessness, but this was not a triumph for JFK; especially since the crisis was his fault. Yes, I said it was his fault. It was his provocations which caused the USSR to try to place missiles in Cuba the first place. First, there was the invasion of Cuba, which drew Castro closer to the USSR and his desire to have a deterrent to possible future invasions of Cuba. Second, JFK had missiles placed in Turkey, which served no other purpose than to put the US in a better position for a first strike against the USSR. JFK did not seem to understand that the actions of Cuba and the USSR were deterrents to his provocations. Also, even if missiles were placed in Cuba it would not have made much of a difference since the USSR had ICBM's and subs with nuclear weapons off the coast of the US with which they could strike the US whenever they desired.",Thirteen Days
138,tmcona-1,Wonderful Film,9,13 August 2007,"This movie is just outstanding. This is a wonderfully acted film with plenty of history. But at the same time it combines enough history and enough suspense to make it great. It does not bore you like some historical films do. With a wonderful script and great direction this film shines. But it would not be the same without the three main actors at the bill. Bruce Greenwood, Kevin Costner, and Steven Culp. These three performances are three of the best that I have seen in a while. I loved this film and if you like history and suspense you will to. Check it out. Bruce Greenwood is outstanding as President Kennedy, probably the best role of his career.

139,Barry Kruse,Mandatory viewing for every American,10,25 January 2001,"This film is very nearly perfect, and should be shown to every single American high school history class. It's riveting, and terrifying sending the most powerful message about cold war politics, and is dead accurate right down to the vintage Ovaltine bottle on the kitchen table.It certainly answer the big question: how important is it to have the most intelligent person you can as President of the United States. (I couldn't help thinking about George W. Bush during the film... how would he have reacted in this situation? Scary.)Costner is masterful, and his accent is just fine. (Do you want to see him speak the same way every single time? Open your hearts and minds, and suspend the fact that you saw Waterworld for just a moment.)Bruce Greenwood's performance is exemplary. He shows a JFK who is both supremely in charge, and extremely human, fallable in both character and confidence in his own leadership.There's nothing funny about any of this, and though I'm not old enough to remember the event, I am sure that it tells the inside story in a way that most people would never have known. I can imagine no time in the history of humanity where we were closer to extinction than these thirteen days. It is a deeply important message to learn.Directors: yes, please!!! More films like this, which unlike The Patriot and U-571 (decent films), tell real, true stories of our past and history. Our heroic forefathers, John Paul Jones, George Washington, Eddie Rickenbacher, etc. were certainly colorful enough!",Thirteen Days
140,Jackie-Kennedy,The mother of Political thrillers,10,6 November 2006,"As one with a long held interest in the life and times of JFK I had high hopes for this film. I am pleased to say I was not let down in any way. Thirteen Days is easily the best historical and political thriller to come about in a long time.The film of course centers around the events of the two weeks Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962. Through the eyes of Presidential aid Kenny O'Donnell, JFK himself and Bobby Kennedy it takes us through the Crisis from the moment the Missiles were spotted. It's real eye-opener because you can't believe how close we came to war.Although Kevin Costner has received some flak for his New England accent I have to say that anyone who focuses in on trivial matters like that is missing the point of the film. O'Donnell serves as guide through the world of JFK and Ex-Comm. Costner's portrayal is a perfect mix of business like and friendship. Through his eyes we see the intimate workings of government and learn a thing or two about loyalties.Personally though I think the movie belongs to Bruce Greenwood as JFK and Steven Culp as RFK. Greenwood, as the put upon President, is excellent. He looks the part (handsome and yet all business) and his accent is superb. He has Kennedy's various mannerisms and his habits of leaning a lot and sitting awkwardly to a tee. His JFK is shown as both a powerful leader and yet a vulnerable, exhausted and sick man.He carries the part like a true professional and I have yet to see a better Kennedy.Poor Steven Culp tends to get overlooked as Bobby Kennedy but in fact this is one of his finest performances. Again he looks, speaks and acts the part to perfection. He is youthful and energetic but yet a top politician and business man. The closeness between Bobby and Jack is also wonderfully shown through little meaningful looks and glances between Culp and Greenwood.The support cast are superb and the piece is historically accurate which is rare in film. There is suspense, action humor and strong remotion throughout. Hats off to a superb piece of film.",Thirteen Days

I always like True Story movies, and This one is among the best, the details of the events and the conversations makes it easy to understand the flow of the event, to think the world was horrifyingly close to a nuclear war.Few questions though... what accent did kevin costner was trying to do in his kenneth o'donnel character, because it didn't came out clear and often it comes and go.And what ever happen to that one last cargo ship that tried to run the blockade?

The movie was intense, heartbreaking, and though provoking. It showed what real presidential leadership is, something that we're lacking today. Kennedy was a very hands on President, he just didn't take the word of others, he wanted to find out for himself, which is the total opposite of what we have in our president today.Every life was sacred to him, that's why he did everything within his power to avoid going to war.

143,isbabo,Fascinating for anyone who finds the Cold War interesting,8,31 March 2005,"For anyone who finds movies about the Cold War interesting, this movie is great for you. It manages to bring to life the 13 Days in 1962 when the Soviet Union and the U.S came very close to nuclear war. It does take certain liberties in telling the story, especially when it comes to U.S missiles in Turkey (I won't say how, but pay attention to Bobby Kennedy's meeting the Ambassador from the USSR near the end). Costner is great except for his unfortunate New England accent (didn't we learn anything from Robin hood: Prince of Thieves....). There is also several times when the film fades to black and white for no apparent reason. However, it is a good, interesting movie and to see it now that communism in Europe is dead reminds the newer generation just how close we came. rent it.",Thirteen Days
144,gorillaz-96353,Steve's Film Page on Facebook,8,9 June 2017,"This is an interesting film. Thirteen Days is, at times, independent and rebellious of common Hollywood tropes. Other times, it panders to the general public. The film was good, but conceptually contradictory. The obvious issue of the infamous 'Kevin Costner accent' did not bother me so much and there are powerful performances among the supporting cast, certainly Steven Culp. Bruce Greenwood delivered a noticeably dedicated performance, albeit uniquely deviant. They used several gimmicks, such as slow-motion, black-and-white, and filtered shots. All of these are fine, assuming they are utilized tactfully. But all three in the same film? Simultaneously? It's a hat on a hat on a hat and was distracting from the better aspects of Thirteen Days. Overall, when a film makes choices indicative of wanting to separate itself from the norm, but then also contrived and uninspired choices, it leaves an impression of fear, an unwillingness to fully commit. The arbitrarily selective liberties this film took could have left it dangerously close to pot-boiler status. Thirteen Days falls just short of greatness because it just couldn't get out of its own way. 7.5/10 — ￼watching Thirteen Days (movie).",Thirteen Days
145,luttens,I was anxious to see this wonderful movie,10,1 April 2002,"It was a pleasant summer day on the Bulgarian coast. The year was 1962. Two men were walking along the seaside near the wonderful Palace of Evksinograd, near the town of Varna talking to each other. The Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev and his Bulgarian partner and colleague Todor Zhivkov had a lot to discuss... Probably at that moment the Soviet leader for the very first time mentioned that he had intention to deploy medium range ballistic missiles in his new ally Cuba. No one can say exactly how it all began, but many say that Todor Zhivkov unsuccessfully tried to persuade Khrushchev not to do so... The rest of the story is very well known. The movie Thirteen Days appeared in Bulgaria in 2001. Almost no one saw it and that`s pitty. Once again Kevin Costner stars in a realistic and even shocking political film, which, in my opinion stands along with the classic JFK. And both movies are closely connected. I was delighted to see this masterpiece and a month ago I bought it on a video tape. Probably the most important lesson one can learn from it is that the Greatb Powers are closely connected, much more than officially admitted. And we, the common people on the Planet, will never be aware of what really happens on  the Great Stage of World Politics!",Thirteen Days

Film shows what was happening in white house during the crisis. Even if the film is basically meetings in cabinets, it still was interesting to watch. Although there were a few well made scenes of recon planes flying over Cuba. There are two stupid things in the movie. First is the stupid accent of Costner. And the other was the length.

People were on the brink of falling apart due to the fear they were experiencing fueled by various sources. In a way this crisis, like any other crisis, gave way to intensive political theater which further made people totally freak out. This movie properly illustrates the tension of these days and the affects on the officials' families as well as the surrounding citizenry.With all that said, I do wish this movie had paid more attention to the general ambiance of the nation rather than the struggles and actions of government officials.The movie has a taut, flat style, which may be appropriate for the events narrated, but it was still a bit boring in my opinion.Overall, decent movie, sufficient explosions.",Thirteen Days

149,fanny92,"Lots of Talk, But Intense",8,13 March 2019,"I've never really known a lot about the Cold War, besides it being mentioned, and when I did learn about it in my history class, it wasn't taught in very much detail. Watching this movie helped me to understand what was happening during it a little bit more. This movie is mainly focused on the Cuban Missile Crisis, so just a part of the Cold War, but it still helped me understand it better and be able to visualize what was going on. This was a great movie. It was well acted, and I liked the scenes with President Kennedy and Kenny O'Donnell. It was interesting to see how they interacted and to see what they were like under such great pressure.
Again, the movie is about the Cuban Missile Crisis. It follows the president of the United States and members of Congress and shows what they went through to solve the missile crisis.
Like I said, I did not know much about the Cold War and I did not know anything about the Cuban Missile Crisis before I watched this movie. Even while I was watching the movie, I didn't quite understand everything that was going on, but I still really enjoyed it. I just really like history even when it's confusing. This movie was a lot of talk and not a lot of action, but it had the action feel to it because of the intense situation that everyone in the movie was working to try and resolve.
This movie was directed by Roger Donaldson. I haven't seen any of his other movies. The main actors in this movie are Kevin Costner, Bruce Greenwood, and Steven Culp. I'm not familiar with Greenwood and Culp, but I have seen other movies with Kevin Costner in them. I think he is fun to watch in movies and is a good actor. My favorite scene in this movie was when the airplanes were flown over Cuba and they took pictures of the missiles. It was a really quick scene, but it was intense and interesting to watch.
I feel like a lot of people don't like movies that are mostly talk and they probably find them boring, but I like movies like that that are history related. They really interest me, even when I don't understand them, which is probably weird, but I do. I really liked this movie. It was interesting to me to see how everyone in congress working on the Cuban Missile Crisis interacted and the different opinions on how things should be done.

150,Plisko-52,***1/2 and A Oscar Contender,9,6 December 2000,"I just saw Thirteen Days at an advanced screening at CSU. This is a great movie that should be seen by everyone. It makes you appreciate being an American and more importantly a human being. It isn't the feel-good movie of the year, but instead a realistic look into one of the most darkest, most tense times in the history of the world.The key for this movie to be a successful one was to be realistic. It did not include any false events that would stray from what the Cuban missile crisis actually was. We all know how it ends, and I was hoping that Donaldson would not imagine a more intense ending and include that in his film. Though the ending of the crisis was far too close for comfort, Donaldson keeps it real, instead of more exciting. In most movies, the detonator is disarmed with a few seconds left on the clock. In the missile crisis it was a day or so until destruction, and that is still plenty of time to leave you shaking.The acting is great. Costner gives his best performance of the last 10 years ( I don't know if that is saying much) and JFK and ESPECIALLY RFK are portrayed wonderfully. This movie, through great acting and story-telling, paints a picture that serves as a great history lesson, as well as great entertainment.",Thirteen Days
151,thellers,A fairly solid political drama,8,29 May 2003,"Thirteen Days isn't for everyone. If you're not into political dramas then you're not going to like it, because it's a down-the-line, hardcore, plain-and-simple political drama. There's little character devlopment surrounding the momentous characters (nor is any really necessary), and there's not much action beyond a U2 spy plane getting shot down.If like me, however, you have a passing interest in the Kennedy administration and the whole 'Missiles of October' incident, then this movie is definitely worth a look. The whole thing is very well made, well acted and sleek. Having watched some of the older Kennedy movies, it's nice to see the high-sheen finish of a modern Hollywood production being put to use on this subject matter.Costner's had a hard time at the box office lately, this movie included. However, he does a sterling job here as Kenneth P. O'Donnell. Actually, his entire role was relatively needless, and he got more screen time than necessary for his character. However, he played the part very well throughout, apart from a slightly shaky Boston accent.Bruce Greenwood is a great actor. He manages to be pretty convincing as JFK, even though he doesn't sound like the former president one bit. Whether it was a conscious decision not to try to mock up the unmistakable JFK accent, or whether Greenwood simply didn't pull it off, I don't know, but the performance doesn't suffer too much. Greenwood's voice is far deeper than JFK's too, so Greenwood automatically comes across as more brooding and moody. The other approach would have been to concentrate on JFK's voice, the accent, the right-fist-clenched hand gestures, the upturned top lip... that's precisely the way Martin Sheen approached the part in ""Kennedy"" (1983). Sheen's performance was uncanny (truly, truly uncanny), but sometimes felt a little like a ""caricature"". Greenwood's performance is the opposite -- much more subtle and less ""hammy"", but essentially less accurate too.For me, Steven Culp as Bobby Kennedy is the best all-rounder in this movie. His acting is great, and he looks and sounds the part too, mananging to do the Kennedy accent without ever sounding like a self-caricature. This is Culp's second outing as RFK, having played the Attorney General in a low-budget TV effort about Marilyn Monroe a few years beforehand. He really does a great job here... full marks!So, all round, this is a well-made, well-acted and historically accurate political drama. I'm going to give it a 7.5 out of 10.",Thirteen Days

It wouldn't be fair to say it was a terrible movie, because I didn't pay attention the entire time, but when I did, it was more boring than anything. The plot of this movie was the Cold War. I know that the Cold War was the most dangerous times in world history, as we could've gone into a nuclear war and died. This movie was directed by Roger Donaldson. I liked how the movie was pretty informative about the Cold War as before watching this movie I knew absolutely nothing about it. I just didn't like the movie overall.

It has a lot of great information, and it shows what lots of these polititions and what America has to go through during the Cold War. But I do am not the type of person who wants to be informed, during entertainment. The problem I had with this movie is before even watching the movie I generally knew what was going to happen. I knew that the U.S was not going to go to war with the Soviet Union, so that takes out the eximente of surprise as we all know nothing is really going to happen. I also did not like that the actor playing JFK didn't talk like JFK he sounded completely different. The positive I can find in this movie is that It really shows how worried everybody was and makes me great full that i don't have to deal with that worry of other countries starting a war and bombing the us (at least not as big of a worry)",Thirteen Days

He makes great sports movies, but in most other things I get the feeling he's out of his normal water.  Especially when he's trying to do an accent.  But he was good!  I actually didn't mind him trying the Kennedy-speak, and except for that one big clunker in the beginning (hide behind something heavy), it wasn't distracting.Bruce Greenwood does an excellent as JFK, and Steven Culp as Bobby is almost as impressive.

Examples:  Costner's character overdoing it when worried about his family - not that he wouldn't have been mind you - it just seem contrived and I found myself wishing they would get back to the real story.I found the first 1.5 hrs pretty riveting but found it just dragged on after that - partly i guess because we know how it ends.When it was done I found myself thinking I would have much rather watched a good documentary on the subject on the History Channel.6/10",Thirteen Days
157,billk51,Time at last to tell the true story of the Cuban Missile Crisis?,7,1 July 2011,"Now that we are removed almost 50 years from this event, can we at last give the straightforward account of the Cuban Missle Crisis.In 1961 the United States moved one hundred Intermediate Range Ballastic Missiles onto the territory of its allies Turkey and Italy. These missiles could strike Moscow with nuclear warheads on very short notice.The Soviet Union, not being pleased by this, countered by moving intermediate range ballistic missiles into its ally Cuba, where they could strike Washington on short notice.The United States showed outrage at this provocative policy without drawing the obvious comparison with the US missiles in Turkey and Italy, except to getting around to saying that the missiles were obsolete anyway one year after being deployed. The US threatened to attack the missiles in Cuba and then invade.This supposedly would move us to the brink of mutual nuclear annihilation. But given the reasonable sanity of our government (except for Gen. Curtis Lemay, the mass murderer of millions of Japanese women and children in WWII), would this have actually happened? Someone would have pulled back from the brink at the cost of looking weak. This someone turned out to be the ""stupid peasant"" leader of the USSR Nikita Khrushchev, who arranged a back door deal to break the deadlock.What the deal came down to really required brilliance: the Russians would remove the missiles from Cuba and the US would remove the missiles from Turkey (which were obsolete, you recall). But the removal of the Turkish missiles was not to be made public. Instead it would be said that the missiles were being removed because the US promised never to invade Cuba. As if a diplomatic promise between two enemies was ever good for anything.So the hero turns out to be stupid Khrushchev, who appeared to be making the bargain of a weak fool, but did not let that stop him from preventing the destruction of the world.",Thirteen Days
158,torijohn33,twelve days,7,13 February 2019,"One personal experience is my friend says shes distantly related to John F. Kennedy. One great scene would have to be the ending when they accomplish what they wanted, everything went well and they had a good claim against the USSR. The movie has a great set back and shows what they did to accomplish these things against the Soviet and doing it without a lot of errors. This part of history i feel has had a lot of world problems and everyone wanted to bomb places. This was the closest they got to a nuclear war, so it was a pretty intense time. The movie showed good history of the time and really let the audience have an intake on this time from the past. This time in history only makes me question, why does everything have to be solved by war and domination? To this day we have military out. I have not seen any other movies by this director besides this one. I´ve seen some other movies with the same actors in this movie but i´m not too sure. I liked how it really showed the struggles and how close they got to a nuclear war. Its not that i didnt like anything but im not a big fan of these types of movies. If any of my friends needed to learn about any of this then yes i would recommend this movie to them. This movie was pretty good and showed the true history of that time period",Thirteen Days

This fascinating thrilling film gives an insight into the bluff and couterbluff of the American President John F Kennedy trying his best to avoid war, while the military were doing their best to go to war. This film follows Kenny O'Donnell (Kevin Costner) who is John F Kennedy's Political adviser. However I must stress this is not just a Costner film, Bruce Greenwood playing John F Kennedy is a match for Costner We are here so we know the outcome, but this film is gripping . How much of this is truth or exaggerated  for fimllmatic reasons I do not know, but It has put a question mark, about John F Kennedy's death. A real must see film.",Thirteen Days

I usually enjoy historical movies and what events they are based off of. I have a harder time watching politician based movies, but that is just my opinion. The movie was going by very fast kind of skimming over what was happening during that time period. The only thing that I understood was who is who and a general idea of the events that described in the movie.",Thirteen Days
163,ayelver,A real life Tom Clancy novel,7,16 January 2001,"`13 Days' is the story of how the White House dealt with the Cuban Missile Crisis.  Usually when I write about a film I try to avoid revealing much about the movie.  I will deviate from this rule a little for this movie because I hope that all of you are somewhat aware of how the story unfolds. `13 Days' stars Kevin Costner as Kenneth O'Donnell, special assistant to President Kennedy during the crisis.  It is the story of how O'Donnell, JFK, RFK, and others made crucial decisions as missile crisis unfolded. All the actors do an excellent job (although Costner's `Bawstan' accent is distracting at first, I laughed whenever he said `Cuber' which was often) and the pacing and production values are top notch. The plot unfolds on many levels and the tension mounts creating a real life Tom Clancy novel.  The two air combat scenes are fantastic. The film succeeds wonderfully as a piece of entertainment.  It is not too simple and only rarely is melodramatic. In its portrayal of actual events the film is somewhat less successful.  I am no Kennedy fan to say the least and cult that has developed around the whole Kennedy family perplexes me.  I was sure this movie would be nothing more than the next step on the road to JFK's deification.  I was surprised to find it fairly even handed in its treatment of the issues involved.  It presents effectively how serious the actions of the Soviet Union were, the worldwide climate at the time and the lack faith in Kenendy after the Bay of Pigs.  It also shows what a political animal Kennedy was and makes a joke of how in debt he was to Daley (echoes of current events). Like all historical films this one simplifies a great deal and there are many actions attributed incorrectly to Costner's character to make the film work.  Also this movie is another in the long line of films that portray top generals as war hungry dogs that must be kept on a tight leash.  I get sick of military leaders being portrayed as trigger-happy cowboys and the scenes where Costner tells individual pilots to lie to their leaders are just silly.  The film however highlights the importance of a civilian controlled military and it celebrates the soldiers who risked their lives during the crisis.  There are problems with accuracy but this is not work of fiction like `Hurricane' or `The Cradle Will Rock.' This film also raises the issue of faith.  The movie is full of religious images and at one point Costner even prays for peace (showing there are no atheist in foxholes or life rafts).  It seems odd when in the end all the credit is given to `men of goodwill.' Having said all this I believe this is a valuable film.  Any movie that celebrates national service both in the military and in public office cannot be all bad.  Also in the era of revisionist history it is encouraging to see a film that highlights the serious nature of the communist threat at that time.  It has become fashionable to argue that communist world domination was never a possibility. It is also refreshing to see a President willing to draw a line in the sand when the nation is threatened.  While I had some problems with this film it is highly entertaining and any movie that is thrilling while dealing in serious way with such events is quite an achievement in today's Hollywood.",Thirteen Days
164,mikeysazulita,Excellent,10,20 July 2001,"This movie was excellent.  I know some people are going to disagree with the historical events in this film and how they portray the President and his cabinet to be saints, but think of the story.  Could there be a more thrilling plot?  The U.S. and the Soviet Union in a face-off that could have resulted in World War III and the end of the free world as we (now) know it! Oh, and it REALLY happened.  Mind-blowing, isn't it?",Thirteen Days
165,earlgreyi,Costner's character ruins it,5,11 January 2004,"Costner's character is completely unbelieveable. The character comes off as showing almost no respect for the presidency, instead the president appears to be practically a puppet in his hands. It reeks of vanity from Costner's side.While there were three major sides involved - USA, Soviet Union and Cuba - even though Thirteen Days is 2.5 hours long the Soviet and the Cuban side of the story is never shown, the movie focuses exclusively on the US. What motivated the Soviet and Cuban leadership? How did they react during the crisis? Surely it would have been interesting to get a glimpse of that.In the end Thirteen Days is part documentary - with the usual liberties taken with regard to the truth - and part propaganda. Quite silly considering that the cold war has been over for a long time now.",Thirteen Days
166,Avenge85,"Honest cinematography, story and acting.",7,13 May 2003,"When I heard that Mr Costner was making a film about the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis - I was terrified, more terrified than if a Nuclear ICBM was 80 miles from my home. I was expecting Costner to assume the lead role of President John Kennedy - I was wrong. Mr Costner handed that role to Bruce Greenwood (a fine choice for his voice alone,) and became Kenny O'Donnell - special aide to the president (a little similar to his role in JFK.) This film unlike many other Hollywood adaptations (Cough 'U-571' Cough) was fairly historically accurate and presented at a steady, unrushed pace. I misjudged this film before seeing it.The reels of celluloid arrived at cinemas gradually, sticking around for merely a week or so. This film had a target audience - those with an interest in historical events and their consequences, no those who went to see Hanks in 'Apollo 13' hoping for action but instead getting three hours of grey suits, grey expressions and grey acting. This film too is predominately grey (the colour of 1960s politics,) and if you don't like it - tough. This film is a drama to be shown in History classes globally for content - not to be converted into mugs and fluffy pyjamas with matching trading cards. This review may appear to poke fun at America - this is not the case, it highlighted how the UNITED States were and can still be, if only they settled for reality instead of enforcing artificiality upon the world - a world which in October 1962 we almost lost.Watch this film, try to enjoy it, remember it is not - nor never was it intended to be a huge Box-Office smash - just a truthful preservation of the facts which all too many are keen to forget.",Thirteen Days

Their appearance and accents are so genuine, you'd think you're actually watching the President and his brother.Don't worry though.

169,TCentea,"A gripping, intense, thoroughly fascinating movie.",10,12 January 2001,"One of the best movies of the last few months, it's a fascinating view at the Cuban missile crisis. The performances are solid all around, with special mention to Bruce Greenwood for a perfect JFK. The content is also very interesting, and the great thing is that even though you know the final ending of the crisis, most of us probably don't know all the twists, turns and details, and this makes this movie even more interesting. Also, there are some sequences that are very intense and gripping, even more so that in many fictional thrillers or action movies, and some great air and naval military sequences (my favorite is the low-altitude run by the two Thunderchiefs - breathtaking...). Also, a great thing about this movie is that it actually involves you in the story and makes you become interested about the characters and the story, and that's pretty rare for a movie.
A word of advice though: this is NOT an action movie. It's long, it's mature and it's mostly talk, so younger children will not be interested. But the dialogue is fascinating, the direction is brilliant, and the story is real (after seeing the movie, I find this very unsettling), so if you're in the least interested to see a good movie, and have alreay seen Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, see this movie.",Thirteen Days

As I watched the movie, I couldn't help but speculate how more recent chief executives would have handled what JFK faced.Also, from the perspective of seeing the film in Uruguay, a country where many are sympathetic to Castro, ""Thirteen Days"" may provide people here with a better understanding of why many Northamericans have negative feelings about the man.  After all, he was apparently prepared to blow us all up.",Thirteen Days
172,srella,Quick decisions at the end of the world,7,4 December 2001,"Do you have any idea how close the United States was to nuclear war? Watch Thirteen Days, and you'll get a better idea. Thirteen Days is the story of how the Kennedy brothers avoided war and created enemies during the Cuban missile crisis. While the entire U.S. military -- and most of President Kennedy's staff -- wanted the United States to strike Cuba and enter into war with Russia, President Kennedy, Bobby Kennedy, and Kenny O'Donnell, their political advisor, decided to wait. It is a chilling two and a half hours of drama, showing that tense dialogue -- not special effects -- are really the way to make an audience squirm. Perhaps the most tense moment of the film is when the United States starts a blockade, preparing to search all Russian ships that are heading toward Cuba. Without live television feeds, satellite imagery, or even direct contact with the American ships, the President and his Chiefs of Staff have to sit around and wait to hear what happens. It was chilling.Although the storyline is magnificent, the acting leaves something to be desired. Kevin Costner, as O'Donnell, has what is probably the most horrendous Boston accent since Rob Morrow in Last Dance. it is silly, it is ridiculous, and it takes all your focus away from what he's actually saying. Sometimes, the accent sounds like a bizarre hybrid between Bostonian and southern. The only explanation I could come up with was that maybe Costner still thought he was in JFK. Or wished he was. Bruce Greenwood as President John Kennedy also suffers from a less-than-par Boston accent. But what is worse, he captures very little of the Kennedy mystique. He seems too old, too straight-laced, to play the free-wheeling president that changed everyone's perceptions of the White House. More Ronald Reagan than Jack Kennedy, Greenwood seemed not worth all the hype that was surrounding his performance. Almost making up for both these poor performances is Steven Culp as Bobby Kennedy. Perhaps benefitting from previous practice (he played Bobby in 1996's Norma Jean and Marilyn), Culp is absolutely perfect as the attorney general, from the Boston accent right down to the floppy hair. He had the charisma, the looks, and even the brazen, mildly obnoxious personality right down to a T. Thirteen Days, which glides through two hours and fifteen minutes effortlessly, unfortunately runs out of steam right at the end. It's almost as if the writers and directors can't explain how we survived this ordeal. Maybe that's the problem. Perhaps Thirteen Days suffers most from a storyline that is, at its heart, still too scary, too unfathomable, for us to fully express.",Thirteen Days

One should be advised that it is not a historical documentary. It is a movie from the likes a few solid people who put it together and made it happen. I enjoyed it I really made me go back in time to that date! What would I have done? Well I would agree that nuclear weapons have no place to be used in warfare or against others.

While Kennedy's military advisors prefer an attack of the island to get rid of the nuclear missiles, J.F.K, his brother Robert and his advisor soon realize that an act of agression against Cuba would inevitably lead to a nuclear world war. Thirteen Days is an excellent movie which has a lot of action on the psychological level and remains gripping although most of the action is set in conference rooms within the White House. The actors are not overly brilliant, but the script is. You have to credit the film also for its ideological neutrality. You won't find any ""the US is the most powerful nation on earth"" crap, but rather a strong appeal against nuclear insanity and the intelligent insight, that the solution of the crisis was a victory both for the Soviet Union and the United States.",Thirteen Days

179,saintpauliboy,Why you should see this film.,8,9 August 2001,"`Thirteen Days' is a fine film.Whew!   It's not often I can write that about a film starring Kevin Costner, especially the past several years.     And that's because, despite his character's prominent movie role (larger than the historical facts dictate, but that's something that typically only bothers history buffs), his work is overshadowed by a group of actors who give absolutely wonderful performances.Other reader comments dwell on the facts surrounding the crisis, so I won't go there.  I'll simply highlight why you should see this movie.First, the acting.    Bruce Greenwood's JFK was just plain remarkable.   His accent was perfect  natural, present, yet not distracting nor over-the-top (like Costner's).    His mannerisms, expressions, and gestures truly captured the President's.    In fact, the entire cabinet gave one of the best ensemble acting performances I've ever seen.   Just splendid! Costner, while adequate, was completely overshadowed by his cast-mates.   So don't go to see him - go to see everyone else.Second, the story.    This movie does a great job of showing just how intricate and complicated the situation was, and how frequently it changed.   Each individual event that made up the missile crisis created new options, new scenarios, and new decisions for the President.    The tension that results is wonderful.  As opposed to so many films that require explosions, gunfire, car chases, and sex to create drama, this one uses true human drama  and does it quite well. What about the film didn't I like?    Well, Kenny O'Donnell's role in the crisis was certainly inflated, and he spoke to the Kennedys as if he was lecturing them instead of giving an opinion.   While inflated roles aren't new to Hollywood depictions of historical events, it wasn't necessary in this film.   I'm impressed that Costner took a back-seat role (vs. taking on JFK).    It would have been even more impressive had his character been perhaps a bit less the `hero behind the scenes'.   A tone-down job would have helped a great deal...though not a big deal considering the entire film's excellence.      Also, the JFK role was written in a way that was a bit overly sympathetic, but that's also a relatively minor quabble.  
Considering how often Hollywood incorporates formula into it's historical movies (such as the fictional love stories in `Titanic' and `Pearl Harbor'), it's refreshing to see a film like `Thirteen Days'.    It's an excellent film overall, worth seeing just to witness the performances of ensemble. Just shows us that sometimes there's a big difference between `fine actor' and `movie star'.",Thirteen Days

Robert F. Kennedy, Thirteen Days: A Memoir of the Cuban Missile Crisis
Thirteen days is about the cold war. The director is Roger Donaldson. Some actors are Kevin Costnor,Bruce Greenwood,Steven Culp, Frank Wood, This movie was alright. There are many scenes in which you'll fall asleep. But I guess if you're interested in war movies without any action this movie is for you. I did have some pretty cool actors. Over all I'd rather watch paint dry.",Thirteen Days
181,Bradford,"Excellent movie, with one annoyingly recurring technical flaw.",8,6 February 2001,"I found this to be an excellent film.  Costner's accent was not a problem for me.  For the record, I was six years old when the events of this film occurred, and I do recall taking part in air-raid drills at school.  I thought at the time that it was just part of going to school.  Anyway, I liked the focus on Costner's character, rather than on the Kennedys, because they've been overdone in other films and television programs.  I liked that the focus was on the crisis, and not on JFK's private life.  My one problem with the film was the number of times that the boom mike was in the shot. It had to be at least a half-dozen times, and it got to be distracting. Other members of the audience also made comments about it.  It even happened once during a close shot between Costner and Lucinda Jenney, who played his wife (later in the movie, when he comes home late at night).  I've never seen sloppier operation of a boom.",Thirteen Days
182,X-9er,When will they quit making these movies??,9,5 December 2000,"Costner, as usual, is awful. Bruce Greenwood, as usual, is excellent. But this film is about the story, right?Portrayed as a thriller, political suspense, drama, etc., but it's a story of something that happened 38 years ago and everyone knows what happened.Okay, not everyone. Most of the college students I had the (dubious) honor of watching this film with didn't have a clue about the Cuban Missile Crisis. Most probably didn't know that Kennedy was president in 1962. But this film wasn't aimed (no pun intended) at them. It was too slowly-paced and ""mature"" for kids who want sex, blood, and guts. So they quickly became restless and missed out on the decent history lesson.However, for boomers and those who paid attention in history class, this film won't have you on the edge of your seat. Is MAD coming? Well, what do you think?That isn't to say it wasn't 'enjoyable.' I'm just awfully glad I didn't hand over ten bucks to see it.",Thirteen Days
183,RichardU,Made for TV,5,26 August 2001,"This movie reeked of an amateurish quality that began with Costner's accent and was constantly reinforced by a heavy-handed soundtrack. Screenwriting 101 says show, don't tell the drama. ""Apollo 13"" did a good job of showing the drama even though we already knew the outcome. Regrettably, ""Thirteen Days"" kept telling us over and over, mostly with reaction shots of Mushmouth (Costner). The footage of him looking concerned, worried, etc. put this film so far beyond two hours, you'll wonder if Thirteen Days is how long it takes to see this film.",Thirteen Days
184,jer33_3,"Powerful, brink of war drama",10,5 October 2002,"This movie is what every movie should be. Incredible acting, great directing, brilliant screenplay. I was impressed by how accurate it was to the real story. David Self must have done his homework on the Cuban Missile Crisis when he wrote this script. The casting was practically flawless. The only small set back was Bruce Greenwood as JFK. Not because anything in his performance was lacking, but just because he didn't seem to put a great deal of effort into the Boston accent. Most of the time it was quite obvious that he was a Canadian trying to fake a Boston accent, but this is so trivial that it has no effect on the movie. Even down to the small supporting performances this movie was very well acted. The only performance I didn't care for was a guy with only two lines and who really cares about that. The highlight of this movie was Steven Culp as Bobby Kennedy. His performance was subtle, but brilliant. I firmly believe that he deserved the Academy awards for best supporting actor. Him not even getting a nomination is the biggest robbery since Citizen Kane lost Best Picture. Dylan Baker as Robert McNamara was another highlight. I had no clue who the heck he was the first time I saw this movie, but I walked away praising his performance. Kevin Costner gave a great performance, but it's overshadowed by the supporting performances.Just like Tora! Tora! Tora! Thirteen Days proves that you can have a completely historically accurate film, without any dramatization or Hollywood-ization, and still make it entertaining and brilliant.

The war hawks in the administration along with those with the same sentiment on Khrushchev's side kept ratcheting up their desire to go to war.After JFK was murdered, Khruschev mentioned that the chance of the Cold War ending died with JFK.I have loved this movie since its first release and enjoy watching it still today.

186,cincinnaticobra,Some flaws but Entertaining,7,17 April 2004,"This movie about the Kennedy Administration during the Cuban Missile Crisis is flawed, but is still entertaining. First there is Kevin Costner's role as Special assistant Kenny O'Donnell. Costner gets way too much screen time. He got much more than the President and other important figures. Then there is costner's accent. Some people think that his Boston accent for the part is terrible. What I found more interesting was that sometimes Costner spoke with an accent, and sometimes he didn't seem to have one at all!Vice-President Lyndon Johnson was made out to be just a dumb hick. Even Johnson's detractors will admit that he certainly wasn't dumb. The Adlai Stevenson (United Nations Representative)character wasn't anything the real person either. They made him out to be way too much of a wimp.
Another flaw was that on more than one occasion you could actually see the voice boom boxes (or whatever they are called)that record what the actors are saying, at the top of the picture. Seldom do you actually see this in a movie. So there was some bad editing. I saw this movie in the theatre and wonder if it was edited out of the videotapes and DVDs.Still, the movie was entertaining. It was for the most part historically accurrate. There wasn't any of the Oliver Stone made up crap in this movie. You really got the feel of the pressure that everyone was under.
Besides Costner, the acting was very good.  In this kind of movie, there is often a lot of overacting, but in this movie it was just right.
This movie had a good pace and had some interesting twists. I give it a 7 out of 10.",Thirteen Days
187,mjknight,"Excellent, historically accurate film about Cuban Missle Crisis",9,6 August 2005,I really enjoyed this portrayal of the inner-workings of the Kennedy White House during this pivotal time in American History. Costner's chowda accent is a bit over-the-top and tough to get used to during the first few minutes of the film but that's the only critique I really have of this fine film. Costner's portrayal of Kenny O'Donnell as the President's bulldog as Appointments Secretary is right on and the other actors portraying the members of the Ex Comm during the crisis are quite believable and effective in portraying the hawkish preferences of many of the members of the government's brain trust as the crisis unfolded. I watched on DVD in order to rewind and review certain parts of the film.,Thirteen Days
188,aarneai,It's Good,7,17 October 2018,"Having an interest in this period of time I was excited to learn about Thirteen Days. Indeed, I had never heard of it before and seeing the cast I have to say that I was a little surprised. However, now having seen it, I'm glad I stumbled across this film. While it's not amazing it is certainly very well made and represents the graveness of the situation brilliantly.The most impressive thing was how reasonably Donaldson handled showing the Cuban missile crisis and the US politics surrounding it. I think that it would be rather easy to let things get completely out of hand and thus the movie would end being mostly a mess. Either you make it action oriented or focus completely on politics. Donaldson did the latter and made it work. While most of the movie is people sitting in rooms talking - as one can imagine - there are also small action sequences sprinkled in which add some excitement, keeping the film always flowing. Perhaps it was thanks to the rather excellent cast or the great writing but the talking never gets boring. In fact, I wouldn't have minded seeing more of it.Now, having said what I said in the last paragraph one might imagine me giving Thirteen Days a higher rating. This brings me to my biggest flaw in the film. There is just something unexplainable missing. I can't figure out what it is but I just felt like there was always something missing. Had it not been for that, I think that this could easily be one of the best political movies out there. There are no flaws and everything that this film does, it does very well. I just felt like I was wanting something more for almost the entire runtime.Thirteen Days is definitely a good film and if you are interested in the Cold War or how Kennedy and co handled it, I would highly recommend seeing it. However, I feel that everyone else might be left somewhat bored and wanting for more. Perhaps that is what I was missing. This film is as political as it gets and maybe I just wanted it to be a bit more. With that being said, I enjoyed it and certainly learned some things.",Thirteen Days

Actually, I'm not sure if 'powerful' is a strong enough word to describe it. I was immediately sucked in and, in fact, the only time reality came back to me during the entire movie was when my friend, who'd fallen asleep,  suddenly jumped up wide awake at the roar of the jets... When the movie let out, everyone was yawning and stretching and in some way or another, complaining.Not me, I was pumped up and ready to go talk about it to someone, I didn't care who, for hours and hours. Who cares if it was 'thirteen days long' or if Kevin Costner's accent was a little annoying? Admit it, the movie was about as good as movie's get. The acting was perfect (I believe Bruce Greenwood should at least get a Best Actor nomination, possibly Culp, too, for Supporting Actor), and the script... man, did somebody put some time into that script! Not only was it historically accurate (to the best of my knowledge anyway) but it was heart-warming and witty and was full of those ""great lines"" that people will memorize and repeat over and over for many years to come. My favorite part, however, is just a shot of Kevin Costner coming home. He gets out of his car, and instead of going inside his house, he turns and looks at his street, his neighborhood, his world... I hate saying more than I should, but if you've seen the movie you know what I'm talking about. The emotion that is shown in that scene... it gives me chills just thinking about it.This film is intelligent, and beautiful, and 'powerful.'

193,brn2brd,13 days.....is that the film's length?,2,17 January 2001,"I'll be honest.  I did not like this movie.  Thirteen Days is an unbearable 2 1/2 hours of Kennedy pumping, uneven style, poor editing, multiple boom mike appearances, and puzzling moments of B&W exposure. What about Costner's attempt at a Boston accent?  Admittedly this becomes more bearable as the movie plays, but it is so bad in the beginning that I heard several groans.The ""Football of Doom"" shot near the beginning is supposed to be ominous, but I heard laughter around the theater.  Bobby Kennedy's occasionally comedic dialogue fell flat making people more uncomfortable than anything.
The shots of the jets were very cool, but that wasn't enough to keep me interested.  I started looking at my watch forty-five minutes into the film. That made the next two hours seem like forever.I am a big fan of the history channel.  I would have preferred one of their excellent sixty minute documentaries.",Thirteen Days

But do not let it deter you, those of you young enough to have only lived through it during history classes...this is a highly recommended movie for anyone who enjoys a great political thriller.

Two relative unknowns though are the show stealers; Steven Culp is eerily good as Bobby K, whereas Bruce Greenwood is excellent as the Pres. The real winner in the movie though is the David Self's script. The lack of real action had to be compensated by something, and the lingual sparring between the main threesome and the military and hordes of advisors and secretaries, and Special Assistants and so on, certainly does that. For someone who wasn't alive during the Cuban Missile Crisis, this is as informative as it is entertaining, despite the fact that some of it will no doubt have been untrue. The only real flaw is the jingoistic sensationalism of the Kennedies and the bad light that the post-Bay Of Pigs Military is shown in, but I can look beyond that when the script is throwing up lines like ""I am the President of the United States. And I say when we go to War!"". Excellent film thats even better second time round.

197,stringfellow76,Shamefully Underrated,8,18 May 2005,"Like many, I was nervous to hear that Kevin Costner was gonna be in a Cuban Missle Crisis flick, with a Bostonian accent no less! But don't let this scare you off! ""Thirteen Days"" is one great, very historically accurate movie. Now obviously there are parts that are dramaticized as this is a movie about those 13 days back in the 60's largely told through the walls of the Kennedy White House. As one born in the mid 70's, I knew about as much about the history of these events as most my age and went into the theater mostly ignorant to the details. I walked out thinking about the tagline; ""Not believing how close we came"" to World War III. But how accurate was it really? God love the Internet for research! Aside from the dramatization, this movie is very close to the facts as far as the government will let us know. I watched this with my parents who actually lived through the days of Air Raid drills in case ""those Commies"" attacked from Cuba. They were struck by how much of their experiences it brought back. But the best part of this movie is the Kennedys themselves. Being as that JFK and RFK were real people and VERY ingrained in our minds of how they were, the task of making them believable on screen is no easy task! Kudos to Bruce Greenwood and Steven Culp for performances that make it easier to slip into the movie instead of glaring at us as actors playing those famous figures. In fact it is easy to perhaps think that this is a documentary as opposed to a Hollywood movie. But Hollywood-ized it isn't. This is a slick film, but not glossy like the Bruckheimer or Ridley Scotts can make. At 3 hours in length...prepare yourselves for numb fannies! But for those who love history, this brings something from my 8th grade textbook to life unlike anything else I've seen from ""modern history.""GOOD- The Kennedys, attention to detail, how this film makes me WANT to see what happens...even though it is well documented history.

We were scared to death of the possibility of WWIII and Nuclear War, because it would have killed millions in one fell swoop, we were told-- as the movie here TALKS ABOUT. I also lived in Pittsburgh at the time, and we were told that Pittsburgh would be high on the nuke target list, given its then-prolific steel industry. In school, we were practicing what we would do if The Attack came. Neighbors were building fallout shelters. There was a heck of a lot going on for this scared eight-year-old to take in, none of which is reflected in this movie. The Washington bigwigs talk about this scenario then that scenario, none of which ever materialized, but some of us already know the situation first-hand or have studied it in school, so the writing comes off as flabby and over-expository. And we already know the outcome. WWIII didn't happen, Kennedy was assassinated the following year, the Beatles were on Ed Sullivan the year after that, LBJ got us involved in Vietnam, giving rise to the hippie movement-- and the Radical 60s were born. There's a great movie about the pivotal moment in we Baby Boomers' lives, but this wasn't that movie.

Kennedy has been portrayed -- on stage, TV  and movies -- by many many actors. No one until Bruce Greenwood has gotten him right. Greenwood's performance embodies why JFK still has such a hold on America's heart. And it has nothing to do with charisma, the Peace Corps, the Alliance for Progress, the space race, the Missile Crisis, or sex.<g> It has to do with the enormous decency and empathy of the man. Not only was he smarter and more courageous than others we have had since, he was more understanding of the hurts, doubts, and longings of other people on this planet.

There was no love tale, as has become popular with diplomatic films (""Pearl Harbor"", ""Michael Collins"").  I don't care about know the personal history of the men involved and I don't care about their families.

204,lwaysmith,Effective drama revisits our flirtation with WWIII,7,27 January 2001,"The Cuban Missile Crisis is the one event in our recent history that forced Americans to think about their own mortality, and the possibility that not all wars happen somewhere else. The decisions being made during those days in October, 1962 would have a profound effect on the lives of millions of people throughout the world. For the most part, THIRTEEN DAYS does an effective job of recreating the desperation felt by both the leaders and the citizens during this time of crisis.The events leading up to the stare-down between the US and the USSR have been well documented, so there is little new ground covered in this movie. The payoff for the audience is to watch the actors in their roles as world leaders, and to hopefully get a sense of the conflict not only among the different factions of the government, but also within the mind of each individual. Most of the performances are first rate. Bruce Greenwood, as President Kennedy, is impassioned without being hammy, no small accomplishment given the emotional nature of the situation.(One aside--was it just me or did Bruce Greenwood bear an uncanny resemblance to Dan Patrick of ESPN and Sportcenter fame? For me this was a bit disconcerting, since ""presidential"" is not one if the adjectives I would use to describe the entertaining Mr. Patrick.) Presidential Advisor Kenny O'Donnell is played with some restraint by Kevin Costner, who allowed the other members of the cast to carry their share of the load. His accent is somewhat overpowering and forced at the beginning of the movie, but either he toned it down later, or I became used to it. Either way, it stopped being a distraction. The best performance is turned in by Steven Culp, who was totally believable as Robert Kennedy. We see Robert as a tough, intelligent man thrust into an almost no win situation--he is expected to be the voice of reason and a guiding light while surrounded by dissenting opinions as to what is ""right"". Steven Culp shows him as a man who accepts this responsibility because his country needs him to, even if he sometimes doubts his worthiness for the role.",Thirteen Days
205,peterbrooks,"Very timely, well crafted film....",10,3 February 2002,"I feel this is an excellent film.  It stands out particularly because it is so timely as we sit through an incredibly incompetent administration, which is not only unable to protect its citizens, but is launching us head first into a ""war without end.""The phrase ""hopefully cooler heads will prevail"" which is uttered  often in this film is a statement that both sides need to privilege at this time.
There is sufficient depth in this film.  It consistently makes me cry, which says a lot for a film.  The characters are personable, understandble, reasonable, intelligent, thoughtful, contemplative; it is a wonderful film for learned people to enjoy.It is an historical document which much like ""Amadeus"" by Milos Forman, which is an excellent vehicle for learning about classical music. ""Thirteen Days"" is a also a wonderful laboratory for examining the operations of democracy, diplomacy, teamwork and leadership at its best.
There are also relatively subtle, but unmistakable statements that speak to the nature of our military, its attitude and the extraordinarily (yet unappreciated) fragility inherent in our rich democracy.
It is very hard for me to find flaw with this film.  It is exceedingly obvious that the cast, director and crew really believed in this film and without ever over acting or indicating, they convey these events with convincing authenticity, familiarity and agency.I only wish there were more films like this for our young people to make American History and civics ""come alive"".  FDR, Teddy Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Thomas Jefferson films could all emerge from essentially using this model of paintstaking authenticity and sensitive craft.

Proof of how good a movie this was is the fact that besides a couple of short action shots involving the planes and missiles, most of the movie was dialog.

It also shows how the evil and dark American military tries to trigger them into a war. But thank God, it failed. Today, a lot has changed: America is run by a bunch of war criminals who force-feed their obvious lies to the American nation, which swallowed every little detail of it, obediently.

The protagonists: the Kennedy Brothers, O'Donnell, McNamara. A tribute to JFK. The American perspective. Proud. But not exaggerated, not overdone. Wise. Which is important for me because of my European perspective. Not always dominating political power. Not always confident, noisy; but weak moments, doubts, sincerity. Think of it that way: they tell you a story you already know. You heard and learned about it in school, history classes, even my father told me about it. How scared he was. So you know the story, you know about the happy end. But still, you are tensed throughout the entire movie. No fancy special effects just pure acting. Beautiful. Now, which movie has achieved that in recent years. Most of them don't get your attention with stories you don't know. ""Thirteen Days"" tells you a story you already know and manages to incorporate you, forces you to partake. You're a part of the team. Counselor.

While all actors put on a good show in portraying the people that make the decisions, truly Steven Culp (Bobby Kennedy) and Dylan Baker (Robert McNamara) succeed the most and come closest to the original.What apart from the actors truly makes this film though, is that it is not shown from the perspective of the decision-makers but from the perspective of a by-stander (not an un-influential by-stander, but still) someone who will not be held responsible for the actions taken, but still knows everything that happens.

Following almost every movement of Costner as Kenny O'Donnell, JFK's special political advisor, the film retells how Krushchev, or others in the Russian administration of the time, and the US Chief of Staffs took the world close to nuclear war. And how JFK and others stopped them.With a punchy script, inspired by supposedly primary source material, Donaldson deftly weaves a narrative of political intrigue that shows America's military commanders content, even eager, to take the US into war if it means an initial strike on the 'commie b*****ds'. It is left to the triumvirate of the two Kennedies and O'Donnell, a close relationship the film explores well, to keep cool heads and so avoid nuclear catastrophe. But it is for JFK to realise and stress that any offensive strike would be futile and go on to create a so-called 'new political language' to solve this horrific situation. A language not borne out of a desire for annihilatory attack but of measured military action. In this case a flexing of naval muscle through a 'blockade' of Cuba.The film reveres JFK as an almost untouchable hero (as the final scenes of the film make abundantly clear), yet at the centre of the film is a celebration of the common American man that is Costner's character. It shows a political process undermined by a scheming Pentagon but restored through the temperate attitude and solid values of a good Christian (albeit we assume Catholic) family man who sees public office as the highest achievement. And it is he, the man the audience can identify with rather than sit in awe off, who provides the advice, pep talks and emotional sustenance to keep JFK wise, alert and sane. O'Donnell is even portrayed as closer to JFK than Jackie Onassis, notably absent from the majority of the film. This exalted position shown by Costner's vetoing and then reinstating of various of Jackie's friends for a birthday party at the start of the film, and a humorous interchange where, like husband and wife, JFK and O'Donnell bicker over morning toast. Costner seems more like JFK's wife and first lady than political advisor. And together with Teddy it is these three modern non-military men who 'win' the battle within the White House and without against the Soviets. It is their fight that lets common sense and good American values prevail.But it is these American values that although are entirely honourable, in the end add up to a sickly sweet portrayal suggesting an almost divine miracle inspired by the Kennedy administration. It is an absorbing and well-crafted political drama for the highest stakes yet in the end it reverts to a self-centred belief that the 'best man won'. The achievements of the three, Teddy to the side and Costner in the wings helping the gifted JFK, cannot be denied, but neither can the so dramatic, glorious and one-sided depiction that is Thirteen Days. But that is what winning is about. And it is thanks to them, and thanks to God, that the sun will rise another day.",Thirteen Days
225,jaybird89101,Excellent retelling of the pivotal event of my childhood of which I have only a vague recollection.,9,13 January 2001,"I was enthralled by the retelling of this historical period in the life of our country...and in my life...even though I (we all) know the outcome.  I have a vague recollection of the Cuban missle crisis as a 13-year-old boy in 1962.  There were several parts of this event I discovered for the first time.  Little did I know as a youngster how close we came to the brink of nuclear oblivion.  I thought the storytellers did an excellent job of recreating these events and keeping the viewers interest.  However, as a frequent movie goer not used to such things, it was unsettling to see such a professional group of movie makers allow the audience to glimpse the sound mike in not one but two separate scenes!  Where was the cameraman when these scenes were shot or the editor when these scenes were put together? Unfortunate...but I still enjoyed the show and recommend it highly.",Thirteen Days
226,adl-7,Worst film I've seen this year,2,12 December 2000,"Thirteen Days is a movie that milks the audiences' patriotism to garner box office receipts.  Don't be fooled by the subject matter, this film takes a real life historical event and exploits the story in a poorly done script to make a little dough (see The Patriot).I honestly don't know what the director was thinking.  No, I really mean it...was he thinking Oliver Stone, or John Woo?  Director Roger Donaldson borrows so much from cliched or trademark directing techniques that it's hard to derive his own style.The musical score, which is constantly playing, doesn't leave any thinking up to the audience.  If the scene is tense, the violins are right there to remind you. If the scene is happy, we're not permitted to figure it out for ourselves.  All in all, I wonder if they even hired a composer or just dubbed over the soundtrack from late night crime dramas. Personally, I was insulted that I wasn't allowed to think for myself.  But the rest of the audience didn't seem to mind.  If you're with me then this movie isn't one for you.Some other complaints: Why the black and white scenes?  This was a question I was pondering during and after the film.  There is no obvious conclusion for why Donaldson included the occasional B&W shots except that he was trying to be like Oliver Stone.  Sorry Donnyboy, but it'll take more than Kevin Costner and B&W photography to make you feel like the master.The characters are trading lines so much that it hurts.  And their New Englander accents would make The Simpson's Mayor Quimby jealous.  Also, there are so many characters that a caption always has to appear after a character delivers his first line to tell us who he is (as if it matters...we soon forget about him and the other 100 government officials who are introduced through this mess).  Luckily for the presumed unintelligent viewer, the story line reduces it's characters down to 4 people: JFK, RFK, Coster, and the other guys.  The first three exist to do everything that'll make them look good for the audience, and the other guys exist to undermine peace and tranquility and act as cheerleaders for WWIII.I wasn't around for the Cuban Missle Crisis, though I've heard the situation in the White House was similar to what I just described...but please don't tell me it was as simple as that-- that our democracy elects either a villain or do-gooder.  If this movie is right, then give me Cuba any day.People were cheering at the end of this movie.  Why?  Because it was patriotic I guess.  But it's patriotic in the same way that Independence Day was.  Just because it's America rising up to the challenge doesn't mean it's a good movie.  And just because it is telling a patriotic historical event doesn't mean we should nominate it for an Oscar (which I'm betting will happen).  I wasn't cheering by the end of this film.  I would have liked to see a good movie about the Cuban Missle Crisis.  Is that asking too much?",Thirteen Days
227,grease2000,A great ride through the waves of history!!,10,27 May 2001,"I was born in 1983 and I really start to remember stuff that happened after the cold war was over. But I'm a big fan of history. I know American History 101 and was curious about ""Thirteen Days"". I went to see it and wasn't exactly sure what to make of it.I know Kevin Costner's ""record"" and was a little suspicious considering the movie he made in the past. After the first 20 minutes I loved the movie! It doesn't have all those fancy special effects or a lot of sex and crime, but it is one of the best movies I have ever seen. The acting is great, especially Bruce Greenwood (JFK) does a terrific job. He is able to show how intense the situation was, a how it must have felt for the people in the White House. Kevin Costner does a great job in ""supporting"" Greenwood. I don't think that his role really is the lead-character. He just gives a good point of view of the events. It would have been much harder to identify with JFK. The movie has great dialogues and is more exciting then many fictional thrillers. The camerawork is awesome, even though you have the feeling the stage-micorphone belongs to the cast... There are some great cuts, in the movie.*Spoiler warning*I really love the part where Costner closes the door to the oval office, turns around and is in the middle of the press conference. And also the scene with the sunrise is absolutely great!!*Spoiler ending*The movie is fairly long, but it's so captivating, then when I looked at my watch I was surprised that it had already lasted 2 hours.I think that it's a must see for everybody only slightly interested in history, and for everybody who likes good movies. It's a great ride through the waves of history, which were especially high during that time.But I have to warn you, this is a movie where you shouldn't take a bathroom break, because it's either a bad time because you would miss something or you just don't want to go. For me it's a 10/10",Thirteen Days
228,stewbop42,"Great movie, Costner a little dull",8,5 December 2000,"As a member of the University of Rochester's student body, I was graced with a preview screening of ""Thirteen Days,"" starring Kevin Costner in the story of the Cuban Missile Crisis in October of 1962.  Aside from a few technical difficulties (since it is a preview screening, they receive the movie by satellite uplink--the weather tonight was horrible, so the sound and picture cut out in a few key scenes), I thought it was a very well-done and entertaining movie.  The majority of the movie concentrated on people's discussions and interactions during the ordeal, rather than the scenes of military mobilization. Some would probably complain that they had too many people sitting around in rooms talking and not enough scenes of engagement. However, it never got boring.  All the politics and back and forth deals, coupled with the occasional military encounter, provided for a very tense, edge-of-your seat movie.  The few military scenes that were in it were extremely well done, especially the views of the planes flying low over Cuba. I felt that the actor playing RFK did the best job of interpreting his character.  The actor playing JFK didn't look or sound enough like JFK for me, but RFK was right on the nose. Of course, I don't know the actual person that Kevin Costner was playing, but his Boston accent was slightly annoying, coming from him.  It would probably have been better if he were played instead by an unknown actor, to shift the focus somewhat off of his character.  He was probably the thing I disliked most about the movie--he just didn't fit. Since this was only a preview screening, there were some problems with the editing that I assume will be fixed in the final version.  In one scene, there was a barely visible boom mike on the side.  Plus, there was a short scene that made no sense and had no bearing on the movie that I assume will be cut from the final version (it was a 2-hour 20 minute movie).  That coupled with the fact that there were several technical difficulties and it was an excellent movie means that I will definitely be seeing it again when it comes out :). One thing I'm not certain on is the historical accuracy. Of course I've read textbooks that describe the events, but living through it would have been a different experience completely. I felt, while watching it, that not knowing exactly how the events turned out heightened the tension.  Since a lot of viewers have lived through it and watched each event play by play, it won't be as much of a thrill ride.  But by that same virtue, I don't know if everything in it was accurate.  From what I know of the actual historical events, which I must point out is relatively little, it was accurate.  The extent of my knowledge was that there were missiles in Cuba, and we almost got nuked over it :). Overall a great movie, exciting and thrilling but not relying on its action scenes for all the excitement.  Kevin Costner wasn't great, but he's been on the decline the last few years and this was better than some of his recent stuff, so I've got to give him props for that.  My rating is an 8 out of 10",Thirteen Days

230,deyganb,Incredibly accurate and objective historical drama.,10,13 January 2001,"I am currently working on a set of volumes about Jack and Bobby Kennedy, and have spent hundreds of hours researching everything about the Kennedy administration. As movies go, ""Thirteen Days"" has been the most historically accurate film I have ever seen. I cannot speak much for the suspense, because everything that happened, or was said, I already knew about. But, for anyone who is interested in knowing what really happened, ""Thirteen Days"" is as good as it gets. I am no die-hard Costner fan, but I must defend him here. I have read and heard a lot about how he lets his personal admiration of the Kennedy's show in his acting. THIS IS NOT TRUE. The character he plays, Kenny O'Donnell, first met JFK in the mid-1950's. At first, O'Donnell wasn't impressed. By the time JFK was elected, O'Donnell was closer than any non-family member could get to both JFK and RFK. He would have done anything for either one of them. His nickname was 'The Cobra', and everyone knew that to get to either brother, they'd first have to go through O'Donnell. He was also one of the 'Irish Mafia', so I don't think it's fair to knock Costner for letting his penchant for accents show. O'Donnell did have a strong New England/Irish accent, and often tried to hide it. The movie is also very objective. It does not take any dramatic license with any of the events or characters. The closest I could find to a serious omission is Bobby Kennedy wasn't shown to be as integral a player as he really was for JFK - yet it still does better than any previous work in establishing his importance. Any of the dialogue or actions shown in the movie actually did happen, and if anything the producers left out some factual things that could've made people skeptical. More than anything, I would like to emphasize that ""Thirteen Days"" tells the story as it really happened, and the all the various people as they really were.",Thirteen Days

Bruce Greenwood masterfully depicts President Kennedy, and so do the rest of the actors!  Kudos to Steven Culp on Bobby Kennedy.  While Kevin Costner does not get the accent down, he does a good job overall acting it out.

It's amazing the similarity of the actors to the real people, particularly Bobby Kennedy and McNamara. The underlying tension and the restrained acting reminded me of the movie Seven Days in May. The Portrayal of John F. Kennedy was remarkable in so far as one doesn't even notice that his physical appearance is off. His mannerisms and acting portrayed John F. Kennedy so well that he blends into the character perfectly. The tension exhibited by the actors in this movie reflects accurately the tension the nation felt during those awful days when we had to practice atomic bomb drills in school. Kevin Costner's portrayal of Kenny O'Donnell seemed right on the mark, as did the actor who portrayed Adli Stevenson. Those scenes which took place the United Nations were particularly moving sadly, they have not been repeated in present times. If only Colin Powell could have made such an impact with the UN perhaps the war in Iraq would have been unnecessary.",Thirteen Days

It did not bother me. I wonder how somebody even bothers to mention it.Then there has been questions about Costner´s hair. Really, some keep asking why he has different haircut in different movies; If I were Costner i would not answer.About Kevin´s ""wooden"" acting; I have always thought that he acts like Gary Cooper with not so strong manners. Even now, though times are cynical, nobody dares to say that Cooper´s acting was wooden?I´m so sick and tired of the world press being like apes quoting each other and mocking Costner´s work. And they call themselves humanists. Though Kevin makes movies about White House, I think he is not trying to become the president of USA; though he could be suitable for that position too. Don´t be afraid of Kevin; he is just a human being. He is (still) very beautiful, he has degree in marketing. And to me he is very talented.

239,rwilson024,"Thirteen Days, an enticing look into our most volatile times...",8,11 October 2006,"Thirteen Days, presented historically dense as well as tense situations in my Modern War Class in a manner which kept you centered into each frame change, on the edge of your plastic chair, desperately attempting to make an assumption of what will happen next in order to avoid further anxiety. I would never have thought I would be presented such a roller coaster ride in an optional/elective course, this roller-coaster ride is a rather intricate one giving you a close look, despite Hollywood theatrical elements, into just how close Uncle Sam's jittery hand came to pressing the button. We are presented two conflicting sides in this movie, the military generals representing the ""Hawks"" and the Kennedy's representing the ""Doves"". The enticement factor and anxiety brought on by this movie are solely based on these opposing symbols. The hawks, greatly willing to respond through the ""rules of engagement"" and shaft the ""Red Dog's"" who have been digging and instigating at them, and the Doves, trying to ""cage"" these hawks and prevent them from creating a potentially disastrous hardball approach. We are, in this Movie, more connected with the Doves, not simply because we all want peace to prevail, but because the way the film portrays a menace out of the military generals, and depicts them as officials with a never-quenching thirst for military aggression and war medallions. Though this movie obviously takes a side, it is a bias that is completely understood and acceptable, as the point addressed is a necessary one which, even today, may need to be reintroduced a second time as these events are history which need not repeating.",Thirteen Days
240,mt_pink,Good movie Overall,5,12 October 2006,"Thirteen Days narrates the story of the Cuban Missile Crisis in the United States in the 1960's. Seen through the eyes of John F. Kennedy's special assistant (which never existed), one grasps the seriousness and tension of the situation.Although one knows the outcome of the movie, it is a still interesting and worth seeing. Seeing the development of each character as time progresses and tensions grow, one feels as if one was there. It truly captures the essence and importance of those thirteen days of world history. It teaches us that we really did come close to WW III.One thing it portrays very well is the bias of the hawks and the doves. Military men such as General LeMay and Acheson really pushing for a war. In contrast, Stevenson and Rusk try to look for diplomatic alternatives. This contrast was made quite clearly, but at times, very harsh.Though the movie is an excellent watch, at times it can become too dramatic. One particular scene that was a waste of time was the scene where Kevin Costner shows up at his son's game. It says nothing about the movie and really portrays drama at its highest level.Overall, this movie does a good job in teaching us how important political decisions can really be and how one simple mistake can cause a catastrophic event. It also shows how intelligently things were carried out in the White House in the time of the Missile Crisis. Even I, who was not alive at the time, can truly say I got a sense of what it must have felt for people at the time to live in such confusion.",Thirteen Days
241,straight_ballar,Response to Jakemac08 comments on the Movie,9,29 November 2006,"I'm not sure how much you know about the Cuban Missile Crisis jake, but Kenny O'Donnell was JFK's special assistant, appointed in 1960. He helped with his presidential campaign, and in 1957 he was appointed as Assistant Counsel, Select Committee to Investigate Improper Activities in Labor-Management Relations in the Senate. Which ended in 1959, and in turn in 1960 O'Donnell was the organizer and director of John F. Kennedy's presidential campaign schedule. The following year he became Kennedy's special assistant. SO Kevin Costner's role as Kenny O'Donnell is clearly a true role, and you are quite incorrect in trying to tell people it was made up. i agree Hollywood added its personal touches, which makes it a blockbuster film, however the depiction of actual events and problems are quite accurate. the movie is excellent for educating about the Cuban Missile Crisis, with few, if any, incorrect historical facts.",Thirteen Days
242,northernseal,A close-up of the importance of diplomacy in international relations!,8,19 October 2001,I really enjoyed this movie because it broadened my awareness of historical events and underlined the importance of strong communication skills. I was not really aware of how close the US came to war with Russia in 1962.  I was about 12 years old at that time and I remember very little about this situation. The movie also gave me some insight into the communication processes of political leaders. I was surprised that some of the military leaders (males) were so aggressive and pro war.  Were they really that naive to believe that the rest of the world would not be adversely affected by an armed confrontation of such magnitude? I watched this movie after the tragic events of September 11th. I felt quite uncomfortable thinking that military leaders would make decisions that could have truly devastating consequences for all humanity.  Thirteen Days really made me reconsider the present situation that faces us.,Thirteen Days

Specifically, his accent in the movie was like listening to someone scratch their nails on a blackboard.  I nearly returned this video without watching past the first 15 minutes just because of Costner's awful accent, but I kept watching and the movie proved to be okay.

244,edmoore5000,One of the great political thrillers of all time,10,11 January 2008,"From the terrific acting to the beautifully written script to the masterful directing, this is easily one of the greatest political thrillers ever made. I don't care if Costner's accent is not the best, he acted his *ss off in this movie. And both Steven Culp and Bruce Greenwood(the Kennedys) deserved Best Supporting Oscar noms for their work. This is a film that chronicles the thirteen days of the Cuban Missile Crisis. What is lost in the film's brisk pace, constant plot twists and the unbelievably immersive acting, is the fact that much of this really happened. How it's taken to the year 2000 to make such a film out of this story is beyond me, but this film is pure craftsmanship on every level. I didn't see it until 2002(came out in 2000), but when I did, I was shocked to find out that it was not at least nominated for Best Director and Supporting Actor. Greenwood IS JFK, but even his remarkable performance is overshadowed by Culp's Bobby Kennedy. The truth in the way they portray this subdued emotion is evident in every scene. But the true master of craft in this film is the director. Roger Donaldson's work in this picture should be a film school staple for teaching interior camera setups and blocking actors. They are few interior locations, so it must have been a real challenge for him to keep it fresh. But the way he handles it with the camera's movements complementing the actors movements and the way he adjusts it throughout the film to serve the story was something I felt only unconsciously at first. But after repeated viewings, it became clear I was watching a director at the top of his craft.This film is a must-see if you are 1) a U.S. history buff 2) a fan of the political thriller genre(plenty of action too) or 3) great ensemble acting.",Thirteen Days

USSR - 300 of nuclear warheads.As you can see USSR had just 5% of American nuclear arsenal.In 1960 USA placed American middle range nuclear missiles in Turkey. To answer this, USSR was forced to send missiles to CUBA. After Cuban crisis, American missiles from Turkey and soviet missiles from Cuba were withdrawn.There is only one explanation for Cuban Missile Crisis - do not do any harm for anyone and you will not get harm in exchange.American propaganda machine is alive and functioning. 300 billion of American citizens in USA have no idea about real events. Everybody just believe that that damn Russians had put missiles to Cuba just to destroy America. Bloodthirsty Russians just wanted to destroy America. Just wanted KILL THE FREEDOM.

Millions of tons of food and supplies were sent to Eastern Europe in attempt to avoid hunger and unnecessary deaths of native population.Everyone knows about Marshall plan, but IT WAS TO LATE AND TO SMALL. No body knows how Stalin, despite hunger in Russia was sending a lot of food to Hungary and Chehoslovakia. (When Russia stopped sending food and coal to these countries they just revolted) Guess what is going to happened with eastern Europe when America runs out of money because of economic depression? You think they are your friends? Get real, they are your friends until you sending them MONEY! Poland not long ago asked 20 billions dollars from Bush for army modernization.

Now, in terms of the acting, I respect Costner's choice to try for the accent, but didn't anyone on set notice it was not working.

He and his close advisers couldn't be 100% certain that everything would work as planned - many times they had to do as much research as possible, but it was finite and inconclusive, then make a decision/use their judgement.

During the crisis the IRBM in Cuba were almost the only effective nuclear threat against the USA, but liquid fuel rockets cannot remain ready to fire at short notice for more than a few hours, therefore a surprise attack would have wiped them away in minutes before they could be fueled.And the SAM 2 would be unable to protect them without the massive triple A that supported them in Viet Nam. But that genius of JFK let disclose the discovery of the missiles and gave away the chance of a surprise attack. The ""reckless desire for peace"" (so celebrated by Mr. Kostner)the National Command Authority displayed at the time can be traced back as the reason behind later soviet aggressions like Vietnam. The opinions of Mr. Kostner prove his willingness to share with JFK the blame and the responsibility for that tragedy. By the way the attempt to blame the military as a major cause of the crisis is simply disgusting.",Thirteen Days
250,ploni-1,THIS is how to make a film.,10,15 December 2009,"""Thirteen Days"" is superb film-making.Tightly written . . . superbly edited with no hackneyed scenes or characterizations . . . believable casting . . . an appropriate musical score that added tremendously to the pace of the film . . . I am very, very impressed with Mr. Donaldson's film-making talents. He is a master of quick, precise, edge-of-seat pacing which has been so rarely seen for the past forty years. This will forever be one of the select films that I will watch, enjoy, and recommend forever.Fantastic job. Fantastic!",Thirteen Days
251,Jakemac08,Movie Summary,7,8 February 2006,"13 Days was a historical movie about what went on behind the curtains of the Cuban Missile Crisis. For the most part 13 Days was a historically accurate movie with the exception of two things. The most obvious exception was the fact that Kevin Kostner's character was not a real character. That fact spoiled the movie a little but we can not look at his character as an actual character but more as the narrator of the movie, and an actor that was there to highlight the key points of the movie. The other thing that stood out to me was that John F Kennedy's character seemed too aggressive. Not living in the time of Kennedy and relying on clips of speeches he just does not seem to be an offensive type of man. The movie was interesting and historically accurate with everything from the U2 planes being shot down to some of the speeches being given. The movie was a fun and eye-opening film that shows how close we really were to having a nuclear holocaust. Of course Hollywood has to throw in its happy ending and the closing scene was a bit tacky but otherwise it was a fun movie.",Thirteen Days
252,JackHorohoe,Factual??,8,20 February 2006,"I served aboard the USS Joseph P. Kennedy which was depicted in the film. The Kennedy was the ship that boarded the Marcula in the waters off the Bahamas. The Kennedy, now part of Battleship cove in Fall River, Ma., actually played herself in the film. The actual boarding was not as quite dramatic as depicted in the movie.The boarding party for instance did not wear dress white uniforms and the Marcula was more of a ""rust bucket"" than depicted in the movie. Although the 5 inch guns were aimed at the vessel, I don't recall a shot being fired.As far as the movie is concerned I though it gave a rather accurate accounting of the circumstances that surrounded this time in history with a few embellishment's that are purely thrown in as theatrical license.",Thirteen Days
