0,TheLittleSongbird,This line is completely flat,2,3 October 2017,"Personally liked the 1990 'Flatliners'. It wasn't perfect, but it was stylish, fun and with some chills, making the most of a concept that at the time was very different. It also strikes me as one of Joel Schumacher's most underrated films and an example of not all Schumacher's films being overblown camp.Immediately had doubts hearing there was a remake, 'Flatliners' was one of those films that didn't need a remake in any shape or form. However, the cast didn't seem too bad on paper (Ellen Page and Diego Luna have shown performances that were at least capable in the past), it was written by Ben Ripley (who did some fine work for 'Source Code') and it was directed by Niels Arden Oplev of the excellent Swedish 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' fame. So actually, despite questioning the point, there was hope.Sadly, 'Flatliners' (2017) failed to live up to any of its potential that it could have potentially had with the right execution. Questioned the point of it before watching it when it first came out last Friday, after seeing it to me it has to be one of the most pointless and dead on arrival remakes since 'The Wicker Man'. The concept of the original 'Flatliners' unlike any other, that's not the case anymore (having actually starting to wear well before this came out, being executed for example to not particularly good effect in an episode of 'Diagnosis Murder') and it feels very stale here, so no despite how appetising it appears in the summary it's hard to put ""great premise"" as a strength.The cast do their best, the actors are the thing that come off least badly. That's not saying much at all (and it's only being said because everything else is done worse) because most of them still give very uninspired one-note performances. The most dedicated of the lot is Diego Luna, he makes a real effort to keep things together, even when things seem unsalvageable, and ends up being the best, and perhaps only good, thing about the film. The normally very capable Ellen Page plays her character in far too repressed a way, and the rest of the cast are either too histrionic or robotic. Kiefer Sutherland's cameo was even more unnecessary than the film itself.With that being said, that the acting is not great is not the fault of the actors. They do have everything else in 'Flatliners' fighting them every step of the way. The characters are ones we learn little about, other than very over-familiar dilemmas and past traumas that are mentioned but not really expanded upon (certainly not in a way that would make one root for them), and one is just too frustrated by their very hasty and sometimes illogical decision making and inexperienced students-like behaviour (way too inexperienced to be doing something this advanced) to make one care for them.Just as disappointing are the script and the direction. Anybody who remembers Ripley's taut, occasionally drolly humorous and emotionally weighty (in its exploration of loss and responsibility) script for 'Source Code' will be very disappointed to find a script here that makes one think whether it was actually written by him or a completely different person who was a complete rookie in script-writing. For this script was clunky, drab and tonally very muddled (trying to mix sci-fi, psychology and horror and making a complete hash of balancing them and properly doing anything with each individually) with some unintentionally funny elements.Likewise it was hard to believe that such lazy ill-at ease came from the same director who brought so much tension, class, boldness and suspense in masterful, terrifying ways to the Swedish 'The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo'. Everything single one of those completely and utterly absent here in a film as chilling as a wet blanket. Sorry for comparing, but it's hard not to when the glimpses of potential that actually persuaded me to see a film that didn't appeal to me in the first place, based on previous work that did impress me, disappoint so drastically.Worst of all is the story, which is a disaster in execution and does nothing fresh with an idea that was quite unique back in 1990 but not so much over-time and feels incredibly stale and unimaginative here. It started off mildly intriguing, quickly became dull once it was clear that the characters were not engaging and the script and direction being as poor as they were (not to mention the pacing being leaden throughout) and then got really weird and forgot to make sense in the second half. The film tries to raise interesting questions but fails to answer them convincingly so many things feel unresolved or very, very vague (like all the strange goings on, the whole flat-liners concept and the unexplained physical forms thing that is more at home in a Stephen King novel). The ending is a fizzling whimper, nothing exciting or suspenseful at all about it, and indicative of the writers running out of steam and ideas.Forgot to mention the production values. Visually it was very close to looking like straight to video fodder but just rose above that (only just) with some atmospheric lighting that is wasted by especially photography that was suggestive of a photographer either drunk on the job or had never shot a film in their lives. When reading that it was the same man who captured the bleakness of 'The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo' effectively, lack of refinement aside, there was shock. Some slapdash effects here too. One actually misses the interesting use of orange and blues of the original, which was far more interesting to watch than the dreary look here. Nathan Barr has done some great scoring for television but it's very ham-fisted in the few times it's memorable here.Overall, completely flat. 2/10 Bethany Cox",Flatliners
1,Leofwine_draca,Another unnecessary remake,3,24 August 2019,"I'm not a huge fan of the original Julia Roberts-starring movie and I'm no fan of remakes either, so I was bound to hate this updated FLATLINERS. The addition of Ellen Page to the mix did me no favours either; she's an actress I consider incredibly overrated and my opinion didn't change on watching this. The new version of FLATLINERS spends a lot of time on set-up but eventually devolves into a cheesy, by-the-numbers style ghost story with a lot of generic material filling out the running time. It has a boring, blue, digital filter-type look and a relatively unknown cast who go through the established character motions. As for the attempts at drama and suspense, they never make a mark. File this under another unnecessary remake attempt.",Flatliners
2,SnoopyStyle,inferior and unnecessary,4,22 February 2018,"Courtney Holmes (Ellen Page) accidentally drives off a bridge with her young sister. Nine years later, she is a medical student working under Dr. Barry Wolfson (Kiefer Sutherland). In the basement of the hospital, she uses unused emergency equipment to do her research on the afterlife. She recruits fellow students rich womanizer Jamie (James Norton) and sweet friend Sophia (Kiersey Clemons). When things go wrong, earnest Ray (Diego Luna) and ambitious Marlo (Nina Dobrev) join the group.I don't understand why Kiefer can't play the same character. What's the point of bringing him back to the franchise if he's not the same guy? It makes no sense but let's move on. Rebooting this franchise is a questionable move at best but nobody expects more from a stale Hollywood studio. Again, let's move on. The movie has nothing new or special to say. Nevertheless, I love many of these actors and I hoped for the best. When we first move down to the basement, there was a fleeting moment of hope for a functional horror. The afterlife is simply lackluster and may work better without being seen. The original had a horror take which works much better. The new afterlife look and movie in general is simply inferior and worst of all unnecessary.",Flatliners
3,claudio_carvalho,Unnecessary Remake,5,16 December 2017,"In 1990, Joel Schumacher directed the unforgettable ""Flatliners"", a original horror film with Kiefer Sutherland, Kevin Bacon, Julia Roberts., William Baldwin and Oliver Platt. The remake directed by Danish director Niels Arden Oplev has nothing new in he story. The cast is weaker with the awful and unexpressive Kiersey Clemons in one of the lead roles and the screenplay is corny. The cameo of Kiefer Sutherland is probably the greatest joke in this forgettable and unnecessary remake. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): Not Available",Flatliners
4,nogodnomasters,I'm going next.,6,26 October 2017,"Courtney (Ellen Page) causes an automotive accident which kills her sister. Since then she has been fascinated by near death experiences as a medical intern. She convinces a group of fellow interns to ""kill"" her, do an MRI on her brain while she is dead and then bring her back. She gains enhanced mental powers which causes the other Interns desire to go dead and come back....or yeah, one she gains one more thing...a visitor.The first film was a classic and this one is not a classic. Kiefer Sutherland manages to get a role in this version after being in the first one as a different person. Too bad they couldn't maintain some continuity. I was surprised by the plot change-up. Worth a view.Guide: No swearing or nudity. Sex scene.",Flatliners
5,kosmasp,Capture this,6,17 January 2021,"So this is the first movie I've seen with the artist formerly known as Ellen Page. Now he goes by the name of Elliot Page - though he is still credited as Ellen in the credits, which will be true for most releases I'm certain. And by the way I say ""he"", because that is one of his prefered terms to adress him with. I don't know how you feel about Elliot and his decision to come out and tell us what's what - but we have to respect anyones decision to say the least.And talking about respecting other peoples decision, it is almost as if this was meant to be, Elliotts character is the one who kickstarts it all. Kind of like the Kiefer Sutherland character in the original movie. And while I'm comparing the movies, here's another difference: you almost had entirely a (white) male group in the original. And here you have diversity in the group itself. While we now know that Elliot is male, the character he portrays is as female as Nina Dobrevs (again, personal feelings one may have aside).Obviously the effects are way better and to a degree I'd even say this is more enganging ... but that's it! Just to a point! Because after a relatively strong beginning, the movie unfortunately derails a little bit. The effects stay good and the actors try their best, even if they can't reach the charisma of the original groups/movie. Also including a semi-cameo by Kiefer Sutherland in this, does not really elavate the movie - it is fun to see him though. Would be funnier if there was more for him to do ... imho.So while this isn't too bad a movie, it isn't really a good one too. For first time viewers there is the strong central idea ...",Flatliners
6,classicsoncall,"""I think we're way past parlor tricks here.""",7,16 August 2018,"Quite by chance and more so by accident I picked up this copy of ""Flatliners"" and was somewhat puzzled by the names of the principal players appearing here because I knew the film had been made more than a couple of decades ago. Seeing Kiefer Sutherland as old as he was, I knew I had picked up the remake, but what the heck, I've made that mistake before. I didn't think it was as bad as a lot of the reviewers make it sound here on IMDb, but as I mentioned, I was really set on watching the original. There were some interesting concepts being explored in the picture, which blended sci-fi elements with horror and the idea of the 'flatliners' having to deal with mistakes they made in life that required atonement as a result of being on the other side. Feeding off of a guilty conscience, each of the young medical students found themselves on a plane of existence where they saw people who died or who's deaths they might have caused. The entire concept comes together near the end of the story when each of the players comes to understand that they have to face up to what they've done and find a way to forgive themselves. Sounds to me like the makers of this film could take a cue from that advice.",Flatliners
7,Tweekums,Better than I feared but still fairly unnecessary,6,29 November 2020,"As this remake/reboot of the 1990 film of the same name opens Courtney Holmes is driving with her younger sister; distracted by her phone she crashes off a bridge. She survives but her sister doesn't. Some years later Courtney is a medical student with a fascination with the possibility of life after death. This fascination leads her to undertake a dangerous experiment... with two friends assisting she induces clinical death. They struggle to bring her back so seek the help of another friend. Once back with the living Courtney seems more alive and more intelligent. Her friends soon want to try the experience too. At first things seem great but then it appears that there is a dark side to what they did as they are haunted by people they wronged in the past.I'd hear some fairly negative reviews of this but as it is available to watch on Netflix, and I'd enjoyed the original film, I thought I'd give it a go. It turned out it was better than I expected. The story is essentially the same but there are some noticeable changes and one genuine surprise, which I won't spoil. There are some nicely creepy moments but it lacks the sense of dread of the original... possibly because I've seen plenty of scarier films in the intervening years. The cast does an solid enough job; most notably Ellen Page, who has impressed me since I first saw her in 'Hard Candy'; and James Norton, who will be familiar to viewers of UK TV series 'Grantchester' and 'Happy Valley'. The casting of Kiefer Sutherland seemed strange; I was sure that there would be some link to his character in the original... if there was it was too subtle for me to notice. Overall this is hardly a must see and if you plan to watch just one version of 'Flatliners' I'd go with the original unless you are a real fan of one of the stars... that said I certainly don't regret watching it.",Flatliners
8,Quinoa1984,More like... STUPID-LINERS RIGHT?,3,30 September 2017,"Look, a lot of remakes or reboots or whatever you want to call them (Rebooquel sounds like something that might come from outer space so the less said the better), they are the same because they are based on the foundations of either good or great films - sometimes they can be something else that is interesting, but with the rare exceptions they don't improve on the originals. Flatliners had the potential, however, to be something more since the 1990 Joel Schumacher film was not very good, though it certainly had its ambitions and young stars who were game for a Frankenstein-cum-Elm-Street premise. The saddest thing is the remake does nothing visually to distinguish itself, and more infuriatingly does diddly squat at the script level to find new ideas for its premise.Think about it: you can get someone to use some medical equipment to stop your heart, wait for a minute or two (or more!) while you are dead, and then can resurrect you so one can see what you went through while in that almost-all-gone phase of deadness. Is there a ""light"" at the end of the tunnel, or anything else? That's the meat that the 1990 Flatliners hung itself on, and while the script was mostly (surprisingly) under-cooked, in Schumacher there were no lack of off the wall visual ideas and the production design was off-balance, but it was certainly never boring. The 2017 Flatliners from the Swedish ""Dragon Tattoo"" director Oprev (and written by, of all people, the guy who scripted Source Code) is not interesting visually or striking in any way. This has the visual panache of tax attorney.There is also some major mistaking going on at the casting level; at the least when you had that movie back in the 90's, you had that cast who had charisma to burn and could play off each other well (Oliver Platt had something to prove, man!) Here, with the exception of Ellen Page, no one is really bringing anything to the table and what the filmmakers have them do through the run time is either run-of-the-mill in terms of the story, or they kill off the *one* character that could keep us engaged with the material. Oh, and Keifer Sutherland shows up as discount House, MD, and what COULD be a connection to the original film - is this a sequel, may-hap - never materializes, making it simply an easy paycheck.Why was this made if not a chance to explore some narrative or visual possibilities in the genre? Why not make it scary and push the R rating (this is PG-13) for audiences who are ready for a dark, suspenseful psychological thriller where young medical students who should know better have to grapple with the bad s*** they've done? This Flatliners isn't interested in that, either, and each character (Page included, and I don't count Diego Luna as he's the one who doesn't go for the flatlilining, and all we know about him is he's an ex-fireman, so who cares) has one note and only one trauma they have to re-experience in their half-hallucination-half-real state. The flaws from the original are not corrected, and the laziness amplifies it all. Not to mention at 110 minutes this feels punishingly long, and when the aforementioned character is out of the picture there's another half hour to go that feels like FIVE hours.This is bland, stale, overheated garbage that made me literally BOO in my seat once it was done, not for anyone in particular in the theater, just because I could do it. It's one thing to get a remake that disappoints simply for existing (i.e. Ghostbusters last year), but it's another when you see what could have been in the hands of a twisted, hungry auteur out to show some shocking things - picture, for example, Tarsem circa The Cell, or Leos Carax or something - or a filmmaker who might want to just use the material for a straight drama and not go for the horror, which could also be done. Instead, Flatliners is stupid when it's not dull, and yet it's not stupid often enough to be an overall enjoyably bad movie (I did laugh here and there, but too little and too late). It's everything that is wrong with what SONY is currently doing in an overlong 110 minute package.",Flatliners
9,hitchcockthelegend,Line of flatness for fans of the original - for others not so much.,6,22 July 2018,"Strictly on a personal level, I always felt that the original Flatliners was average at best. A missed opportunity to use the premise for frightening results, to unnerve, unhinge, whilst intelligently examining the life after death question. So when news of this 2017 remake broke I wasn't in the least bit surprised, the idea at the narrative core was ripe for further filmic delvings.Niels Arden Oplev's 2017 version is itself problematic, and a long way from being all the things I so wanted from the original film, but at least it has its own twists, a supernatural slant for scares. The makers are also to be applauded for making a truly bold decision in the story, rendering complaints about this not offering anything new as being redundant. 
Chances are that if you are a fan of the original film you will hate this, if like me you have no affinity to it then this is an ok time waster. While for those not familiar with the 1990 pic can go in for some mild shock and afterlife dalliances. 6/10",Flatliners
10,george.schmidt,Hit the snooze button.,6,1 October 2017,"FLATLINERS (2017) ** Ellen Page, Diego Luna, Nina Dobrev, James Norton, Kiersey Clemons, Kiefer Sutherland. Yet another remake no one was clamoring for - to wit - this witless and wan re-boot of the 1990's sci-fi thriller (which was lackluster to begin with) has another quintet of medical students attempting to discover the boundless answers in near-death experiences with little or no consequence. While the state of the art technology is nothing but eye-candy the insipid screenplay by Peter Filardi (um, why the hell bring back Sutherland's character from the original and give him Nothing To Do?!?) and listless direction by Niels Arden Oplev will have you in REM mode (if not for the vapid 'actors' outside of Page and Luna to the mix).

11,neil-476,Not very good,4,8 May 2018,"Medical intern Courtney prevails upon colleagues dumb Jamie and overworked and overstressed Sophia to help her research into brain activity after death by stopping her heart and then restarting it a couple of minutes later, having recorded a brain scan during her death. Hottie Marlo also has a go when she finds out. Only conscientious Ray shuns death, although he does help them out.Kiefer Sutherland was in the original Flatliners, and he cameos here, in a film which is as dumb as a suitcase full of sausages. Never mind the basic premise, how about the fact that these young medics are fortunate enough to be able to experiment in a fully equipped but unused spare hospital in the basement of the hospital they work at? A spare hospital? Right... And their only problem is fitting their experiments in between the routine of the cleaning crew which, every day, cleans this spare hospital in which all the equipment is under heavy dust sheets.Let's turn to the film itself, and consider these after-death experiences. Apart from the fact that they are shot through a not-very-jazzy filter, they seem more or less indistinguishable from real life - that's the way to suck an audience in, thrill us with extreme normality.Anyway, back to the plot: it turns out that all of the four have guilty consciences concerning deaths, and then things start happening. Are they psychological? Or did the trips to the other side tap into something? Well, the answer you get doesn't stand up to close examination, and is the dumbest part of a dumb film.I cast a vote for the girls in sports bras, but they fact that they are getting heart massages or defibrillations rather dents the voyeurism aspect.This is the lowest point on Ellen Page's CV so far.",Flatliners
12,AlsExGal,At last somebody besides Disney has made an unnecessary remake,3,14 July 2019,"In this case it would be Columbia. If you have seen the 1990 film there is nothing new here. What you have is updated technology - part of the film involves cell phones - and there is better CGI and a more diverse cast. The underlying lessons of the plot are the same, just how they get there is different. One thing that I felt was really lacking in this film was atmosphere. In the original it seems like it is perpetually Halloween. It is always foggy and the university is littered with gargoyles and religious imagery. And shame on Kiefer Sutherland for doing a cameo that has nothing to do with his character Nelson in the original 1990 film. That would have been an interesting flash forward.Because the original was made almost 30 years ago is the only reason I can figure that some people give it a positive review. I give it three stars for the technical team, which seems to be the only stars I give to many modern movies these days. Where are the original ideas? Every generation has its storytellers and visionaries, are the studio suits freezing them out because they are afraid of offending someone or more afraid of not making a profit than they are of making a mediocre film? The original Flatliners was probably about a 7/10, not a great movie but worth seeing. It did not need to be remade.",Flatliners
13,trashgang,flat indeed,5,18 December 2017,"So here we go, another reboot of a classic horror flick. The 1990 version had something to offer and was original back then. So why this reboot? On the other hand the producers were smart enough to put Nina Dobrev (ex Vampire Diaries) in it to attract the youngsters to waych this flick. But be honest, you can't say that all the acting was Oscar worthy.But not only that. Like the Vampire Diaries this flick has nothing to offer for the horror geeks. There's no gore or scary parts to see so clearly made for the PG-13 kiddies, and it's there that Nina fits in perfectly. She looks indeed again like a vamp but the main problem is that she is afraid to show anything. Full swimsuit for example, and then the laughable sex scene she has, only to reveal her bra going open to show her back. If you want to be the sexy chick then show it. And this has nothing to do with #metoo. The story itself is okay but the editing is sometimes so weird. Like the boat scene.At the end a knife is used, suddenly we are in another day. What happened after the stabbing? Where's the ghost? The effects are the only thing worth seeing. Once they flatline and we go into the brains it do delivers. I agree, I am an old horror buff who likes the old school horrors or the new ones who deliver the red stuff and gore (Jigsaw for example amongst others). But this here isn't made for the older ones but is another example why reboots doesn't work if you make it a PG-13. Just watch the Evil Dead (2013) which does what it has to do. I was looking forward to see this (and to see Kiefer Sutherland from the original one) but I was left again with a bitter feeling, guess a lot did seeing the rating.

15,Hellmant,It's what's to be expected from a PG-13 redo.,6,5 October 2017,"'FLATLINERS': Three Stars (Out of Five)A remake of the hit 1990 horror flick (of the same name) about medical students experimenting with near death experiences. This film stars Ellen Page, Diego Luna, Nina Dobrev, James Norton, Kiersey Clemons and Kiefer Sutherland (who also starred in the original movie, with Julia Roberts and Kevin Bacon). It was directed by Niels Arden Oplev (who also helmed the original 'THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO'), and it was written by Ben Ripley (who also wrote the 2011 sci-fi hit 'SOURCE CODE'). The film has gotten mostly negative reviews from critics, and it's also disappointed at the Box Office so far. I found it to be mostly unoriginal, and unexciting, but it does have it's moments, and it's a great idea for a horror film; the original was much better though.Courtney Holmes (Page) is a medical student, studying medical science under the tough Dr. Barry Wolfson (Sutherland). She's been fascinated with death ever since she lost a loved one, in a tragic car accident (she was responsible for) years earlier. Now she's convinced other medical students to experiment with near-death experiences with her, in order to try and understand what death feels like. The experiments go well at first, and the students seem to develop special abilities because of them, but then they're each haunted by horrific side effects.This remake isn't nearly as dark, or horrific, as the original film was (that's to be expected from a PG-13 redo I guess though). It even has a positive message at the end. It kind of feels more like a science fiction adventure, than a horror movie too (to me). The actors are all talented though, and they give decent enough performances in it. I also think Oplev and Ripley are both talented as well. They seemed to miss the mark here though, but it's not a complete waste of time, in my opinion, despite the horrific reviews.Watch an episode of our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at:https://vimeo.com/236806254",Flatliners

This could perhaps be forgiven if the poorly paced piece provided a glimmer of genuine entertainment at any point. Sadly, 'Flatliners (2017)' is a detached and passive experience that provokes absolutely no attachment to its unlikable and unintelligent characters. While it is mostly a technically competent film, with the scare sequences in particular being confidently crafted (if generic) and the music being occasionally inspired, it never properly engages. By the time a sequence that could be considered interesting rolls around, you're already so truly bored that nothing can pull you out of your almost comatose state.

After awakening from clinical death, their sins from the past, in the form of aggressive hallucinations, return to bite their ass, and they must find a way to redeem themselves before it's too late. This is the backbone of both scenarios, but the stories are quite different, so, even though I watched both movies the same day, it was not boring at all. Although it is possible to pair characters from both films based on essential characteristics, their sex, race and background stories are quite different. The story is more complex in the remake and the effects are incomparably better, but the actors and their performances can not be compared with the original cast, that includes Kiefer Sutherland, Julia Roberts, Kevin Bacon, William Baldwin and Oliver Platt. Kiefer Sutherland also appears in the remake, but in a completely irrelevant role. While the atmosphere of the original is dark, mystical and balancing between drama and horror, keeping you in a constant state of tension, remake for the most part has a sterile SF atmosphere, with unconvincing characters, and only in the last third it's gaining strength.

22,Platypuschow,Flatliners: Another remake that simply shouldn't have been,2,3 January 2018,"I liked the original Flatliners, I think it was a clever well constructed movie with a solid cast.Upon hearing of the remake my hackles went up, I hate this reboot culture it's all so very unnecessary. If writers can't come up with something new then they need to step aside for those who can.Flatliners turned out exactly as I expected, a modern updated adaptation which completely misses the point. With a mostly bland cast, rehashed plot and absolutely no originality it's an embarassment.Not since Death Note (2017) have I seen such a ridiculous attempt at a remake. This is truly appalling stuff and further example that we need less remakes and more original movies, or even sequels just not more of what we've already seen.The Good:Kiefer SutherlandThe Bad:Distinctly uninspiredSimply didn't need to existPredictible from the outsetThings I Learnt From This Movie:Ellen Page still looks like a 14yr old Dying makes you horny",Flatliners
23,The-Sarkologist,Should Have Gone to Richmond Instead,2,2 October 2017,"Normally I wouldn't have gone and seen a film like this, except that I saw the original a while ago with a group of friends (and when I saw a while ago, I mean quite a long time ago, back when video stores still hired out video cassettes) and really enjoyed it. As such a part of me wanted to see this one, and then watch the original and compare the two, and to be honest, I really should have just watched the original and left this one to pretty much flounder and die for the travesty that it happens to be.At first I was planning on watching the original so as to compare them, but due to other events I ended up simply watching this film. In the end I am glad that it worked out that was because I doubt that I would have been able to watch too much Flatliners in one weekend, and will simply leave the original for another time, if I end up actually getting around to watching it again (considering that there are so many other movies out there to watch).Anyway, the film is about a group of medical students who decide that they want to see what happens when people die, and to also measure it scientifically. So they basically kill each other, measure what is going on, and then revive them (and I wonder whether this has actually happened in real life). On the positive side, this near death experience changes them for the better, making them smarter and able to recall things much better, but on the negative side it actually digs up sins of the past to haunt them.This is interesting because the idea of being confronted with one's sins is something that is not just apparent in the Christian faith, but in numerous other faiths as well. Sure, many of us in the modern world simply believe that when we die then that is it, but the film does actually confront us with this other idea that what death brings about is a sense of guilt over what we have done in our lives, and that in dying these sins will constantly hound us.However, going away from the theological perspective of the film, in the end it was pretty bad. It simply seemed to be like a lot of other films coming out of late which are taking what was a pretty awesome concept years ago and simply butchering them. It is almost as if Hollywood is looking back at some of these films, thinking that they have been sufficiently forgotten, and that modern audiences aren't all that impressed with the technology at the time, and attempting to up the ante – and failing abysmally. In the end, maybe just leave this films as if, and if you want to bring them back, digitally enhance the original, rather than creating something new.",Flatliners
24,cruise01,Lacking in scares.,4,3 January 2018,"Flatliners a remake about a group of medical students that's experimenting with life after death by stopping there heart for a few minutes and reviving themselves. Only to feel like there brain is rewired to doing things better. Something from there past comes back to haunt them all after there death. Flatliners is a terrible science fiction horror film. It did not have any scares. Or thrills. It was difficult to even care for the characters from the lack of development with its script. Ellen Page was decent as a character that lost someone she loved. Diego Luna was the sensible character there is. Nina Dobrev was terrible. James Norton and Kiersey Clemons had unbelievable performances, which makes it difficult to take them serious as medical students. When these characters experience visions and hauntings there is no scares or thrills. The direction is dull and boring. Overall, Flatliners had a neat concept, but lack the thrills and suspense that it should have been.",Flatliners
25,leonblackwood,Watchable but the original was better!,5,5 April 2018,"Review:
I was in two minds when I saw that they remaking Flatliners, after enjoying the original when I was young but I must admit they didn't do a bad job. The actors were not in the same class as the original movie but the storyline wasn't too bad, even though there wasn't much flatlining going on. It does go a bit dark towards the end, and a couple of the characters were quite annoying but I enjoyed the intensity throughout the film, especially after they played with death. Anyway, the film is about 5 ambitious medical students, Courtney (Ellen Page), Ray (Diego Luna), Marlo (Nina Dobrev), Jamie (James Norton) and Sophia (Kiersey Clemons), who are fighting to become the next big thing in the medical world. Courtney comes up with an idea, to stop her heart for a short period, which will trigger a near-death experience, so she asks her friends, Sophia and Jamie, to help her with the experiment in a old part of the hospital. Towards the end of the experiment, they have problems bringing her back to life, so they call on Ray to help them. Marlo follows Ray to the bottom of the hospital, and they manage to bring Courtney back to life, which bonds them close together. The near-death experience enhances Courtney's brain, which makes them all want to Flatline, but there past soon catches up with them, and they have to face the sins that they committed earlier on in life. I liked the fact that the director spent some time introducing each of the characters, and that they all had their own reasons to do the experiment but Ray didn't get a back story. Personally, I wasn't that impressed with the whole horror aspect of the film but it's still worth a watch, especially if you was a fan of the original. Watchable!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Niels Arden Oplev, who brought you Dead Man Down starring Colin Farrell, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo in 2009 and a few movies made for the Danish market. Michael Douglas, who produced the first Flatliners, returned to produce this movie, and Kiefer Sutherland, who was the star of the original film, also returned to play the head doctor, but it still didn't make an impact like the 1990 classic. The original only made $61.3million, with a $26million budget, and it was the third blockbuster from Joel Schumacher with the modern day Brat Pack, before Julia Roberts became one of the highest paid women in Hollywood. Personally I think that this movie needed an established director, and a bigger budget to touch the original, and some of the actors weren't that great.Budget: $19million

26,TheMovieDiorama,"Flatliners delivers an interesting concept, but slowly declines into the hellish battleground that is commonly known as: clichés.",5,27 February 2018,"Having never watched the Joel Schumacher original, the trailer immediately caught my interest. Ellen Page, Diego Luna, surreal visions, afterlife...the recipe for a thrilling flick was there. Whilst this does not deserve the harsh criticism that it has received, it's still not great either. Essentially five medical students run experiments to find out what happens to our brain activity when we die. But then being brought back to life has resulted in their past haunting them. And so we have ourselves a tale of forgiveness. Owning up to our sins and not just forgiving other people, but forgiving yourselves. Somehow, if you die and come back to life...your past mistakes will come to murder you. That is where the stupidity resides in this plot. The third act was absurdly generic and negated the interesting medical premise that the first act built up! I don't need tame jump scares and creepy imagery to keep me thrilled! No. Give me the pseudo-science ideas and concepts, that is what intrigued me. Or if we look deeper into the story, is it actually a metaphor for the ridiculous stress that medical student go under? If this was directed by Darren Aronofsky, then maybe. But it's not. Clichéd plot aside, I found the characters to be relatable and found their interactions to be natural. A close friendship between the group, however I did find some of the love interests to be forced and the fact they all did something terrible was such a plot convenience. James Norton was probably the best performance, everyone else just played themselves. Ellen Page acts the same like in every other film (yet somehow I still warm to her...) and I wanted more from Diego Luna. I have to say the sound editing was pretty good. Liked the flatline noise mixing in with the musical score, was a nice touch. But...not enough to save this from mediocrity. An intelligent first act, a thrilling second act and a damn clichéd third act. Not utterly terrible, but not amazing.",Flatliners
27,jtindahouse,A mess from start to finish,4,31 December 2018,"When I finished watching 'Flatliners' I had to go and see who had written the screenplay and made this film as clunky and unwatchable as it is at times. I was shocked to see that it was written by Ben Ripley who also wrote the quite brilliant 'Source Code'. How those two films were both written by the same person I will never know. 'Flatliners' is actually a fun concept, it's the way that they've gone about it that makes it the unpopular film it is. The fact that I still managed to mildly enjoy myself on some level shows just how strong of an idea this actually was (and yes I am aware that it was a remake).Firstly, the characters are just awful. They made the mistake of going for beauty over charisma. Maybe they thought Ellen Page could be the exception and carry the entire personality side of things by herself. I assure you she did not. Plus when the cast is as good looking as it is then none of the actors actually look like doctors and it just completely takes you out of the movie. Then finally, the character of 'Jamie', played by James Norton, was about as unlikeable as characters come. I think they were trying to have a story arc on his character where he does a 180. It didn't work and just made you hate him and all his friends for associating with him. Also for doctors these characters do some incredibly dumb things at times. Sheesh.Then there's the structuring of the script. Almost the entire first half of the film (if not more) seems to be taken up with character after character going through the ""Flatlining"" process. Once was fine, but we don't need to see it over and over again in full length each time. How this wasn't cut out in the editing room I'll never know, especially considering the film goes for 110 minutes, which is comfortably 20 minutes too long.Finally the ending of the film and how things are resolved was about the laziest, most uninspired and dull I've ever seen in a film. You have to see it to actually believe it. This film needed a dark ending with some thoughtfulness behind it to in some way redeem itself. Mind you, maybe that wouldn't have even helped because by the time the ending came around I cared very little about the fate of these characters anyway.I couple of things I did like (just so it isn't all doom and gloom) were that at least the visions that are seen are actually a genuine threat to the characters. Too often films show scary imagery but it isn't in any way effective because it has no actual consequence on the characters. Also there is a death scene in the film that caught me off guard and I applaud them for having the balls to do that. Otherwise though 'Flatliners' isn't much worth your time, energy or money. Look elsewhere.",Flatliners

30,tadpole-596-918256,"Sony Pictures really ""blows the whistle"" upon Canada . . .",4,10 October 2017,". . . with this latest version of FLATLINERS. It will come as no surprise to anyone who's ever been hassled by a Canadian Border Goon that most if not all Canadians have multiple murder skeletons in their closets. ""Ray"" (played by Diego Luna) is the only major character in FLATLINERS who's NOT a killer on the lam, and that's because he's the ONLY American here, hailing from Houston. FLATLINERS depicts Canadian Highways as Murderer's Row, with ""Courtney"" texting as she drives her sisters to their deaths off a bridge, and ""Marlo"" committing multiple hit-and-runs, the last against a Sidewalk Café. USA Today recently reported that about 99% of Mexican felonies go unsolved, but FLATLINERS depicts a Perfect 100% escape rate for all these wanton Canadian killers. FLATLINERS might constitute a public service of sorts, if it was only perky enough to keep movie goers awake.

However, the experiments with the afterlife have unforeseen results as the students' pasts come back to haunt them - literally.Whilst the notion of medics looking into the afterlife presents an intriguing sci-fi / horror idea, this rather sadly opts to go for standard horror tropes eg white faced spirits, jumpy bits, vast over the top fantasy special effects etc. This is a shame because the cast are not at all bad, particularly Norton - showing clear star quality here, but it's a rather so so script and the last third repetitive and somewhat dull.Overall then something of a missed opportunity but nowhere near as awful as some critics and die hard original film lovers would have you believe.",Flatliners

I really enjoyed the Afterlife type of trippy stuff that's all visually good & i like how the slick sci-fi Thriller moves into Supernatural Horror as the film goes on & each person who ""Went Under"" starts to experience all sorts of weird stuff that starts out abit fun but turns sinister.

35,TdSmth5,Not as good as it should have been,5,9 May 2018,"A girl crashes her car while using her phone killing her sister. Ten years later the girl (Courtney) is, I guess, a resident physician at a hospital when a patient who had a near death experience asks her if she's lost a loved one. We meet a couple of her colleagues: an overly sweet and insecure black girl (Sophia), a bright heavily accented Latino (Ray), a Brit playing a rich arrogant American (Jamie), a confident girl (Marlo). Next we know, Courtney coaxes Jamie and Sophia into killing her and reviving her after a minute while her brain is being scanned--all in the name of science of course. The two struggle mightily to revive her until the competent Ray arrives to save the day. While dead, Courtney has something of a beautiful cosmic experience. But something also starts to haunt her, which later takes on the shape of the dead sister. At the same time, Courtney has become a medical genius, impressing everyone with her knowledge and playing expertly the piano. Jamie of course wants a taste of that. He's next to flatline and has a nice experience riding around the city in a bike with a girl. But he also starts having visions/hearing stuff, namely the girl is haunting him. Sophia insists that she wants to do it so she can become smarter. She also starts being haunted by a girl she bullied in high school. Marlo follows and again she brings back with her ghost of a guy she killed in residence by mistake. Ray doesn't want to have anything to do with this but sticks around to save the lives of the other fools. The visions start getting deadly and the remaining kids suspect that somehow they have to atone for their past sins to rid themselves of the evil. Will they able to do it in time before their end up dead?I don't think I've seen the original Flatliners so I'm not interested in whether this movie is better or worse or whether it's true to that one. The idea of course is excellent but by now, horror movies where past sins start haunting people are all too common. The cast here is excellent and everyone does a solid job. As always Ellen Page shines and steals the show, although it took me a while to get used to her completely unnecessary cosmetic surgery look. That she still hasn't won a major award is bizarre. With a good story and a strong cast, this movie should have worked easily. But it doesn't. And it's not clear at all why. It comes across like the work of a first-time director, editor, and/or screenwriter, but it isn't. So it's hard to understand why this movie is often sloppy and why there are so many mistakes. Still, it's a watchable, mild horror thriller, with a good-looking cast and without a brilliant English character, finally. It has a moral message at the end but that doesn't make up for it's shortcomings unfortunately.",Flatliners
36,rgkarim,Dead On Many Factors,6,30 September 2017,"Death, the inevitable destination that we are constantly reminded of in the various forms of media. We spend all our time trying to postpone it that sometimes we miss out on life itself. This weekend's remake though focuses on hastening to that endpoint all in the name of science. I'm talking about Flatliners, a movie that many may be ""deathly"" afraid to see for one reason or another, however this reviewer is back in the theater to bring you some information on the latest silver screen picture. Let's go!LIKES:Pretty Cast: You get this from the trailers, but Flatliners is another example of pretty faces taking full front in a movie. Like MTV meets a horror film, this cast will make young and old hearts beat as the characters dress in either preppy fashion or tight clothing to get the blood pumping. Made up faces sparkle in the light, despite the ever-pressing doom hanging over them, and even in their worst they still look incredible. Very important qualities in a movie. Morals Wrapped in Horror: A better reward of this movie is the impressive delivery of some important lessons, one of which was rather personal to me. The first is not to play with the defibrillator to study death, a lesson we all thought we knew, but guess we could use a refresher. Second is to take responsibility for your actions, and make up for them in an honorable manner. Third is all about forgiveness, something that everyone can use a reminder of in terms of accepting apologies of those that are sincere. While a bit theatrical at times, Flatliners delivers its lessons solidly, integrating it into the plot and making it fit well into the story. This gooey, moral driven center is the sweet reward of the movie and perhaps my favorite component of the movie. Decent Characters: Horror movies often have idiots for characters, or so blatantly shallow you can't help but root for them to meet their end. Not the case in this film. Flatliner's crew, despite the stupid desire to meet death, actually feel like relatable characters. Their friendship, their flaws, and their fears were relevant to me, and were well-acted by our beautiful cast. As such, these characters are little easier to latch onto and invest your time into, following them through the nightmare they unleashed. For me, it was Diego Luna I grasped on to the most, his character being a keystone into connecting the elements of the plot.Short Run Time: Always nice when a horror movie doesn't drag out too long, lost in the unnecessary details that often aren't needed. Flatliners did a decent job trimming the fat, keeping things concise (if a bit rushed) and essential to explaining our character's backstory, while still keeping the plot moving. DISLIKES:Not Scary: Perhaps it's me seeing so many movies, but Flatliners again failed to shock me. Outside of the looks they wear when they stop their own hearts, the movie doesn't remotely focus on scares of any sort. There are few vivid images that start down the path, but these fizzle out and become lost in a rather vague concept. Throw in the rather lax attacks of the entity and well there isn't much more to build on to explain the calm pace this movie takes. Vague Creature: The trailers portray something being unleashed, but Flatliners does a poor job explaining what it is. A spirit? A demon? Their minds breaking from all the stress? The answer is left for you to decipher, but don't expect much in terms of the evil taking any form. This not only robs the movie of potential scares, but also makes the story confusing and more towards a drama than anything else. While this gets points for making you think, I still would have liked a little more imagination into my monster, or whatever it was. Rushed Elements: While the characters are better than most horrors, they still are mere shadows to great story works. Flatliners' dilemmas are hastened through on many levels, a rather pathetic climax with a resolution obtained more easily than the Hulk Smashing through a building. Some characters got their just desserts on development, but others got off a little easier than expected. But development would mean a longer movie, so I can't be too upset. Predictable: It's hard to throw surprises in these days, but Flatliners was a little too familiar for my tastes. In addition to the scares, much of the tale was easy to see coming, and following that pathway just takes away from the originality factor. With this gone, the special feeling of this movie is further reduced to just another weekend filler. The VERDICTFlatliners is another example of modern, horror movies with superficial glimmer that is merely gold paint. A pretty cast and good morals don't offset the fact that movie is just not scary enough, nor original enough, to garnish a theater visit. The abstract monster that dwells within us all gets you thinking, but come on, we want something to make us lose sleep at night. Therefore, this mediocre remake gets the following:Drama/Horror/Sci-Fi: 6.5 Movie Overall: 5.0",Flatliners
37,Kingslaay,Not all that bad,7,30 September 2017,"Flatliners captured my attention due to its intriguing and unique plot. The premise and trailer showed a different type of thriller. To my surprise it was also a horror film and the 2nd half actually showcased a lot of horror scenes. Many would consider this film to actually be scarier than featured horror films like IT. The acting was decent and the story was somewhat engaging to follow and see it through. We were intrigued by the unique experiment the stressed students were performing and even more interested by the effects. The latter film was a series of bad effects that were all too real and brought back inner demons. This aspect had a lot of potential to be deepened. I agree the film could have been made better by having more character development and showing them conquering guilt or demons. Perhaps the film could have started in the past for all of them showing their previous mistakes, instead we only saw Ellen Page's character have this scenario. However I still think it was somewhat enjoyable despite being scary and deserves a higher rating. 6.8/10",Flatliners
38,eric262003,This Reboot Needs The Boot Where The Sun Doesn't Shine,5,4 June 2018,"So here we have a reboot of movie that was never needed let alone a movie that came out in 1990 that even people back then hardly ever remembered. If only I was sitting next to Muppet characters Statler and Waldorf and we would have a ball hurling heckles at this abortion of film that is ""Flatiners"" just to tell Hollywood, we don't need anymore pointless reboots and to come up with original ideas instead.There's no point in rebooting a film that already bad before, so why now?Prior to watching this remake of ""Flatliners"" I saw the original 1990 Joel Schumacher movie to see how poorly executed this movie was by starring five medical students who experimentally kill each other to see what dimensions are in the hereafter. Cut to 2017, and all we get is the same exact rehashing without any new twists or angles or anything new to unravel during the supposed 27 years of scientific research into the unknown. The end result is lacks in anything engaging to say while the characters have little to be emphatic about. The script was penned by Ben Ripley with some credit given to Peter Filardi the original screenwriter decided to up the technological ante by adding an MRI machine for these students to experiment with while they like their audience go brain dead for five minutes. All for naught this MRI apparatus was there to inject modern machinery into the story to make us forget this is a reboot. This sets some alarming questions to boot. If these students are given access to the fully equipped abandoned section of hospital in the basement to conduct their bizarre experiments, are they not being under surveillance?The new group of medical students are an improvement from their predecessors of 1990 film being that there's three females and two males taking part in this research study instead of four guys and the token girl. The ethnic diversity is well established too as we have mixed bag of cultures instead of an all Caucasian roster we had in 1990. But the ages within these characters are truly put in question. I'll say that Marlo (Nina Dobrev) and Sophia (Kiersey Clemons) are just around the rightful age to play medical students. Courtney (Ellen Page) the mastermind behind this wack initiative is thirty, but still can pass off younger than her actual age. However, Jamie (James Norton) is quite long in the face for a thirty-two year old. And the maturity level of Diego Luna's Ray was passed due to his nine years as a firefighter in Houston has no significance to his line of work or experience. Sure there are late-bloomers in every field of work, but this experiment these students are conducting is geared towards a more youthful curiousness as opposed to more older people who should know better which is where the 1990 film worked because the cast (Julia Roberts, Kiefer Sutherland, Kevin Bacon, Billy Baldwin and Oliver Platt) and they looked the part as younger than the roster we have here.To keep up with new technological advances to the this practice, the MRI has little in terms of the plot and wears out its welcome rather quickly. So Courtney now discover she has the gift of baking bread from her grandmother's recipe book and could play piano without years of practice. Sophia can solve a Rubik's Cube in no time. But then things from their past comes back to haunt them as people they hurt return for revenge and now they must go out and repair the damage they've done. The 1990 original movie didn't make it seem haunting, but here in this reboot, they did the scares a little too over-the-top as an excuse to generate a reaction from the audience. Director Niels Arden Oplev seems to get under the skin of the five student doctors that their lives like so many others have been laden with guilt and that their quest for redemption has more if not grim meanings behind it.Even though this reboot takes a more haunting twist to the original, like its predecessor, it still fails to decide what genre it wants to be. Is there a supernatural entity lurking in all their near-death experiences or have they seen a new lease on life to make them softer? It's like it wants to be one genre but tries to be a bit of each (drama, thriller, horror with some bits of comedy). Hell, it even makes itself seem intelligent when it's anything but. They try to be cheeky by casting Kiefer Sutherland in the cast because he was in the original 1990 film as he plays the student teacher's doctor. But it turns out he's playing Dr. Barry Wolfson and not Dr. Nelson Wright from the 1990 movie. It would've been cool if the students found some nots from Dr. Wright's desk that were meant to be destroyed and taken advantage to it. or they were placed there to further quench his curious ways into seeking answers to other people's journey to afterlife for further research. There are many ways they could go with Sutherland's existence instead of just playing for laughs.There was just no reasons, purpose or motives as to why this film was green-lit in the first place. When Marlo said ""We're beyond explanations as to why we're having these macabre manifestations brewing in their minds"". Sorry I can't agree with you on that one. Hollywood needs to invest in new stories dying to be made and stop with the reboots. It's becoming too much.",Flatliners

41,bkrauser-81-311064,Barely Worth the Autopsy,6,5 October 2017,"I may be alone in saying this but I think a Flatliner's (1990) remake wasn't initially the worst idea in the world. I've always said that the ideal remake fodder is the types of movies where the original's objectively good premise didn't effectively gel with audiences and critics at the time. Flatliner's, the story of a bunch of medical students dying and reviving each other to give firsthand accounts of the afterlife is one such movie. It had an intelligent, worthwhile story and interesting characters that were all unfortunately undone by an overheated sense of self and a campiness that was uniquely 90's. Could a second swing at this property give it the attention it deserves? The newest reincarnation of Flatliners isn't so much a swing and a miss as it is a strikeout looking. No attempt was made to improve on the formula. No attempt was made to update, or fix or toggle or even clarify the original's intent. It's just a boring, uninspired, flat-looking drudge. It's as gripping as a late season episode of ER (1994-2009) and as insightful as a fortune cookie. Someone should have told the makers of this thing that if they wanted near-death experiences you need to be alive to begin with.The all-star ensemble of the campy original is replaced by a gaggle of kinda familiar faces. Replacing Kiefer Sutherland as the lead doctor with a death wish is Ellen Page whose recent experience with death has left her unable to focus on her studies. The film wrongly thinks that the tragedy of her dead sister will ground the story but instead it opens a Pandora's Box of expositional minutia. As much as the original's cold open bewildered and confused, it at least allowed the audience to piece things together and give the film an air of mystery. This movie seems more concerned with the accuracy of medical terminology than anything; highlighting that the one thread they all have in common is finding medical school hard to get through.Of course, Flatliners isn't all bad – you have largely the premise to thank for that. Those with bargain bin expectations and absolutely no idea this thing is a remake, may walk out thinking they saw a slightly below average PG-13 horror film. To that end the cast isn't atrocious they're just stuck in a lose-lose scenario. I'd even go so far as to say James Norton of British TV fame is fairly compelling; though that may be because he's the only actor with something to prove. Everyone else is enough of a face for a casting director to go, ""let's get what's-her-name from Flatliners to play the love interest."" So yeah, Flatliners is a dud but not a Top 10 Worst Movie of the Year kind of dud. It's more the kind of dud that people will forget they saw a week after they saw it. Frankly as far as bad remakes it's not even worth an autopsy. It lived and died quite unremarkably.",Flatliners
42,m-47826,Disappointing and forgettable.,3,6 October 2021,"I'm not a big fan of the original either. But it's a real mistake they got rid of Helen Page so early on. True it was unexpected and risky, like killing off Drew Barrymore at the beginning of Scream. But none of the remaining female cast members, were able to give a performance as good as she did. As a former fan of Nina Dobrev, I could see she was clearly miscast for the material she was given. Same thing applies to Diego Luna and Kiersey Clemons. Only James Norton gave a believable portrayal of his character, and his backstory. The script has interesting ideas, and managed to adapt the original story in the 21st century. But, the bad casting for the second half of the film, can never highlight this. And it suddenly turns into a silly mess, with bad acting and an ending that don't even make sense.",Flatliners

A refresh of sound track, fashion, effects and some gender shuffling perhaps?
It turns out, yeah that is about it.The cast are pretty good.
Everyone holds their own at being young, stereotypical, rich Americans, so good looking you could eat ice cream off them.
The characters are ok but seem a little too smart to guard the skeletons in their closets for as long as they do.The build-up and front end of the story are pretty serviceable and I enjoyed myself for a bit.Where the film really falls down is the later half.
The pay off from the other-world experiences are so limp and weak it really makes you wonder what the fuss is about.The bullying element - which was so memorable in the original - has been modernised to include some sexting malarkey but is completely watered-down.
Before any of her crimes comes home to roost the character makes amend by spending about the same amount of effort it takes to order a Starbucks, then all is forgiven.Keifer Sutherland is wheeled out for nostalgia purposes but adds nothing. You can almost feel him grimace as he exits the two painfully laboured scenes that were shoehorned in for him.It feels like the makers of this movie were really enjoying making this until they realised it was all you can eat wings in the bar opposite, so wrapped the whole thing up and took a half day.Ellen Page is pretty good, the effects are OK but the sum of all this is greatly less than the original.Just watch the original.",Flatliners
46,rockman182,Flatliners (2017),6,1 October 2017,"I wasn't overly fond of the original, so when I heard that this film was getting a remake I was unenthusiastic about it. However, seeing as its 31 days of horror I thought I'd use the opportunity to make this the first entry in my month of films. The film is directed by Niels Arden Oplev who made the Swedish Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, which was excellent. So it was interesting to check out this film and see what Oplev would be able to bring into a film that was kind of eh to begin with.The film is about a group of young medical students who start experimenting with near death experiences, stopping their heart and reviving shortly after, in attempts to answer questions about the afterlife and what is seen in those brief moments. At first it seems that the experiences create positive experiences in memory and creativity but it turns out that something haunts the students. Its hard for them to separate reality from the horrifying images they say and they must find a way to pull through.I don't see Ellen Page in enough things these days so this was a rare treat. It was an odd assembly of cast but they all did fine. While the film doesn't offer a whole lot of originality, I felt like the film was interesting enough despite having some very poor writing at many times. The films resolution is stale and seems too easy. It actually divulges into becoming a bit of an unfocused mess. Once the film commits to becoming a full fledged horror it becomes derivative. The jump scares are quite predictable and the film loses a bit of the fun it made for itself earlier.Overall, this is a throwaway film that I don't think anyone will think twice about. Its a nice chance to see talent like Diego Luna and Ellen Page (and HOT Nina Dobrev). Kiefer Sutherland is in the film but its a role completely unrelated to that of the original. Its stupid because a lot of what the characters are able to do after they flatline makes no sense. A lot of this film is poorly written and makes your head scratch. Its pretty entertaining, at least I found it that way despite it being a horribly executed idea that was rehashed from the original.6/10",Flatliners

48,bob-the-movie-man,The undiscovered country which they shouldn't have returned to.,5,6 October 2017,"The movies have depicted the hereafter in varied ways over the years. From the bleached white warehouses of Powell and Pressburger's ""A Matter of Life and Death"" in 1946 and Warren Beatty's ""Heaven Can Wait"" in 1978 to – for me – the peak of the game: Vincent Ward's mawkish but gorgeously rendered oil-paint version of heaven in 1998's ""What Dreams May Come"". Joel Schmacher's 1990's ""Flatliners"" saw a set of ""brat pack"" movie names of the day (including Kevin Bacon, Julia Roberts, William Baldwin and Kiefer Sutherland) as experimenting trainee doctors, cheating death to experience the afterlife and getting more than they bargained for. The depictions of the afterlife were unmemorable: in that I don't remember them much! (I think there was some sort of spooky tree involved, but that's about it!)But the concept was sufficiently enticing – who isn't a little bit intrigued by the question of ""what's beyond""? – that Cross Creek Pictures thought it worthy of dusting off and giving it another outing in pursuit of dirty lucre. But unfortunately this offering adds little to the property's reputation. In this version, the lead role is headed up by Ellen Page (""Inception"") who is a great actress too good for this stuff. Also in that category is Diego Luna, who really made an impact in ""Rogue One"" but here has little to work with in terms of backstory. The remaining three doctors – Nina Dobrev as ""the sexy one""; James Norton (""War and Peace"") as ""the posh boy"" and Kiersey Clemons as the ""cute but repressed one"", all have even less backstory and struggle to make a great impact. Also putting in an appearance, as the one link from the original film, is Kiefer Sutherland as a senior member of the teaching staff. But he's not playing the same character (that WOULD have been a bloody miracle!) and although Sutherland adds gravitas he really is given criminally little to do. What was director Niels Arden Oplev (""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"") thinking?In terms of the story, it's pretty much a re-hash of Peter Filardi's original, with Ben Ripley (""Source Code"") adding a few minor tweaks to the screenplay to update it for the current generation. But I will levy the same criticism of this film as I levied at the recent Stephen King adaptation of ""It"": for horror to work well it need to obey some decent 'rules of physics' and although most of the scenes work (since a lot of the ""action"" is sensibly based inside the character's heads) there are the occasional linkages to the 'real world' that generate a ""WTF???"" response. A seemingly indestructible Mini car (which is also clearly untraceable by the police!) and a knife incident at the dockside are two cases in point. Is there anything good to say about this film? Well, there are certainly a few tense moments that make the hairs on your neck at least start to stand to attention. But these are few and far between, amongst a sea of movie 'meh'. It's certainly not going to be the worst film I see this year, since at least I wasn't completely bored for the two hours. But I won't remember this one in a few weeks. As a summary in the form of a ""Black Adder"" quote, it's all a bit like a broken pencil.. pointless.(For the graphical version of this review, please visit bob-the-movie- man.com.

49,kjproulx,Why Was This Necessary?,2,1 October 2017,"When it comes to remaking a movie, I'm all for it if it means that they're going to try and make a better movie out of something that wasn't all that impressive to begin with. That being said, if the original film was already solid or decently received by both audiences and critics, then why bother? Flatliners was a film that was released back in 1990, and I quite enjoy that film, even though the overall product has many issues of its own. I didn't see the reason for a remake, but I could see potential in improving it, so I was open-minded. Sadly, Flatliners is one of the worst films I've seen all year. Taking a solid premise and putting a supernatural spin on it for absolutely no apparent reason, bothered me to no end. Here is why Flatliners fails as both a remake and as an original piece to be shown to a new audience. The idea of doctors being capable of flatlining people and bringing them back to life, being able to have conversations about what death is like and going through hallucinations as a side effect is quite interesting; However, this version of the film becomes a supernatural thriller by the time it reaches its third act, making for a very confusing film, due to the fact that there is clearly no physical entity that could ever accomplish these things. This version of this concept just strips away anything that was exciting or intriguing about the original film. Not to compare and contrast, but idea of Flatliners definitely benefits from a more subdued and subtle approach to things. What bothered me was the fact that the majority of the cast seemed capable of being subdued, but the film's screenplay was such a mess that I found myself thinking these actors/actresses deserved better material. In particular, Diego Luna and Ellen Page were actually very good in their respective roles, making for a few emotionally resonant moments, even though the lines they were given were pretty lame. Quite honestly, with a better script, a title change, and a bit of originality, this cast could've worked in a much better movie. Even though the performances are all decent, the fact that this cast was a bunch of youngsters actually annoyed me. The original film was about a group of experienced doctors who had a neat idea, and were much more capable of being able to bring each other back to life. This time around, it's a group of students who have just enough knowledge in maybe being able to bring each other back. This notion alone was a scripting mistake, because it just becomes a story about naive young students who become obsessed with someone's experiment. I found no attachment to any of these characters and none of them really had a reason for wanting to die (with the exception of one or two without spoiling anything), which left me not caring from frame one. In the end, this film benefits from a strong enough cast (for the most part) and the concept itself is very interesting, but all you have to do is watch the original to see how it should be done. This film tries too many new things, and quite frankly fails at pretty much all of them. Having terrible dialogue, an unnecessary supernatural turn of events, and a climax that turns into a straight up horror flick, I found myself not caring what the outcome for each of the characters would be. The only thing redeemable about this film is the premise itself, which has been done better in the past, so I can't recommend this movie to anyone, but I do recommend checking out the original Flatliners if you haven't seen it yet.",Flatliners

Five unconvincing medical students carry out a deadly experiment on each-other, they use some obsolete hospital equipment to briefly stop each-others hearts to experience 'life after death' with some sinister dreamscapes and then revive themselves after 2 minutes. Apparently dying and resuscitation gives you superhuman intelligence and a need to party. I'm surprised none of them became latex wearing superheroes.

This is loosely done and rushed, and almost no explanation given, one got is ex GF pregnant and tough she had an abortion, the other killed a police officer giving him the wrong medication, the other OMG who as not done that shared picture of a girl with her 5 grade class mate far from the guy that bullied the boy in the first movie..........and the other got into a car accident on a bridge with her little sister.As soon as they come back from the dead they have special power, hahaha, there brains have been augmented, but they also brought back some bad memories in the form of a spirit, of course they try to scar us but hey its 2017 that don't work like that anymore.All in all this movie is a serious mess, but its well shot so....... giving it a big 2 for effort HA",Flatliners
55,Java_Joe,"It's not a remake, but that's still not an excuse.",1,1 October 2017,"There's been this trend in recent years to remake iconic or at least popular movies from earlier years. For the most part these movies have been met with yawns, disinterest and have been rightfully savaged by the critics and viewers. Occasionally you get a good movie out of it but more often then not it's just a big, costly mistake. And so to get around this studios no longer refer to these movies as remakes, but ""reimaginings"". The idea is take the concept of the movie and and try different things. This still doesn't make it a good idea.The 80's version of Flatliners was an interesting movie. The concept of a group of medical students flatlining and then coming back was original. It brought with it elements of horror, existentialism and how our choices can affect both ourselves and others. This one? I struggled to find a positive to give to it and I still can't. This is a bad movie from every single point of view I can give. It follows the same story of a group of medical students who in effect kill themselves for a short period of time to see what's on the ""other side"". Then before brain damage can occur they are brought back but each brings back with them something from their past and they are in effect haunted by this. It's really the same story as the original even if it's executed in a different way. There's nothing else that needs to be said. Same thing but worse.

59,CineMuseFilms,a gods-in-training story that flatlines to a corny finalé,5,12 October 2017,"Nothing seems to anger the crowd more than a filmmaker who tries to improve on an original. After twenty-seven years, Flatliners (2017) is back with the same story but instead of a science-fiction horror it has been updated into a fictional science thriller. If you consider this film on its own merits and not dwell on how or why it is different from the original, this is an intriguing story with the potential to raise several complex issues about death and redemption.By now the basic storyline is well known. Four out of a group of five friends who are medical students have their hearts stopped for a few minutes to experience death and peer into the beyond. The fifth is the group's sceptic and conscience. Over several days, these gods-in-training take turns dying in an isolated basement ward, avoiding detection by hospital authorities. They record each person's brain activity which shows elevated electrical disturbance in the minutes after death. Each of the four episodes encounters an emergency in the revival process and each has a heightened awareness or an enhanced ability after the experience. They also experience a flashback vision of a past mistake or error of judgement that must be confronted, and deal with it according to stereotype (spoilt rich kid versus poor kind girl). Of course, when you play with death anything can happen and each has a different demon to handle.The film's high-concept premise is the main star of the show: the cast are merely automatons who repetitively carry out the same scenario. The idea that it's possible to see what exists after our heart stops has preoccupied writers and artists since the dawn of time. The medical science constructions placed around this story give it some degree of plausibility and the psychological trauma that follows each person's experience are variations on the theme of 'last-chance for moral redemption'. Given the constraints of the storyline, the acting is mechanical, clichéd, and unremarkable. But that's not the film's major problem: seeing the film's premise repeated four times makes it tedious and takes away its only chance of developing any rising tension. By the time the last person is 'put to death' the film itself has irretrievably flat-lined and limps its way to a corny finalé.It did not have to be this way. Regardless of how Flatliners (2017) differs from Flatliners (1990) there was ample opportunity to take the new version to a higher level. Today's secular millennials are more aware than any generation before it and are curious to explore meanings of life from the perspective of death. The idea that in the twilight between life and death our worst sins come back to haunt us is not a spiritual or paranormal notion but one of earthly morality and redemption. But the film has no serious intentions. Like the young people it depicts, Flatliners (2017) is about thrills not intelligent discourse. In the end, the film gives us neither.",Flatliners

At first, they excel in their everyday lives. But as time passes, they realise that the pros may not be worth the cons. Wow. Where do I start with this dumpster fire of a film. When critiquing a movie, I prefer to not state my opinion as fact and let anyone who'll listen to my opinion decide for themselves. That is not the case with this movie. 'Flatliners' is a literal travesty of a film. With the slim exception, of one minuscule slither of content, these film is a piece of utter garbage from second one until the end. It's not so bad it's good; it's so bad it's unholy. But anyway let me start with the positives.Page.Now onto the negatives, everything else! Every single other performance in this godforsaken piece of gutter trash. James Norton looks less interested in what's going on on screen, than the Nazis were interested in the welfare of non-white people. Nina Dobrev gives as uninspired performance as they come and I genuinely wouldn't have been half surprised if she was on marijuana while they were filming. Kiersey Clemons gives a very limited performance as Other Race Girl, as does Diego Luna as Token Other Race Guy. I'm not being racist; I'm being honest. Each character falls into the very inspiring and GENIUS reinventions of the wheel, such as Smart Person, Hot Guy, Hot Girl, Other Race Girl and Other Race Guy. It is literally like Oprev was throwing darts at a board when he let these people be these characters. 'Mein Kempf' had more innovation and creativity. The only things that were missing to fulfil the holy collection of heavenly laziness would be the stereotypical gay guy, and the Jew.The story for this movie was also unbelievably awful. There is less creativity and 'fun' in this movie than there are Gay Fan fictions in the West burro Baptist Church Psycho Cult Induction Guide(If you got offended at this, then you deserve to be offended). I'm not good at predicting were a film is gonna go and genuinely don't try and predict it. But with this film, I was pretty much reciting the script without even reading it. It's the most clichéd, blatantly lazy script I've ever 'read'. How did a script this bad get anywhere past the bins?The other main issue I have with this movie are the atrocious scares. I despise horror movies because I dislike being scared, but I was disappointed that I wasn't scared in this movie. And you know what the sad thing is? The scares have EXCELLENT buildup but then NO payoff. It's stupid. SpongBob is a more mentally scarring product of entertainment than this movie. No joke. There are more disturbing and creepy scenes in SPONGEBOB than there are in an adult horror movie. I'm not making this up or exaggerating. Honestly, if you feel genuine fear from this movie: you're either 5 years old OR there is something wrong with you. Overall, Flatliners 2017 was a utter mess of epic proportions. It was atrocious. Please don't waste your money on it. It's not 'The Room' it's just bad. I'll rate 2017's 'Flatliners' 1 'Possessed Radios' out of 10.",Flatliners

except very few aditions. The ones that are worthy or feel necessary
today are the remakes that brings new and fresh ideas to the table. 
to make something unique. There should be a Law against just ripping of the entire original Movie and then somehow make it worse then ever Before.
why there is such a high demand in Hollywood to remake and cash in on successful classics and cult Movies I have no idea. The youth today doesn't actually want it. The ones with any brain can see that the thing or evild dead, or dawn of the dead is superior to the new one etc. Why do they keep destroying their own legacy? I have no clue.
First of all remakes of the horror genre is most common, and that's really a questionmark in itself, cause all horror fans and buffs of the old classics noone wants a new remake of their favorite Classic Movies. still we get them on Daily basis. And they are poorly made, bad acting, they bring nothing new to the table either. It's lazy cgi, it has nothing to do with fine Cinema or have any Visual identity of their own.. WHy horror?.. why what's considered to be the most influental expression of art in Cinema.. still they cant come up with something new..? Before this Review I was looking back at the list of remakes and looking at them in a new light. only a few of them Is deemed worthy as a remake. and are actuall very good. for example:
IT, The new IT is not step by step following the old Classic. It has from the getgo a fresh new idea and following the book more closely. Perfect and entertaining Movie. I was so worried about watching the new IT because I hate cgi and how it ruins the aestetics and aspects of style in Movies. But I found
It was a good balance between practical effects and thoughtful cgi when it demanded it. kept in the dark mostly not to distract or disappoint.
The other remake that was way better then the original was The Ring.
It wa superbly full of atmosphere and a great Noire like dreamy detective Movie. The japanese original didn't have anything of that. And was a real snooze to Watch.
So.. only a bunch of films has been meaningful so far in my book.

63,Mike_Devine,Lack of originality makes this fall flat,5,6 July 2018,"27 years after Joel Schumacher's original psychological thriller 'Flatliners' hit theaters, we see a new interpretation of the unique premise for a new generation. The 2017 low budget film by Niels Arden Oplev is a far cry from the original, despite a solid cast of newcomers who bring the stories of five medical school students who are fascinated with the afterlife - and experimenting to get a glimpse at the beyond.In 'Flatliners,' we get to meet the core cast as they are still getting acclimated into med school, from Courtney (Ellen Page) and Ray (Diego Luna) to Marlo (Nina Dobrev) and Jamie (James Norton), as well as Sophia (Kiersey Clemons). Each member of this unlikely crew has a different perspective they bring - in addition to a different painful past experience. The plot does not diverge much from the original film, so it comes as no surprise that as ""amazing"" things begin to happen to the students, strange side effects emerge, as well.Given that this isn't a new concept, 'Flatliners' needs to depend on execution, acting and overall entertainment value in order to be a hit with audiences. Unfortunately, the film kind of flatlines on its own because none of these three aspects are strong. While Page and Luna are perhaps the best actors represented here, neither of them give it their all, and even a minor role by original cast member Kiefer Sutherland does not help much in the acting department. As for the fright factor, there are some good scares thrown into the mix here, but none are what could be called memorable. There are scenes that feel cheap enough to be from a TV movie, so the low budget nature of 'Flatliners' cuts against it.In short, there aren't a lot of good things to say about 'Flatliners' because it will always be compared to the much superior original.",Flatliners

The first 5 minutes made me wonder if it was gonna be any good...I could not foresee a movie go downhill so quickly...the ending was so daft I could hear people saying ""What""? in the theatre.Not even the addition of Keifer Sutherland could make this any less silly. Direction was lame and lazy...I get the idea they thought they were going to cash in..I also get the idea they are very much mistaken.Rush release on DVD I would think to cash in before people catch on how bad it is.

This movie was actually boring, with the 'flashbacks' not even being scary.Should have known something was wrong when everyone was perfect faces and perfect bodies.Acting: I could question the acting but it may the be directing that is off. Too often the female leads were 'overacting their emotions' to the point that there was no way you would believe these were doctorate students.Editing: Inconsistent. Too often the movie had skipped to a scene without finishing or understanding what happened in the previous scene. In one scene they are looking for something very valuable that was impossible to find then they skipped to dinner with possession of the valuable item that they would never find. At no point do we see them finding it or at least one of them talking about. This happens multiple times on key plotlines.Missed opportunity: Having Keifer Sutherland was nice but movie missed a golden opportunity that would have saved this movie. Why he was not utlized more or differently is a mystery.If you saw the original you will hate it. If you didn't see the original, you will not like it.",Flatliners
66,Aly200,Watch the Original Instead,3,5 October 2017,"Wow what a massive dud we got here. Rebooting/trying to give a sequel to a cult classic that had such an A-list cast with a good story and director gets traded for a beyond bland script, mediocre acting and probably one or two solid jump-scares.If you are familiar with the concept of the 1990 Joel Schumacher film then you know that film follow five Chicago medical students who decide to play God and experience the afterlife only to have past wrongs come back to haunt them when they awaken. The majority of this sequel follows some of the same premise, but these characters do not undergo profound realizations like the original films' leading players do and come to terms with what they had done.The film's casting here should have worked with actors like the talented Ellen Page (spoiler: she won't make it to the end), Diego Luna, Nina Dobrev (Elena from ""The Vampire Diaries"") and even a cameo by the 1990 film's original lead Keifer Sutherland. However the leads have absolutely no chemistry and turn into ""Blair Witch Project"" characters rather than honestly tormented ""Flatliners""; there is needless sexual hookups (rather than implied like Kevin Bacon and Julia Roberts in the original 1990 film) and clichéd 'sins' that the characters endure and pay an honest price for though an exception is made Page's Courtney. Kiersey Clemmons is one of the film's weakest links as she blubbers and whines the entire time and has a needless mommy issue that is never addressed fully; her apology scene is the weakest moment for the actress when compared to Kevin Bacon's David apologizing in a dignified and calm manner in the original film while Clemmons just sobs and whimpers for forgiveness making her look pathetic and childish. The character traits from the original are virtually thrown into almost all five actors except the two male leads who are defined in their type; James Norton (a quasi-talented actor) is essentially now the Billy Baldwin character and Diego Luna (who could do better projects than this) is the Oliver Platt role as he never does the 'flatline' experiment. Kiersey Clemmons' Sophia is meant to be Kevin Bacon's character from the original, but she tries to also be Julia Roberts' role in a sense at the same time, Ellen Page tries to be the Nelson Wright (Keifer Sutherland's role in the original film) but despite her acting abilities comes off as a weak lead and Nina Dobrev tries to be both the Nelson role (as she goes solo flatline at the film's climax like Sutherland does in the original film) and also the Julia Roberts role given the actress is pretty and has a guilty conscience like both Nelson and Rachel in the prior film. One final note is the film's absolute waste of Jack Bauer himself, Keifer Sutherland, in a cameo role that really has nothing to do with the plot which makes his connection between the two films utterly pointless (bright spot is Keifer probably got a nice paycheck).The film's script is a total mess as the film has no real clue what it wants to be. The attempt at mild comedy is just foolishly placed with no real laugh except probably a pity laugh. The horror isn't remotely terrifying except for the scene where Courtney hallucinates her dead sister in her wrecked car. With no connection to the original film, this feature comes across as a lame-brained attempt to reboot a superior film that needed so no such treatment. Even the trailers didn't know what the film was supposed to be and the final product glaringly reflects this issue. The original film left the characters' backgrounds ambiguous for a purpose which helped ratchet the suspense little by little as each flatliner became to descend into delusion until the heart-stopping climax. Plus the Schumacher film knew exactly what it was: a sci-fi horror thriller and executed the idea well.Save yourself the trouble and go watch the 1990 film instead of this dreck.",Flatliners

Why not bake up some new ideas, not retrending a old movie to modern audience. This movie doesn't know if it want to be a remake or a sequel so they fail at both.

70,totalovrdose,"As the Title Suggests, this Film Really Begins to Flatline as it Progresses",6,27 September 2017,"When it comes to its great effects and spooky ambiance, Flatliners has a lot of style, but when it comes to its narrative, the film is significantly lacking in substance. As a fan of the original, alongside being an admirer of Ellen Page, I was really looking forward to this film, though by the end, left the cinema disappointed.Flatliners begins with Courtney (Page) experiencing a tragic loss. Nine years later, she is a medical student, trying to convince her colleagues to help with an experiment. Later in the film both events are connected, though significantly more depth was required.As one can guess, Courtney's experiment involves her death, in an attempt to record what happens to the brain after a person flat-lines. Her friends Jamie (James Norton) and Sophia (the beautiful Kiersey Clemons), originally discouraged with her intentions, quickly become involved, as do Ray (Diego Luna) and Marlo (Nina Dobrev) when things don't go according to plan.When characters travel to the other side, the use of light, sound and motion are used wonderfully to create a fantastic experience, the world beyond often visualised as been very beautiful, the music also adding to the magic of the occasion. After returning from their near-death experiences, characters are miraculously gifted with greater intellect, an idea that is never elaborated upon. Moreover, despite the characters been perceived as studious and intelligent, unlike the characters in The Taking of Deborah Logan, rarely do the leads in Flatliners attempt to use science, or their training, to find a solution to the problems they face, instead behaving much like the stereotypes found in other genre films.Though the always entertaining Kiefer Sutherland (who deserved a much larger role) has a cameo, don't mistake this as a sequel – this feature is in fact a remake, though it is disappointing we didn't get to see Sutherland's Nelson again after all these years.Much like in the original, the characters begin to realise the consequences of travelling to the other side. It is during these moments, when the film fully embraces its dark material, that Flatliners is at its best. The music adds to the already well developed spooky atmosphere, and the performances of the cast further heighten the sense of dread. Though occasionally predictable, the feature has its share of unexpected scares, the chase sequences being very gripping.Like the original, characters find themselves pursued by their 'sins', though the secrets the characters have been harbouring are rarely provided the required depth. Despite flirting briefly with the supernatural, the film pulls on this string only once, which was quite disappointing, the film rarely attempting to stray from the original. Though the original shone a flashlight on bullying, racism, sexism and betrayal, the remake is often centred around the competitiveness of the medical profession, which joins each of the characters together.As the film progresses, the confrontation between the characters and their 'sins' becomes progressively worse, been far more malicious than what was experienced in the original. Though the film appears to be set for an exciting climax, it is here that the movie appears to run out of steam, and instead rushes towards a happy ending that does not do the film justice.Flatliners is never boring, capturing the fun lives of the up and coming professionals of tomorrow, and the horror of when things go terribly wrong. The latter however is not given the depth it deserves, and coupled with its weak conclusion, the richness of the films potential goes largely untouched.",Flatliners

Where did it fail so miserably? Was it because it catered to the sensitive sensibilities of modern audiences? It worked to hard to appeal to a general audience, and not teh horror audience that is tired of seeing of genre filled with this teenaged-level garbage? The entire time watching this film, I felt bad for everyone involved, in particular Ellen Page. She deserves so much better than to be cast in such a poor excuse for a remake. I just don't get teh though process behind teh making of this movie. Why did anyone bother to amass the funds, hire a cast, write a script, film it, and vomit it out to the public? It's just offensive at this point that this is what Hollywood execs think makes for a great use of our time. It's life-less, soul-less and entirely bereft of vision. It is the McDonald's of cinema.

But in recent years there has been a steady decline in seeing new films with a great and 'original' story. Instead we have a plethora of, reboot/remake, as a guarantee of box office success.(or at least not loose money) So you now have a glut of 'reboots' that bear only the most superficial resemblance, to their classic namesakes. So many remakes/reboots, for no other reason, than to cash in on the name and glory of their classic forebears.With few exceptions the reboots are substandard, ersatz, low grade, unoriginal and unworthy bearers of titles of former great films.Sadly this film is no exception. The med students experimenting with 'after death' experience can have all the cgi and modern fandangos you like. The original was hardly a 'classic' but it had a good story, good actors and (the real test) you could watch it more than once.As with most reboots, imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery, but is certainly no guarantee of quality.

Money People obviously made them take the title of the 1990 cult classic that featured some of the then future stars of cinema. This is a sequel that is incredibly wrong-minded. The original movie was about restitution. It didn't have specters from the past murdering people who had wronged them. It wasn't about 'forgiving yourself' either. I can't think of a bigger cop out than that. And they didn't seem understand the nature of the transgressions in the original. I mean Ellen Page's big 'sin' was getting in a car accident that caused a death but could've happened to anyone. Whoever wrote the script for this thing really didn't get the central theme of the original at all. The direction is like something from the Lifetime Channel. It totally lacks the Gothic atmosphere, sumptuous art direction and rich cinematography that Joel Schumacher gave the original. It feels like a forced attempt at 'Hipster Chic' and comes across as flat and lifeless. The afterlife is not explored and there are no reaches into the metaphysical that original included. The music is distracting and again more in keeping with a made for TV movie. And I don't mean to be mean but none of these actors hold a candle to the original's cast. Diego Luna and Ellen Page aren't given much to do and the rest of them have no dynamism, whatsoever. There is no reason this movie should've been made.

77,svhot,"Good Acting, Intriguing Concept, however the screenplay & direction is very weak",8,29 September 2017,"""Flatliners"" has a very intriguing concept being presented to viewers. However, the screenplay is very weak and that is why a lot of people who watched it did not ""fully"" like it. I could have written a much better story and screenplay (Yes, I really mean it - literally).The basic plot revolves around a group of medical students who try to record near-death experiences by stopping their hearts for brief periods of time. During and after their ""flat-lining"" experience, they get flashes of sins they committed in a nightmare style. After coming back from their ""temporary death"", the medical students somehow become more intelligent than they were before. This concept is given no logical or scientific/ medical explanation at all. This reduces the strength and depth of the story/screenplay to a great extent.The sound, light and other special effects used in the movie are good and effective. However, these special effects have been utilized at a minimum level only. Viewers of this genre expect more thriller/horror elements when they watch such a film. Kiefer Sutherland, the only actor in this movie who has a huge fan following, has been given a tiny, cameo role only. His fans will be disappointed. I have no problem at all with the happy ending (Other critics/viewers are angry that the ending was a happy one).

It's kinda muddled whether it's a sequel, or remake/reboot. Kiefer Sutherland appears in both. He originally announced he was playing the same character in this as he played in the original, but when the movie was released his character had a different name. However, there is apparently a deleted scene on the home release which makes it clear it's the same character, now living under an assumed name.This is well enough acted, and some scenes are atmospheric. The story is pretty much a retread of the original, but none of the young leads in this are as charismatic or memorable as Sutherland, Kevin Bacon, Oliver Platt, Julia Roberts, or even William Baldwin were. And despite the high stakes the new characters are playing for, the ending is laughably lite, with little or no consequences for anyone (with one notable exception). 5/10.",Flatliners
79,angiris,Never have I had my brain and respect for original ideas and good writing insulted this way.,3,27 October 2017,"Where to even god damn begin. I'll make a quick summary before going on a rant about how unbelievably stupid this film is. Good: - Starts off interesting - Good actors - Keifer Sutherland is here for brief moments - Some of the scary scenes are well doneThe Bad: Why did they bring back Kiefer Sutherland if not remotely to use him? Oh thats right. To lure in us original viewers. Nostalgia and all. Jesus Christ. - Why is this film full of dance scenes and partying plus insanely quick jumping between scenes that you'd think meaningful. Who is this film made for? I came expecting a remake. I came expecting INTELLIGENCE. Instead we get lust for life, letting go, DEATH IS A RUSH... YAY.... ARE YOU F-ING KIDDING ME?! Director and Writer? Are you un-f'ing believably kidding me? I was expecting something perhaps like The Lazarus Effect. Instead we got something closer to some twisted morbid death flick that simply backfires after people get greedy and want super powers?.... yes. If you die, you become a genius now. Is that concluded or meaningful to the plot? Nope. OFC NOT.This "" remake"" was made with ZERO respect for the original movie. The start is all you're gonna get. After that you get tons of cheap jump scares and even changing up the meaningfulness of being haunted.We got NOT GHOSTS haunting these people. Instead a spirit of vengeance. Freaking Nemesis of ancient Rome is playing tricks. Gone is any interesting antagonist and sorta redemption alike the original. One completely dies. And thats that... serves as a lesson for the others. The other gets drowned but comes back. 3rd one gets haunted by his guilt and has his hand impaled by a huge kitchen knife although he didn't kill or cause the death of anyone. Same goes for our 4th character. They could've made this film without ANY death at all and made this new plot work because of how stupid it is to make GUILT itself to far greater extent than the original. The whole ghost thing is not well executed at all. We got 2 examples and 1 of them isn't even conluded.Let me tell you the worst scene in the movie. One of our characters visits her old class mate who she spread nude pics of. Walks up to her and says it was her and that it was wrong. Then instead of saying "" I'm SO SORRY. I should've never done it. I am so...so...so sorry for destroying your life""What does she say? because of the AWFUL writers?"" I'd like to...ehh... ( uncomfortable, in-genuine face) want you to accept my apology? ""Really? ....really?.....really?.... !!!! I thought forgiveness was about BEING GENUINELY SORRY! I REMOTELY got that impression. YOU ARE NOT GENUINE IF YOU ASK FOR FORGIVENESS. You get it from someone if they DETERMINE YOU ARE. If you are really sorry and feeling bad and expressing it as such. GOOD. If the best damn thing you can say is "" Will you acccept my apology"" then you can go to HELL. What is this? What the...F... This vengeance demon is stupid. Wanna see a movie that handled this well? Watch DRAG ME TO HELL.This film is criminal. Its horrifically insulting to the original. Dumbed down, made stupid and unintelligent for the sake of viewers with short attention spans, in need of cheap jump scares let alone all this as a result of terrible directing and writing. I repeat: Its rushed. Scenes with large impact end in the blink of an eye. Girl comes back from flat-lining. Jump to entirely different scene same instant. Girl dies for real. Jump to next scene. Guy gets stabbed in his hang with a huge kitchen knife.Jump to bar scene where its not mentioned at all for the 1st 3 minutes of the scene. I'm getting a headache. The biggest crime of this ""remake"" and I refer to it like that because its REALLY not deserving of being reffered to as such since the original was intelligent and far more respectful of the spirit concept, let alone having interesting characters. Julia Roberts scene with her father was so unbelievably impactful. Kiefer Sutherlands scene with the school kid where Kiefer really expressed how sorry he was. THAT WAS IMPACTFUL. You get NOTHING OF THE SORT HERE: REMOTELY. And best of all is in the original you didn't know what to expect. I REPEAT: UNPREDICTABILITY. This.... is as predictable....as it F'ing gets. And thats downright lazy and unforgivable because of how much material they had to work with. To learn from. How is this movie different from the original? People die. No ghosts. Vengeance spirit kills. And about that. What makes me so angry about this twist is that it literally renders the character who's hurt IRRELEVANT. You needn't really be sorry about hurting them. YOu just gotta be afraid of the big bad vengeance spirit. Which just... makes the whole plot fall on its face. Its as fake and in-genuine as the pedophile priests in the vatican. 3 out of 10. Its a 4 script wise. But I'm knocking it 1 lower because of how it SPITS in the face of the original movie and us movie goers. Insulting. rushed, fake, unoriginal, cliché garbage. I cannot believe Kiefer Sutherland returned for this. Guess he's just cashing in on the disaster with minimal appearances. I don't blame him.

80,GavWaskett,Go see the one with Keifer in!,4,12 September 2020,"I absolutely loved the 1990 film this was a remake of. I still remember seeing it at the cinema with my best mate, it was slightly disturbing, an original storyline and full of great young actors and actresses who were at the top of their game. So, it was with trepidation that I settled down to watch this version.
It still has a great young cast, Ellen Page, Diego Luna, James Norton, Kiersey Clemons and Nina Dobrev are fine actresses and actors and some of them already have a great body of work behind them. But to me, they're no Keifer Sutherland(though he does pop up in a nod to the fans), Julia Roberts, Kevin Bacon, Oliver Platt and even William Baldwin(actually Diego Luna would have easily replaced William Baldwin and made the first film better, but at the time with Backdraft and his Baldwin connections, he was a big(ish) name). It is not quite as disturbing, maybe because I'm nearly 30 years older than when I saw it and the storyline, well I cannot call it original when I still have the cinema ticket in my parents house for the film it is remaking.
However, it is well acted, nicely shot and if I had not seen the original and was watching this without any preconceptions, then I would have enjoyed it more than I did. Unfortunately, I had and I did not. To be honest before I started writing this, I remembered that I had watched a film earlier in the week but could not remember what film, so I had to check my Netflix history to remind me it was this. Not a great recommendation really, good cast, a nice way to waste some time but pretty forgettable as a movie.

Faltliners is a remake of the same movie that came out in 1990 directed by Joel Schumacher. And like the original it has the same premise. Is there an afterlife after you die? And so a group of friends begin to test this out only to find out it comes with deadly consequences. Now I'm all for remakes, but only if they're done correctly, but this one was terrible. For those of you who haven't seen the original and are seeing this for the first time, and the plot is interesting for the first twenty minutes. Now for the people who have seen the original and know what to expect well this movie really does suck. The plot is way out there to the point where it becomes completely unbelievable and stereotypical characters that you've seen a dozen times. And the script was awful. I was moving around uncomfortably in my seat by how terrible and cringe worthy it got. I watched this and there are only two positives that I liked. The first is Keifer Sutherland because he was in the original and I like when remakes bring in actors or actresses from there original movies. I just wish he has the same name he did in the original, but I didn't care anyway. And surprisingly, I like Ellen Page. Ellen Page is one of those people that doesn't get enough credit as she deserves, and I like watching her movies ever since Inception. I actually felt a little smart listening to her explain some medical terms to her friends, but after she dies my brain just flatlined after that.

This is not a remake, it's a reboot. But it fails for many reasons. I give it props for creeping me out twice, but apart from that, I was just waiting it to end whilst shaking my head multiple times. So they have gone via the horror route with this. It could of worked, but it didn't. For a start, the acting was poor, the casting was all wrong and unbelievable! Apart from Diego Luna, none of the actors were believable as Doctors. I am not a fan of Ellen Page, never was, even in Juno. I never got what all the fuss was about in regards to her as an actress.

Ellen Page's character suddenly decides she wan't the others to help her Flatline, due to her killing her sister years ago in a car accident.

All start being haunted by ghosts of who they have wronged, or in this case who/what they feel guilty about. Some live, some are killed.

Ellen Page is always compelling to watch, as is Diego Luna. But, these actors are up against the inevitable comparison to established greats Julia Roberts, Kevin Bacon, and Kiefer Sutherland, and it the film more like a TV movie version of the original. I brought my love for the original to this movie and felt like it did not give back what I'd hoped for: something original in its take on the same material. Perhaps most annoying is the Keifer Sutherland cameo that suggested this story was a follow-on in the same universe as the original. Now, that would have been a surprise if the Keif figured out what was happening and helped the young docs in some way. But alas. No such twist.",Flatliners
88,artsycutie,Not that great,5,21 April 2020,The concept for this movie is interesting but unfortunately has no scientific explanation or any credibility behind the science.

An intimate dinner date with death will break up the grad school monotony and breed unique fears. The neural pathways open as a barren city overpasses, and life flutters as mysterious emulsions. Either coffins or spaceships our bodies have untold enchantments to those burdened by a pulse. Monitor beep baggage keeps the door open for guilt, and the living are damned by unresponsive. With foolish motives, a rag tag team transverse into forbidden waters without life preservers.Nightmares only bite when we create them. Blood never washes out when you choose to ignore it. The journey to forgiveness goes beyond a single interrogative. Terror strikes those who need to feel their victim's disappointment. Lives are cut short from self-preservation, and cries bloat into super-cells. Imaginative notions of existential quandaries fall into horror cliché pits complete with obedient characters to a convenient plot. An unlikely group is more of an impossible group with lousy motivations that supersede the realism that initially clothes their humanity. Death becomes a neat party trick, and the stakes are diluted to a fickle competition.",Flatliners

91,cschultz-2,Just Another Stupid Horror Picture,2,9 October 2017,"Somebody should open a ""GoFundMe"" account where movie fans can raise enough money to produce a major motion picture worthy of the remarkable talents of actress Ellen Page. Following her Academy Award-nominated breakthrough performance as a strong-minded teenager confronting an unplanned pregnancy in 2007's ""Juno,"" Page has been mostly toiling in low-budget independent pictures, which often showcase her talents but don't afford her the exposure necessary to propel her into the front ranks of American actors.Instead, when Page appears in a movie sponsored by a major studio, it's likely either a supporting role in an ""X-Men"" picture, or in lurid garbage like ""Flatliners,"" released by Sony on September 29.More of a continuation than a remake of the surprise 1990 hit ""Flatliners,"" this new version again concerns the adventures of five medical school students experimenting in near-death experiences, as a means of gaining insight and knowledge of the afterlife. The 1990 version of ""Flatliners"" contained the solitary distinction of employing an inordinate number of cast members who later graduated to stardom, giving the picture something of a cult following. But even accounting for a characteristically strong performance from Page, it's doubtful than any of the cast members from this new updated version will achieve the same results as the 1990 personnel.Despite a relatively large budget and the backing of a major studio, in the end this new incarnation is nothing more than another mindless horror movie, little different in quality than the recent low-budget pictures ""Rings"" or ""Wish Upon,"" or dozens of others.As a more practical concern, research indicates that young people are inspired to simulate actions and events they witness in motion pictures. This notion was augmented by the deaths of at least two young men recreating a stunt depicted in the 1993 picture ""The Program,"" and the deaths or serious injuries of others mimicking activities they witnessed on television's ""Jackass.""After viewing a picture like ""Flatliners,"" which depicts a group of young people inducing death in themselves and their friends—a notion of temporary suicide—who knows what asinine acts of cardinal irresponsibility might follow?",Flatliners

Anyway.Ellen page is so pretty and small and a married lesbian i guess.the similarities of actress Nina dobrev and both Jennifer love Hewitt as well as a jersey shore cast member were as peculiar as Diego Luna's visible Matt Damon esque long hair from that ancient mid evil samurai movie made.James Norton looked like allamerican reject lead singer Tyson ritter and then there's the actress who kinda looks like will-smith or even mandymoore. So. What i thought was weird was that kifir Sutherland was in it and he didn't seem to reprise his former role.he was just a trained doctor quizzing med students.the most intriguing point of the movie that didn't go anywhere was between Diego luna and Nina dobrev.they were covering up situations and basically playing tug of war over ethics and conscientious incriminating and illegal activities. It was a pretty plain movie that wasn't too entertaining.the spoiler that shocked me was the early demise and suicide of Ellen pages character.its like the movie knew i took a cigarette break.she died,the cast acted like it was one of three scenarios...accident,suicid e e e or even murder.none of the actions by the cast seemed to lead to a murder scenario...so...she probably died by accident?

Overall, I found the original to be an underwhelming film, and I felt the same about this effort. They definitely tried to make this one scarier, bringing in supernatural elements that weren't present in the original, making it more intense, but somehow less intense at the same time, by that I mean making it more a traditional horror film, but taking away the creative sense of realism that the original tried to create.

Let's start with the Sci/Med/Tech issues: Why is the brain the only organ that doesn't die immediately? You as a medical student (and someone that's researched this kind of thing for ten years should know better)...it's not, several of your organs continue on after ""death"". That's why we can harvest organs after someone has ""died""....granted there's a small time window...but it is there. Okay so we're going to use this shiny new machine to record my brain...now let's make sure not to have any metal around it....like say the metal on the bottom of the defibrillator panels I hold up literally 2 minutes after saying that, and the metal in the pole of the I.V. stand constantly there in the background, and the metal in the needles. I would also point out, there's a reason the computers/laptops and other electronic devices are in the heavily shielded room the technician goes into, the one that's usually a good 10-20 feet away...electronics don't respond well to magnetism. Hmm, we've crossed over into the realm of death and returned...only to be haunted by something.....You would think this would have turned up in the ten years worth of research I did...but nope, I'm as surprised as anyone. Not to mention, you do know that hospitals carefully monitor and inventory their drugs...wouldn't they notice the Elephentine doses of ""Epi"" that seem to have gone missing. Now onto the character stuff: I literally laughed out loud when they claimed these people were ""20 Somethings""....what a joke...if I looked this haggard in my 20's I'd probably want to stop my own heart too. The character's are bland, one dimensional, boring, wooden, and unlikable. Car Crash Girl verges from obsessed to bipolar (one minute death is the best thing ever, later without much warning she's breaking down sobbing, and apologizing for putting them all in danger...based on a few disturbing instances). Brainy Girl is shrill, grating, and cracks under any kind of pressure. Jellyfish lady is whatever she needs to be from one moment to the next, needy and loving to homicidal to a big crybaby. Rich Snob might as well retreat to the Hamptons and spout ""Why I never!"". Finally, French Guy....god how I hated French Guy, they made him so completely unlikable I wanted to punch him. How convenient for him that as others sat terrified and afraid, he got to kick back and sit in sanctimonious arrogant judgment without having to confess anything he did bad. ""You and your Ivy league schools!""......""WE GO TO THE SAME SCHOOL YOU JERK!!!"" ""I love you Jellyfish lady....oh wait now I can't wait to ruin your career and leave your life in shambles, because I have arrogantly judged you without offering you the same opportunity.""The logical stuff: So...we all feel guilt. Again, good thing this never turned up in 10 years of research. Car Crash Girl crashed her car because she was texting (We producers would like to input our moral stance here) of course even if you hadn't been texting you still would have crashed trying to take that narrow bridge around that curve at those speeds, and what? You couldn't manage to submerge/dive down and try to rescue her....why? Brainy Girl feels bad for spreading naked pictures of a girl she was jealous of...and while I won't' defend that, perhaps you should have simply reported the shameless way she seemed be be flirting with your teacher, also while I'm sure GPA is important to a medical program (right behind whether or not you can pay) I doubt you were the freaking valedictorian, since it was never mentioned. Jellyfish lady feels bad for killing a guy by giving him the wrong medication....when did she find time what with being a Queen, a Senator, and a Handmaiden. Oh wait, a Student, a Resident, a Cellist, a Swimmer, a Party Girl, and a Lover. Rich Snob feels guilty for not going with the girlfriend to get the procedure done...okay jerk move...but that's seems to be par for the course for him...he's a jerk. Towards the end we see Car Crash Girl come back from beyond to help Jellyfish lady...thereby proving that dead people can visit you in your flatline....ummmmmm....WHY THE HECK DIDN'T ANYONE ELSE DO THAT THEN?!!

When the movie started I was pleasantly surprised: It was exactly what it promised in the trailers and I was curious to see what was going to happen next. Unfortunately the second half of the movie was indeed BAD. After the very interesting theory about afterlife that is shown to us in the first half, the movie starts to become more like a horror movie and not even a good one. It has a lot of moments with predictable scares and the one cliché after the other. The movie stupidly takes a bad turn and fails to be anymore interesting.It tries to be smart by using medical terms but it is literally gets more and more stupid as we go closer to the end.

116,nickijjohnson,Weak,4,9 October 2017,"The main problem I had going in to see this movie was that I hadn't seen the original. I wonder if it was any better because this one wasn't very good. Ellen Page's character was the only one who had an experience similar to what people who have had near-death experiences described as far as floating out of your body. The ""afterlife"" experiences the other characters had were mostly just memories of their lives. One character was even riding around on a motorcycle in an empty city. If that's the afterlife there's not much to look forward to then. The movie was approached too much from a scientific point of view. It didn't seem as though they were experiencing the afterlife simply that they were dead and their brains remained active as they do after death. The side effects they experienced after they flat-lined just seemed like weak attempts to throw in some scares and had weak explanations as to why they were occurring. The end scenes where the girl flat lines herself was pointless and basically just used as an excuse to show more weird scenes for scare factor. In my opinion movies about the afterlife are more interesting when they're approached from a religious point of view. Movies like Hereafter and Ghost show you the kind of afterlife that you would want to experience. You're free, you see loved ones, and if you weren't a good person you see darkness. This movie also did remind me of the Lazarus Effect which I thought was actually more entertaining. It was clear this movie wasn't trying to be meaningful or interesting it was basically just trying to be a horror movie which was disappointing.",Flatliners
117,rdnyscott,Better than I expected,10,2 November 2017,"Considering the poor reviews and how fast it went through the theaters, I had expected this movie to be much worse than it was. This movie suffers too much from viewer nostalgia, where viewers' preference for the original movie causes many to be unfairly critical. I saw it on Halloween, choosing this movie to avoid a crowd. It was scary as hell, much moreso than I had expected. Though I liked the original better, there are some things I liked better about this movie: 1. Small mistakes with tremendous consequences: Each of the characters is haunted by a small mistake they made which resulted in enormous consequences for other people. In each case, the character knew the risk they were taking, but they took it anyway. For instance, the star was a young teen driver who checked a text message and, in the process, wound up killing her passenger. This is the perfect movie to warn viewers (and the screenwriter clearly expected young viewers) never to take risks (even if the risk seems small) when the consequences are large. Also, the sex fiend is haunted by more than just a hundred women acting jilted. He's haunted by what would be the actual consequence: a former girlfriend now struggling to raise his child.2. Forgiveness doesn't come easy. In the first movie, the characters are easily forgiven, but in this movie, minor mistakes result in the death of other people. Though the killing was unintentional, how forgiving would you truly be of somebody whose negligence caused your death? This movie forces us to truly consider that, and to see things from the perspective of the poor victims who lost everything due to careless negligence. The movie teaches the importance of being careful, especially when engaging in potentially fatal activities.3. Special effects. They definitely did what they could to truly put you there, which was part of the reason it was so, so freaky. Don't watch this movie while alone. Though I'm not a big fan of scary, those who are will love this movie.",Flatliners

119,imdb-936-837144,Why be concerned about the mysteries of the afterlife when this life has problems enough?,8,9 October 2017,"Several med students at prestigious Trinity Immanuel Medical Center are competing for best residency options upon graduation. Courtney Holmes (Ellen Page) invites her erstwhile African-American friend Sophia (Kiersey Clemons) to join her for some extra­­curricular activity—we think drugs, this being a hospital. Ander Monson in his book _Neck Deep_ writes an aside on Dramamine: ""the lethal dose (LD50) of Dramamine in rats is 500 mg/kg. LD50 means that at this dose, 50% of the subjects die.  taken in larger amounts, it causes tripping with hallucinations"" (Saint Paul, Graywolf Press, 2007, 96). Courtney takes 50 mg of propofol, Michael Jackson's drug of choice, with the same result as Michael's and in half the rats. It has a quick onset but also wears off quickly.In William Henry Johnson's 1897 book _The King's Henchman_, he writes, ""A petard is a small cannon, as it were, secured against a wall or gate to be breached, the machine fired by means of a fuse at its rear end. To us this engine of war was then new, and we awaited the results of its employment with mingled uncertainty and hope."" This new engine of war had the habit of going off before the munitions engineer was clear, giving rise to the expression: ""hoisted by one's own petard,"" now meaning that the device one employs against his opponent hurts the user instead. These students fiddle around like Keystone Cops with the fuse lit. Their ambitious flatliner experimental results are as likely to destroy their careers—if not them­selves—as to gain them notoriety.Once a hole is breached in the wall, one may look in, true, but what in tarnation may come out? ""What if our sins are coming for us?"" they ask. What matters their technical doctoring ability if they can't own up to their own moral failings? For trying to outdo the competition with this deadly experiment, they could end up hoisted by their own petard.Their experiment is set in a fully equipped duplicate hospital on hand for an apocalypse. Since their hallucinations involve quasi-stellar objects (QSO's), we have to think cosmically. There are lots of water scenes and one boat. There was even a scene of distracted driving resulting in a drowning, reminiscent of Max Ehrmann's 1915 ""Jesus: A Passion Play"": ""they heed not. It was just so in the time of Noah before the flood. And the flood came and swallowed them."" This provides a mechanism of sorts for sins to transcend death, down through generations. Sophia's sin of broadcasting a person's nakedness and disrespecting her own parent's house with some rough sex parallels what Noah's son Ham did to him, in Genesis 9:20-27. William Graham Cole's book _Sex and Love in the Bible_ says of it, ""a revulsion against both sexual perversion and filial impiety lay behind this story"" (NY: Assoc. Press, 1959, 382). This resulted in a sentence of servitude on Ham's offspring. Cush, Ham's oldest, in Hebrew means black; he settled in Africa.Sophia was uppity, wanting to do her trip on the same night as another tripper when there wasn't enough time. Her hasty trip was subtly different from the others, like the medium as opposed to the mystics in Blaise Cendrars's _SKY Memoirs_: ""In the mystic, it is *ecstasy*, in the medium, *trance*. Both phenomena may show certain organic symptoms in common: alienation of the senses, cooling of the extremities, slowing down of the rate of breathing, and often rigidity, anesthesia, catalepsy. ¶""In the case of mystics a state of ecstasy, the cessation of heart­beat, and tachy­cardia, reveal the move­ments of the soul and its trans­ports; in the case of mediums, cramp and turgescence, often accompanied by orgasm, denote a profound moral disturbance"" (NY, Paragon House, 1992, 138–9).Sophia was in so much of a hurry that one of her fellows had to distract the night janitors to pull her chestnuts out of the fire. Its parallel is the Civil Rights Act of 1964, title VI, that moved race relations in a whole different direction. Here, though, every­one wanted to be the best physician possible, but that required owning up to past circumstances they might other­wise have gotten away with were it not for their ""flatliner"" experiment opening them to their past.One of the mystics' visions was of a sacred church setting. In effect the visionary students were confronted with a de facto saying of Jesus, (Matt. 11:28-30) ""Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn of me: for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light."" You'd be hard pressed to find more burdened workers than these med students. The path to the meekness of Jesus opens as a real possibility once they give it some thought.This movie has adequate acting throughout and a plot that takes a curve or two. Owning up to one's past is not necessarily at the top of the young adult's agenda, but their horizons were expanded by their experiment. For some reason the theater was empty except for me at the early showing. Being alone in a dark room added a sense of dread I hadn't expected. The examples of personal responsibility were quite on point. Since as evident from the name of the hospital it's Christian, and the class­­room instruction shows the usefulness of optional reading, I've thrown in a historical application that the movie only implies but can be got from the Bible.

But instead i was very disappointed because the movie focused too much on trying to scare the audience rather than make them think or wonder and yeah maybe their intention was to make a scary movie but i think it was the wrong take on it, they should have tried making it more memorable by creating situations which people would question causing more discussion of the movie but instead we get a bunch of lazy jumpscares and a lack of actual story.
Well to end on a positive note, all characters were well developed, a bit cliche but what do you expect? and the actors seem to be giving it there all, there wasn't really any laziness shown so i applaud them.

124,miguelangel-23,Fanboys of the original will not appreciate this re-make for modern times.,2,23 December 2019,"Or at least this is how failures are being justified nowadays in Hollywood. They take no responsibility, They make mediocre or horrible products and they expect we should like it or we are misogynists, or fanboys who are craving nostalgia.
First off I was not a fan of the original Flatliner, i wasn't even aware that there was a group of people who considered the original Joel Schumacher thriller a fan favorite or a cult classic. I watched that movie in theaters in 1990, And i still considere it to be a good, entertaining movie but not particularly a master piece or a nostalgia driven favorite. Is just an interesting concept with very fleshed out tridimensional characters. Great acting from Bacon, Sutherland and Roberts and little more than that. My point is why are we so invaded by remakes and sequels nowadays. I mean if you're going to do a reboot, make sure you have in mind something that will considerably improves upon from the original, and no, new CGI technology is not a reason to remake a story. Also, if a movie is clearly a master piece, i.e. The Shinning, Gone with the Wind, Casablanca or ET the Extraterrestrial there is no reason to remake or reboot that to start with, I mean is not like we cannot remaster the originals to 4K for the new generations to watch and appreciate there is no need to readapt a classic to modern times, but if you do, make them better, not worse.
In this case this 2017 Flatliners is considerably worse that its predecessor. And filmmakers need to accept their failures and not justify them by saying that nostalgia seekers or fanboyism is the reason their garbage is not well received. Just make good movies with a good script and good characters!

125,Zensha,Slightly better than expected,6,19 December 2017,"I haven't watched the original Flatliners (1990) as most reviewers have, so my review is purely from a viewpoint of a standalone movie with nothing to compare.It could have been a 5 instead of 6, but perhaps because I thought it was a 5 to begin with that's why I gave it a 6 after watching. Yes the acting and dialogue was terrible; yes it's predictable; yes it may not be original to those who have watched the original movie; yes it's full of cliches, but it's honestly not a 1 star bad. I was rather bored halfway into the movie and a little disappointed that they have failed to utilize the full potential of such an interesting theme and topic by turning it into a brainless horror, but the final act managed to give it a 2 star boost which was quite a pleasant surprise.One thing I have a really huge beef with these days is crappy trailers. They are so misleading and poorly made that they either spoil the entire movie or con potential viewers into thinking that the movie is of a different genre. I didn't know throughout the show if I was watching a Sci-fi or Horror until the final act (I'm a fan of both but would much rather this be Sci-fi).Seriously, it's not that bad.

I thought this movie will be an amazing horror movie with a lot of interesting aspect. But i was wrong. One of the good aspect in Flatliner is the prolog of the movie. First 30 minutes is good with nice plot, background character, and quite good story. It tells us about the young newbie doctor who did the experiment about brain activities when we already dead. I can say they succeed with the experiment, and have some good effect after done that experiment.Then, it seems all falling apart when one by one are having side effect that terrorize and scaring them. The horror scene is like a low budget horror movie, but with nice touch of the background sound effect. Almost all of it seems weird, and many of it seems not clear.

In my opinion, if a horror movie makes you flinch a couple of times, then it fulfilled the intended purpose. The main theme of the movie is the capability not only to seek forgiveness for the sins, which you have done, but also to be able to forgive yourself, or else, you will not be able to live with yourself (figuratively and literally as was the case in this film). I would have given this film a much higher mark, if it wasn't predictible (for example, if Nina Dobrev's character would have also died in the movie) or if there weren't some discrepancies in the movie (how could their subconscious actually do damage to them? The case of Jamie and the knife). All in all, it was a decent remake, which was more fun to watch then the original (a rare event), but I guess I wouldn't watch it for a second time (not that type of a movie)... well... maybe I would, if I happen upon it on some television channel. 7/10",Flatliners

Though the original Flatliners may have had faults, the combination of the cast and the unusual 'villain' carried it through to make it highly watchable. And not just once either.It's very rare for a film remake to surpass the original, The Thing (John Carpenter version) and The Fly are the only ones I can think of, and that's mostly because the originals were ultra-low budget B movies. This remake certainly doesn't join those hallowed ranks, it's the sort of film that makes you you start wondering what's for tea during the 'suspenseful' bits, and roll your eyes at the plot butchery (the most horrific bit in it).If you must watch this, make sure you don't see the original first, and you might not realize quite what a dog's dinner this is.",Flatliners

Outside of Page and maybe Diego Luna, the acting was poor, and instead of doing anything interesting with the the plot, it is the most cookie cutter cliche horror/thriller ever made. It also might be the most boring horror/thriller ever made. What makes it even worse is that SPOILERS!!!! Ellen Page dies halfway through. The most interesting character, and best actor, is killed off halfway through the film. It makes me wonder if Page realized that the film was awful, and asked to be killed off, because doing so really doesn't make sense in terms of the movie.

Instead we're treated to an overly-stuffed plot, and painfully pseudo-scientific mumbo-jumbo. What happened to the 'less is more' approach? Why are the ghostly visions so damn literal now? There are several ways this script could have been improved (cutting down the number of scientists involved for a start), throwing in more ambiguity. But alas, we were given more CGI.

169,georgejamesgatwick,Missing The Magic Of The Original,4,30 September 2017,"I loved Flatliners back in the 1990's (I think it was released in 1990 or 1991). It's not a great work of art or anything but I thought it was really scary and cool. It had a lot of great young up and coming actors (who are mostly big stars now) and most of all it was a great original story.So the major problem with this remake is that it is not original at all. The actors are not as good but they are fine enough, there's just no magic here because we already know the concept and basically what is going to happen. They have changed the way the story goes but not enough.Worst of all Kiefer Sutherland is completely wasted! They brought him in to apparently do nothing at all with his character.It is still worth watching and maybe if you did not see the original you will like it more but I thought it was very pale in comparison to the first.",Flatliners

It then changes to got jump scares and mysterious, spooky encounters.
I saw the original decades ago so I don't remember it much. Watching this as it's own story, in the dark, proved entertaining and hair raising.

It feels like the same movie.",5,29 September 2017,"A lot has been discussed about whether this movie is really a sequel to the 1990 version or if it's a remake. Whatever it is, it feels an awful lot like the same movie. The one thing that could distinguish between the two are the presence of Keifer Sutherland. After having seen the movie, I don't even know if he's playing the same character from the original or not. Having him appear here felt pretty pointless. There's also no references or mentions of the previous experiment from the first film, further proving that this is in fact more of a remake. The characters and the things they do felt a lot like the ones in the original. One positive I will say is, I was glad to see the movie had the guts to kill off a character. In the first one, other than Sutherland's character, you never feel like any of them are in any real physical danger from their post-flatlining experiences. Here it feels like the stakes are upped a little more.All in all, it just felt like a really unnecessary sequel/remake that just didn't do a whole lot to set itself apart.",Flatliners

175,dodgeruk,"Same old story, new Page",5,30 June 2018,"Joel Schumacher's overly stylish med students-kill-and-resurrect-themselves-for-kicks thriller was one of the more original films of 1990. Nobody was desperate for a remake, but with Ellen Page and original star Kiefer Sutherland on board, the going looked good. Alas, the result looks like a straight-to-DVD thriller with Page, Sutherland and a barely understandable Diego Luna heading a no-name cast. Once more eclectic med students decide to endure short-term death for the sake of hyper intelligence: the latter aspect a bit like Limitless. 
Naturally there's a price as demons from their past come back to haunt them. 
It starts off well. But once the dream turns into a nightmare, it looks like every thriller from the past 30 years. Flashes of The Ring and Final Destination will leave you rolling your eyes.

I didn't watch the first movie but the second one, the remake, had this premise. The cast was interesting; Ellen Page and Diego Luna both have astonishing career filmography. The film starts OK, but just when you get into the core subject - the experiment - it falls down miserably. What was supposed to be a Sci- Fi feature film turns into a commercial horror garbage. We were supposed to watch a young team seeking for an answer to their essential question. Honestly, I didn't think they will ever do, but they did!

185,noahaster,Flatliners proves to want make your own be unconscious than sit through this.,1,12 November 2017,For audiences who have watched the trailer for this film it pretty much says what your getting into here. A group of medical students go through near death experiences to curiously convey what happens when you die. We all get that already and now after we see this progression start then the film flies into a borderline careless plot that loses itself real quickly and bores you through the next hour or so. This suppose to be remake of the 1990 movie flat liners which wasn't a great film to remake either though nails it compared to the junk that was poured into here. There are first of all too many scenes that don't point too anything after the first 45 minutes or less it completely loses track of what it's trying to be and it loses interest real quickly. After the episodes of dying and waking up where it starts to become maybe an interesting plot ahead it whacks off and feels like there are several different directors trying to dabble with ideas ideas but doesn't stack up to anything. One thing though I found very troublesome in this film and this is a major spoiler for whoever still wants to see this shouldn't read. Halfway through the film the main star Ellen Page dies and leaves us with these other buffoons to do what else they can throw here. Why kill off the main star right in the middle of this film just as the story evolves and instead turns to crap. This frustrated me and through the rest of the film off guard. Also we get the original cast member Kiefer Sutherland to have a role as the medical professor but his role is so vague and shows no resonance of what they were capturing or not from the original that it was meaningless.,Flatliners

Even Ellen Page, who showed incredible acting chops in Juno and Inception is lacklustre in this movie.

Boy, disappointment is an understatement.It started off well enough, but the writer / director must've lost the plot somewhere.. 'Good Movie Scripts 101' tells me that if you have a significant event at the start of the movie, surely you don't just kill off this main character after you've developed the story around her right? It's just a recipe for disaster... unless you're Game of Thrones. Perhaps they were trying to give the audience some shock value or an element of surprise, but this has backfired completely in my opinion.Somehow, another character (who really didn't have much of a background story) became the protagonist. The moral of the story became something about you shouldn't lie on an autopsy report. Really??!! Wouldn't it have been more relevant if the tragic loss at the beginning of the movie somehow tied into the ending, like uniting the 2 sisters that appeared to be key characters... until they weren't. The message of forgiving yourself would resonate a lot more with the audience this way I'm sure.Oh, and don't get me started about why they brought Kiefer Sutherland into the movie and did absolutely nothing with his character.Perhaps the plot wasn't so important, after all, it feels more like just another not-so-scary teen flick, but if it was meant to be something more, it well and truly flatlined... sometimes you just need to stick with the formula that works.",Flatliners

Very good combination between sci-fi and horror,8,13 October 2017,"Flatliners is about a group of students who are not satisfied with their lives and thanks to the initiative of one of them (Ellen Page) they find something beyond comprehension that changes their perspectives about life. The plot itself: Promising.The movie is half sci-fi, normal people trying to surpass the limit of science in a realistic way or at least tied to the ground which cannot be said about the other part, the horror one, where the movie takes another road, a supernatural one. But is interesting in it's on way and it's very well made, in my theater people were really scared. If you're willing to accept this two sides of the movie, you're enjoying it for sure.The acting is good enough. Of course Ellen does a great job and the other actors did a good performance with what they were given.So, why the bad reviews? Well, Flatliners doesn't have the best script and it has ""teenager parts"" but who wouldn't party after that? Anyway, this is not enough for so bad reviews. So, what is it? It's the comparison with the original one. Yes, in case you don't know, this movie is a remake of a 1990 movie. And what almost everyone is doing is comparing this new one with the oldest and it's tiring. What did I do up there? Analyze the movie I went to see to the cinema. And that's it.

213,ThwSpiritualAnarchist,Your Wrong,7,23 March 2018,"Before watching this movie I read as many review as possible. Let me start off by saying to most of the bad reviews you are wrong. I read review after review that said this was a bad horror movie with ""jump scares"" that were completely ineffective. I even saw professional reviews on YouTube to the same effect. Because I hate horror movies especially supernatural ones that only exist to give people nightmares about demons or ghost or demonic ghost... I was prepared to turn this movie off the minute it turned into this kind of movie. But it NEVER happened. I think a lot of people went on looking for that type of movie or maybe that with a little Final Destination thrown in. If this is what gets you off please stay away from me and don't bother to see this movie. I watched this movie because I liked the original movie and I was looking for a reboot with better actors special effects and maybe something a bit more science based with elements of real NDE that wasn't in the original.Although I was disappointed it wasn't because this was a bad movie but because it was so close to the original that no new depth was added.But unlike the original it was clear from start to finish exactly what was going on. So after seeing the movie I was inclined to give it a 6 but I gave it a 7 because the negative reviews were so wrong as to almost to seem to be lying. Ok here are my corrections to what I see as lies about this movie or at the very least misinformationLie #1 this is a horror movie
1. Like the original this movie was NOT and is NOT a horror movie. Lie #2 The actors are horrible and the characters are unlikable
2.The acting in this movie was more enough adequate considering the limitations of the script which did not seem to want to stray too much from the original 
(Had they made this both more scientific and true to NDE experiences and made the visions more powerful than just hallucinations I would have given this movie a 10)Lie # 3 The main character dies in the middle of the movie is pointless and is forgotten by the other characters immediately 
3. Many reviews claim that the character that died just disappeared out of the plot and none of the characters seemed to even notice. This is an outright lie and is actually the opposite of what actually happens. Finally it is true that something supernatural that feeds off guilt and fear seemed to follow them over and was only vaguely hinted at. So the movie does not end up going dark or demonic. So you will have to go somewhere else for your supernatural porn.I will admit that the character development is was too slow. Too little to late. By the time you start to understand the characters enough to be pulled in the movie is more than half over. Also the ""death is a rush"" part was examined only in the most superficial way and ended up cringy. If you survive death you will definitely feel different. Add to that the expanding abilities of these characters after crossing over could have provided a hint at deep philosophical questions about the brain or evolution or even reincarnation.

Going into this film with that unknow, I enjoyed the plot in which the story is being told. The main problems with this movie is the run time, and the movies identity crisis. When it comes to how long a movie is, the only time a movie becomes too long is when it runs out of stuff going on in it or just padding the time with worthless junk. Avengers: Infinity is just as long as this, but the problem Flatliners suffers from is it took too long for anything to happen which where the identity crisis comes into play. I'm not sure this movie knows what it wants to be. STARS called it a drama/thriller while Google says it falls into the Sci-Fi category and after watching the movie, it did none of them correctly. If it intended to be a thriller, why settle for the PG-13 rating, and if it wanted to be a drama what was the point of the jump scares? All in all this movie isn't bad because it was long, it's bad because it's long, boring, and confusing to what it was.",Flatliners

Sad to say it more than misses the mark.The only entertaining aspect of the film, Ellen Page, the experimental doctor, seems to be so careless she might as well be someone driving a car while under the influence of alcohol, drugs and no seat belt.
Diego Luna is also a decent addition and appears to be the only ""smart"" character in the entire movie.While the concept is indeed intriguing as no one really knows what happens after we die, the movie ends up relying on jump scares and a peculiar but apparently not supernatural conflict that just comes across as downright confusing? Are they hallucinating, are these things actually happening, did something really come back with them after being resuscitated? It's never clear.What seems to be interesting ends up as a sort of ""moral of the story"" type deal which is so corny and boring, you might as well just watch the trailer instead of sitting through 90 minutes of young adults freaking out over something INCREDIBLY stupid the decided to experiment with... something without ANY PRIOR TESTING.

I had never seen or heard of the original 1990 movie until earlier today.So I watched the 1990 version and by comparison, the pace in the original was really slow in the first half and it seemed very dull. Eventually it got better. I have to say that I enjoyed the second half of the 1990 version and overall it tells a better story compared to the 2017.The 2017 version feels current, the music is better, filming angles are better. Obviously that's expected comparing to a 27 year old film. The point here is, I believe the younger generation would prefer the new one as they can relate to it - computers, mobile phones and current events. More female main actors instead of just one in the original.To those whom have never seen the original, this is an enjoyable movie. Not something that would come to mind as a memorable, but enjoyable nonetheless. As a remake, it's not in the same class as the IT remake, but nowhere near the Ghostbusters remake.",Flatliners
243,sassy-boots,"Actually, at least as good as the original.....",7,4 December 2017,"....but don't expect miracles. This was an entertaining movie, insomuch as what it was turned out to be. If you watched the trailers, and went to see this expecting flying body parts, flowing blood, and absolute terror, you are going to be absolutely disappointed. If you actually SAW the original, and understand what the premise and plot lines were about, then this one isn't so far off; as a matter of fact, its pretty darn close to the first movie in those respects. The differences are the sexes of the main players(in this one its three girls and three guys, in the original it was one girl and the rest guys)the things they did wrong they had to atone for, and the fact that one of them dies in the new one....its almost the same movie, nearly twenty years later. The difference is we are a lot more hardened and a lot less prone to look for the deeper meanings in the movies; we want instant gratification and don't want to have to ""think"" about our entertainment. I think the people that really hated this movie had never seen the original(or didn't understand IT, either, and had no clue what it was really about)and went into it hoping for a gory bloodbath. THAT would have been a great way to ruin what was actually a pretty good movie, and one of my favorites. If it ain't broke, don't fix it, maybe just tweak it a bit, which is what this movie does. I do have to admit though, the actors chosen for the roles were a little weak and watery. This movie deserved WAY better candidates for the characters. This movie carries the same messages the original one did-namely, don't mess with what you don't fully understand, be prepared to pay the price for doing what you do, be careful what you wish for, and basically ""do unto others"". All in all, I really enjoyed it. I was a bit apprehensive with all the really bad reviews, but it was OK. It won't win any awards, but that's alright. Still a better quasi horror flick than a lot of studios are cranking out these days. To everyone that hated it....maybe you should watch it again..but REALLY watch it this time.Peace.",Flatliners

The acting was ok but the story line is just so flat and didn't make much sense. At the part where courtney died, I didn't even realize she was actually dead because it all happened so fast, and the others' reaction wasn't what you'd expect when their friend just died mysteriously in front of their eyes. The whole movie was just very confusing and unnecessary for me.I was very excited about this movie when I saw the trailer, but after I watched it, I was so disappointed. 'Flatliners' is one of the very few movies that I couldn't get through. Don't bother watching it.",Flatliners
250,brownthomasw,I thought it wasn't that bad.,8,22 August 2018,"Maybe because I saw the bad reviews and was prepared to turn it off if it was that bad so I had low expectations and I often like things few others do. I don't know why all the hate. There were some plot holes. I couldn't see why the majority of the characters would want to be involved in such a risky endeavor but there was an attempt to justify it. I was legit scared afterwards and i haven't been scared since the first Ring. I went outside after and saw stuff out of the corner of my eye and when i came in something fell off the shelf across the room for no reason and I screamed like a little girl. Maybe they were cheap jump scares and it was one of those movies where you know better than the characters. More than once i was talking to the TV saying don't go in there, you don't want to go in there. I think a lot of movies today rely on gore and gross. It was definitely the anticipation that got me. When things actually happened I was like meh. I should say I'm not a big horror buff and don't like most movies lately of any kind. I can't remember the last thing i really enjoyed before this. We had few movies and no premium cable when I was a kid but we recorded the original on one of those free weekends and my sister watched that a million times. From Lost Boys and Young Guns I thought Keifer Sutherland was the coolest person in the world when I was 12. I feel they changed it up enough to keep you guessing but also familiar. I generally hate all the remakes these days too but I was entertained. I feel like religion oriented after life/ supernatural turned people off but that was in the original as well.",Flatliners
