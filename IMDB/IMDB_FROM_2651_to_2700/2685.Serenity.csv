0,SnoopyStyle,ambivalent about the twist,6,7 November 2020,Baker Dill (Matthew McConaughey) is a fishing boat captain obsessed with catching one particular tuna fish. He pushes aside his own tour customer to catch the fish and his assistant Duke (Djimon Hounsou) quits. Constance (Diane Lane) gives him money in exchange for sex. His ex-wife Karen (Anne Hathaway) tracks him down despite his fake identity. She is willing to pay him $10 million to kill her husband Frank Zariakas (Jason Clarke) who abuses her and Baker's son Patrick.The first half seems to be trying for Hitchcock but various mannerisms and unreality kept dragging it down. One could see the changes needed to keep this on track better. Then the skinny guy shows up with the suitcase. The story takes a left turn. I'm still no in love with the twist. I do appreciate that it made the movie more cohesive. This is not the best. I'd rather have it go straight but I'm willing to give the twist some leeway.,Serenity
1,Prismark10,The big fish,3,5 March 2019,"Writer and director Steven Knight wants to subvert the hard boiled film noir matrix but fails.Baker Dill (Matthew McConaughey) is an ex war veteran now a down on his luck small fishing boat operator in Plymouth Island. It is supposedly set somewhere around the Florida Keys. He is assisted by loyal Duke (Djimon Hounsou.) However Dill has an Ahab like obsession in catching a big fish called Justice, even if it means ruining the paid trips by tourists.His ex wife and mother to his teenage son, Karen (Anne Hathaway) turns up with a proposition. She wants her new rich husband Frank (Jason Clarke) dead. Frank is a monster, he has been abusive to her and Baker's son who spends all his time on a computer. Karen will pay Baker good money, all Baker needs to do is get him drunk and toss him into the sea so he will be gobbled up by sharks.Knight has failed in his execution in Serenity. As a straight noir thriller it is dull and predictable.Hathaway is not much of as femme fatale. Diane Lane who plays Baker's friend with benefits would have done it better.There are constant hints in the movie of some other worldliness. Even the locations point to this. Plymouth Island looks less like something that is off Miami Beach but more like a Caribbean island. In fact it is filmed in Mauritius and we had fun looking at locations we had visited over there.The film never hits its stride, when it pulls the rug under your feet; you never for a moment think that was clever. Only Jason Clarke made an impression.",Serenity
2,nogodnomasters,He wants justice,6,8 February 2019,"John Mason aka Baker Dill (Matthew McConaughey) owns a fishing vessel where he takes out tourist for marlin and tuna fishing. His boat is named Serenity and he works on Plymouth Island off of Miami. Duke (Djimon Hounsou) is his occasional first mate. Baker is obsessed with catching a tuna he was named ""Justice."" Constance (Diane Lane) helps maintain his sanity and cash flow when the fishing is not good. We know when Justice is about as a Freegate flies overhead.John's ex-wife (Anne Hathaway) shows up. She left him for a very rich man who abuses her and their son (Rafael Sayegh). She offers John/Baker $10 million to kill him while out fishing. He refuses but does take him out.The script shifts gears at about an hour into the feature and you basically have to forget everything you think you know about the movie.This becomes an odd film and I am not sure why Jake Gyllenhaal didn't star in it.Guide: F-word, sex, Matthew McConaughey butt.",Serenity
3,kosmasp,"Not connected to Firefly, still out there",8,21 June 2019,"But when I'm saying out there, I'm not talking as in outer space - it's more an ... inner space. Well you'll see if you decide to watch this. Just be open minded and take whatever this serves you with a grain of salt. It is quite insane and the twists and turns it takes cannot be really predicted (unless there are in the summary you read or someone spoiled it for you).So this movie that takes routes and goes places, has a slow pace and may feel weird at first. Performances are great and the story is wicked. It has touches of other movies from particular genres mixed in. I am being ambigious or even more careful with my wording, because this needs to be experience in my estimation, rather than explained. Yes it is flawed and yes you can critisize choices, but you can not say it isn't trying something different and it does challenge you ... for better or worse",Serenity
4,BandSAboutMovies,The worst movie I've seen all year!,1,8 August 2019,"Along with Mike Whitehill and David Briggs, Steven Knight created the game show Who Wants To Be a Millionaire? He's also written plenty of screenplays - he contributed to Eastern Promises and Shutter Island, which this movie feels like the Italian ripoff of - and wrote and directed the films Locke and Hummingbird. None of these things will prepare you for this complete and utter grease fire of a movie.Baker Dill (Matthew McConaughey, who should know better) is a fishing boat captain who lives off the coast of Florida on Plymouth Island, yet all the steering wheels are on the wrong side of the cars. He spends most of his days drunk or out on the ocean, hunting an elusive tuna named Justice.That all changes when his ex-wife Karen Zariakas (Anne Hathaway, who should know better) shows up and begs him to save their son from her abusive husband Frank (Jason Clarke, who was in Chappaquiddick as Ted Kennedy, another excoriable bit of Hollywood dross), giving hi $10 million dollars to feed the man to the sharks. This seems like an exorbitant figure and an overly elaborate plan, but don't worry. This film is about to go off the rails in a way that few do.Seriously, if you felt like watching this movie, you should stop reading right now.The truth is, DIll - who is really John Mason - was really killed in Iraq and is now a video game character in a game that his son Patrick has designed based on the one memory he has of his father. Now that he's stuck with a stepfather that beats his mom and attacks him, the game changes to one where Dill or Mason or whatever must kill the new dad. That means that everyone else in town, from Djimon Hounsou's Duke to Diane Lane's Constance, are all non-player characters.Just before virtual dad is about to be killed by the monstrous tuna, the real Patrick stabs his real stepdad with his real dead dad's knife. He is released into custody before a trial and designs a new game where he just hangs out with his dad.I made none of that up. This all really happens in this bizarre film noir with people that have no understanding of the genre. Also, if the son designed this game, does he really want to see his dad's bare ass double digit times? Does he want his virtual dad to get with his virtual mom and sail the seas of mayonnaise on a houseboat together? Who can say!No matter how bad a movie is, it usually gets millions of dollars' worth of promotion. The test screenings for this film were so bad that Serenity's distributor Aviron canceled a full campaign, even after all of the actors agreed to a full press junket as part of the contracts. According to a Deadline Hollywood article, only nine TV spots aired in the middle of the night in obscure cities, one assumes only to answer some contract or requirements. That means that this movie went up to 2,500 screens with no one knowing a single thing about it.Aviron said in a statement: ""As much as we love this film and still hope it finds its audience, we tested and retested the film - with audiences and critics alike - and sadly, the data demonstrated that the film was not going to be able to perform at our initial expectations, so we adjusted our budget and marketing tactics accordingly.""I really can't explain just how bad this movie is, one that starts as a Body Heat style neo-noir and somehow becomes the redneck Matrix while at the same time threatening to become a shark week movie. Compounding the pain, my wife - who had wanted to see this - fell asleep an hour in and that meant that I had to soldier on alone.",Serenity
5,sunwarrior13,A High Suspension Of Disbelief Required,3,25 September 2019,"""Serenity"" stars Academy Award winners Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway.It tells a story of a fishing boat captain -Baker Dill - on a tour in a tranquil and tropical Plymouth Island. During this tour,she gets to see his ex-wife Karen and her son with a desperate plea for help from her present and violent husband. The request would make Baker take the husband on an excursion and thrust him on the sea to leave him dead.The film can boast of a talented cast.The acting was alright that and the performances saved it from the lowest rating. Too bad that the story was somewhat ludicrous and weird. Added to that,the movie would require the viewer to have a very high suspension of disbelief to get an appreciation of the story.I bet that this movie is a contender for numerous Razzies next year.",Serenity
6,LeonLouisRicci,MURDER AND DESPERATE FAMILY AFFAIRS WITH SHOCKING REVELATIONS,6,10 September 2021,"A Semi-Successful Attempt at a Neo-Noir with Shades of ""The Twilight Zone"" and other Quirky Types.A Twisty-Turny Affair that Requires a Steady and Focused Hand to Pull-Off the Fractured Story-Line that Detours in Dimension Shifts.That Jerk the Audience here and there so many times that might result in Seasickness.The Two Leads Try and Withstand the Convolutions as the Third-Act becomes Hyper-Energized and Moves so Quickly and Things become a bit Blurry.Not a Bad Try but the Film is Perhaps to Complicated for its Own Good.Sometimes Simplicity Steadies the Waves so the Reveal can be Exposed with as little Clutter as Possible.Therefore the Entertainment Value isn't Lost or Ends in Confusion.Overall, Worth a Watch with Low Expectations.",Serenity
7,zardoz-13,Mindless Head Games!!!,1,5 February 2019,"Ever seen a movie that made no sense? Hollywood goes to extraordinary lengths to make its feature films not only palatable, but also coherent for its audiences. After all, they want us to vicariously participate in the plot and enjoy the heroic triumph of good over evil. Occasionally, even an incoherent catastrophe, like ""Crank 2: High Voltage"" (2009), qualifies as entertaining, especially since the filmmakers refused to take themselves seriously. Oodles of horror chillers make little sense because their logic is hopelessly flawed. In ""Tokyo Gore Police"" (2008), a mysterious virus from outer space distorts human physiography; when a woman loses her legs, the mutated jaws of a ravenous crocodile replace them! Another 'off-the-wall' epic ""Enter the Void"" (2009) depicts the demise of a French drug dealer living in Tokyo. After he is shot to death, his soul hovers above his head and then like a drone keeps track of his sister who dances nude in a Japanese strip club.
Sometimes in a senseless movie, the protagonist is dead from the get-go, but we're left in the dark about it until the very end. The indie cult hit ""Carnival of Souls"" (1962) pioneered the tale of a heroine who had been dead the entire time. Naturally, this revelation arrives like a mind-blowing surprise! ""Dr. Terror's House of Horrors"" (1965) followed ""Carnival of Souls,"" but it concerned people on a train who had already died in a train wreck. For the record, many films have recycled this last-minute shock premise, among them ""High Plains Drifter"" (1973), Jacob's Ladder"" (1990), ""Campfire Tales"" (1997), ""The Sixth Sense"" (1999) ,""The Others"" (2001), ""The Tale of Two Sisters"" (2003), ""Atonement"" (2007), the Anne Hathaway movie ""Passengers"" (2008), ""The Uninvited"" (2009), and ""The Lovely Bones"" (2009). ""Redemption"" writer & director Steven Knight's picturesque but anticlimactic hokum ""Serenity"" pulls the same stunt. Mind you, no spooks show up to scare us, because it is a hallucination of a character's warped imagination.
None of the main characters in ""Serenity"" are remotely sympathetic. Matthew McConaughey plays rum-soaked charter boat skipper Baker Dill who lives to land a legendary tuna. He has even given it a symbolic name: 'Justice.' When another fisherman hooks this tuna, Baker pulls a knife on the guy and confiscates his rod and reel. Baker's preoccupation with this tuna approaches Captain Ahab's obsession with harpooning Herman Melville's great white whale Moby Dick. Anne Hathaway plays Baker's alluring ex-wife Karen. This desperate femme fatale offers him $10-million in cash to feed her affluent but abusive husband to the sharks. Jason Clarke plays Karen's villainous husband Zariakas who terrorizes not only her but also their young son Patrick. Rude, crude and lewd, he is a guy who feels entitled to everything he wants.
Meanwhile, the rest of the ""Serenity"" characters loiter on the periphery. Diane Lane of ""Justice League"" plays Constance, a cougar who not only pays Baker for sex but also to find her lost black cat. Djimon Hounsou of ""Gladiator"" plays Baker's long-suffering deck hand Duke. Baker believes Duke has cursed him with nothing but bad luck since Duke's wife died. Duke warns Baker not to murder Frank. Duke ranks as the most sympathetic character. An outsider, Reid Miller (Jeremy Strong of ""Zero Dark Thirty"") enters Plymouth Island, because he believes he can help Baker catch his tuna. More enigmatic than everybody else is Rafael Sayegh as Patrick, the reclusive teen who holes up 24/7 in his room on his computer. ""Serenity"" unfolds in a make-believe enclave called Plymouth Island, but this Plymouth is located nowhere near Massachusetts. If the strange license tags on Baker's truck indicate anything, Plymouth Island may have the Caribbean lapping at its shores. Baker's deep-sea fishing boat is named 'Serenity,' but it doesn't provide Baker with a sense of serenity. You'd think from the tropical setting of ""Serenity"" that you were watching an adaptation of an Ernst Hemingway novel since it focuses on a loner with fishing boat who gets himself in trouble. Ultimately, little that you see in ""Serenity"" contains a shred of credibility. Although it channels film noir classics, such as ""Double Indemnity"" (1944), ""Body Heat"" (1981) and ""Out of Time"" (2003) with its steamy sex and murderous agenda, ""Serenity"" emerges as a dreary morality tale about adultery and murder. Ultimately, deception and revenge propel the plot, but the filmmakers keep you in the dark about who craves vengeance.
Most movies feature straightforward plots, and you need not worry about characters who may not know they are dead. Writer & director Steven Knight complicates everything so thoroughly in ""Serenity"" with his artifice-driven screenplay that you have trouble navigating the conflicts. Is it a grim murder yarn about an ex-husband conspiring to kill his ex-wife's second husband? Or is it the murky psychological fantasy of a distraught teenager who hates his stepfather? Just about every time we're shown Patrick, he is gaming on his computer, and this fuels the antagonistic relationship that he has with his stepdad. Eventually, he must commit himself to action and confront reality. Meantime, Baker has no memory of having a son, while Patrick dreams of reuniting with him. Confusing? When Knight doesn't make ""Serenity"" difficult to understand, he squanders time on a superfluous subplot about Baker's tuna. A decorated soldier, Baker died a patriot's death overseas in a U.S. Army combat zone. Meaning, he didn't live long enough to own a deep-sea charter boat, much less take tourists on fishing safaris! Since he never lived in Plymouth Island, he couldn't have helped Karen deep-six Frank. Sometimes, Patrick's imagination descends into voyeurism. He imagines Baker wallowing in a steamy affair with a cougar who treats his father like the catch of the day! The only thing in Patrick's imagination that isn't phony is his abject fear of Frank. The final quarter hour delivers an ending that literally feels like a rug has been pulled out from under you.
Altogether, ""Serenity"" plays mindless head games that will drive you bonkers!",Serenity
8,oscaralbert,"Some are seeing this flick as ""TRON, with a brain . . . """,9,31 January 2019,". . . while others call it ""THE TRUMAN SHOW, if you add a heart."" Perhaps the best description of SERENITY is its distinction of being the greatest Iraq War film yet released. SERENITY documents how many if not most of that phony baloney (What WMD's?!) conflict's widows have been driven by the guilt of their having allowed their spouses to perish in the service of a petty personal vendetta to remarry by hooking up with abusive brutes. This generalization applies doubly to officers' wives such as ""John's"" widow ""Karen"" in SERENITY. For the most part, these Ladies were in the best position of all the Significant Others to sniff out the lies about ""Saddam's"" yellow cake uranium, and to recognize ""Colon P."" for the caving craven coward he was in selling out 5,000 U.S. Boys to the greedy maw of the Military Industrial Complex. (Many of the enlisted men's spouses never even graduated from college!) Worse yet, a preponderance of the kids Left Behind by those duped Iraq War casualties are subject to the periodic abuse of the brutish stepfathers their self-flagellating war widow Moms have dragged into their Gold Star households. Fortunately, SERENITY is the story of one such kid--""Patrick""--who's able to take the Raging Bull by the horns.",Serenity
9,ferguson-6,life is but a ...,4,24 January 2019,"Greetings again from the darkness. A seamless zoom shot through a young boy's eye, a plunge into the deep blue sea, and up across the ocean onto a boat ... that's the very cool opening to writer-director Steven Knight's latest film. It can be described as a 1990's style noirish, murder-for-hire drama with a contemporary twist, and it features a terrific cast. Unfortunately, all of that somehow adds up to a film that never really clicks.This is Mr. Knight's first time in the director's chair since the excellent LOCKE in 2013. He's best known for his writing in such projects as ""Peaky Blinders"", EASTERN PROMISES, and his Oscar nominated DIRTY PRETTY THINGS. A resume like that lends itself to certain expectations; something that makes the messiness of this one all the more surprising.Oscar winner Matthew McConaughey stars as Baker Dill, a boat captain who runs a charter fishing business at the edge of the world - a sleepy little remote tropic village called Plymouth Island. We learn pretty quickly that Mr. Dill is a few pickles short of a jar. With customers aboard, he gets the hook in the unicorn he's been chasing - a giant tuna he's named Justice. It's a frantic obsession that the locals call the fish that lives in his head. On a boat named Serenity, Captain Dill's less appealing side is exposed as he and his first mate Duke (Djimon Hounsou) fail to reel in the mighty fish.With the significant exception of his money woes, Dill leads a pretty calm and under the radar life on Plymouth Island. He drinks at the local bar, lives in a makeshift cliff side container by the sea, and enjoys periodic frolicking with Constance, a local beauty played by Diane Lane. We soon learn that Justice the Tuna is just the first of two things that rock the serenity of Dill's world. The other is his ex-wife Karen (Anne Hathaway) who magically appears one night next to the bar stool he is planted on. It turns out she has tracked him down for the sole purpose of paying Dill to kill her abusive and filthy rich and thoroughly obnoxious husband Frank (Jason Clarke). It's also during this time that Dill is being chased down by Reid Miller, a nerdy and suspicious little salesman played by Jeremy Strong.Karen's plot would stand no chance if not for the son they share. Patrick (Rafael Sayegh) is an odd kid whom we only see writing code at lightning speed from his home computer. It's the Reid Miller character who clues us in on the twist; but rather than shift the movie into a higher gear, it feels like the air goes shooting out of the proverbial balloon. As shaky as the film, characters, and dialogue were, this twist turns it into a convoluted mess that changes everything we have watched to this point.Murder for hire/love films have been done many times and in many ways. Some of the best include Hitchcock's classic STRANGERS ON A TRAIN, Billy Wilder's film noir masterpiece DOUBLE INDEMNITY, and Lawrence Kasdan's steamy BODY HEAT from 1981. This film should never again be mentioned with those. Although the premise is interesting, this terrific cast certainly deserved better material. Filmed on Mauritius in the Indian Ocean, the little scenery we see are the film's highlights. Apparently all that Mr. Knight wishes to tell us is that life is a game ... and it might not end well. Not exactly breaking news.",Serenity
10,bombersflyup,Doesn't work.,3,20 February 2019,"Serenity has a star-studded cast, however with a ridiculous premise it's a complete misfire.There's just no way these particular characters are created by this boy, hasn't the life experience. The last portion when McConaughey's character's self aware, amusing at least. Hathaway's not right for the role, Clarke on the other hand terrific.",Serenity
11,gradyharp,"'On Plymouth Island, No One Ever Dies...Unless You Break the Rules'",7,5 May 2019,"Writer/director Steven Knight (Dirty Pretty Things, Eastern Promises, Locke) has brewed a film that, like the theme of the film, is not what it seems at first. The transition from reality to non-reality is unsettling - a sunny tropical island populated by interesting people becomes a computer game of rules involving death, or does it? That is left to the observer to decide.Baker Dill (Matthew McConaughey) is a fishing boat captain leading tours with his sidekick Duke (Djimon Hounsou) off a tranquil, tropical enclave called Plymouth Island. He earns money as an escort for island lady Constance (Diane Lane) when his income from fishing is down. His quiet life is shattered, however, when his ex-wife Karen (Anne Hathaway) tracks him down with a desperate plea for help. She begs Dill to save her - and their young son Patrick (Rafael Sayegh) - from her new, violent husband (Jason Clarke) by taking him out to sea on a fishing excursion, only to throw him to the sharks and leave him for dead. Karen's appearance thrusts Dill back into a life he'd tried to forget, his service in Iraq and loneliness for his son Patrick, and as he struggles between right and wrong, his world is plunged into a new reality that may not be all that it seems. The strange unreal world seems to be known by the mysterious Reid Miller (Jeremy Strong) who follows Dill before his mission is revealed.We are left to wonder if the confusion of the story is intentional - and if it is, the message is a bit too jumbled to make sense - or is that the intention? This is an odd movie with a very strong cast - it just gets a bit lost in the second half.",Serenity
12,deloudelouvain,Could and should have been better.,6,2 March 2019,"If it was not for the ridicule outcome of the movie I would have rate it with a seven instead of a six star rating. I don't know why they took that route at the end but that was a mistake if you ask me. The movie is entertaining and easy to watch, at least for the first part, so it's not a complete waste of your time but it could and should have been better. It's also not Matthew McConaughey's best part in a movie so for that it was also a bit disappointing. I wouldn't call it a sci-fi either as for that it just lacks sci-fi.",Serenity
13,blanbrn,Pretty lame and bad suspense drama thriller.,4,27 January 2019,"This latest picture ""Serenity"" does have some star power yet the plot and story just doesn't pan out as it's twist and revealing discovery is weak and a little non interesting it's like you could see this coming all along in the film. Matthew McConaughey is Baker who's an island fishing boat captain and a guy with a haunted past which involves his bleached blonde ex wife Karen(Anne Hathaway) and the past is slow to figure out only it involves their son and new husband. The film turns into a game that's silly not clever as really it ends up letting you down, still you find a little bit of steam and spice with Diane Lane(still very sexy!) as Constance who plays Baker's part time intimate one night stand lover as the smoke between the sheets is hot this happens to be really a better subplot of the film. Overall though this film is a waste of time as star power couldn't save it.",Serenity
14,FeastMode,my notes,1,27 July 2019,"Super garbo. i could tell immediately. i should have quit after ten minutes. the story went in directions i didn't expect, but it was all useless and poorly done in basically every way. the dialogue was so bad. i couldn't believe some of the lines that were being said by two actors of this caliber. i can't believe they read the script and decided to do this movie. i was laughing at stuff so early on in the movie (1 viewing)",Serenity
15,ThomasDrufke,A Complete Mess & Waste of Talent,2,10 February 2019,"I'm honestly not even sure I understand what Serenity is about. A mind trip of a ""thriller"" with twists so obscure and bold, that you have to give the film some sort of credit for the effort. But by every sense of the word, this film is utterly ridiculous. I can't believe something like this came from the brilliant mind of Steven Knight, you know the man who has given us Locke & Peaky Blinders in recent years, among many other impressive writing credits. Knight has always had a keen sense of tone, especially in something like the aforementioned Peaky Blinders. However, Serenity has insanely divisive twists that turn the film into a farce of a story. There's a cool Matthew McConaughey/Anne Hathaway revenge film in here somewhere, but the end result is most certainly not that.2.5/10",Serenity
16,westsideschl,Different,7,17 May 2019,"Well, it was different from most genres' crime/thriller, rom-com, sci-fi highly repetitive scripts/plots. A little bit like Matrix, but not fair to compare the two as they are structured & evolve much differently. You think the story will head in one direction, but veers off with a totally different explanation. The writer/director left a lot of room for viewer ""figuring out what's going on"", and plot holes may bother the ""clean 'n' tidy"" crowd. But then, given that the story is from a novice so to speak, then the holes are OK. Only criticism of our young writer is a bit more background on characters was needed; a little less tuna, and a little less seeing McConaughey's physical exposure.",Serenity

No trailer, no synopsis, so all the surprises that were in his movie were genuine for me. And there are quite few surprises to say the least but i won't spoil anything nor discuss the plot.Overall, ""Serenity"" (2019) has a pretty unique plot and even kind of original one.

20,cruise01,"Love the mystery concept idea about the story but the direction is dull, script is flat with characters, and it is forgettable.",5,26 January 2019,"Serenity (2.5 out of 5 stars).Serenity sure is something for a neo-noir thriller film that does mislead you on what the actual plot is about. Matthew McConaughey delivered a good performance. Sadly, the film falls flat as a mystery thriller that tries play smart but gives you an empty satisfying result. Kind of reminded me how the sci-fi thriller Transcendence film with Johnny Depp was. Delivered an interesting mind bending concept but an empty satisfaction of the results.The plot follows Baker (Matthew McConaughey) who lives in a small town on an island. He is obsessed on trying to catch a large tuna fish known as ""Justice."" So obsessed, he pushes aside his own visitors that pay him to take them out to sea. When his ex wife Karen (Anne Hathaway) shows up on the island. She asks for his help to take her husband Frank (Jason Clarke) out to sea and kill him. Cause he has been abusing her and her son.That is enough what I can say about the plot without giving away details or spoilers. Besides, it is one of those movies were the plot changes gears in the middle of the second act. With a lot of people on the island being suspicious and not knowing a clue about anything. Or a stranger Reid (Jeremy Strong) that shows up in a suit and is creepily staring at Matthew McConaughey throughout. Or walking through the ocean in a suit. The film does have a great amount of mystery ideas. With Baker being obsessed with this tuna fish. Figuring out everyone's motive on the island. The twist is a game changer that turns the film into a different direction. It is not as surprising or shocking when it is revealed.Matthew McConaughey delivered a good performance as Baker. Along with Anne Hathaway. Jason Clarke was okay playing an abusive character. The direction is kind of dull. It tries to build some suspense and mystery. Instead, it is a tedious thriller that is forgettable.Overall, Serenity is a bad film. It started out great. It has an interesting concept of ideas with this mystery building of people being weird on an island. After the twist is revealed, it did not leave a satisfying shock factor besides it probably will be forgettable once the credits begin.",Serenity
21,Floated2,Tries too hard at being mysterious and clever,3,31 January 2021,"Apparently this film was a massive box office failure and was panned by critics (for the right reasons). As a film this was relatively a confusing and different. The story wasn't too easy to follow and there were some moments of intrigue and entertainment but as a whole its ""twist"" felt forced and was somewhat confusing and far fetched.Apparently it's main twist is that the characters are a part of a game created by the real life son (13 year old child), meaning the characters on the island aren't real and the acting by the side characters are deliberate (speaking in cliches, not much depth).Also near the very end it reveals that Matthew McConaughey's character died in real life many years before (when his son was very young).

22,eddie_baggins,A thriller with an odd-twist,5,25 February 2019,"Tis early in the year of 2019, but it's likely that one of the strangest and most surprising film's has already found its way onto our screens (skipping cinemas in Australia) in the form of acclaimed filmmaker Steven Knight's Serenity.What makes Serenity such an oddball event even more out of the blue, is the fact that this oft-delayed thriller was seemingly just your run of the mill hot and sweaty thriller with a dash of murder, starring two A-listers and a collection of solid supports, working for a filmmaker that has made a mark in works such as Eastern Promises, hit TV show Peaky Blinders and the Tom Hardy vehicle Locke.It's hard to talk about what makes Serenity the film you don't expect it to be (with critics flabbergasted upon initial release in America last month) but rest assured Serenity is weird, very very weird and for some it will be too much to bare as the story of Matthew McConuahgey's Iraq war veteran turned fishing charter captain/gigolo Baker Dill getting offered $10 million dollars by ex-partner Karen (played by Anne Hathaway) to kill her abusive husband Frank (grossly played by Jason Clarke) goes to places that not even the most eagle eyed viewers will be expecting.In some strange way it's amazing to witness such a high-profile and well-backed affair just completely go for it in the ideas department and while not a lot stacks up when examined in fine detail and many little plot lines remain carelessly unanswered, the zaniness and complete commitment by Knight and his cast will keep you watching regardless.It's a beautiful mishmash of creativity, eccentricities and quite possibly brilliance as we follow Knight and his leading man (and his unclothed butt cheeks that should win an award for best supporting actor) on Dill's journey that sees him long to catch a tuna that's been a subject of his fishing desires, weigh up his financially beneficial offer and help Diane Lane as his client Constance find her oft-missing pet cat.Where Jeremy Strong's oddball suit and tie wearing Reid Miller, a teenage computer wizz, telepathy and video games comes into the equation is best left for viewers to discover, as this thriller's rough yet often enjoyable journey on the high-seas of high concept movie-making takes place.Final Say -I still can't believe Serenity is a thing, a potentially brilliant out of the ordinary thriller that aims high and lands somewhere in the rough middle. I can see why so many have taken to Knight's film as an early contender for the years worst, but despite all its flaws and strange choices, Serenity is always watchable and a sometimes wickedly enjoyable thriller with a difference and a heartfelt message, offering a lot more than many of its other by the numbers counterparts.2 ½ bare buns out of 5",Serenity

Original? Nope.Fisherman Dill (McConaughey) is leading a peaceful life on an island, he makes money catching fishes n takin tourists on his boat, he is obsessed with catching a particular tuna n when he runs outta money, he bangs Constance (Diane Lane). Sometimes he goes cliff diving all naked n suffers from strange visions n telepathic connection with his son.
Drill's ex-wife Karen (Hathaway) shows up to his residence and tasks him with killing Frank, her abusive husband.
The film starts like a 90s neo-noir thriller, holds up the attention with some suspense n tension but goes downhill n turns into a blunder with the lousy twist.
McConaughey did a terrific job, Clarke, Lane n Djimon Hounsou all did good but they were not able to rescue the predictable n bad script.

That makes sense in this type of thriller.However, by the time the big reveal of what is indeed going happens.

By the time we get there, I'm far too bored to care.The film does have a really good cast of actors to keep me interested. I think Matthew McConaughey is good at making the mundane seem interesting, and they nominated Djimon Hounsou for an Oscar twice for being able to support these ""movie stars"" while doing... whatever they are doing.Jason Clarke was interesting to watch on the screen as a blowhard of an abusive husband and I wish that Diane Lane had a bigger role.Plus Anne Hathaway's turn as a ""femme fatale"" in this Neo noir is very pleasant.None of the skills of these actors, however is doing anything to make the film itself a better watch overall.

25,jtindahouse,"Watchable because of great cast, but ultimately hollow and pointless",5,5 March 2019,"It pains me to dislike a film like 'Serenity' because it is trying so hard to be original and unique. The sad fact about modern cinema is that if there's a good idea out there, chances are someone has already thought of it and done it. That doesn't mean there aren't ideas out there that haven't been explored - it just means they likely aren't good. 'Serenity' is one of those unfortunately. It had me intrigued for a little while, until the twist (or not even really a twist, just an explanation) is revealed and we realise what is going on. From there the movie falls apart pretty rapidly.The cast of this movie is quite incredible. Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Diane Lane and Jason Clarke. They must have all been sold on this being a great idea. It's lucky they're there though because their star-power combined is all that really carries this film and keeps it watchable. Hathaway phones it in a little, but McConaughey gives it his all as usual.'Serenity' is a very dark film that takes itself extremely seriously. I can't remember even one instance where they attempt to make you laugh. This can make for a pretty bleak experience at times. Combine that with the fact that the film isn't half as smart as it thinks it is and you are left with a pretty weak product. Don't waste your time on 'Serenity' I'm sorry to say, there are bigger and better fish in the sea.",Serenity

This is a noir type mystery thriller with a twist ending that makes little sense. Matthew plays a fishing boat captain that lives on a small populated island-where everyone knows everyone-and he goes fishing every day on his boat, Serenity. Diane plays his local no strings attached girlfriend. Things are fine until Anne shows up. She is Matthew's ex but is now remarried to Jason and raising Matthew's son with Jason. The problem is that Jason-although he's very wealthy-is abusive to both Anne and Matthew's son. Anne wants Matthew to take Jason out on his boat on the pretext of a fishing trip and then dump him overboard for the sharks to have a nice lunch. As you can see, there is a right or wrong struggle for Matthew's consciousness. To make things interesting, Anne tells Matthew she will give him $10 million dollars if he does it. Plus, he can have Anne and his son. But, there are things going on that are hinted at in several places and finally revealed near the end but they just don't make sense-at least not in the real world. The acting is fine but the story's ending was what's wrong here.

Sometimes plot is average but execution makes the average plot looks great, sometime the plot has something to offer but with a bad execution the entire plot is ruined. The same is the case of this movie. The plot had potential to becoming a great edge of the seat thriller but with immature execution the entire movie had fallen flat.This movie is a victim of too much plot twists and this creates lots of confusion and even a hardcore mystery Lover can get confused. The screenplay is slow infact very slow and gets very boring, sometimes you might feel that the movie is not moving at all. Acting is probably the only solid part of the movie as with stars like McConaughey, Hathaway, Clarke and rest of the character had given their 100% to the movie.

31,kluseba,One of the most creative thrillers in recent memory,9,20 February 2019,"Serenity is one of the most underrated thrillers in recent memory that doesn't deserve the unfairly harsh critics and reviews it has received. The film tells the story of a fishing boat captain and war veteran who lives on a Carribean island. Even though he has left his bleak past behind him, he battles serious alcohol problems, has financial issues and has become quite grumpy. One day, his past comes back haunting him when his former wife finds him and tells him that her new husband abuses her physically and mentally which has a negative impact on their son. She asks her former husband to kill her new husband to save their son and stage it as an accident. The femme fatale is also willing to offer a hefty sum that would seemingly solve the captain's problems all at once. He needs to figure out whether he should reconnect with his past and become a murderer to save his son or ignore the offer and live with a heavy burden on his conscience.This movie convinces on numerous levels. The plot certainly needs to be pointed out since it comes around with an unpredictable and creative twist halfway through the movie that changes your perception of everything that has happened up to that point and will keep you on the edge of your seat until the memorable bittersweet ending. The acting performances are great and especially Matthew McConaughey convinces as tough war veteran longing for peace of mind. The locations of the film are phantastic as they portray both the stunning landscapes of an isolated Carribean island but also show the negative impacts such a small community can have on its different members.Many critics were disappointed by the twist which prompted them to give the film exaggeratedly low ratings. It is certainly a very unusual twist that might be perceived controversially. However, it's a turn that is very unique and makes this movie stand out among similar crime flicks. It gives the film an unforgettable imaginative dimension that already makes it an early cinematic highlight of the year.If you are someone who likes to think outside the box and longing for some risky storytelling, this movie certainly is for you. If you simply want to be entertained and like things by the numbers, you shouldn't watch Serenity. Personally, this film has been a very positive surprise, I will certainly purchase it legally in the future and make my family members and friends discover it as well.",Serenity

36,rgkarim,Serenity or Unclarity?,6,25 January 2019,"There are those movies we go for the stars, especially at the promise of some sex appeal that will get the theater steaming in delight. Tonight's review is one such movie, whose little to no trailers left me with no idea as to what to expect. Yet, sometimes those very movies turn out to be treasure troves of quality, and though you went for the steam you might have found more gleam. Robbie K is back with another review on:Movie: Serenity (2019)Director:
Steven Knight
Writer:
Steven Knight
Stars:
Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Diane Lane
LIKES:Acting
Tropical Island shots
Twist
OriginalitySUMMARY: As I said, the poster sells you into the film and the leads of McConaughey and Hathaway are the center stage. The former has the smolder, trashy looking grunge part down, diving once more in the darker roles that involve facing elements that are uncomfortable in this film. Certainly, much more serious than his earlier works, the man proves he is not afraid to take on the roles that others shy away from. As for Hathaway, the amazing woman played her part well, though the awkward parts may seem a bit flat, she works the role well, especially on the sexier side of things. With these two running the show, eyes will be glued to the screen in anticipation for the next trip to the bedroom.
Of course if you are like me, seeing the island shots and aquatic world is quite beautiful to see, as you are transported to another world that makes you want to go on vacation. Serenity is all about sailing into a lot of unknowns and fortunately the cinematography and the views are a fine feature.
Yet visuals aside, the story of Serenity is certainly an original one, or at least more unique than most. Much of this has to do with the twist, which once revealed starts to explain the strangeness of characters, dialogue, and performances. With this approach, the movie goes down a more psychological approach that will dive into a lot of awkward corners and engage your mind to see how deep this rabbit hole goes. There is little more I can say to avoid surprises, but definitely look to an original touch to the sea of blockbuster stereotypes.DISLIKES:Waste of Characters
Pace
Editing
Lack of Excitement
Going Nowhere
Too Bold On Twist?SUMMARY: Serenity may have some acting, a little bit of visuals, and one heck of a unique approach, but that doesn't make it perfect by far. It starts with a waste of certain characters, each intriguing in their initial introduction, but quickly dropped to mundane characters who appear at the oddest times. While secondary characters do little to expand the group they ironically are the smallest dislike I have.
Instead much of the dislikes for me involve the pacing of the movie. Serenity is slow, no doubt, drawn out in a drama like film that starts to get lost in the director's vision. Because the editing focused more on the steamy, sex appeal or on the concept of the twist, the excitement was practically missing for this reviewer. Promises of deep mysteries, pressured decisions, and a few other usual excitement clichés are quickly lost to the circular spiral of the same problems. Lines and scenes blend together as the stars get stuck expressing their disdain of their lives, which sometimes makes the scenes boring or repetitive.
Why was this the case? I think it was going too bold on the twist. Trying to execute the original concept, led to lines and sends going very oddly, and by getting lost in the convoluted ideas, the other areas the movie wanted to go for fell short, sinking into the sea of the mundane. As they say, to go big you go bold, but going too bold can sometimes bite back harder and get lost to most audiences.
The VERDICT:Serenity may not be on most radars or fish finders, but within lies an interesting, psychological tale that surprisingly has the steaminess the poster promised. With acting to take the lead and a story to try and blow your mind, these are the qualities one needs to keep in mind when going to see this film, (use the mantra of There is a Twist, There is a Twist) Still by going on this twist, the usual components that people go to the movies for is loss to mundane tactics and odd approaches, alongside a repetitive collection of complaints and plot points that are difficult to swallow. Still while not the theater quality film, Serenity is best cast off from the port of your living room and worth it if you want to get a good headscratcher into the film. Otherwise hold out for something more exciting in the near future.MY SCORES ARE:Drama/Thriller: 6.5

37,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Serenity,7,8 February 2019,"A fishing boat captain named Baker Dill, is visited by his frazzled ex-wife. She wants him to kill her current husband because the a-hole is harshly abusive to their astute son. That's the fugazi blueprint for 2019's Serenity (my latest review). In all truthfulness, I really got into Serenity. Yeah, it's a movie lover's movie if there ever was one.Shot in early 2017 yet released this past month, Serenity displays an obvious nod to film noir with co-lead Anne Hathaway casually sporting a fedora hat and informally walking in the rain.Basically, Serenity is a steamy, neo-noir endeavor that's not what you think it is and not what you think it will ever be. With Serenity, director Steven Knight readily commits to every darted shot. Whether it's overhead camera angles, plenty of fast cutting, coarse 50's-style dialogue, or sweaty actor close-ups, Knight really gets you into his groove. Credit also goes out to Serenity's attractive cast and standout Matthew McConaughey as Baker Dill (mentioned earlier). Heck, you won't have to wait till March's The Beach Bum to see ""full"" McConaughey. Here, he's awesomely beast-like and a total badass as he smokes, knifes, and drinks his way through every scene.In retrospect, Serenity at times doesn't take itself too seriously and feels a little too trashy for its own good. Also, the film's Greek Chorus in Reid Miller (played by Molly's Game's Jeremy Strong) reeks of being a poor man's character from a watered-down David Lynch outing. Still, Serenity with its fantasy elements and big reveal early on (all the personas are non-existent and are rather part of a kid's video game), seems more daring and more gleefully off the reservation than most of the junk that comes out in January. Bottom line: Serenity containing tales of thrusting sex, Truman Show oddities, and big boy tuna catching, is a cinematic ""amenity"". Rating: 3 stars.",Serenity

The ""Moby Dick"" reference is strong, but the story structure allows for theming to evolve as the story continues.Each arc is interesting as if it is a new story using the same characters.While the journey definitely carries some intensity with it, the end is a bit vague and may leave you questioning not only what happened in the movie, but questioning reality.",Serenity

And Netflix seem to be actual subscribers to it. Personally, the moment I saw that guy with the suitcase, I knew they would go there. And this didn't impress me, it even angered me a little.

40,krocheav,Serenity - Don't Look for any Here,3,24 February 2020,"No-one involved with this movie can expect to get away without explaining their true motives. Whatever the creators were thinking will only seem clear to those who think because something is 'different' it must be good - while sometimes this can be so, it's not in this case. Here is an example of trying too hard to be 'different' and ending up simplistically off-the-wall, but not in a good way.Writer Stephen Knight won the day with 'Amazing Grace' 06, and seemed to perhaps be thinking he can blend some of the grand philosophy that graced that film into this concoction. Problem here is, the grotesque characters and situations are manipulatively designed to be so overly nasty as to make the viewer want to see the 'baddy' violently done in. That is never a good way to set up a convincing story but is very much a popular computer games scenario.This swear, booze and sex-fest wears thin very early on with its obvious attempts at outlandish 'smart' pretence - it may have been halfway interesting if they had played it straight as it appeared to be at the outset. Initially looking much like a remake of the Hemmingway/Garfield 50s noir classic ""The Breaking Point' - it soon veers off-course into the now predictable land of Computer Game 'magic'. It's also unbecoming for mixing perverse situations involving an abused minor into a rather lame fantasy element. Some audiences will only see the supposed 'cleverness', while others will see straight through it! (as the box-office returns tend to confirm)Matthew McConaughey can be impressive (Free State of Jones '16) but also sometimes over the top (as here). Previously, he has also verbally praised God for his career, if he thinks God will look favourably on this mess, he needs to think again.

The older one is sci-fi and latest is mysterious but not sci-fi ( as described its genre ). Because we do not see kid playing computer game of catching fish anywhere in the movie nor he is playing any other game which we know through conversation between various characters about writing situations in real life. Only we can see him before computer typing something every time. This is not sci-fi as me. Moreover the plot is very confused. We do not understand that which character lives and which is dead ? When was Baker dill in army by his name John? And he is not John then why Karen call him 'John'? Where was Patrick? Was he alive or dead? So confused! Either I did not see movie carefully or it was a mistake of plot. May be possible both. Okay. About acting part, Matthew seems dumb and not having much expression on face like a stone face. Other hand Anne Hathaway looking good and did well acting. Please beware of some bold intimate scenes, but is very usual thing in Hollywood movie.

46,rockman182,Serenity (2019),5,27 January 2019,"Didn't hear about this one until mid week which was odd, as it has good star power in it. Matthew McConaughy, Anne Hathaway, Jason Clarke? Surprised at the lack of promotion. Went into this without really knowing a lot which can be a good thing with expectations but this film was trash. I was literally rolling my eyes at this film and how the writer of it must have thought that they were being clever with the twists that made no sense and were seen a mile away.The film is about a fisherman who encounters a woman and her abusive husband. The husband wants to sail out and catch big game and his drinking problem causes him to be abusive and abrasive. The fisherman and the woman actually know each other and have had a previous relationship. The duo plan to kill her husband and stage the murder as a fishing accident gone awry. There's more to this plot that I cannot get into without revealing the stupid twist.The film takes a while to gain steam or make you care about its characters. I wonder why the duo of Hathaway and McConaughey accepted the offer to be in this. Its just messy all around and thinks its way more clever than it actually is. The twist is obvious and even then its written in a way that makes it unclear of what its trying to do. Just an all around mess that is actually unintentionally funny.So now I can see why this film didn't get any promotion. Its pretty terrible and the twist ruin an already bad film and just make it worse. Locke was really good so its surprising how bad Steven Knight's follow up to that film is. Yeah, not recommending this one unless you want to roll your eyes and join the stupidity it brings.4.5/10",Serenity

The Island is all wrong. It is just off and it bothered me to no end during the beginning of the movie. I mean it seems a weird mix of a New England town named Plymouth and a Carribean island with fish and features from both locations scattered haphazardly. You have New England lighthouses and crab traps mixed with tropical buildings and palm trees. I would swear there is no possible explanation for such a poor set design.Well, there is an explanation. A twist so out of left field it would not occur to me in a million years. And this is a neo-noir film a genre well known for its twists and double-crosses. I am not going to say what the twist is here. It truly is best discovered on one's own I will just say I enjoyed it which certainly seems to put me in the minority of critics and film viewers.Outside of the twist, there is a lot to recommend this movie. It is a handsome production with good performances from the leads and a lot of little touches that make very good sense in retrospect.The Bad: You know what as much as I enjoyed myself I was looking forward to an old fashioned neo-noir film with big stars and a Hollywood production budget. Heck at this point I would take Shannon Tweed level stars and a Canadian production budget. I mean there have been some great Neo-Noirs in the past, Mulholland Drive, L.A. Confidential, and Body Heat to name a few. But name one released in the last fifteen years? Drive maybe and Blade Runner 2049. The pickings are beyond slim.The Ugly: Back on the I want my Neo-Noir bandwagon I do wish Serenity went a little harder into the neo-noir in the first bit of the film. I understand from a story point of view why this did not take place but certainly, the ending could have been a little more in line with a true noir if you know what I mean.",Serenity
49,sjanders-86430,A brilliant screenplay,10,20 February 2021,"The teen is at a loss from the Iraq war death of his beloved father. His mother remarried an abusive rich guy. He takes to his computer and creates an alternate universe where his father, McConaughey, lives as a boat captain on an Island called Plymouth. He sets up a scenario where his dad takes his stepdad out to catch a tuna and kills him. There is a game rules manager who initially says no murder, but he changes his mind. This fantasy is perfectly plausible for a bereaved teen. And very watchable with actors filmed on the beautiful Mauritius island in the Indian Sea. There are exciting moments on the fishing boat. Also nude McConaughey swimming under water. This is exciting writing.",Serenity
50,DukeEman,"""Hey, Steven Knight, we have plenty of money!"" And Steven went through his puberty draw and blew the dust off a screenplay...",7,22 July 2019,"I'm not sure if the busy writer, Steven Knight (Taboo, Peaky Blinders, Girl In The Spider's Web), created this project for a much needed working holiday! He also directed, which meant he got to hang with the cast and crew on the island of Mauritius (north of Africa), a most glorious location which was perfect for this dark and dreamlike neo-noir. When film crews are far from home and isolated from the studio's eyes, then there is a party going down (one of the many reasons for my bunged-up liver).Serenity feels like a pet project Knight had in a desk draw from his childhood days. It has that naivety about it with some ambiguity and plays out as an over-the-top neo-noir but ends up being something more deeper and interesting in a muddled sort of way! Technically it was brilliant, with plenty of drone shots and other interesting directorial touches of sensory-impact. And the cast was perfect and beautiful and had your interest. So there was enough in this movie to keep you hooked in a matinee serial sort of way. So what went wrong?It was how Knight undersold it. At first you thought you were going to get a thriller of some sort. The acting was noir-like, a little hammy and sexy from the femme-fatale (who even dressed for the part). The protagonist, (McConaughey cast perfectly), was doing a dark Bogart who went hard on the liquor and had some deep regrets in life hidden under the tough exterior. Even the antagonist was pure evil in a comic-book sort of villain way. It then shifted into another sphere that threw everything off kilter, but made it more interesting, even if it was somewhat clunky. I took the bait and decided to go with it because I too wanted to believe this revenge scenario created by a hurtful fragile creature. Once you made the connection you understood why the first half was played out like... I should stop there and not be giving this much away. But if you are prepared for it then you might accept the shortcomings, and enjoy the trashiness.",Serenity
51,jrarichards,"Certainly offering the unexpected, but at the expense of ""serenity"" ... and watchability?",7,26 July 2019,"For me, the most (truly) wonderful moment in British Director Steven Knight's ""Serenity"" comes very close to the beginning (OUCH!) - as our hero ""Baker Dill"" - played plausibly enough by Matthew McConaughey - comes close to landing a simply vast tuna (or as we once called them ""tunny"") he's been after for years. No albacore comes in at that size, but bluefins do (up to 3.7m we are told), and the latter certainly can do their level best to exhaust the fisherman trying to reel them in over hours or even days.Anyway, as it comes close to the surface, the great fish stares at us with its cold eyes through the clear water, and we see its great mouth ... and then it is lost.The very phrase ""the great fish"" would instantly put one in mind of Hemingway, and Dill's terse, somewhat macho utterances (with spartan-ish lifestyle to match) would just fit that bill, so you would be forgiven for thinking that you're in for a movie with a grizzled old former war hero of few words out to get the bane of his life in the form of the tuna, and only coming back to shore for the occasional dose of *@4!#?^+*! in the sack with Constance (that's Diane Lane's character).That the film does NOT follow that course, inter alia due to the arrival in it of Dill's ex Karen (Anne Hathaway) and her perverted brute of a husband Frank (a quite-good Jason Clarke), is a tribute to those who made it (Knight also wrote), but at the same time devalues the aforementioned encounter with a great wild beast and wonder of nature that was the early (possibly the only) highlight here; for this watcher at least!The sharp-eyed may have an inkling of what is actually going down here from an early moment, as the film's dullish, small-townish (""everybody knows everybody's business"") setting of ""Plymouth Island"" can't quite seem to make up its mind if it is in the Caribbean, or somewhere off the Carolinas, or perhaps even further north. The vegetation here looks vaguely tropical, but nothing on the island quite seems to hang together ... as well it might not, given the way events unfold.And truly, though the idea taking shape here IS unconventional, radical and somehow appealing, it does indeed seem - whether you like it or not - to leave things looking worthless, even as it enlightens. Unsurprising, given that Dill feels exactly the same thing himself, and he's IN the film, not just watching it! And somehow there's no rescuing this piece from the unwanted apathy - as much as gloom - that is likely to overwhelm the majority of watchers.In the middle of all that, you might like the eccentric linking role of Reid Miller, played by Jeremy Strong, or you REALLY might not!",Serenity
52,allanmichael30,Nerdy kid obsessed with his war hero dead fathers sex life and fishing ?,5,1 March 2019,"This film is has beatiful scenery and well directed and almoust brilliant but story lame maybe fish could have been metaphor for his stepfather and he wanted his dad to kill it.
The film maybe is made for the ladies,only watched it because i like watching mconahay movies. The film was tough to watch for first hour director was obsesed with mconahays body with plenty of shots of his butt and only one scene where ann hathways was naked. This is pehaps not what i like to watch needed more of a balance or no sex scenes as they were stupid and ruined story.
The main story was about Baker Dill a fisherman obssed with catching this giant tuna and great story loved that scene. The fishman ex wife turns up and ask him to kill her new boyfriend as his child is suffering take him on fishing trip and kill him.
The plot got kind of wierd after that and revealed that as their child created this reality and its kind of loop like truman show. The only problem is that he created this game as a way of coping with his abusive step father and bring back the father he loved. This gets wierd as his father in the simulation is in to fishing and sex lots of it ,but mainly with some lady who owns a cat and lives in shipping container. Then their another scene where his mother and father have sex. Why would he create a sex simulator with his parrents. Then in real life kills his step father? The stabbing at end was not needed just stupid.",Serenity
53,RonellSowes,Asinine Film,1,22 January 2021,"Why couldn't they just make a film like the one the logline suggests? A neo-noir thriller of a woman plotting to kill her husband. Perhaps a little contrived but certainly no worse than the mess that is Serenity. It starts off like some sort of Moby Dick knockoff before taking a sharp turn to become a thriller and then...it implodes. Revealing itself to be a mind twisting and utterly illogical concept of a video game world all from the mind of Steven Knight. How this bafoon was given the oppurtunity to transform his absurdities into film is maybe even more baffling than the film itself.
Don't be fooled into believing this film is something like what you think, for I can assure you it isn't. The title might derive from the serenity of the vegetative state this picture might leave you in from its asinineness.",Serenity
54,kjproulx,A Strange Film from Start to Finish,3,25 February 2019,"I always love when an original concept makes it to the big screen, but sadly, not every original idea will resonate with every viewer. In the case of Serenity, it seems as though many people have chosen to be detached from it in terms of relatability. I admire when filmmakers go out of their way to create a bizarre world that usually would not work, but goes for it anyways. Unfortunately, Serenity is one of the strangest films I have seen in quite some time and also one that I feel is quite terrible as a whole. Although there was an effort to impress here, it failed on many levels and here is why.After a burnout fisherman is approached by his ex-wife, his new mission turns into whether or not he is okay with murdering her new husband, due to his violence toward her and their son. That premise alone works as a movie, but that is about as much as I can say without ruining where the film takes a turn. This is where I admire the filmmakers for trying, even though it did not work at all. The twist that this film delivers may work for a handful of people, but I fear that viewers will most likely laugh once the film reveals what it is truly about.Matthew McConaughey is a fantastic actor and has truly proven his worth throughout the past decade or so. Nominated for numerous awards and appearing in Oscar-nominated films consistently, I always look forward to the next project he chooses to sink his teeth into. While I will not say his performance is fantastic here, he is definitely committed from start to finish. He carries this movie in a dramatic way, but his wacky character feels a little fake at times. He is quite over-the-top here and it almost stood out as a negative to me.On top of this crazy performance, as I mentioned, the twist this film delivers is one of the best and worst twists I have witnessed in years. There is a sense of humour to it for the viewers, but the movie takes everything so seriously that it really collapsed as a whole. This film would have had a lot of potential if it winked at the audience, but it just asked you to buy into the entire premise as if it were real. This aspect of the film alone is what turned me off. I enjoyed watching this film in a weird way, but that does not mean I actually liked the film.In the end, Serenity is a great film to watch if you are a film lover and have someone to watch the film with, while having a few drinks. There were times when I had to question how these filmmakers thought certain plot devices were going to work for the majority of moviegoers because it simply feels ridiculous when the true storyline kicks in. Serenity may end up being on my list of films to never watch from 2019, but it certainly is a memorable one, so take from that what you will.",Serenity
55,Headturner1,Film noir.,4,4 February 2019,Does anyone know hat that means or have you watched true film noir? No? This was ridiculous. I knew he was dead 30 min in. The rest was just unbelievable garbage. None of it mattered once he was dead. I thought they'd make it a kind of purgatory for all the cast but no. The compulsion for him to catch this tuna was ridiculous as well as the salesman. Not a big fan of Mathew but do like hathaway. But this was not a good script and annes acting was cartoonish.,Serenity
56,msbreviews,Rating: D-,2,28 January 2019,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)I will always respect and appreciate the will of a director/writer in trying to do something bold and bonkers. Whether that's a divisive plot twist, a double-faced character or even an unusual method of filming, it doesn't really matter, as long as it succeeds. Steven Knight delivers a story that doesn't feel right from the get-go. Everything feels strange and random, with weird dialogues and awkward hints at something underneath it all. Then, a somewhat predictable plot twist changes pretty much everything since our perspective is entirely different now. However, it sinks the movie even more and creates a whole bunch of incongruencies and plot holes.The film wasn't near good before the twist, and it gradually transformed itself into something jaw-droppingly bad, after it. In addition to this, the final message that Steven Knight leaves the audience with, is probably one of the worst ones since The Emoji Movie. ""Doing the wrong things for the right reasons"" is always going to be a controversial statement, but in this particular case, having in mind what happens in the movie and who does it involve, it's 100% wrong and I want to believe that Knight didn't exactly want to transmit this in the way that he did.There's an intriguing and meaningful story to be told deep down in this messy screenplay. Behind all of the unnecessary exposition scenes (there's no need to describe what's happening since the twist is quite self-explanatory) and cringe-worthy dialogues, there's a well-structured narrative and an extraordinary concept to be explored. However, I have no idea what happened to the script nor the production and filming stages of the film, but I understand now why its original release date in October was postponed to the traditional January's garbage. This was supposed to be an Oscar-bait movie: an Oscar-nominated director/writer plus two Oscar-winner protagonists, in a film that seems to be more than what it actually is? I guess the production companies saw this coming and they tried to prevent an even bigger flop.I'm always the first to defend that a movie without at least ""good"" technical attributes is rarely one of the best of the year. However, I'm also the first to affirm that if a film fails to deliver a captivating story with compelling characters, there's no magnificent cinematography or mind-blowing special effects that can salvage it. Serenity doesn't even have that. Despite me feeling pleased that it was filmed in one-location and that the set design is pretty sweet, the editing is incredibly choppy. It feels like Knight had to remove several cuts in order to reduce the overlong runtime, which wasn't performed in the best way possible. There are a lot of moments where a character is facing a side, and in the next cut, the former is already facing a completely different one (this particular thing really occurs often).Regarding the characters, Baker and his son are definitely the ones that we learn more about since their connection is continuously addressed. Like I wrote above, there's a relevant story behind all of this mayhem, but I did saw (even if briefly) the light at the end of this very dark tunnel. That light is instantly consumed by the darkness as new characters or subplots start to show up, and the hollowness prevails over everything else. Jeremy Strong's character is baffling ridiculous, Diane Lane (Constance) is one of the dozens of logical reasons why the twist doesn't work, but the one who annoyed me the most didn't even show up. You spend a whole movie talking about this one person, like it is going to be a crucial subplot, and then you forget about it. You merely end the film, and it's like that character was never even mentioned... Why? Why give even more reasons for someone to leave the theater frustrated?Then, there's the tone. It's weird until the twist and weirder after it. Not even Matthew McConaughey or Anne Hathaway can save themselves from some awfully delivered lines. Nevertheless, it's the cast who saves this wreckage of being an F. McConaughey is a hell of an actor and he demonstrates his outstanding range throughout the runtime. Hathaway has less to do, and I felt that her lines were the worst, but I can't argue with her ability to deliver any emotion. Jason Clarke (Frank Zariakas) is perfect as the violent father/husband, and Djimon Hounsou (Duke) has some space to shine.In the end, Serenity tries to go big and bold, but falls astonishingly flat. Plot holes, logical incongruencies, awful dialogues, terrible editing, hollow characters, and neglected subplots. Steven Knight had a great concept and a truly interesting thriller-mystery in his mind, but his execution is shockingly baffling, and the twist transforms everything into something way worse. The final message is the number one reason why I don't recommend anyone to see this movie, especially if you take teens or kids with you. Matthew McConaughey is good enough to avoid a total disaster, and I know that there was something incredible behind all of this horrible mess. It's probably going to end up as one of the worst films of 2019, unless we have a truly disastrous year in cinema.",Serenity
57,RussHog,Garbage first draft of a screenplay,1,23 September 2020,Someone must have typed this movie in like - a week? A day?

He's a brit best known for their popular Peaky Blinders series, but that and nothing else he's done has translated to success here in the US. How Matthew M and Anne Hathaway got roped into this surely leads to a tale of fraud, either on them, us, or both. There is a decent nut of story in ""Serenity"" but it's buried in the film till past the first hour! And then it's presented in such a shallow and rushed manner that it's just lost on the viewer.

61,andrewroy-04316,"Though the script is heavy-handed, the mockery of Serenity is unjust and misses the intention of the twist",8,13 August 2019,"I was very close to not watching Serenity because it was so panned by critics and audiences alike, and saw people say variations of ""just read the plot summary on Wikipedia, it's an absolute joke"" many times. Still, I heard the twist was bold, liked Knight's previous film, Locke, and the acting talent is there, so I took a chance. I get why it's polarizing, but I can't quite understand how so many people say it's comically bad. Several of the lines are far too on the nose, sure, and the twist wasn't revealed in a climactic way. Where people seem to be frustrated with the movie is that the twist is ""lazy"" and calls the entire plot to that point irrelevant, since the characters we spent all movie with are just simulations. However, this completely misses the whole point of the twist and of the movie: it's a picture of how Patrick sees the world and copes with having an abusive father. It's not a flaw but part of the design that many of the characters feel like caricatures - Frank is so unredeemably evil it's hard to see him as a person, but crucially he's not a person, but the simulated rendering of him in Patrick's mind. This is also why Dill is a far more complex and nuanced character than others: Patrick spent far more time coding him in than most side characters. When you look at it from the coding perspective, a criticism I've seen a lot is how messed up it is that Patrick, a 13 year old, would put the sexual fantasies into the game. Again, this misses a key plot point (and a morally intriguing choice made by Knight): the characters in the game are gradually achieving some sort of consciousness through machine learning. Their actions aren't all strictly programmed, their personalities are given some guidelines in the code for their goals and attitudes and they develop from there, so Dill's weird sexual relationship with Constance, for example, wasn't necessarily explicitly coded by Patrick.
I will say I didn't love the Reid Miller character, as they never explain why he's always slightly late or why Patrick would code in a character basically to enforce the rules.
At its core, Serenity is an analysis of the mental space of a 13 year old with an abusive father who spends hours creating a game as his way to cope, and our perspective just starts within the game. Maybe the fact that we start inside the game and only later realize its true nature and who the real protagonist make viewers feel cheated by most of the plot. Regardless, the twist is satisfying if not exceptional, as there are clues given throughout and it does add to the story in showing Patrick's worldview and mental state. The very end was quite unexpected and hit me hard, as I hadn't processed Patrick's intentions with changing the rules until you see the parallels between the game and real life at the very end, and I also hadn't considered that Dill actually died at war, which adds another layer to his character and Patrick's devotion to him. Moral questions are raised both in the traditional veins of whether it's okay to harm or kill an abusive person, as well as the moral responsibility on the creator of a simulation with potentially conscious beings. McConaughey is great and convincing as someone driven by coded-in goals but enough complexity to question the nature of his reality. Some of the scenes and lines just felt a little over the top or heavy handed for me to qualify it as a great movie, but Serenity has lots of great ideas and pieces, and I think the very ambitious and original premise is executed quite effectively. Maybe I'm missing part of the comedically bad side of it, but the more I consider it, the more I'm satisfied and intrigued by the film. Definitely worth watching, if for no other reason than that it is a unique and bold project where you'll find a wide variety of opinions on it.",Serenity
62,thekingsdom,Cardboard Dialogue,5,25 June 2019,"The dialogue in this film is stiffer than a porn star's 'love sausage' on Viagra. Some of the lines were so cardboard it felt like I was watching a soap opera. Dear writers, normal people don't speak like this. It's like me saying: ""I took a crowbar, cracked open the white box and investigated the internal contents""....or in real life.. ""I opened the fridge"". The lines may look snappy and intellectual sounding when written on paper but if doesn't sound real in real life, then don't use it. If characters are speaking lines that no one in real life would say, I'm not going to get emotionally involved with them. So for me, the big fail in this film was the dialogue. Bad dialogue separates me from getting involved with the story. If I'm questioning whether the characters sound real, then I'm not involved in the story. As for the story itself, well it's pretty bland. It starts off ok but once we had 'the twist' it just went nowhere and I was like ""meh"". Overall, a 4.5/10 for me.",Serenity

65,sweidman-28016,Horrible Movie With So Much Potential,2,1 February 2019,"Serenity Review:I honestly forgot about writing this review because I forgot about this movie. It has a great cast, a few good camera shots, and a good trailer. I didn't like this movie and neither did many people. The trailer was really good and made it look so interesting. The cast was stellar and it looked to make for a good thriller. The script and plot was what actually ruined it. It was so boring. Oscar nominated Steven Knight has wrote some good scripts and directed a couple good movies (Locke being one of my favorite). He had the right idea with the plot, but made it lackluster with the most bizarre twist halfway through. That twist literally had me laughing in my seat because it didn't work and it was just so random. If anyone who contributed to the $4.4 million it made this past weekend (the budget was $25 million and it'll never make that back) they probably agree. The start of the movie made it look kind of like it was going to be a 90s thriller on water. Even the score, cinematography, and title looked like that which I thought was odd. Speaking of cinematography, every time a new character was introduced they did a fast cut from their back to their face which was annoying. I don't know what to say. I don't feel like spoiling the twist because I don't want to talk about that whole mess. It could've been interesting but the way it was executed and with the whole script and story it didn't work. The leads did fine with their acting and there were a couple cool looking shots, but overall this was a big mess that had so much potential.My Grade: D",Serenity
66,JakeBrinkman,Almost blows Hollywood out of the water,7,1 September 2019,"Serenity is exactly the sort of risk that Hollywood needs to be taking. Movies that play it safe are more likely to win an Oscar, but they're much less likely to become well loved for decades to come. Serenity plays a most aggressive game, and it nearly succeeds in becoming one of my favorite films of 2019. Based on the shockingly abysmal IMDb and Metacritic ratings, I doubt that this film will become a well-known classic, but I predict it becoming a cult classic all the same (and I don't mean the so-bad-it's-good sort of cult classic).The scenery and cinematography is exceptionally well made. The film's events and characters all show an extremely well-written depth that somehow also feels shallow and one-dimensional, which is perfectly explained by the film's climax that takes every risk required for a movie to truly become unforgettable.My only real complaint is that the film drags on far too long after the climax is concluded. I know that 1:46 already makes Serenity a relatively short film, but I do think that 1:30-1:35 would have been a much more suitable runtime that would present an excellently satisfying and thought-provoking film.",Serenity

68,Just-A-Girl-14,I'm not sure how I feel about this,6,8 March 2021,"Half way through the movie there's a major plot twist. I heard there was a twist coming so I was expecting one but it was different than what I thought it would be and to be honest, something about it didn't feel right. With the exception of the suited man, the first half seemed pretty straightforward but the twist changed everything. The idea is actually really good. Abused kids often find escape in their own way so it makes a lot of sense but I don't think it was done well. If the idea was a video game then the first half should have been different. For example, we should have seen less of Matthew McConaughey's butt (not that I'm complaining). I can't really put my finger on it but It's like the first half and the second half were forced together. Something just didn't feel right.
Also, I'm not sure that Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway were a good choice. Both are good actors but the chemistry between them also felt off. Oh and btw, blonde is really not a good color on Hathaway. She has such unique brown eyes. She should really keep her hair dark.
Anyways, I think it would have been a better movie if they worked more on the script or maybe just loose the twist.

At first I didn't know where the story was going but as the film unfolded, it became quite clear what the story was telling us, on another coping mechanism a child may use to escape domestic and the breaking point of said mechanism. The bad reviews are 100% wrong, because to not like the story is saying I don't understand abuse and don't care what tolls it may take on child. Don't get me wrong, the story a tad bit farfetched but overall it made sense and was enjoyable to watch.

72,Stay_away_from_the_Metropol,87-93 story with a 98-2003 arc and contemporary sheen,8,5 February 2019,"So, I went to the theater and saw SERENITY tonight. Was it absurd? Yes. Did I kind of love it? Yes. It's totally over the top: the characters, the acting, the dialogue, the concepts. Everything about it. Jason Clarke annihilated it as an absolutely despicable man. Anne Hathaway was viciously seductive. And McConaughey was full McConaughey - because of his ability to completely sell things, I do believe this movie will go down as a bit of a cult classic. It mostly felt like a movie that would have been made between 1987 and 1993, along the lines of Basic Instinct, 9 1/2 Weeks, Fatal Attraction, maybe a little Falling Down. But then, even more so, Wild Things. Overly dramatic and mostly unpredictable with sudden surges of seduction. Then, it gets even more absurd and turns into something more along the lines of Vanilla Sky... or even a little Truman Show. Much like this movie, the last movie I watched was Velvet Buzzsaw, another film which most people and critics are TEARING APART, because it creates it's own world and requires a suspension of disbelief. For some reason, the average person can't seem to find anything to appreciate in most offerings of surrealism or the abstract and I'll never quite understand it. Personally, I felt like this movie probably came from a very personal place for the writer/director. I laughed at it's absurdity, I was intrigued, I was tense, and it made me feel emotional things as well. Also, it's beautifully shot, in a beautiful setting! I was thoroughly impressed and fully back this bold, creative, ambitious film. I don't think I would change a thing about it.",Serenity
73,Magow-Intermean,Serenity Review,7,23 March 2019,"The small-town life of fisherman Baker Dill (Matthew McConaughey) is disrupted when ex-wife Karen (Anne Hathaway) blows into his life with an offer: ply her violent gangster husband (Jason Clarke) with drink and then thrown him overboard for $10 million. Will Baker accept the indecent proposal?
Written and directed by Steven Knight (the talent behind Cronenberg's Eastern Promises screenplay and the writer-director of Locke), Serenity is a film of two equally disappointing halves. The first looks to revamp the tropical crime thriller, a heady cocktail of sun, sex, subterfuge and sailing, in a modern milieu. The second takes the premise into a whole different unforeseen zone of madness while still playing on familiar noir themes of fate and destiny. Either way, the film misfires on practically all levels, wasting an A-list cast, some intriguing ideas and big ambition on a story that is deeply flawed, and over-sincere but under-cooked.
Set on the the sleepy sun-kissed island of Plymouth Island, the action centres on McConaughey's Baker Dill, the moniker joining Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation's Vilmer Slaughter and Contact's Palmer Joss in The Most Ridiculous McConaughey Character Name stakes. Dill is an Iraq vet turned skipper of small fishing boat The Serenity and has a Captain A-hab/Moby Dick relationship with tuna. He also has an on/off thing with Constance (Diane Lane), and his course seems pretty set until his ex-wife and mother of his son, Karen (Hathaway, all blonde hair, smoky eyes and cigarette holding-as-acting) turns up with a proposition: take her violent multi-millionaire husband Frank (Clarke) on a fishing trip, get him sozzled and toss him to the sharks for $10 million and the prospect of getting back with her.The writing is tin-eared and the performances feel bizarrely off.
So far, so Double Indemnity in espadrilles. But there are strange quirks. Dill is haunted by memories of his dead son and is chased around by a mysterious fishing equipment salesman (Jeremy Strong). What is weirder, given the talent involved, is the tone; the writing is tin-eared and the performances from such such stellar talents as McConaughey, Hathaway, Clarke and Djimon Hounsou (as Dill's loyal first mate) feel bizarrely off, stylised without riffing on a style. Yet slowly, the film begins to reveal its true colours in a Shyamalan/Nolan-esque twist that reframes the story but neither redeems the 'bad' quality of the first half or manages to answer all the questions raised by the sharp turn. There are interesting ideas around the role of storytelling and the nature of free will, but Serenity never manages to engage or address them.
If you are being kind, the pretty, sun-drenched Mauritius locations might send you running to Trivago and Knight at least goes for broke, trying something bold and adventurous rather than playing it safe. But the end result has the unique quality of being simultaneously silly yet sombre, a waste of on-screen and behind-the-scenes talent that perhaps raises the biggest question of all: how did so many great people come together to make this drivel?Serenity is a genuine headscratcher, baffling on almost every level. Badly scripted, strangely acted and poorly pitched, there is so much to pick over it's hard to know where to begin. Sometimes the best of bold intentions are just not enough.",Serenity
74,fciocca,"A small gem of Cinema, a decent plot twist, but overall nothing new under the sun",6,11 June 2020,"You cannot really understand what this movie is about by simply watching the poster or the trailer. It seems that it will go on a very specific direction, but halfway there is the real revelation: and is something that you don't see coming, there are a few clues here and there, but you can't really understand until a specific scene comes out. The way they handled the plot is amazing, but in terms of originality, there is nothing new under the sun. For me the best moment of the whole movie is at the very end, when finally the mistery around Plymouth island will finally be completely uncovered. The movie needs to be watched more than once, in order to understand every single aspect of it.Matthew McConaughey comes back with a quality production, after the awful Beach Bum, but this is not his best performance: he could give to his character more personality, and we are very far away from the acting skills shown in True Detective. A real pity, considering that he is practically the character that has most on screen time. Anne Hathaway and Jason Clarke are good, but they are both side characters, and honestly did not have much room for a deep development considering the plot.",Serenity

The movie starts with good premises, the plot and the characters sound intriguing enough as to engage the viewer, but as the story unfolds, it gets confused, the thrilling side is badly blurred by a kind of science-fiction drift, as to get an uncontrolled and messy sci-fic thriller. And in the end, it even does not surprise that much, since by the middle of the picture we may guess what is hiding behind the intriguing plot. Some mystery relies in the final encounter between father and son, but this does not lift the movie above a mediocre level. Matthew Mccounaghey gives a good performance, this is the kind of role fit for him, and does not disappoint, as opposed to Anne Hathaway, who does not shine, whereas Daine Lane is confined to a minor role that does not render justice to her acting skill. On the whole, rather a disappointing movie, which could have been much more enjoying.",Serenity

Started to be better when poor wife appeared, but still really below average.The real question is how this attracted famous actors ? I guess that with better direction could be at least more watchable, although dialogs are poor too, and that is what is visible in script, I guess.Diane Lane was so underused - not connected to story really.

He daily takes tourists out on fishing trips, but he personally has a mission of his own to catch a large tuna fish who keeps escaping from him.Baker soon finds his ex-wife is in town (Anne Hathaway) and encounters her. She offers him a large sum of money if he will kill her husband (played by Jason Clarke) who has become unbearable to live with due to his consistent abuse. There is also a man in a suit who is continually trying to catch Baker in person but always misses him just by the nick of time. What does he want with Baker? And who is he? These are just some of the many questions in this film.As the film progresses, Baker soon has to make some rather challenging choices. Along with this, the things that surround Baker in his everyday life aren't actually what they appear to be...This review will be brief, as for the sake for spoilers, there's not much I can share about Serenity.If you've seen the film's trailer, I advise you to simply ignore it. I found the film's trailer misleading as to what this film is actually about. If you ignore the film's trailer, you will find Serenity tries to gives the audience the set up to a major twist. The only problem with this is that I found the major twist incredibly predictable with the film basically giving it away far too early. Once the twist comes into play, we have to suffer through the leading characters adjusting to what the audience already knew. This hurts the rest of the film, with the twist dragging and becoming dull (not to mention extremely hard to accept).Matthew McConaughey does well on a performance level but there is nothing new or exciting here from the actor. He fishes, he smokes plenty of cigarettes, makes love to women and says a small amount of dialogue along with frowning and thinking deep thoughts. That there is nothing new or exciting from the actor could also be said about Anne Hathaway, who I feel is here more for star power and looks than being used for her true talent as an actress.As far as the film's visuals, sure there are some points to praise, but this is only a minor element of the film. The film mostly feels bland, dark and gritty.Overall, Serenity is a complete surprise and sadly not of the good kind. This is a film that sets up a hugely predictable twist that is filled with flaws. Brilliant actors such as Matthew McConaughey & Anne Hathaway are simply wasted on the screen. The film's trailer is also misleading as to the end and final results. The whole film is simply a major disappointed considering the cast.3.8/10

It doesn't really ruin the movie, but, it does put it in a compromising position.From there, though this movie is no The Truman Show, or The Matrix, it isn't nearly half as bad as projected. It's reveal answers quite a few questions one would find asking themselves throughout the movie, like; how does news travel so fast. especially when it's so personal, or why was Karen's introduction the way it was, or, why does everyone seem to be doing the same thing over and over again, though not necessarily conspicuously?Also, the connection to why Patrick named his father Baker Dill, wasn't a bad a touch at all. Frank's relaying of Patrick's words, when he was talking to John, and John quoting Patrick with Frank, was another pretty good inclusion.What may have worked against this movie the most I believe, was its desire to come across as a dramatic mystery, which could definitely work for this movie, however it would require more substance. As it was, it may have fared better, as a mystery sci/fi, but it fell in the same trap as movies such as Self/Less, and pretty much suffered the same fate.Personally, I ended up enjoying Serenity, but I do acknowledge that it may have bitten off more than it could chew, with not enough bait to hook its audience as it intended. 6/10.",Serenity

Dill is only considering it to free his son Patrick (Rafael Sayegh) from Frank too.This is a strange one. Acting is all okay, but when you find out what is really going on you would classify this as Sci-Fi. What is going on? A game, of course unknown to Dill, who does catch on later in the movie.Problem: Is Dill alive? We do hear a news report that John (Dill) was killed in a military action overseas. So who is this? Jeremy Strong as Reid Miller tells Dill the game is afoot (also he's the one who also tries to give Dill a fish unit to tell where the fish are.) Listen carefully to the conversation between Dill and Miller on the beach as your answers are here.Who is controlling the game? We see a very deep connection between Dill and his son Patrick via a computer screen or Dill talking out loud and Patrick hears him. Like I said strange. So think of it this way: Patrick has created this world (this whole story) to get rid of his Stepfather and get back with Dill or John, his real father. See it's like a Sci-Fi story if you look at it like I just said. We just got side-tracked thinking this was Dill's story.Am I giving away too much? Probably.

86,TheVictoriousV,Oh my God... what?,1,20 February 2019,"I have seen movies that make it seem as though the screenplay was nothing but a game of Mad Libs. Rarely has it seemed like said game of Mad Libs was still being played during principal photography. A film like Serenity (not to be confused with the 2005 Firefly film) has no business taking itself this seriously, let alone seriously at all.It starts out with a cliché tsunami; not a regular tsunami, ergo the tropical island we visit remains safe. Matthew McConaughey plays, or at least delivers the lines of Baker Dill, a man who fishes for a giant tuna known as ""Justice"" when he isn't visiting Diane Lane for a quick shag. The enigmatic Reid (Jeremy Strong) is following Baker around and fellow fisher Duke (Djimon Hounsou) delivers anvilicious words of wisdom.Then suddenly there's Karen (Anne Hathaway), Baker's femme fatale ex-wife who tells Baker she and their son are being terrorized by the horrible Frank (Jason Clarke), her current husband. In true Book of Henry fashion, Karen logically concludes that Baker should invite Frank on a seemingly innocuous fishing trip, only to then get him drunk enough to push him into the water, putting him at the mercy of ""Justice"". If Baker agrees, says Karen, she will give him a check for 10 million. Oh right, while this is going on, Baker seems to recevie telepathic messages of sorts from the son.These characters are stereotypes of such cartoonish proportions (Hathaway was compared to Jessica Rabbit at one point, just with less going on in the bazooka department) that it becomes all the more fascinating that the movie is neither a parody of noir, nor self-aware. I suppose there is an explanation, but numerous other questions arise once it's been given (as mad as it is, it fails to make up for the dullness of the rest of the movie).I'm speaking of the twist; there are several but this one is the biggest. I won't reveal it but it does involve the son character and the scenes showing him playing computer games as a means of escapism. It is a prime example of ""Just because you don't see it coming, doesn't mean it's a good twist"", legitimately up there with such insane hypotheticals as ""Forrest Gump was actually a vampire all along"", ""Shawshank was really floating through space à la Dark City"", and ""The Village takes place in modern times"".An ideal twist makes you get the film, and if not, improve it upon repeat viewings until you do get it. This one was genuinely maddening (unsatisfying doesn't cover it) and will cause the film to make LESS sense. The last film I saw before this was Glass and boy does this one make me appreciate the typical Shyamalan twists a whole lot more.So what am I saying? Oh God, wait for this movie to come out on VOD and see it! Bring friends, alcohol, and some Neil Breen to watch after.",Serenity
87,bastos,Mash up of genres that leaves a bad taste,5,12 January 2021,"Steven Knight is a prolific writer who has very few titles as a director under his belt. This is his follow up to Locke, a movie I quite enjoyed. It has star power, production value and an intriguing screenplay. So what went wrong? I think the main problem with this movie is that it tries to be many different things without being very good at any of them. It's not a very good noir, it's not a very good drama, it's not a very good thriller and ultimately it's not a very good sci-fiish tale. This also has the effect of confusing the audience that can't grasp what kind of movie they are watching. I'm all for originality and something different, but the execution needs to be good to pull off something this ambitious, Dark City being a good example of something like this that works. And I'm no prude but am I the only one to be bothered by the fact that this hypersexualized story is created by a little kid?

But the film story does have a purpose and what your seeing is a subconscious mind in conflict with itself, it's clever and the acting in this film is Incredible.Most of the story you're possibly getting from the trailer where Matthew plays a freshman that seriously intense at time, his ex-wife played by Anne Hathaway who turn up out of now with asking for him to kill her Abusive husband played by Jason Clarke.Don't let this part of story fool you, you have to listen to the dialogue which reveals what is actually happen, the ending reveals more than you realize which make this film actually a well-written story, with a mind-blowing theme that will mess with your head if you not paying attention.Dislikes: I think the Film does reveal a little too much in the 2nd act of the film, but it's not actually what going on so that might fool some audiences.",Serenity

I think that was it.And---------this fish story is WAY past its ""use by"" date. What A Stinker. In the first 15 minutes they pulled out every trope re: man vs. fish. Disgraceful. When Matt C. says (the dramatic emoting in this movie gives slapstick a bad name): ""I already gave that fish a name. His name is . . . (dramatic dramatic pause, glug glug with the whiskey) . . . 'Justice.'"" Beyond ridiculous.Sorry. But that was it for me. I think 5.1 is way too high a score. And what a tragedy. I love Djimon, but even he couldn't lure me in to watch this moronic mess.Oh.

112,varun-25071997,A Brave Attempt,7,20 February 2019,"Serenity isn't the film for you if you are looking to be entertained by action and tension. Director Steven knight's new film explores various subjects and creates a mind bending neo-noir thriller which has similarities to the film Machinist in terms of film making approach.The story is about a happy go lucky always dull fisherman Dill who is obsessed about catching a particular fish. He spends most of his time at bar and with his sex partner Constance. His relationship with his assistant is a very important part of this film and Anne Hathaway's arrival forms the core of the movie.A movie set in a very tranquil mood, shot entirely in Mauritius has some brilliant visuals and colors. While the score isn't anything fancy it syncs well with some scenes. This is one of the movies which would be appreciated a few years after its release and may as well as end up gaining the cult status.",Serenity

Matthew McConaughey is horrible, as always, but women do get to see his naked ass for at least 5 minutes, and Anne gives her worst performance ever, directing is the so bad, and so is the cutting, terrible terrible movie.",Serenity
114,margulanabutrlov,Serenity Review,9,11 March 2019,"Shortly after the publication of his short story ""The Vane Sisters"" - in which a plot twist is revealed through a hidden acrostic message in the final paragraph - Vladimir Nabokov quipped that the narrative trick he employed was something that ""can only be tried once in a thousand years of fiction."" Perhaps we'll need to call for a similar moratorium, albeit for entirely different reasons, on the type of twist that powers Steven Knight's soggy, island-bound noir ""Serenity.""
Instead of a caper with Kate Hudson, McConaughey has got a mess written and directed by Steven Knight. The captain - his captain, Baker Dill - has unsexy sex with Diane Lane's character. He tries to catch that fish alongside his dutiful first mate (Djimon Hounsou). He puts up with the nerdy, White Rabbity stranger (Jeremy Strong) chasing after him and managing the return of Karen, this ex of his and mother of his son. She's played by Anne Hathaway, as a blonde, and her arrival at the local bar appears to be an event so momentous that the camera has to sprint-swoop around her to gawk. I laughed when it did. Baker Dill is a lousy character name. But that camera pivot is lousier.
Complications arise when Baker gets a visit from Karen (Anne Hathaway, vamping it up as a smoky-eyed femme fatale), his childhood sweetheart with whom he once fathered a child. Karen has since married into money via a comically loathsome sadist with underworld connections named Frank (Jason Clarke), and she makes Baker a desperate offer: Take Frank out on a fishing trip during their weekend getaway, ply him with booze and toss him to the sharks, and she'll pay him $10 million in cash for his trouble.",Serenity

116,levybob,Not nearly as bad as I'd heard,5,30 September 2019,I have to give this film credit for being absolutely unique. I knew there was going to be a major plot revelation half-way through; a revelation that most critics detested. Well the revelation does take place. And I have to say it works (for me). Not that there aren't holes in the story-telling. And not that there isn't a lot of over-acting. But the fact that is revealed is a touching fact. It gives the viewer someone or something to root for. And might even help the view tap into his / her own wishes and hopes. Give it a try.,Serenity

Then you think about a dramatic turning point, which already goes wrong because you already anticipate the ending in the middle.If you had given these three stars, who are all Topfit and beautiful, a treasure and some voodoo, then it would have been a top adventure movie or you would have simply continued it as a thriller without a genre mix.",Serenity
118,shimenpf,Strange,6,11 August 2019,"Yes. This is a very strange movie. It certainly stands out as an unpredictable story. The good things for me: its conflict, which is constant and non-stop in almost every scene, and it also escalates and grows; the questions it seeds, that keep you wanting to get answers and continue watching; the dilemma the hero faces, since, right out of the bat, it has no actual right or wrong answers.
The bad thing is mostly its sudden change of tone near the end. I don't even mind that much the videogame revelation. It was interesting. But the moment where the real kid actually takes a knife to kill a man, that's completely out of tone with rest of the movie and really shouldn't have been in the movie. On a lower note, the pace is a little too slow at times, but that's a little issue compared to the dark ending.

McConaughey appears to play the same drunken role as in True Detective, while Hathaway has high hopes of being a Noir Siren, but only comes across as frenetic and out of place.As for the ending... well, straight out of The Twilight Zone...

125,teutonfirst,An advanced drama,7,18 March 2019,"As a gamer I found quite interesting the take of this movie, a nice metaphor regarding the saying that what is ment to happen to someone it will happen no matter of one's awareness of his situation. Drawn to your destiny, or purpose. I expected to dislike the movie, not a big fan of drama, but I enjoyed it. Has a sort of happy ending.
Now about what was wrong in this movie. The scene where a naked man swim in the ocean towards a naked boy... Awkward . If the world was created by a 13 years old boy, on his computer, the sex scenes, the drinking, personal memories of his father, his mother sexual abuse, were way beyond his knowledge and experience to implement in his game/world. Overall, acting was great a solid 7.",Serenity
126,ivans536,"Interesting, but ruined concept",5,21 March 2019,"Boasting a great accomplished cast and a (more or less) proven director, you could be left wondering why this film didn't receive a wider release, or why you missed the marketing for this film?Well my theory is that it was buried, because the studio knew they had a costly dud on their hands.The problems start with the script that begs for rewrites. The dialogue is very lazy and obvious (similar to naming the Moby Dick-like fish Justice), and the cast is completely wasted and too much of the dialogue is just telling a narrative. This could all be partially explained with the concepto of the film, but then again if the script was better and sounded more true to life, no one would complain.I won't spoil the concept, but you'll get it half way through the movie anyway. It's sad, because the film obviously tries to be mysterious and tense, but shoots it's load too early. While it admittedly doesn't work completely, the first half of the movie is the more potent half, and if the screenwriters didn't give us the explanation before there even is a mystery to be solved, it might have worked. This way, the later portion of the movie is a tedious will he-won't he, followed by a utterly predictable conxlusion.Liked: the choice of the actors

133,fxdx4,Tries to be more than it should be and fails.,4,7 March 2019,"As I read looked at the Serenity IMDB page, I noticed the genre was si-fi. I thought maybe it was confused with the mid 2000s Serenity, but nope... keep that in mind.The story follows a seas captain who takes tourist out on his boat during the day, fishes at night, and has some kind of relationship with older women in his spare time. His ex then reappears in his life and asks her to kill her abusive husband.
There is good in this movie. It is a fine performance by Matthew McConaughey, showing his range and intensity. Hathaway captivates as well, although the usually steady Jason Clarke's performance seems forced. The mood as setting are good, and the first 1/2 of the film works well.Then the problems start. You will immediately know when the movie is about to go into the toilet. I audibly groaned to myself, and shook my head. It didn't get better, with massive plot holes, nonsensical character interactions and just general 'who caresedness'.I would like to say the director does an admirable job in the attempt to do a different type of story, but I found it lazy and would have been way better if he left the si-fi element out of it. There is a good if not great story here, and he had the cast to do it.I didn't turn the film off, and it had moments which I can appreciate, but as a film it fails. The call is 4/10 - Sorry Matthew, your string of duds continues, but at least this one is not on you.",Serenity

137,MooWoolf1,Could have been better,7,9 February 2019,"I'm not going to talk about what everyone else stated before.I'll talk about that how this talented director but not as good writer could have done it better.It was all ok. All original for most of the time. Then came the idea of the game. That part was not well written, if you just think about that an 8 or 10 years old kid creates a game and ALSO an AI is just a nonsense.Instead of that he should have use the fisherman's character as his good father. Little rewrite needed ofc but not a big deal.
The money guy could have been his bad stepfather as it was in the movie.You would have watch something that goes 99% the same as it did in the movie.
And later on after the fisherman finishes the money guy not in this way but on the sea during a strom, he could have reveal that in reality he kills off his troubled real father who had serious mental health problems because of the war he was in. After that he could have done a shot where the kid was in hospital for people with mental health problems. And here comes the happy end, he could have show us an ending where he meets his father/the fisherman. (The plot in the imagined world is 99% the same.)Like this the movie would have been a solid 7.Also movie marketing in general should be more clear.
I watched this movie and people around me had no idea what they were watching. The trailer made them think it is going to be about something else.

The obsession is such that it costs him fares, despite his first mate's objections. He has to service local hottie Diane Lane for funds. Rough life! McConaughey constantly drinks and strips to the buff in real and day dreams. Ladies, enjoy.Then one day his ex-wife Hathaway shows up, revealing Dill to be John Mason, who has fled to Plymouth following his Iraq tour and divorce. She's arranged for her brutal new millionaire husband Clarke to come to Plymouth to fish, so Mason can kill him for $10M to free her and their traumatized son who sits in front of his computer day and night as some kind of savant. Dill/Mason is torn, as he apparently only cares about his son and not his ex. Will he or won't he?Then the movie takes a sharp turn in a different direction. Spoilers follow.Everyone in Plymouth 'knows everyone else'. Then a mysterious salesman shows up to just keep missing Dill, finally catching him at 2:30 AM at Dill's shipping container home to provide him a fish finder. Umm, okay.Turns out the salesman represents The Rules in the game that is being played by his son, who has created some kind of virtual reality where Dad catching the fish keeps the son from killing his step-dad. Got that? I didn't either. Dill wonders what reality he's living in, eventually finding a map that shows nothing in the ocean except Plymouth. Everyone else on the island seems to be there only to interact with him.Hathaway makes one final plea for Dill to kill her husband. He agrees, having rough sex even after seeing her bruises. The Rules want to help. However, his first mate (his conscience) intervenes by breaking the husband's hand to keep him from going fishing Hathaway gets him there anyway, they take him out, he goes overboard and dies. Meanwhile, IRL the son stabs him to death. The game ends. Turns out Mason never came back from Iraq, and has been ""living"" only in his son's virtual really. The son tells him he'll start a new game. Father and son are reunited. Fin.The film had a decent enough start, although I attributed its quirks to poor writing. The salesman appearing to explain everything was forced, but it was the only way to make the awkward turn. As with many alternate reality stories, you stop caring about the characters when you learn it's all made up. All the WTH moments eventually piled up to where you just wanted the ending to come since none of it would make much sense.A top cast and some nice island/sea setting couldn't save this mixed up mishmash of noir and sci-fi.Will",Serenity

143,thirtyfivestories,World's First Feature-Length Fragrance Commercial,3,29 January 2019,"Here lies the unwanted, unofficial final installment in the Matthew McConaughty sailor/treasure hunter trilogy accompanied by Sahara and Fool's Gold. Steven Knight follows up 2013's excellent Locke with this more ambitious (sci-fi?) melodrama. Locke being a minimal ""Let's film Tom Hardy during a car ride"" effort that wowed everyone with its staying power. This film could've easily been ""Let's film Matthew McConaughey during a fishing trip"" and would've been a much more compelling narrative. The ""expansive"" environment of the film's world spreads the logic of the premise so thin that pores begin to appear as soon as the opening act.McConaughey plays Baker Dill, a renegade ex-pat that takes tourists out to fish tuna. He's also harbors a Moby Dick-esque obsession with a giant fish he calls Justice. If that sounds like a painfully obvious thematic motif, then you would be spot on. Baker's fixation with the creature frequently jeopardizes his excursion business, which puts himself in financial potholes. Then enters the most elementary conflict possible: Our protagonist is broke, and needs to make personal compromises to become rich. Baker's financial salvation arrives in his ex-wife Karen (Anne Hathaway) who has married up to possibly a construction tycoon (this is my best guess).Karen reveals the history of abuse that her current husband Frank (Jason Clarke) has dished out on her and Baker's son, Patrick. She offers Baker a proposition that would rid her of a slave master husband, and award Baker the funds to avoid prostituting his body and skills ever again. The remainder of the plot has us stuck to Baker as he goes through the rose pedal ""I do it; I don't"" charade. The brevity of this review is a result of the most lazy twist in recent memory, that makes spoiling the otherwise unsatisfying turn all too easy due to its painfully early reveal.The grand meta-plot crashes in the door midway through the second act, and blows its load suddenly and all at once. We are literally served up a character whose sole purpose is to break the twist to Baker. After some rough housing from Baker, this mysterious prophet spills the beans with zero nuance, and the film ruins itself at a blistering pace. Then (as to pull a rug over the vomit) the film has Baker questioning the prophet's proclamation for what seems like eternity (Eternity would've been a more apt title upon further thought) regardless of the blatant signs plastered all around him.Too often movies hide behind plot-twists to avoid scrutiny, and this one cowards behind a skinny palm tree rather pathetically. Knight attempts to cash in on a video game industry that he clearly has no understanding of (I promise that checks out after you *if you* subject yourself to this film). If it weren't for the spoiler-free creed I hold myself to, then I would detail in full all the cringe-worthy missteps taken by this revision-free script. I suppose Knight wins this round, considering he has created an inscrutable film. The only winners are the viewers playing a cheeky drinking game whenever McConaughty's ass appears on screen. Screw it. Spoiler alert: The buns appear in four separate scenes.",Serenity

147,thinkMovies,Let's not go overboard...,7,21 February 2019,"The thumbs-up, or down, for Serenity depends on whether you think movies should entertain you, or get you involved. Then of course there's the question of what do you consider entertainment and what kind of emotions you would be interested in getting involved with.I'll take door number two, the door that requires for me to talk about this movie without offering any spoilers. As impossible as this may seem for this particular movie, I like the challenge. Here it is: this movie is worth watching. It's probably not going to be remembered, unless it develops a cult following. But it's definitely worth watching.The first half is when you begin to feel there's something wrong with this movie. You begin to worry that you wasted the ticket money. Then, slowly... you begin to wonder whether it's not that there's something wrong with the movie but more likely there's something wrong with reality. The clues are everywhere, even in the opening shot, but you don't begin to get it until the third act. By then, you more or less know where you are, but you still haven't figured out the kicker. I exclaimed the kicker to my wife about 14 minutes before the end credits and about 11 minutes before it was revealed on screen (pat on the back for me).Bottom line, everything that instinctively didn't make sense while trying to understand what you're watching, makes perfect sense just before the end credits roll up. It was well done, the acting was great and, do consider, that if you thought it wasn't, maybe it was great in that the characters you were watching were actually supposed to act in a way that you would mistake for bad acting, or for cliche acting. It was great acting, after all. The editing made sense. So did the photography. Well done Mr. Director-Auteur, writer, producer man of many hats, and feathers and hooks.So?

A good blend of mystery, fantasy, and the conscience/morality struggle.I feel a lot of reviewers (both critic and audience) are hung up and overreacting to all the surreal aspects, which individually may be jarring (even downright comical, to which I can't deny having some laughs), but taken as a whole make enough sense within the nature of the story. Even though I easily predicted the big reveal, I didn't feel it was so ""out there"" that it ruined anything. I'm not saying you can just hand-wave stuff away as ""movie magic"", though, since there are a few questionable events that don't fit even within context (like why can't the businessman just meet McConaughey at his shack, even though he apparently knows all his locations?). But unless you totally zonked out, most things were clearly justifiable, whether you enjoyed the twist/ending or not.What I can agree on is that the movie isn't much of a suspense/noir thriller, despite some of the elements being there. But it did a decent job of building up anticipation so I remained hooked throughout. I also thought Diane Lane's character was unnecessary, but again, is somewhat excusable based on the complete context of the story.Overall, I had a good time.

155,paul-2148,One of the most entertaining films in awhile,9,1 May 2019,"First off, this film is beautiful. Fantastic location shooting, superb production and set design. MM is captivating as always. I won't say too much because I don't want to spoil the ending for anyone. This film starts out as sort of an Old Man and the Sea tale. A war veteran trying to heal and put his life back together on an isolated tropical island. He runs a fishing charter, drinks too much, and pursues a single 600 lb tuna while squeaking out an existence. Honestly if this was all this film was about I would have been happy, but this is not at all what this film is about. There is an ex-lover, an autistic son that he never sees, fathered by a an abusive step-father. The film shifts into a sort of Body Heat type of thriller when his ex suddenly shows up, and it's all engrossing and mysterious. There's something not quite right however and you start to question the motives of all the characters in the film.That's all I will say except there are some serious twists in this film that you don't see coming, and the film ends up being a meditation on loss and redemption.I think the poor reviews of this film are unfair. It's really well done and entertaining as hell.",Serenity
156,fbmike,This was just not good,3,20 February 2019,"I'm up and down with McConaughey. Sometimes the dude is really good and sometimes he is just really bad. This was the latter. His patent cool luke grin is just getting a bit old. He looked like the same dude as when he is in the car commercials. Fake cigarette smoking trying to be Humphrey Bogart. Just doesn't cut it. He's trying way too hard to always look cool and it doesn't look natural. He has become too full of himself and it shows on film. Hathaway was just generic like she always is. Everything else was just filler. Movie looked forced and rapid in the making. Story was crap and no matter how much you try to make the movie decent, if you start out with crap, you still end up with crap. When I saw this movie was with McConaughey in it, I had dice in my hand as I want to watch it, not knowing if it was going to be seven or snake eyes. It rolled out a solid snake eyes.

From custom interaction with characters, to Matthew jumping into the ocean naked, this film is ambitious and beautiful. And it actually is very thought provoking. When the truck cant drive during a red light its because the game isnt set up to break those rules. Imo it is a good film with lofty expectations that for the most part is beautifully crafted into the world of interactive gaming.

I thought they stopped making films this ludicrous and nonsensical in the 1980s with films like Troll 2. So I guess in that regard Serenity has accomplished something. But the profound mind-trip that it is trying to be, it most definitely is not. The film opens in a jumbled mess, unable to establish what kind of movie you're watching or even develop a tone, with bad dialog, hammy acting, strange camera-work and over-direction. While these were probably intended to be clues to the twist that comes about an hour in, they don't feel like clues, instead developing confusion (and probably some laughs). And that twist, you'll probably guess it 20 minutes before it happens. Even if you don't, the twist is hugely anti-climatic. Instead of making you want to know how things end, you'll probably wish the story would hurry up and get on with it. Because the 'big reveal' inadvertantly makes everything that happens after irrelevant. So avoid this movie. It's literally a waste of time.",Serenity
160,RustyShacklefordd,One of the Worst Movies I've Ever Seen!,1,3 February 2019,"I can't believe this movie was as bad as it was! I love the cast and the trailer made it look like it would be solid thriller for adults!. Boy, was I wrong!First off, the movie is nothing like the trailers present it to be. Normally, it's a good thing when a trailer doesn't spoil much, but in this case it's not. The trailer sells the movie as something completely different than it actually is. I won't spoil anything, but I'll just say that this has one of the worst twists I've ever seen in a movie that I can't believe anyone thought it was a good idea let alone gave them millions of dollars to make this.Matthew McCounaghey and Anne Hathaway are normally great in just about anything, but here both of them are laughably bad. It doesn't help either that the dialogue is very corny and unrealistic. It's such a shame too because I used to get excited when I saw McCounaghey's name on a film, but this is so bad I think it could really damage his career.Like I said, I can't really say whats so bad about this movie without spoiling the twist, so I'll just say the only reason you should waste your time with this movie is if you love bad movies and want to see one of the dumbest twists ever created. It's no wonder the trailers hid what the movie is actually about because nobody would have saw this.",Serenity

His stepfather turned to be a sadist who terrorizes the boy and physically tortures his mother.The boy, who still loves and misses his dad immensely, is thinking what to do in this horrible situation as his mother is unable to get a divorce since she is absolutely terrified by the new husband. The guy seems to work for mafia but we're never told. The boy is contemplating a murder of his stepfather but understandably it's a very difficult decision for him as he's just 13 or something.In order to resolve his own dilemma, he creates a virtual world where he places his deceased dad (as an AI character) and presents this dilemma to him under different circumstance where his virtual mother asks her ex-husband to kill the new one for ten million dollars in cash. Everything and everyone in this virtual try to dissuade him from doing what he was asked for. In the end, his virtual dad kills his virtual stepfather and by doing he gives the boy a confirmation to do that in the real world. The boy then proceeds to kill his step father with a knife and this is where the film ends.The music in the film is absolutely stunning. Everyone played out of their mind.

And Djimon needs bigger roles... Oh, and both the movie poster and the title seems oddly familiar for a casual fan of Firefly.About a third of the way in I am conteplating shutting the damn thing off. It's such a boilerplate generic noir thriller. Especially when the cardboard cutout femme fatale rolled in. So I reached over to my phone to scroll through a few reviews here on imdb. The reviews kept saying to keep attention as a giant twist is on the horizon. So ok. I took deep breaths and decided to muscle through.Pretty soon hints, about as subtle as golf clubs whacked through my head that this island story is something else. And halfway through I now had a pretty clear picture of what is going on and will happen. Or maybe the twist is yet to come? Maybe?Nope. Like the average episode of Black Mirror there is an interesting story here, but handled with so little care and craftmanship that I only want to get the whole thing over and done with.Like I titled this review, you may be wowed by this if this is your first foray into the wonderful world of cinema outside the norm. I just wish that first taste was delivered with some form of original thought. Because I've seen all of this handled so much better by minds who actually wanted to try something new.Hell...

Well the entire thing was made up by the kid and is a computer game! Nothing is real including the island and the people on it!

174,calsonassociates,"About neo-noir and writers of honor, Steven Knight CBE. A Wellcraft?",10,10 November 2021,"First, a film thanking those for their service. Next, the five classes of both civil and military divisions, listed in descending order and conferred on men and women equally, are Knight and Dame Grand Cross (GBE), Knight and Dame Commander (KBE and DBE, respectively), Commander (CBE), Officer (OBE), and Member (MBE).Lastly, it is almost unbelievable to think that The Templar Rule was expanded from the original seventy-two rules, drawn-up at the Council of Troyes to over 700 rules or codes covering almost every imaginable mode of acceptable conduct. The film for me identified it.All monies from tithes and properties, all gold or possessions of any sort belonged to the order as a whole. Everything was held communally, such as Plymouth Island, without any wealth held in the hands of an individual. If a Templar was given a gift as a reward for some service, he had to turn it over to another.If some small gift of remembrance was given to a Steven Knight CBE by his family, he had to have another more grand individual's permission to keep it. He couldn't even trade something to another Sir Knight without getting permission beforehand.If a Sir Knight was given money to spend to buy something for the community, he had to account for every penny spent and not have any money on his person when he died, or he was refused burial in consecrated ground. To say that the rules were strictly observed would be an understatement.So, this rigid regimen helped propel the Knights Templar to the power and prestige they held for several centuries. Just as film lovers respect the cast, crew, writers, and producers via major film partners, the countries who practice honorable endeavors reflect on similar points of view.Regarding veterans, the Templars may have been emotional, but theirs (mine) in opinion, was not a lot different from the regimental training of modern military forces on Earth. There is a team work involved among trusted caretakers, especially in film, because of their historical impact upon this film warrants patient concern and deliberation of one's thought process.Remembering our solemn vows, promises, pledges, and obligations is still a good thing to do with a serious and committed heart, mind, and attitude.

After 20 min or so, you already know what is going on ... making all the rest of the movie not worth watching.
The synopsis made me think that it was going to be a mind game and using intellect for the husband (Matthew) to get out of the trap of the ex-wife (Anne) ... well, no!
Matthew is playing a VERY dumb person all along the movie and Anne is excruciating to watch and listen to throughout the whole movie (and absolutely not believable in that role - an amateur actress could give the same result) ... the ""husband"" overacts and efforts are plentiful to try to make us hate the guy when in reality, we would be: ""Yeah sure man ... You're just dumb!!""
I kept watching because i still believed there would be an interesting twist with the similitude in look-alike between Matthew and the ""husband"" ... there is no such twist; the movie really is over after 40 min.

188,lizshotter-19401,Makes sense to me,8,3 March 2019,"This film has been panned so much, and I'm struggling to understand why. As a mother of a son whose father died, I completely understood the premise. A son creates a world that enables him to reconnect (or maintain connection) with his dead father, and also uses the world he's created to distract himself from the temptation to kill his abusive step father. Like all methods of distraction, this strategy only works for so long, and the boy starts to use the game as a method to weigh up the possibility (or fantasy) of killing his step father, and the moral complications of killing a bad man for good reasons, yet it still being the wrong thing to do. The characters in the film (game) routinely urge the protagonist to ""do the right thing"" and not kill the stepfather, and just ""catch that fish"" (justice), but the coding has changed, the rules have changed, and the protagonist has choices to make: kill the abusive step father or just stick to catching the elusive tuna fish. The story is overwhelming in its sadness and longing, and the story, dialect and themes are deliberately clunky and odd, because it's a game that's been developed by a child. We first get the sense that it's a game when Dill is walking towards the cliff edge to dive into the water, as we are looking at the back of Dill as if he is a video game character, those who play gta will understand what I mean. We are so used to different films these days, we want the plot to be obvious and loud. This is neither. I've seen this twice now, and each time I see different things; the coding that's reflected on Patrick's face details the changes in the rules, the drawing on the right of Patrick has the word ""justice"" and it makes more sense each time I watch it. It's such a shame it's been so badly panned, as I enjoyed it for what it is; a sad and lonely boy trying to find his moral compass through his dead father, that he's created in a video game. When parents die children find ways to cope with their bereavement, and often get stuck in the realms of magical thinking, and Patrick has created a world that is an extension of this strategy. It made perfect sense to me and I hope people give this a chance and don't just dismiss it because critics have panned it.",Serenity

The whole movie always just feels a little off and bizarre, which I somewhat appreciate. Make no mistake about it though this work is not a masterpiece. Serenity has its share of faults and the ending could very well be one of them in some ways. Besides that it's also a messy script with some big head scratchers and horrible lines.With that being said we need more wide release movies with quality actors taking chances and giving us something original. In a way the film is throwback to the 70's and 80's when we saw wide released movies taking experimental chances.Go give it a watch, love it or hate I think this work is something any true film fan will tip their cap to.",Serenity
201,snktrss,Interesting watch *will contain spoilers*,7,26 February 2019,"This maybe my first review, I don't recall, however here goes. This was good. For a one time watch maybe, yet I can see myself watching it on cable (if it stays in existence) or choose to watch by way of streaming. Either way it gave me the feels like Out of Time with Denzel Washington and other movies Matthew has done where the ocean was involved. The movie is literally not what it seems and thankfully I figured it out early. Then I was left with the feeling of seeing what someone does to create an escape from their reality. Heartbreaking.",Serenity
202,kbohna,Don't waste your time you will not get it back.,1,3 March 2019,This has to be the worst movie I've actually ever seen ever. I only say this because it's true please do not watch it and waste your time. It is a movie that doesn't even need to be made the acting is good by Matthew McConaughey like always but the whole storyline is based on an island and the concept of the whole movie makes you wonder why does the island even need to be involved in this ridiculous story that's how bad it is. Take my advice anyone who says this is a good movie is lying to you I don't watch movies everyday but this is awful.,Serenity
203,olympicator,Astonishing Disconnect,8,26 August 2021,"Imagine if they made ""Blazing Saddles"" as a straight drama, without changing any of the story. That is how ""Serenity"" plays out. The plot of the movie is ludicrous, the dialogue is laughable, and yet everyone plays it like it's Film Noir.What I like about this movie is the dedication. They were not just putting together something silly, to market to the lowest common denominator. This movie took itself seriously, it has some nice photography and earnest performances, and it sticks to its outrageous plot points. I have no doubt that the filmmakers and cast recognized the inherent weirdness of this project, but they still put a lot of effort into it.A movie is a form of art. A lot of people have criticized this movie because, objectively, it is unrealistic and difficult to relate to. But I like this movie, precisely because it took a very strange story and treated it with extreme devotion. A lot of people also found fault with the outrageous plot twist, and while I agree that twist is derivative and silly, the movie stuck to it to the end. This movie affected me, because it was different.I'm tempted to say that ""Serenity"" is like the new ""The Room,"" so poorly conceived that it is unintentionally hilarious. But I also think ""Serenity"" is kind of ahead of its time, because it tries to show us how little control we really have over our lives. The characters have motivations, but we see that they are just reacting to larger forces. This movie challenges us to ask questions about how we fit into the world.I know it's not for everyone, but I genuinely recommend it and I did not find it boring at all.",Serenity
204,richardv81,One of the years best,9,20 July 2019,"I am completely and utterly blown away by what I just witnessed.The pace of the movie was spot on, I felt every act and every sequence came at the right time. You were left guessing for quite awhile but you were left enough throughout to nibble on.Several twist including the big one, that was a really turning point in the film that I really loved and honestly didn't really see coming.I will say the writing in this, man its deep. And to be honest you wonder if this comes from a place that hits at home. But this movie is absolutely crazy, and crazy for all the right reasons,The acting was just perfect.Clarke (who will one day play in a movie I write), he is one of my favorite actor that always brings his A game to the table.McConaughey and Hathaway both were really strong in their roles.

205,travinorbit-72734,A near hit is still a miss,6,22 March 2019,"It's The Truman Show vs Shutter Island vs Identity x Source Code. These are all great films (I love a good subjective reality tale), but this isn't as good as any of them. Due to the full hand being revealed a little too early.It starts out well enough, but there's no chance for the audience to be beguiled. We see where it's all headed too soon, so we just have to wait it out, until the film catches up with our expectations. Then we're slapped across the face with it repeatedly. In its own way, that's the only truly original part of the film; that it shows its hand so early, but insists on playing regardless. Yet it doesn't make for a satisfying experience.And then ending with a surprisingly saccharin scene takes out any of the sting that might have given it some real oomph. Another wasted opportunity.I only started paying attention to Anne Hathaway after Colossal-an incredible film-and she's as good in this as anything else, I suppose. But her character is not-quite-likeable, and hearing her call her hideous second husband 'daddy' is nauseating.
And I don't think it could have hurt for us to have had some deeper connection and empathy for the real subject of the film. There's no emotional payoff at the end, so we're kind of left wondering...so what? Sigh. Maybe next time. It was a nice try.",Serenity

215,dgranger,Better than half of the films in it's genre.,8,3 February 2019,"This film is a member of three genres: Neo film noir, virtual reality, and video game. As Neo film noir, this film is rather very good as it steamy and focuses on the darker side of humanity. It debates the moral issue of killing a man deliberately and weather it it is morally to kill a wife beating abusive man in order to protect the child or mother. It explores insanity too and obsession.
As a virtually reality and video game thriller genre, this better then over half of them sense it is not over the head obvious that is what is really going on here. Believe me, I have seen a lot of them virtual reality films: like all three of ""The Matrix"" movies, ""Tron"", ""Virtousity"" ""Spy Kids 3: Game Over"", ""Cloak & Dagger"", ""Brainstorm"", ""Altered States"", ""The Cell"", ""The Truman Show"", ""Dreamscape"", ""Jumanji: Welcome to The Jungle"" and several more, and including all the virtual reality episodes of ""Star Trek:The Next Generation"". In those movies, is oblivious you are in a virtual reality world and not in the real world and rather hitting you over the head childishly in most of them. But in this film, the virtual world is realistic with very few shots in the first act to suggest that something is not what it seems: like the beginning shot of the eyes with a zoom into the iris of one of them to reveal a boat on the ocean, of the man running into the ocean while dressed in a suit, or the scenes of a kid sitting at a computer or the constant promps to ""Catch That Fish"" over the radio. You have to figure it out before it gets revealed to you in end of the second act. That is what makes it better than half of those films. And since most of the films are aimed at children or family fare, it is refreshing to see this squiarely aimed at adults. Yes, this is an adult move.
As for acting, Anne Hathaway doesn't give a particularly strong performance as McConaughey and Hounsou do. In fact, I was surprised and entertained to see Hounsou again. It is Clarke who plays The a dive wife beating husband who is naturally rich is the one who comes off rather cartoonish and steriotyped.
The direction and story telling is crisp and clear and moody which is a plus since vagueness and murkiness are usually annoying and clumsy if handled by a director and editor who doesn't know how to handle them that well.",Serenity

Different from Shutter Island as many pull in as parallel, this movie is boring and predictable to a huge degree. I'm not saying I was able to predict the whole twist accurately. But a large part of it was predictable from the beginning.It's about a former soldier who left his family in order to find Justice. Literally, since he's actually hunting for a tuna he named Justice. On an island where even the radio seems to talk to him. There are many tells right from the start. (Incl. a statue of Kali)

220,barbaravannorde,I wish I could reclaim two hours of my life,1,24 January 2019,"This movie combined some elements of The Truman Show, Mother and The Matrix. This could have been a compliment if it wasn't such garbage.
First of all, I personally don't understand the hype around Matthew McConaughey. This man is so irritating because of his never ending arrogance and his voice which always sounds like the end of the world is near. I truely don't understand why this man is still being casted for movies. He also seems to be playing the same dude in every film he makes, drunk, scruffy and conflicted. Why are people not done with this one trick pony?
I was exceptionally disappointed with Anne Hathaway. Why she decided to participate in this film is unclear to me. She also didn't act very well.The story is very predictable although I don't think is was meant to be predictable. I think it was intended to be original, unexpected and refreshing. It was none of that. It's a borefest and since you know where the story is going from the beginning you kinda want it to be over asap.",Serenity

No joke, every scene from start to finish has a comedic value, whether it's due to the stupidity of the dialogue or the delivery of it or how seriously the actors take their job. Also, this film is perfect if someone wants to see 3 shots of Matthew McConaughey's backside every five minutes. So yeah, give this movie a try if you want to laugh.",Serenity
223,admcdonough,Strange and Disappointing,3,27 January 2019,"The previews for this looked good and the cast is outstanding. Because of this, I was really looking forward to this film. And it started out good. Then unfortunately the weirdness started. I knew something wasn't right pretty early on and the movie certainly gives you plenty of clues as to what strangeness is going on to the point where I knew that what was happening wasn't real early in the film. And after Matthew McConaughey's meeting with the stranger in his hut occurs, I knew that this was just a computer game being controlled by his kid so there was no real surprise at the ending. Matthew McConaughey, Jason Clarke and Djimon Honsou all give strong performances as expected. They always do. And Anne Hathaway and Diane Lane are solid here and both look great as usual (although Anne should stay a brunette). David Butler and the rest of the supporting cast all perform admirably. A special shout out to Jeremy Strong who is terrific in the pivotal scene with Matthew McConaughey. This film had great potential and maybe if I wasn't looking for it to be a thriller and was looking forward to seeing a fantasy, I would have appreciated it a lot more. But it just didn't deliver from a fantasy standpoint to me. There was a terrific thriller somewhere in here that wasn't made unfortunately.",Serenity

PROS;Waaahh, the story feels unusual but it is actually not, I mean half way through the movie I realised, the movie felt just like I am reading a book. The way the twist and turns happen, it felt as I was reading instead of watching a movie. Don't get me wrong it is not a movie that made me go ""this is frigging awesome"" but it was a story that drew me in and when the plot became clear, I thought ""yes, that's okay, I understand"" and then at the end I had closure. Lane, Hounsou, Clarke and supporting actors have performed very well. McConaughey and Hathaway are doing their very best drawing you into the story and they succeeded with me. Except for maybe the first time Hathaway appears and does her scene with McConaughey, that felt weird. But luckily she did not act like that in any of the other scenes, it was as if she was saying I am not gonna do that ever again.
CONS;Maybe some people will find it having it a weird pace or strange dialogs (which does make sense at the end). But in my opinion if you watch the movie with the mindset that you're reading a book, it might be not so bad. Of course if you do not like reading books then it might not do much for you or maybe it will and you could change your mind about reading books or it doesn't make any difference, but what the h**l do I know.

239,attilabarcellos,This is not a conventional movie,7,30 December 2019,"Serenity is a movie that shows a metaphor about the place where people go after the death, and also about the questions about the ""creator"", in a theistic point of view.Matthew McConaughey is a great underestimated actor and I hope that he shows up more on the screen. In the movie, he is a fisherman living in a heavenly island that is obsessed by a big fish that he's been trying to hook for some time, and by the memories of a son that he is not able to see for some reasons that are explained later.The movie is good, not deserving in any way the 5,3 rating that is showing in this site at this moment. The question is that the plot twist was explained in a rushed single moment and if the viewer wasn't paying attention and didn't see, the plot twist or the revelation of the reasons became less believable.
When Matthew jumps in the sea for the second time there's like some radio stations playing in the background and one of the radio stations or voices captured says that if the container has the neural structure of enough complexity it can be able to receive consciousness, and that would explain how a avatar or a virtual person in a videogame could receive or acquire conscience.So if the son of the deceased Matthew character created a place that matches perfectly the wishes of his father, it could be possible to attract Matthew's conscience to the island and to the virtual character in the videogame.The problem is that all of this was rushed and for people not paying enough attention (a nowadays problem), that bridge just wasn't built.To sum up, if you like movies that aren't obvious, with good actors, photography and makes you wonder, I recommend Serenity to you.",Serenity

I'd like to add that you'll want to know what others think once you've seen it - so in that respect kudos to the producers for making a film that at the very least makes you use your brain a little and does deliver on certain grounds.And now for the problems with the film (deep breath)...

The issues I have are these:Firstly... the character shouldn't be linked to a real-life character - namely, the weird idea that MM's fisherman character is somehow an extension to the entity of the real kids father. This doesn't make any sense - is he in some sort of purgatory or afterlife then? Is this forever? Won't he get bored or go mad now he knows the situation he is in and is becoming self aware? How is he psychically linking to the boy if he's only a game character?Secondly... the self-awareness part doesn't work. If he was just going about his business in a world which didn't make sense to the viewer then the twist would have worked much better - but he shouldn't have any idea that the strange things happening around him are anything out of the ordinary, perhaps a little perplexed when the 'creator' changes things, yes - but remembering his previous life, developing real emotions and questioning the world around him, no!It's almost as if the director wasn't certain about his intentions and as a result trod too carefully through the majority of the film. The tone of the film is definitely off right from the start (which -again - would work if we were experiencing life from within the 'game' but I'm not sure that's what really was supposed to be what was going on). Because of this slow approach - particularly on the lead-up to the 'big reveal' (and the ham-fisted clues along the way) the denouement clumsily presents itself long after you've pretty much come to your own (invariably correct) conclusion anyway - a bit like being slapped gently in the face with a soft toy fish, rather than being hit head-on by a speeding shark (if you'll excuse the topical analogy here).I think this nervous approach to producing a piece like Serenity comes at its own expense to the telling of the story, although thankfully the tension and suspense is still carried off rather well - but the premise of the film fails to recover from this point forwards meaning that what could have been a very emotional conclusion to a story involving characters we do have some feelings for just doesn't work and (for me personally at least) I just didn't care enough to feel much by the end, at least for the fisherman.The kid's story - on the other hand - is quite a powerful one but I also think this suffers from a little bit of over-sentimentality and you just don't feel like you know enough about him by the time his tale reaches it's climax. Is it a tragedy or a blessing that he does what he does in the final stages? Why does his 'father' need to do likewise - supposedly he's not even real!Supporting characters were good (but the dialogue and acting suffered a bit here, sorry). Wouldn't call Hathaway's character laughable (she's a computer game character so she's bound to play up to the role) but it's a bit phoned-in. The bad guy is bad-by-numbers and in reality I'm sure she wouldn't put up with the relentless abuse, it's just waaaay over the top and he has no redeeming qualities whatsoever).To wrap-up - the film clearly doesn't know exactly what it's trying to say, and attempts to present a pretty good idea in a variety of stupid ways. As a result you're left feeling a little lukewarm towards any of the characters - no fault to the actors themselves who perform admirably - but in my opinion because the director didn't have enough confidence to execute their story well enough.6/10 for the acting, the ambition and the technical work, also because I still recommend it as something quite unique and found it entertaining. 4 marks off because it could have been so much better!",Serenity
247,katish7,"Good movie, very unusual though.",7,15 August 2019,"This movie is a proof that movie ""marketing"" today can only promote familiar products and is not able to market true creativity and originality.
This film is a heavily influenced by classics piece of post-post-modern mind, which is out of fashion today. So I'm surprised that it has even been made, I mean there's no superheroes, zombies or sexy bad guys in it.
Now, I must admit story is not perfect, but I get what attracted the talent to it. I'm sure that even though it was a flop with critics and box office, this will not be a piece actors or producers will ever be ashamed of making. I suspect that maybe story seems a bit flawed because Mr. Knight is not a very good film director yet, perhaps if he let this be directed someone like David Fincher perhaps he'd manage to balance a tone change better, which occurs in the middle of the film. But what's done is done and it's definitely one of the more memorable movies of the last decade. If you are looking for originality (even though very postmodern) this is for you, if you are hooked on familiar products you will hate this.",Serenity

It had potential as the movie was going, then it got to the twist...which was absolutely dumb and made no sense at all. I went back and rewatched the trailers to see if my memory was correct about how it was ""packaged"" and it was. I really wish it was the movie that the trailers led you to believe it was. Sadly it was far from it. The only reason I even gave it two stars was because the acting was good in it.",Serenity

I can a little imagine that the ""twist"" in this movie might not be digestible to everyone, but it sure gave me a pleasant and elevating feeling. As far as the rest, the story was great, the casting absolutely fantastic (the combination Matthew McConnaughey and Anne Hathaway worked out really well again!) and the music was outstanding too. Everything was made well and with great care, so my verdict would be 9 out of 10 with the extra protest star on top!

Anne hathaway is good in parts , but less convincing.. Mathew mcconaughey carries the film on his shoulders, who gives a winning performance here.

From the very beginning everyone was a one dimensional cliché that only existed to serve a purpose for Mathew's character and help him in his quest, or to keep him moving along, which is what computer game NPC's always do.You may not have figured it out yet, but the notion that it was a plot twist that suddenly changed everything is absurd. They were wooden, stock, clichéd, one dimensional characters from the get go, PURPOSEFULLY.I would have rather seen the 2 actors make a movie where he (Coop) arrives on Edmund's planet (Interstellar) and wakes up Anne (Dr. Banks) and they make a life together, if they were going to do a movie, but this was ok.I do agree with other reviewers that once you realize it is a computer simulation or game, and the the characters are only NPC's you kind of stop caring about them at all, and that kept this film from being more than just ok to mildly good.I do wonder if it would have been better as a straight up film noir where it really was just a rich wife trying to have her abusive husband murdered by an apparent down on his luck man with a dangerous past through manipulation and seduction.With these 2 actors that might have been interesting and more explosive, than a storyline that a young boy created for his computer game that he designed to keep his father alive to him, and to help him get the courage to protect his mother from a violent and abusive man.",Serenity

265,sven-koehler,an expensive mess,3,5 April 2019,"Steven Knight made a pretty good movie called Locke. So after I watched this one and found out that it was from the same write/director, I was shocked.I could not connect to the characters in this movie. Matthew McConaughey was clearly playing Matthew McConaughey. Sure, he was in financial trouble and drank a lot of alcohol and he didn't catch the big fish. But who cares.Then Anne Hathaway showed up, and her performance could only stem from the fact that she thought that she was part of a film noir. After I got used to that, I finally started to care for the poor fisher guy. Would he kill or not?Then there was this guy with the suitcase (Jeremy Strong). He was taken straight from the Lemony Snicket movie. But he was not from a bank and his suitcase contained a machine that would never be used and we should forget about very soon. The forced mystery that he's the only guy who knows that the world isn't real was just that: forced.The bad guy, played by Jason Clarke, is so over the top, that I couldn't care less. Kill the character off already. So after a while, my interest in the film was purely academical. How would all the story lines finally connect?The big reveal was that nothing was real and everything was just a computer game programmed by some kid. For some reason, the characters are self-aware (otherwise, the movie would have been much less fun) and so that explains why our fisherman couldn't leave the bed before the alarm rang. It doesn't explain, how the man with the suitcase knew what he knew. It doesn't explain, why the kid eventually kills his stepfather who also happens to be the dead bad guy in the video game.So in the end, I'm left with a kid who I barely know an irrelevant video game that was apparently under development the whole time, but never showed a glitch.
And so in the end, I lost the connection with the whole movie.But the film certainly has a glitch. Because apparently the kid programmed the copy of his father as a gigolo who gets money from older attractive ladies for sex. The kid probably spent to many ours on the internet. But doesn't he want to keep good memories of his father?",Serenity

I hold McConaughey and Jason Clarke in high regard, as pretty much every movie they make lately is awesome.At some point the movie attempts to make a witty twists that backfires in epic proportions. Without any exaggeration, I think this is one of the worst movie twists I have ever seen. It completely ruined the movie for me. You don't have to be a genius to see it coming either, the whole time I was thinking 'oh boy, I really don't hope they're taking this route'.This was pretty dubious, as the movie trailer suggested something entirely else, so I think it's not weird if you feel a bit duped. With a heavy hitting cast like this, I doubt whether they chopped and changed this movie up during production. I can hardly believe that any of these actors would go along with such a bad script. But ah well, that's only speculation from my end. Still I think the cast tried to make the best of it.Since I enjoyed the first half of the movie, I still give it a 5.

Extra points for editing, direction and cinematography. This is a master class in the basics of film-making and storytelling.I gave it a '10' but it's more like an 8, because I think the movie could have done more with the 'twist', such as giving us the twist, then taking it away and keeping us more confused about the eventual outcome or nature of the reality in front of us.

It's not worth the time you spend watching. Not that interesting, not shocking, not really emotional.

The last thing is that it's too predictable. When you see that there's some form of communication between Baker and Patrick, combine that with Patrick coding and all the weird things that don't make sense, it becomes obvious it's all just a game/program.

It was already dense enough. Diane Lane and Djimon Hounsou's (both always brilliant) characters basically fell into a hole and disappeared to accommodate the silly twist. They could have been the moral foil for greed and revenge, underscoring the quandary the protagonists were in. Why would you bother with the twist?? Unnecessary. Ended up being just silly.",Serenity

I didn't find one take that was simply ludicrous to me, unlike some of the critics - unsurprising, in a time when reality (or is it??) was/is weirder than whatever any mind could make up! The inclined viewer will follow the main character on his grey area drift between reality, memory, perception, reason, onsetting lunacy and daze, all made up by a kid exposed to domestic violence for years. While this movie will not shake your belief system, its uncomfortability is certainly not rooted in the explicitness, yet, I do wonder if Millrnnials had been more open to this movie, had the main female cast not been their princess.",Serenity

This is such an original story played out in the created reality of a boy, grappling with a tough choice.
My only criticism, the plot is a little thin. It's quite clear early on what the situation is and what will happen with around an hour to go.
There's an odd scene where the character chasing Dill, pretty much spills the whole beans. It would have been far better to leave you guessing whether it was real or just in Dill's consciousness after effects of war imo. A rug pull of showing the boy at the end covered in blood would have made it great. Also the scenes of him coding all the time is too much of a giveaway.

Here we have a bona fide stinker that takes its screenplay seriously and the result is a real chuckle.What makes it so funny and endearing is the earnestness of the filmmaking which treats the story as though it has emotional gravity or that the hilarious twist is anything but hilarious. No, no, no haha, it's just really, really stupid but it's executed with such sincerity that it won me over.I predicted what was going on almost immediately but dismissed it as just too daft to be true; Oh Lordy did I laugh in wide-eyed amusement when it all came together. There are pros: the production values are decent, it has an intriguing setup, it's never really boring and is lead by two major A-list actors which only adds to the amusement - did they read the whole script before shooting commenced?This film is utterly ridiculous but I'm glad it exists - some people have taken it seriously and fair play to them too.

The forced suspense & peculiar behavior from the characters is tedious and distracting; moreso when they start spoiling the twist themselves. It felt like watching an M. Knight Shyamalan movie with all the characters discussing the real situation and pointing into the camera laughing at the audience for being tricked into buying tickets. Thankfully, I didn't - but I ought to demand my rental money back.I won't spoil the story for you directly, but I will say I'd rather have re-watched Fight Club (1999), The Truman Show (1998), The Machinist (2004), or the last act of Brazil (1985).

I loved the movie, the tone wasn't set properly by the promotors - and I feel that so many fans of Black Mirror, Christopher Nolan movies etc will miss out because of the misplaced trailer and bad promotion of the movie.

Never before has a movie taken me on such an emotional roller coaster. The film had me laughing toward the beginning, and crying by the end.I wish I could explain why the film meant so much to me. From an objective perspective, I'm sure most critics and movie goers will find various ways to pick it apart. But it doesn't matter. All I ask is that if you are reading this, go see the film for yourself. Maybe you'll love it. Maybe you'll hate it. All I can say is that Serenity shook my world and left me utterly speechless.

His goal is to catch a tuna, but the kid programmes in a situation where the main character has to kill the kid's stepdad in-game.So hilariously wild in the second half.

330,maceyrr,Confusing until you get near the end,5,26 January 2020,"My opinion of the movie while watching it and after watching were very different. Throughout the movie, and especially the beginning, I was like what is this mess? Is it going anywhere? The characters were stiff and didn't seem to make sense, until you keep watching. The clues were there from the beginning and thrown in frequently but the thing is that I didn't catch them until three quarters through because I didn't expect this movie to turn out to be something different.This is the problem I had with the movie. Most of us watch a movie expecting it to be something. Yes, sometimes we get plot twists that make it enjoyable but in this case, it really wrecked it because it was like, you got hit on the side of the head because you didn't expect a ball to be thrown over left field. You don't go to watch a comedy to find that it becomes a serious drama. If they intended to give us this twist, they should have prepared us for it. To have them throw us a twist like this, I wasn't pleased. However, I changed my view after finishing the movie and thought about it a bit more.Again, this is another movie that had some good names in it that I felt were wasted. The movie could have been practically as good or bad with lesser known actors playing. For the elaborate plot and the number of characters in the movie given the background of the plot, it seems a bit hard to believe but, this is a movie. If you start to tear it down, it really falls apart.You can watch the movie for entertainment value and it could be enjoyable. Just don't get upset when the twist happens which brings me back to how the movie didn't give its audience a heads up on what kind of movie it was. I would have enjoyed it slightly more if I had an idea rather than having it hit me unexpectedly. Duh! Yeah, I should have seen all the clues and hints throughout the movie except I wasn't.I'm not sure if the ending could have been better but I wished they offered something else.",Serenity

He struggles financially and has physical relationship with a woman who helps him out financially in exchange for epic sex. Enter his ex-wife who offers him a fortune for killing her abusive husband and saving their son from an emotionally abusive step father.A well worn film noir set-up and there is nothing really notable about the writing or the acting. There is actually a good reason why it should not be well set-up, but for the audience it does not help.The film has a huge plot twist mid-way through, but it has the effect of totally destroying any dramatic tension of the story and now nothing that happens matters to the characters or the story.

345,moviewatcher-32341,Missed opportunity,5,15 August 2019,"Not sure at what point in the production process things have gone wrong but they certainly did. It's clear to me that the producer/director Mr. Knight had 2 movies in his mind when he made this and that's why it's a big entertaining mess.First, as lazy as I was when the film started, I didn't pay too much attention to the zoom in the boy's eye. Later on in the movie I immediately got understood. In any case, that game thing is always a bad idea. Especially when you combine it to the ""death/ heaven theme"", which came obvious even before we know it's a stupid game. Funny, that death thing reminded me of a famous TV show on an island...
Anyway, I think Mr. Knight just didn't have the experience and budget to make a real sci-fi movie. Also, it's not because you put Interstellar duo that it will become reality!Talking about the actors... He got the wrong casting for it, definitely. Immediately, when I saw how McConaughey was characterised in this movie, with that funny and ridiculous plot, I couldn't stop thinking that the right guy was Jason Statham. That's just his style and let me know if you disagree. As for the woman, Hathaway is certainly the less credible person in the movie. A B-grade star would have the done job just well and saved a lot of money to the production.Now, take Statham, plus a random actress and remove all the game, death, heaven BS and you had there a perfect B series movie that would have been just perfect for a Sunday afternoon and probably made more money.

349,simplyerii,What really is serenity?,10,19 October 2019,"I think what captured my interest to see this movie in the first place was its title. It's almost like you're expecting a happy, joyful, life in the beach, with friends, drinks and music, or perhaps some sort of a romantic story of a prince jetting off into the sunset with his beloved, on a boat called Serenity but ehh.. not quite. First we are introduced to Baker Dill.. who we perceive is a good man, and a good father.. we are shown a scene of him drinking some beverage out of a mug that says ""Best Dad Award""... but instead turns out that he is in fact a regular fisherman who spends most of his time fishing but is also a drunk, and let's not forget that he's broke. He and his partner, Duke have been having a hard time catching fish. It's like he almost gets it, but the fish disappears each time. Then we find out Duke's daughter is deceased, and so he sponsors his granddaughter's college education. Both men appear to be honest men, although cursed with bad luck, only that Dill Baker seems to remain clueless about his. Hence, we see a black cat that follows him around. Black cats often have negative connotations, that is, if you believe in superstition. And we are introduced to his love interest, who pays him for sex, and is the owner of the black cat, as it were. So you see, we are asked to reflect on the characters, and their relationship with Dill, to piece together our own perception of the type of man we expect Dill to be. We know he owns a boat called Serenity, works hard, and ever so often drifts off before the sun sets to catch fish to sell. And later we find out that he was also in the army, married to Patrick's mom, and abandons her due to PTSD or some unresolved mental conflict. Though not clear, we know that Dill suffers from some sort of cognitive dissonance, because he gets night terrors, nightmares, and/or hallucinations.. or are they really? We are given the themes of good vs evil, right vs wrong and these themes are scattered throughout various scenes.. The movie has us question our perception of what justice truly means to each of us, and whether murder is justifiable depending on the circumstance it occurs. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and without hesitation, will certainly watch again. It's an analyzable movie that will make you reflect on certain things, like existence, dream states, morality, mental health and to some extent, spirituality. I definitely recommend.",Serenity

But no matter why you come to the theater, you will be intrigued by this mysterious character who is always chasing after McConaughey wearing a full suit and carrying a mysterious case.

A stellar performance by Matthew McConaughey (who I usually don't enjoy), Anne Hathaway (who I adore), and Jason Clarke (who I NEVER enjoy). Jason Clarke's character made my skin crawl, extremely creepy performance.The scenery sets are breathtaking, great use of color for a small island. The suspense is incredible, and the new developments create the constant thought in the back of your head ""what exactly is happening here?"" NOTHING is what it seems.The whole suspenseful (albeit sometimes unclear) plot comes together at the surprise twist/climax, which for me I did not see coming. The ending made the whole journey worth it.All in all, the incredible acting performances and breathtaking scenery makes this movie worth a trip to the theatre!",Serenity

365,rudymaynard,What's So Hard to Understand?,9,16 June 2019,"Maybe you have to have had a childhood as traumatic as Patrick's, or at least suspend your politically-correct prejudices long enough to comprehend what this film is really about. It's not as if Knight doesn't telegraph his punches almost from the start, yet most reviewers seem to overlook the central premise of the story and instead nit-pick details of characters that are actually just elements of a child's fantasy.That being the case, it is, in fact, an incredibly tragic film. The ""twist"", that all this is a reality conjured up on the computer of a boy who's lost his father to a foolish war, and whose stepfather is an abusive ogre, is heart-wrenching. That this fantasy world doesn't conform to PC culture has apparently clouded the judgment of many reviewers, which would account for many of the negative reviews. However, it seems plausible that a pubescent boy, especially one who sees the world through a computer monitor, might not have a properly ""woke"" worldview. This would, of course, also explain some of the cliched dialogue and characterizations which some critics have myopically faulted. And I know that the concept of using lethal violence to defend oneself or your family is also very unfashionable these days. Regardless, any kid who's had a similarly dysfunctional family should be able to understand how Patrick might think.All in all, I found ""Serenity"" to be a very satisfying film. The performances and cinematography are excellent, and I enjoy movies that stretch the imagination a bit, even when they evoke unpleasant ideas.",Serenity

Of course the characters are acting ridiculously because it's the imagination of a young boy named Patrick, the Creator. This movie was wonderful! Finally a movie where the emphasize is on the father son relation, and not on the mother like it always is. Patrick created a world for his father, in order to help him kill the best, and so they did it, together.",Serenity

I don't know why people hated the twist, I think it is what makes this movie.. without it, it would be a dull movie, only a guy perusing his dream of catching that fish and killing a bully in the way and maybe getting back to his son and ex-wife. If you like technology or studied programming you might like this movie a little bit more than everyone else, cuz you would be able to explain certain events like when John realized he's in a game, that means he's a character with intelligence.. that's artificial intelligence, I think his son gave only him that ability that's why every other character had a problem realizing that they're just characters in a game. The ending was nice, it's like the kid wanted his father to step up and protect him and his mother so he created that game to achieve that feeling although he's the one who goung to kill his step father.

I was still mildly interested to see where the 'game' would take us, but I just found it to get more and more ridiculous and the fact that the main character was Not phased at all by the revelation he wasn't real was just bad writing.The end of the movie was just plain dumb and left me with questions as to how the kid was even able to make this happen from his current living arrangements.All in all, it was an interesting movie, the acting was done well but the characters reactions and script were both badly done.

390,jasonscottwilsonfl,I actually think this COULD have worked...,4,19 February 2019,"Honestly it's not a terrible concept. A boy that lost his father to war in the Middle East is now a young teen living with his mother and very abusive step father. So to escape his horrible reality he creates a virtual world where his main character is a fisherman, who is his father. The island is all made up, full of NPC's, and just running according to their code.What doesn't work about this movie is this information is not known early enough, and you go from watching a drama that you assume is based on reality to......well it's all a videogame.I'm no screenwriter BUT I would have taken a slightly different approach. It's a sad thought, a young teen so desperately missing his father that he creates him in a virtual world to connect with him. The movie should have honed in on that more. The son should have been on the island of Plymouth in his own virtual form, interacting with his dad, making his intentions known about killing the step father in real life. As video game dad becomes more self aware he does his best to guide his son and tries to convince him not to murder anyone. Now the son struggles with even listening a computer creation at all.We needed to connect more with the son in the real world. See his home life, go to school, etc. See how his father's advice in the game is translating to real life. Perhaps in the end we see he was every bit ready to murder his step father, but the re-creation of his father was the voice he needed to guide him and talk him out of it.If done correctly I think that could have been a heartwarming story.",Serenity

The movie runs for 106 minutes.We're left knowing what the twist is with about 46 minutes of the movie to go. That's when the movie, for me anyway, fell apart.The movie would've been so much better had the twist happened towards the end of the movie.The twist in itself was very well done and I did not see it coming and certainly haven't seen this in a movie before.All in all I was intrigued with the movie up until the twist, although it was a great twist I was left disappointed with the rest of the movie knowing what the twist was.

Sure, some scenes indicate something weird is going on, but still, it's just a little over the top noir.
Then it takes a turn for the ludicrous with the movie being - SPOILER - a video game programmed by the kid of the main character who turns out to be dead. It is so dumb, so illogical, and so full of plot holes that the movie just could not win me over after that.

The idea is good but the execution has many flaws along the way and lots of plot holes show when you know the truth and think for a bit.
Acting was good, they convinced you to root for them to actually kill the guy.
The ending was average considering the reveal, Again, not making that much sense or showing a possible way for it to happen but it's there and we're supposed to accept it anyway.
Overall it's an average movie, if you like the actors or guessing thriller movies but don't mind the reveal that much then watch this one.",Serenity

Matthew McConaughey is fantastic! We start the movie seeing his world as he sees it and later he lets us ride the roller coaster of shock, denial, and acceptance with him as the story goes along.

397,more-13,Perfect exemple of how to ruin what would have been a good movie,3,29 May 2019,"You remember that old saying ""Show, don't tell"" ? Well, here we are. The movie is absolutely ruined because of unnecessary explanations.This movie had everything to be good : good director, good actors, appealing setting, nice aesthetics, good photography, and a decent story.
It starts really nice. The introduction scenes set up the background perfectly. The characters are slowly introduced, they are clichés and that actually serves the story. Hints of a fantastic plot come at the right pace. And then everything goes wrong when there start to be some explanations about the real backstory. The movie gets clumsy and cringey. Too much fantastic elements, a lot being clichés, lead to a total trainwreck. Worse : the ending with images from the ""real world"" and the voice-over news report is just like spitting on the public's intelligence. And the coup-de-grace is this extremely awkward feel-good last scene which is wrong on so many points : firstly it ruins what remained of a sad and fantastic tone, then on a script level it means that all that would have been a deep motivational fantasy story for the kid to find the courage to do what is necessary is in fact just the kid being totally insane.Why does a movie like ""Enemy"" by Denis Villeneuve works and this one doesn't, despite the fact they share many similarities ? Because it explains absolutely nothing and leaves a jigsaw story, open for interpretation by the viewer. You end up feeling puzzled at first and then smart when you put stuff together.

I wondered why a director used an opening shot of a person's eyes, with the camera zooming in on one pupil and then revealing an underwater shot of a boat with several men on a fishing expedition. Then I thought this would be a decent way to show that the movie was the fantasy of the person whose eyes we see in the opening shot. And guess what? I was very close to the truth.Although the movie is mediocre, I was entertained. Matthew Mc's toned and tanned ass and just a glimpse of his junk entertained me. The absurd attempt at film noir entertained me. Anne Hathaway being cast in this movie entertained me much, as I kept thinking someone else should have had her role. It was as if Hathaway accidentally stepped onto the set on her way to film another ""Princess Diaries"" movie. I wouldn't have been surprised if Julie Andrews had made an appearance.IN SHORT
I gave this move a 7 because it showed Matthew Mc's gorgeous ass more than once and because it was so bad it was good.",Serenity

off - over dramatic/acting without enough context provided to the audience. So many holes in the script.But like a flick of the 90's, you see yourself going through the end of the movie because
1) it still enjoyable because of the scenery and cast

They each usually display the depth and nuance of a coffee table. However, I gave Serenity a whirl, and I'm quite pleased that I did.I mean, this movie is no masterpiece, but it isn't the 2 star dud some reviewers here make it out to be either. Sure, Mr McConaughey makes good use of both his major skill points: Shouting At The Sky, and Gazing Furiously At The Floor. Obviously, he also waves his bottom at you. Anne Hathaway turns up, as usual, and leaves it at that. So far, so predictable. It's a little bit stilted, a little bit weird, and oddly...flat. But! Don't leave before the magic happens.All things considered, I really liked this movie. Once you understand why the characters behave as they do, it becomes properly interesting. Motivation becomes clear, the demeanour of some characters makes sense, and it does tie most of its loose ends. I mean, it doesn't tie them very well - it all ends up a bit of a tangle, but, that too makes sense in the context of the story. I expected it to be risible, and I fully intended to hate it but it wasn't, and I didn't. Believe me when I say that nobody was more surprised at this outcome than me.I liked this movie, and I want you to like it too.",Serenity

If you seriously liked it and found it entertaining, you are quite possibly a very late learner and still entrenched in kindergarten getting your kicks from making strange shapes with plasticine.
If you haven't seen this film yet, do yourself a favour and take a toilet break and do some number two's.
Before you flush it away though, take a look at it because I can guarantee you that your crap will have more substance, be more entertaining and keep you riveted longer than this film ever could.
I am astounded when I see films this bad that someone didn't say somewhere along the way ""You can't be serious!"" when they were hawking the story around trying to get money.
Maybe it was near the end of the financial year and they had to take a loss to make a profit.
The only reason I watched the whole thing was to see if it could actually get any worse and that is precisely where this film did not disappoint.
An utter waste of money, but more importantly, time because that's something your money just can't buy and you can never, ever get it back.

From the start of the movie I was wondering what the geographic location could have been: American/Cajun territory? Mauritius? Some tropical island?

457,ena-78425,"Not bad, different than whats expected.",9,1 July 2019,"I was going to write a review without spoilers but it is rather difficult to explain how good the film is without it....The movie starts of with a fisherman who wants to catch that big fish, the one that keeps getting away....
Throughout the whole movie you are kept guessing at what is actually happening, because there is a few hints that something is off.
With the flashes of the son having a mental connection with the father, to the odd behavior of the town people and strange radio. Also flashes of the war the fishermen was in.At one point I was thinking he is stuck in some limbo and his decision will determine if he goes to heaven or hell, as said by his friend.
Then when the wife shows up, you think ohh she is there too, the new husband killed her, as she has a connection with the son too.At the end we find out that its all in his sons head, he created a game, an alternative universe to have contact with his father....he ended up killing his stepfather to save his mother as the stepfather threatened to ""put her in a hole"".....
We see he will be evaluated and released to his mother if he is cleared, but I get the feeling he wont be, as he is living inside his head and is basically gone.We do get hints that the father is dead as his stuff, is with his son...his knife, tackle box ect.This movie shows what abuse can do to someones mind and how they can basically lose it and never be the same.",Serenity

It was nothing like the preview, and I wish that they actually made the movie as well as they made the preview.Horrible movie! The only thing this movie had going for it was that it has two great actors in it. Other than that, it was an hour and half or so of time I can never get back.The storyline was bad, and it was very boring. It did not do anything to keep me interested, other then me waiting to see if it got any better.

My husband and I love thriller/suspense/mystery movies and this one does NOT disappoint. It grabs you from the very beginning and doesn't let go til the very last moment. Even if you figure it out early on, you will still enjoy the ride because it will keep throwing twists and turns at you. Once you think you know what is happening, you will still LOVE watching it unfold.I have watched a lot of thriller/suspense movies in the past 30 years and this is one of the best I've ever watched.TRUST ME, Watch for yourself and make your own judgement!!
Some of the best movies ever watched are the ones others gave a low rating too for suspense/thrillers.

460,valentinars,Way underrated movie!,10,25 October 2020,"I would rarely write a review but I got angry I was skipping this wonderful movie for too long because of the very low ratings. Considering the lame movies I've seen rated 7 and above I couldn't imagine how bad this one has to be.
Well... now I am wondering what is wrong with most of the people and why they are so ignorant when it comes for something out of the ordinary. Some are even calling it sky-fi and it represents such a real and deep story?!
Serenity is already in my ""favorites"" list as one of the best scripts, production, directing, acting, make you think films I've watched lately. Is a very up to date scenario with a deep and definetely disturbing message, but hey, the movies are supposed to be different, original, to surprise and raise questions and discussions. That is when filmmaking and acting are becoming art. It seems whenever somebody decides to express another perspective of an issue so common is crucified by critics and viewers.
The plot is beautifully planned and developed, though in an abstract, even somewhat grotesque way. The whole point the critics are missing is the fact that everything is coming from the imagination of a teenager growing in an ugly and abusive environment. He is the creator of the characters presented and the movie itself. Once realized, everything makes perfect sense and becomes credible. And the in-depth psychology behind it all deserves appreciation! I will be thinking and talking about this movie for a while.",Serenity
461,beedvs,Not Alright Alright Alright,1,24 December 2019,"Imagine if you will, if that Black Mirror episode had a budget of $80 and $70 of it went to the talent. I hate this movie. HATE. I went into this at the behest of a friend that it wasn't good but still held some sort of entertainment value, Well, I want my money back, and I watched this for free. I would rather watch Golf whole being consumed by Nicholas cage in a bear Costume covered in bees. If I wasn't already an atheist, this movie would prove there is no god. This abortion of a film rivals Triangle for catastrophic boat failure and makes the Titanic look like a fun Disney ride. If the deceased of that incident could somehow see this, it would automatically become the worst thing to happen to them involving a boat. The dialogue feels like it was written by a dirty monkey with the brain of Luka Magnotta. This abortion of a film apparently had a director who hopefully was tried and convicted of his war crimes. The ""plot twist"" comes way too early like a frat boy getting laid, and feels just as non-consensual. The movie is a scattershot if different genres all done better probably on YouTube somewhere. If I had made the mistake of seeing this abomination in theaters I might have been compelled to drive my car into the nearest wildfire. The cinematography is somehow both boring and offensive at the same time. If you want something good, watch literally anything else. If you want something so bad it's good, watch The Room or Trolls 2 or Birdemic. However if you need something to count down the time while you wait for the pills and alcohol to kick in, well you cane to the right place.

If we were supposed to feel some sense of ""Justice"" by what happened, I don't get it, there's no justification that makes it right. What the director seems to want the audience to feel Is some deeper meaning and connection, but all I was left with was a feeling of how creepy this kid is. An exaggeration, but it was made as much sense as it would have to hear some uplifting score playing while an axe wielding maniac was chopping through the bathroom door in the Shining.

It was ok to watch once but if you don't watch it, you didn't miss anything.It probably would have been a better story if they kept it simple. It felt too full, like it was trying to be groundbreaking but was trying too hard. It was predictable and struggled to make you care for the characters. They're pretty much all terrible people, other than Duke.The message is pretty poor. A soldier dies in Iraq and his wife and child end up with an extremely abusive man. The mom doesn't do anything to get them out of it, reinforcing the idea that women can't escape an abuser. The son doesn't get proper care to deal with the loss of his father so he is justified in killing the abusive man. He creates a video game mimicking this action to support his decision to kill (so is it advocating video game violence can influence real violence?). The concept of the path of righteousness and not resorting to murder is addressed and ignored. Then the movie concludes the murder was justified and the boy did the right thing.The conclusion is the path of righteousness doesn't matter, there's nothing wrong with the boy's emotional state being neglected when his father died, and the murder of an abuser is justified. Way to go guys!Personal note: A guy who abuses his wife and child to the degree depicted in this movie should be flogged and castrated, if not executed! But to go to that final solution without indicating any other attempts by other means were made to leave him, and then have his death be at the hands of a child?! Come on...",Serenity

Matthew McConaughey,as the boys father, has never been better, and gives a stand out performance. This is all played out in a world that is odd and out of place, but creatively conceived.

It's uniqueness is one of it's finest qualities which will unfortunately go right over the head of most people that watch it which is obviously why the reviews no match the quality of the film.
Matthew McCaunghey is at his finest.
Many other good performances as well.
I worked in the film industry for years and I am a huge movie buff and I watched this with intensity and absolutely loved every minute of it.
I am not going to say a thing about the storyline but I would recommend paying close attention to detail.I just love when a writer comes up with a story that hasn't been done before, takes risks and surprises us with something new( as a writer I can tell you it can be extremely difficult).

He is then asked to murder the now husband of his ex wife who is hurting her. All this is their sons idea who can't take seeing his mum get hurt.The performances are all great and nobody was a weak link.

Shocked at the bad reviews. This movie was genius. Not hard to comprehend, but I jumped into the head of a 13 yr old boy part way through... and all the previous weirdness made sense. It was all created by a kid- not a generic hollywood movie that people seem to be wanting (gag).I was fascinated with the creation of an escape-world. I was on the edge of my moral reasoning seat- is killing the man the right thing to do? By father or son? Yes, you knew it was the son who would do it- the rest of the movie doesn't even actually exist outside his head... but would he?! Should he? The changing of the rules... how something so clearly wrong is morphed by the entire pretend universe by the creator of all.... to be the right thing, the compulsion.This is a very sideways look at a child's processing of years of domestic violence. I loved the line, If I didn't catch fish I'd find a way to kill you. And- I loved that in the end- stepdad was a ""construction worker""... not a gazillionaire. I am perplexed that all these gems, and so many many more, have fallen at the feet of movie watching zombies unable to appreciate these perspectives and escape into the escape.",Serenity

While I have always been a fan of McConaughey, I watched this without any understanding of what it was really about until I watched it. The true meaning of this movie is basically the battling of demons within the head of a young boy who escapes the reality of a troubling and abusive household. He creates these characters (which they portray perfectly, as ""characters"") on the island (and in a game), with the hero being his sadly departed father. The father in his mind gives him the strength to act out in real life. Key words include the boat being called Serenity, and the fish being called Justice.

""The movie explaining scene"" happens during a conversation between Mr. Reid Miller and John on the beach, where Mr. Reid tells John that he is made by a unknown creator to live in a world of rules, leading us to think about our relation with God and our environment. This results in a parallel between our world and the game source code, also with John being a code as we are also a living code, a DNA code.This is a very valid plot, but I would have made an end carried with more emotion. John would have been a post war soldier in coma, and his son could have made a computer world for his consciousness to live, between an interaction man-machine.

507,mayamarques,Scorpio Sign explained in a movie?,9,31 March 2019,"Serenity ReviewI've picked up Serenity by accident In a lazy Sunday morning laid down in my bed with nothing more interesting to.
At first I thought it would be some kinda of a candy romance but maybe a good one because of the Oscars winners Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway, I recently found out that they are both Scorpio sign in astrology an me also being an Scorpio decided to see what was going on. Didn't paid attention to who was the director and went surprised When I found out that I love a bunch of he's movies and series!
Well, the movie it's a little bit confusing due to it's mystery and the need to keep it slow to not share too much information too soon.
I don't know if the author was meaning to make this movie to describe someone's personality and behavior or if he was trying to share a clever analogy about life. In my case I felt he was describing an Scorpio personality and I will explain why I felt that.
First of all as I have already mentioned the two main actors are both Scorpio sign, Matthew from November 4th and Anne from November 12th, as a Scorpio person have deep emotions due to its a still water sign ruled by Mars and Pluto, master of the eight house of mystery, occult, if you read about a Scorpio personality you'll have a better understanding what I'm talking about.
Well a Scorpio person is determined, revengeful and stubborn but they are moved by the right things, love, family and justice, the courage they have to help the loved ones and the determination to do it if they feel it's necessary, and most of all to do the things that they had decided to do because once they decided to do something they will not stop until they have it done! I'm not talking here about a low frequency Scorpio who can be a very bad person also because of the same reasons a high frequency Scorpio will have to not be. The movie shows this duality a Scorpio live inside a lot of times, the connection he have with his son, specially true the water, when he jumps in the ocean, when he touch the water at the table, when it's raining, the color palette of his clothes and also Anne's, the dark room where the kid live, his smartness, the kinda of situation a Scorpio person have to go true in life since early age to go true its transformation, scorpios are all about transformation and he will have to go true it for all his life to reach the highest level of a Scorpio which is the Fenix form.
There is an analogy in the movie when he talks about not understanding why he do the things he do and ""who's"" decide it and when he starts to wondering about that, questioning himself he finds out the truth, the truth that anyone else can see or understand not even when he tells them, the astrology said that Scorpios knows and understand the truth about life and death and their path in this world. Oh, Scorpios also have the tendency of being addicted to alcohol or another drugs.
It is also possible that the island represents the earth.
Maybe I'll not understand Serenity and felt the connection with this movie if I wasn't a Scorpio person, i think I'll never know haha.",Serenity
508,jennitruax,Just Ok,3,27 May 2019,Overall twist was interesting but seemed more like a film displaying as many angles of Matthew McConaughey's naked backside as feasibly possible.

509,alekbean,Vanilla Sky Matrix meets the 6th Sense in a What Dreams May Come Spin-off,9,25 May 2019,"Does it make sense? Possibly. But then again, does anything really make sense? Only after the fact, perhaps- depending on perspective - what are the rules about that anyway? what if we just make them up as we go along? change them as we go - after all you can start your day over at any time. Whatever you believe is true... becomes what is real - for you.I love the multi dimensional philosophical questions pulling like the tide beneath the façade of this movie plot. Do we exist outside of this time and space continuum ? Outside of and or within the minds, hearts, souls of those who we are connected with - What difference does being in the physical world make really? Our body responds to whatever our mind experiences as ""real"" in the moment - we are always connected.What is right and wrong? When do the rules change?I love how this movie left me pondering all these questions and I will enjoy watching it again -appreciating with awareness the second time through the way the screenplay & cinematic elements deftly tantalized my perceptions of what the real story in this movie is all about. Plus compelling acting -suspended my disbelief as the incongruities in the script began to unravel- I still didn't care! kept me intrigued all the way to the end.",Serenity

All the weird ""loose ends"" others are talking about is meant to be that way so when you discover the answers it all begins to add up.
I'm surprised this movie wasn't bigger or heavily advertised but I absolutely loved it.I could feel the kids emotions and the anger towards his step dad.

I honestly love the chemistry between the cast and the entire production crew. The performance itself is amazing.There is almost quite a lot I'm struggling with though. All of it has to do with the plot.The plot itself is something new, looking at it from a synopsis point of view. However, there was a lot of room for improvements.First thing's first. This is a movie about a video game. A video game needs a player who will actually be in this simulation. We did have a player in this game, until we found out he was dead in the real world. So we were merely watching lines of code all along. It was just a mere simulation of a place created by a boy who wanted to escape his real life problems and save his mom from her abusive husband. It would have been better if we actually saw more of Baker's interaction with the real world as a program that grew emotions which led to him actually killing a living person than one that merely kills lines of code.Secondly, RULES (Reid Miller) went from being a character who was our biggest cause for suspense to someone we started feeling sorry for less than halfway through the film. If only he hadn't started shouting when he missed every time he missed Baker, it would have been more suspicious and less confusing. Overall though, I expected a lot more from him. For instance, he could have been the gateway to the outside world for Baker.I could go on a lot further, but I will just end it here as a courtesy to the good parts of the film. It's not merely as good as it seems, however it's worth watching. The performance is incredible.",Serenity

He is gifted at this so the characters are capable of acting at least somewhat independently. As things worsen in his household he wrestles with the moral dilemma of killing his stepfather to save him and his mother. So he presents his father's character with the same dilemma, introducing him to the beast that is his stepfather, and having his mother back killing him while dill's friends and an interloper argue against it.

Silent cinema. Subtitles. Foreign. The techniques employed become acceptable.I loved the sheer ballsiness of everyone's commitment to this movie. Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jason Clarke give it everything. And that only comes about by having confidence in the film.The plot twists aren't there to surprise the audience in the manner of something like 'The Usual Suspects', they exist to create the feeling of a troubled conscience. Perhaps, that's what everyone is snickering at? When one of the most popular pass times is shaming people on social media to whom we feel superior, the idea of self doubt and uncertain morality are things we need to ridicule?I dunno.

In fact, it may even be outright bad. But I'll be damned if there was a single moment in the film where I was less than entertained. I laughed more during the course of Serenity's runtime than I did at a good majority of last year's intentional comedies.The performances were attempting to evoke a noir feel but came across more John Waters and the camp factor alone was a fascinating hybrid of cringy and hysterical. From Matthew McConaughey drinking during nearly every frame of the movie to Anne Hathaway saying ""daddy"" every other line, I won't forget their acting any time soon.The plot is a convoluted mess and some of the turns it took won't be well-received but who cares?

543,godess_frigg,It's real cinema - hard to find these days.,10,6 June 2021,"One needs to get the pun, the ratings show how many vewiers did: almost none. It's a surrealistic, atmospheric and well acted twist about the depth of connection a teenage boy needs with his father in order to cope with realities he can't and should not take in. It's about what a teenager with intact sense of justice and not yet shattered core values who craves to achieve serenity. We make our kids swallow and work arround allegedly given facts of real life, that's what growing into adulthood is all about nowadays: accept that for every misdemeanor against any principle of human existence, there is an amount of status and money that buys you absolution. There is a way arround that though, the father (Matthew McConaughey) takes the lead, no remorse, none needed. I very much enjoyed every aspect of this, cinema at it's best, don't let misguided ratings steal that from you.",Serenity

I thought having 2 big Hollywood stars would make the film better, but sadly not the acting of ( Hathaway and McConaughay) can at best be discribed as amature. Describing the film as a ""thriller"" is totally obscene as the film for most part can only be discribed as a comedy.The trailers build this up to be a great films ( as most trailers do) but don't be duped like I was.

But it does gets really twisted hence it could only go two ways, really good, or really bad. So if you don't like twisted movie, it is not worth it for you.Personally I like movie with small twists which makes you think in general. For me, the first half of the movie was good. But once the twist revealed, I just don't get it.
Don't get me wrong, I understand the whole story and the ""twist"". I just don't get why they put it in there. Therefore the two stars rating.I'd prefer not watching the second half as the twist kind of ruined the whole thing. Without the ""twist"" it would be easily better movie.",Serenity

I'd seen the trailer and it looked good... and it was, until about halfway through the movie where, in my opinion, it went off the rails with a stupid plot twist. I understood the twist and everything that transpired after, but felt it unnecessary and worse, that the movie would have been better without it, sticking to it's original setup. The whole landscape of the film changes after that twist and not for the better - it feels like it exists just so it can exist, and not for the betterment of the story.",Serenity

564,mlsbionic,Genuinely beautiful.,9,20 February 2019,"I'm flabbergasted by the bad reviews. This movie was beautiful. The movie was easy enough to follow, the plot revealed itself at like an onion being peeled, threw are so many dynamic points to why and how and you can see and connect to all of it.
Failed system allowing the child to live in that world, and the mother. Failed VA system not keeping up with the Gold Star family left behind by a fallen soldier.
His only reprieve is a world created on pc with his father still in it, and he uses that as his escape until he feels forced to use it as his courage or resolve to kill the man abusing them.
The fact that the poor boy had to live like that, had to make that choice. That his school knew what he lived with, that it was known by many and he had to still do that, that is what is wrong.
This movie beautifully paints the perspective of abusive homes in a modern world and how children cope, and how they can end up making bad decisions for the right reasons, when they shouldn't have to. Looking to the memory of a hero father to come save the day and using that idea of him to do it himself.
Imagine if the police or social services or the school had done more, because clearly they knew, as reported by the news at the end. The school principle said he knew.This movie was beautiful, and, heart breaking, and to the point.This was a tragedy on many levels, one that all too many have to live through, and sometimes not survive.",Serenity
565,flaviucomanescu-696-86036,A very good movie,9,30 April 2019,"This movie is ""clean"" and the story is not at all that bad as other reviews would depict it.I'm no expert but the images are of a crude realism, very clear cut and minimalist to only help the story and characters with minimal effort to the viewer.
The ending will surprise you and it touches on one important contemporary topic.
It doesn't explore it very deep but it does make you think further.
All in all it's one of the better movies I watched this year.In general it seems movies getting polarized reviews either ""very good"" or ""very bad"" are usually pretty good in average to my taste.",Serenity
566,pleiadesds2012,Movie of a decade!,10,3 March 2019,I have to warn that this is not for simple minded people. Do not watch as you will not understand a single thing and end will be even more confusing or look ridiculously stupid.It was incredible how all the clues are there from the very beginning. Just watch it and try not to miss small details. Every scene in the movie is important and it will give you better understanding of the end.

568,henrytheparanoidcat,Oh dear - far from Serenity!,2,6 March 2019,"I was looking forward to this from the intriguing description of the film but it is truly awful. Plot is contrived and unbelievable. How such good actors can produce a film so bad bemuses me. I half expected a film with something about carpentry in it as much of the acting was wooden.In the UK this opened in the cinema at the same time it was launched on Sky - if I'd gone to the conema I would have felt as though I'd been robbed.I've yet to see a decent Sky original movie, perhaps they should do what they do best - should other people's movies.",Serenity

571,chanbohra,Out of this world.,10,19 May 2019,The movie pushes audience to think metaphysically since the very beginning. It shatters expectations of a reality we know and understand. In the beginning it feels like a supernatural thriller but soon turns out to be a perfectly realistic and reasonable story. The committment of the actors was simply mesmerising and the screenplay is nothing like anything ever seen before. Of course it was all a video game and the ending does a great hob of typing up the story together as well as justifying the cinematographic choices. All in all its one of the only few movies that moved me and made me contemplate my own reality while persuading me to watch it again just for the entertainment value of it.,Serenity
572,Glecify,So much better than expected,10,25 August 2019,"I was blown away by this movie! I went in with no expectations and no knowledge of it and came away seriously impressed!I am equally blown away by the low rating and bad reviews here on IMDB. I really think that many of these low reviews somehow missed what made this movie so good. I saw some mention that the acting was bad or the movie just seemed a little off but when you have a full understanding of the movie this all makes sense.It was amazing how this movie tells you the story and shows you it's author all in one. The acting was spot on. The cinematography was beautiful with a few fun moments that really add to the movie. The pacing of the story was simply incredible! In the beginning you start to question what could ever make you care about this story but as time goes on there is a beautiful ramp up in understanding of what is really happening so that the reveal of the big twist is the emotional climax of the film.This film was fun but it also makes you think. The viewer is forced to question real and fake, right and wrong and then you have to do it all over again from an entirely new perspective.This was a great movie and I think in time it will gain the following that it deserves.",Serenity
573,km05759,Serenidon't,3,27 January 2019,This movie was an absolute mess. I found myself ancy for it to be over. The first 30 minutes are spent watching Matthew mcconaughey try and catch a fish. I wish I was kidding. The performances felt forced and the acting was terrible- even for mega A listers. I ignored reviews and decided to give it a chance and I should have listened. Save your money.

It's no award winner, I'll agree, but I found it fascinating at times.I'm usually a fan of twists in books and movies, but I'm torn on how I feel about the late twist in Serenity. At the time of the twist reveal, I was momentarily delighted--sort of a 'whoa' moment when all those little oddities throughout the earlier part of the movie begin to make sense.Unfortunately, though, that sudden whip around in the plot had the negative effect of erasing all the earlier tension that is crucial to suspense movies. Not only that, but the twist also made a big change in how I'd viewed all the characters up to that point.",Serenity

Thats what the writers and producers did here. They thought they conceived a clever story, and fooled themselves into thinking it was smart, but really it was a very contrived, stereotypical, and obvious plot from the beginning. About 20 minutes in you can guess the rest of the movie if you're paying attention, if you didn't catch it by then, the point where Zariakas tells us his wife's kid is a computer genius who fishes on his computer game all day, the final conclusions become painfully obvious. Once you realize they're in a game, the rest plays out exactly as you'd expect. Oh and Dill's response about ""never really coming back from the war"" was not only lazy writing for using such a stupid overused trope, the ""twist"" that he didn't actually come back was almost force fed to viewer before it was finally ""revealed"".I'm giving it an extra star because even though you could call all the twists well before they happened, it was still entertaining enough to sit through and watch them all come to fruition. Writers, don't pretend to be smarter than you are, it takes away from the quality of the story.",Serenity

I left feeling good about it. I thought it deserved a better review than it was getting. The plot twist did not take me completely by surprise, but I found it very easy to believe. The Anne Hathaway character, who I thought was very poorly written, made much more sense when I realized that a 13-year-old boy had created her. The visits to Diane Lane's character reminded me of having to collect coins in other games to continue play.

This movie was made entire on location in Mauritius.. and I am a Mauritian! On top of that it was filmed in my own village and I witnessed some of the scenes being filmed. Anyway, THIS was why I (initially) watched the movie.. just to see on screen my local shop! HOWEVER.. having said this, I also paid some attention to the movie and found it CRAP! Then, a week later, we watched it again and, this time, because I KNEW the twist, the movie made much more sense to me all the way through. And I found it to be an EXCELLENT movie because I already knew the twist! In other words, this movie should have introduced this so-called ""twist"" very early on in the movie simply because it is quite a complex film and, if you are watching for the first time, it will be very difficult to understand what is really going on. So, my advice is, either watch the film twice or read the spoilers and THEN you will find it to be an excellent film!",Serenity

I don't understand the hate???,9,21 February 2019,"I've never written a review before but I must say, I felt compelled to say something after seeing all the negative reviews. I really enjoyed this movie. It was kind of like a hybrid of The Truman Show and The Matrix. Maybe I enjoyed it so much because I'm a computer programmer myself and know that we are not many years away from creating virtual simulations as portrayed in Serenity?? It's very easy to believe that AI programs will be living inside larger programs created by humans and the AI will be completely unaware of the fact that they are in fact programs. Which begs the question, are we, as humans, already living inside a simulation? Elon Musk seems to think so. So yeah, I think this movie is super relevant for the times but I can see how some, especially if you're not a computer programmer, wouldn't get what it's about. I read some of these reviews and it's just patently obvious that many people completely missed the point of this film. Anyone that codes for a living, you will find this film very interesting. Trust me folks, we are probably only a decade away from what is shown in Serenity. The Singularity is coming sooner than you think.",Serenity

613,isemin,Loved it,9,19 August 2019,"I honestly don't understand how such a great movie can have such a bad rating. The actors (and acting) are great. The plot is non-trivial and keeps you engaged the whole film. It's definitely not for everybody, and it should not be. Definitely reminded me of Shutter Island, but more bright and engaging.",Serenity
614,williamskynyrd,Beautiful and unique,10,12 August 2019,"The movie starts kind of slow, going to a way that remembers ""old man and the sea"" from hemingway. Suddenly it becomes a masterpeace of twists and worlds inside worlds that gains a lot of power with the acting of the main actors. It's a surprise the path from thr beginning to the end of the movie and how things change during it, being very entertain to watch and go deep in the roll story.",Serenity
615,christinecuningham,Disappointing with such a great cast,3,19 February 2019,"Very weak confusing story line- it's all about Matthews amazing body at times- it is over acted, doesn't make any sense until the last 2 minutes of the movie, what a 3 Star our iof 10 Star movie- very poor 😌",Serenity
616,lukaszpawelec,Great Film,10,3 March 2019,"So many aspect of understanding in this story, absolutely love everything about it, wow...",Serenity
617,carole_rennie,Not Bored,7,28 January 2019,"Yes, it could have been better. Yes, it needed a rewrite but, I enjoyed it. I was entertained. And that's why I go to the movies.",Serenity
618,plaincabin,Save your time and money,1,26 January 2019,"Horrible, nonsensical movie. What a waste of time and money. Expected much more from the talented cast. This would be my nomination for worst movie of the year.",Serenity
619,perazajaison,A video game..really?!,1,27 January 2019,Great build up but everything was a video game?! Didn't like the ending at all. Is it just me or was this a really cheap lousy version of Shutter Island?,Serenity
620,smartinfilm,Enjoyed it!,7,30 January 2019,"Nothing really makes sense until it does. I enjoyed the movie and appreciated this something new story. I was able to guess the ending half way through which was a little anti climatic for me but I still enjoyed it nonetheless because the two leads are phenomenal.
Why was Diane Lane's character the only one on Plymouth that wanted Baker Dill to help his ex?? That's not the rules.",Serenity
621,ksuzana-83683,Amazing,10,23 February 2019,"I don't know if I am the only one who sees this movie more than just a ""game"".
For me this movie is a sad reality of our society today...
The dept and the real meaning of this movie is outstanding... a world of imagination for a boy who lost his father...and the only way he can conect with him is trough this game..
Sometimes to make something real you need your imaginary place.. and that place gives you strenght to do it...For him his strenght was his father.. so... :)
Movie is amazing and I recommend it..",Serenity
622,deserteagle-17834,Are you asleep?,10,23 February 2019,"Simple analysis of bad reviews for this movie:Anyone giving this less than 8/10 is simply very simple..... I look around, I see simple everywhere. I know I'm not alone.",Serenity
623,stewartowen-52044,Could Have Been an interesting 'Thought Experiment'...but.....,6,26 February 2019,"Overlong start 'set up' sequence borrowing from 'Moby Dick'; turns to a nicely set up run in for a decent thriller, then....well, a highly suspect 'gear change without the use of a clutch'. The idea has been done better elsewhere, and the 'parallel' story is way underdeveloped for its importance to the plot and context.
Gratuitous nudity (Male, 'one for the girls' this time - or those who desperately wish to see Matthew McConachty's admittedly well toned backside) and an interesting play on the theme of 'wet T-Shirts'. All I can recall is MM smoking, drinking and generally being macho. Hathaway 'dials in' a decentish performance
I rather think half way through production everyone went 'this ain't working, let's get it done and get outta here - stick in another scene of MM in the rain and we've ticked the boxes.
TBH the theme probably makes 'plot lite' the only brief that could be followed. Shame.",Serenity
624,moughlies,A clever movie,8,1 March 2019,Was really engrossed in this movie. The concept is clever and you slowly realise all is not what it seems. Good performances from all the cast. I was gripped.,Serenity
625,jamszym,Masterpiece,10,2 March 2019,"Wow, wow, wow... Best movie I've seen in years... Matthew McConaughey at his best!",Serenity
