0,MartinHafer,What's not to like?,9,11 December 2011,"This is perhaps my favorite comedy of the 1980s--it's that good. But what makes it different from most comedies is that the film is VERY character-driven. And, apart from some hilarious ad-libs by Bill Murray, the film is played very straight--and the end results are fabulous. What's not to like about this film? The story is about Michael Dorsey (Dustin Hoffman)--an out of work actor who is very talented but so temperamental no one wants to work with him. So, after losing role after role, he's desperate and goes in drag to a casting call. And, oddly, he gets the part. Not only is the female Michael a better actor but also a better person--and that causes a lot of problems. Why? Because although it's hard to love Michael, 'Dorothy' is sweet and soon the object of several folks' attentions! How will Hoffman extricate himself--especially after he's/she's become a huge soap opera star?! Great music, great acting, a couple nice romances and a lot of laughs--this one is a keeper and one of the best date movies I can think of because men and women can both enjoy it equally. Well worth seeing--I nearly gave this one a 10.",Tootsie
1,bkoganbing,A gender pretzel,8,12 February 2016,"Gender bending is always a good method for getting comedy laughs. It's tried and true with such examples as Katherine Hepburn in boy drag in Sylvia Scarlett and Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis as female musicians in Some Like It Hot. It's also lent itself to horrific tragedy as in Boys Don't Cry. The serious part is more and more as the transgender community has spun out of the LGBT community with their own identity and issues. Still comedy can teach us some great lessons about love and who you love can be packaged any way you find attractive.Tootsie gained Dustin Hoffman a nomination for Best Actor and won for Jessica Lange a Best Supporting Actress Award as the woman who hates him as a man, but loves his warm and matronly woman.Hoffman is one of that large group people in New York, struggling actors. In his own God given gender he can't get work and when he does inevitably blows the job up. But one day, desperate for a job he dons drag and becomes a regular on a soap opera in the role of a new cast member as a hospital administrator. Some of the creative changes he brings to the part frustrate people like director Dabney Coleman, but give the show its greatest boost in popularity. He also turns Jessica Lange into a real soul mate. Hoffman is nothing short of marvelous in the part. So deep does he go into the role you forget he's both a man and Dustin Hoffman. Lange who was also nominated for Frances that year in the Best Actress category did well with the part that got her the accolade of her peers. I also liked Charles Durning as Lange's father who gets his old mojo going when Hoffman's around in drag.With transgender civil rights now an issue Tootsie has a lot of a good if subtle things to say and say entertainingly. Not to be missed if shown or broadcast.",Tootsie
2,SnoopyStyle,iconic comedy,9,12 February 2016,"Michael Dorsey (Dustin Hoffman) is a perfectionist New York actor and teacher. He's a waiter with his best friend playwright roommate Jeff Slater (Bill Murray). He trains his student Sandy Lester (Teri Garr) for a soap opera audition but they won't even let her read. He's not getting the roles. His agent George Fields (Sydney Pollack) tells him that nobody wants to work with him because he's too difficult. In desperation, he cross-dresses and auditions as Dorothy Michaels to raise $8k to put on Slater's play. He clashes with the womanizing director Ron Carlisle (Dabney Coleman). He is put into a dressing room with the statuette April (Geena Davis). The sweet star Julie Nichols (Jessica Lange) finds a new confidant. Cast member John Van Horn and Julie's widowed father Les (Charles Durning) fall for Dorothy.The most important aspect of this movie is that it's funny. It has some really big laughs. It is absurd but it's never illogical. It takes on some social issues but it never gets bogged down by them. It's a relationship movie that could have gone off the rails. Instead, it hits all the sweet spots with a touching turn from Lange. The majority of the praise has to be for Hoffman but there is plenty for everybody in the cast. Bill Murray does deadpan humor in this one and he's hilarious. There are too many great performances to list. This is not just a comedy classic but an iconic movie.",Tootsie
3,Hitchcoc,Hoffmann Was Never Better,9,8 March 2017,"Dustin Hoffmann, one of the most respected ""serious"" actors, takes on the role of a man who keeps his job by playing female character. This sounds like a throwaway role with people clicking their tongues and saying, he probably needed some money between gigs. Of course, if you've ever seen this, you know this is not true. The script is marvelous and Hoffmann steals every scene. It really takes off as he assumes his femininity and begins to see what it is to be a woman, the unfairness and roadblocks they must face. Jessica Lange is superb as well, as his confidante and love interest. There is nothing silly or absurd about this, once you accept the premise. Beautifully portrayed with a sad realism that works to this day.",Tootsie
4,Horst_In_Translation,"Defining film on the subject, but it's tough to really take it seriously as anything other than a comedy",6,26 June 2019,"""Tootsie"" is an American movie from 1982, so this one is almost 40 years old now and it runs for slightly under 2 hours. This is one of the career-defining works for director Sydney Pollack for sure and he is also one of the big names attached to this project. I will spare you the names of all the writers, but there are many, really. Let's move on to the cast: Of course the main character and also title character is played by Dustin Hoffman, in his mid-40s and one of the biggest stars at that point for sure having won all kinds of awards. You see him in drag on the film's poster, even if I am not entirely sure what the American flag is supposed to state because there are no references about America really with the exception of the film playing in New York and patriotism is also not much of a subject. By the way, Hoffman was also one of many many Oscar nominations this film scored, but the only win went to Jessica Lange, who was in her early 30s at that point and played a most harmless character here, which is really something you would not expect given her portrayals in the last 10 years. Anyway, this is still Hoffman's movie from beginning to end really. It is the story of a gifted actor who is a bit of a liability though because he knows exactly what he wants and is not easy to work with. The result is that he does not find a job at all. What does he do? He dresses up as a woman to get work on a telenovela and he actually manages to get cast because of the shenanigans he displays that honestly in reality, at least nowadays, would get him immediately fired, but not back then it seems. This includes improvising own lines when he is not happy with the script at hand and they just accept what he is doing. It did feel a bit unrealistic. But this is not what the film is about at its core. There are many other more crucial aspects that define the movie's heart and soul. First of all, it is really a very progressive film with major focus on subjects like emancipation and equality in the film industry really. The truly sexist behavior by the two most influential characters on the set is pretty scary and while it also results in some really funny moments, it is nonetheless shocking at times. The scene when the lead actor enters Tootsie's apartment and almost rapes her (not sure if I can write that with review guidelines..) is kept easy and light by Bill Murray's character's comments, but there sure is some gravity to it. Oh yes, there I already mentioned Bill Murray. Huge fan here and it was a great surprise to see him at around the age of 30 playing the main character's best friend. I did not know he was in this one and looking at his body of work, he was already a prolific actor by then. And his comedy line delivery was already as good as it is now and has been in the last decades. What a champ.So I mentioned the more troubling aspects this film has to offer, but I still felt that they were sometimes included just for the sake of it and not properly elaborated on in detail so that the film really could have made a powerful statement. But it is alright. The movie still works well as a comedy and sometimes more is less, so I don't mind them taking the more subtle approach. And let's be honest here, the comedy is really good. Even the less likable characters like the lead actor from the telenovela get their funny lines when he eventually worries about Murray's character knowing after he and Tootsie get caught in the act (almost). There are many many other funny lines and quotes I could include here, but my suggestion is you just watch the movie. Just one more, namely the scene when Hoffman dressed up as Tootsie meets ""his"" agent and he does not recognize him. Also the table scene afterwards is hilarious. As for the title, I am not so sure if it is a good choice. It somewhat indicates the emancipation aspect because it is a nickname that is disrespectful, but at the same time, it is just kept there as one word and I don't think it is defining for the film, so it is somewhat examplary for the weaker sides the movie has to offer. On a completely different note I was surprised how we don't really see the (first) transformation step-by-step when Hoffman's character wears female clothes for the very first time. ""She"" is right there in full out of nowhere. I think audiences back then who had no idea what the film was about must have been pretty baffled I can only imagine. Nowadays really nobody probably watches this film without vaguely knowing what it is about. This and Mrs. Doubtfire are probably the two defining films when it comes to this kind of idea. There are a handful others here in Germany and the likes of Peter Alexander, Thomas Gottschalk and a few other good entertainers, but maybe not so good actors, have taken a similar approach and their films have turned out really badly, so it definitely is a challenging subject, but it did work out for Tootsie, even if this is far from a perfect movie. Still I was glad that, on the occasion of a film series about New York, I got the chance to watch this movie on the big screen for the first time, actually for the first time ever anywhere. The awards recognition and reception is probably exaggerated, but Hoffman alone and the script at times (and of course Murray!) made it worth seeing for me. No hesitation for me in saying this is a good (not great) movie that was definitely ahead of its time and I think you may want to check it out. Also you will find many familiar faces in here, even Pollack himself playing a supporting character. Thumbs up!",Tootsie
5,mark.waltz,We need more comedies like this...toot sweet!,10,2 February 2019,"Back before movies became too much about special effects and less about story and character, you could go to the movie theater and be swept in by clever stories, likable characters, humorous situations and music to hum as you left the theater. There is a reason why certain film genres have the term ""popcorn movie"" attached to it, and films of the 1980s had a structure to them that was innocent, sweet, yet worldly beyond most audiences normal lives. Many of these films are now considered modern Classics and ""Tootsie"" is probably near the top of that list.This is the New York City of the 1980's, and there are no muggings, no criminal gangs and the only unpleasant situations come from the deceit of the major character played by Dustin Hoffman which is funny, not malicious. This is when there were 10 New York based soap operas which employed close to a thousand actors a year in regular or recurring parts. These actors could work on the stage or on local television when they were not employed by the soaps, and that is part of the Nostalgia that this film maintains today.Hoffman is a temperamental actor whose reputation has made him unhirable except in the most remote of summer stock locations. Agent Sydney Pollock has to blurred out the truth to him, and when longtime friend Teri Garr loses a part on a daytime soap opera, Hoffman dones a wig and dress and maneuvers his way enter the job, playing the new hospital administrator on a long-running medical base soap opera. The wacky goings-on of what's going on behind the scenes are just as funny as some of the ridiculous situations that go on the screen, and thanks to Hoffman's attitude as his female counterpart, the character he plays becomes extremely popular and sets the mark for what women in the early 1980's were striving to become in a man's world.Among the people he works with are troubled co-star Jessica Lange, lecherous long time leading man George Gaynes, tough producer Doris Belack (modeled after Gloria Monty of ""General Hospital""), tyrannical director Dabney Coleman and the scantily clad Geena Davis and one of her earliest roles. There's also Charles Durning as Lang'es widowed father who quickly Becomes enamoured of Hoffman's counterpart and Bill Murray as Hoffman's wisecracking roommate. The Situation's get out of hand as the character on the soap opera Hoffman plays becomes a magazine cover star.Terrific acting, sensational directing by Sydney Pollock and an absolutely perfect script keeps this moving and suspenseful with how it will all unfold. At the heart of the film is Hoffman whose vanity must learn some humanity as he deals with his gender transition. Then there are the two songs, one of which ended up winning the Oscar, along with Lange who takes a seemingly ordinary, nondescript part and makes it a real acting exercise. It was a nice transition from her first film roles into becoming a truly serious actress, try not to be a fluke by her success in the same year's ""Frances"". Many of the actors in this film had experience working on the soaps so they knew a bit about the setting. In minor roles, there are some easily recognizable future stars including Christine Ebersole as a guest at Hoffman's birthday party. Romantic comedy doesn't get any better than this and those vintage New York locations all over Manhattan are nostalgic as well.",Tootsie
6,classicsoncall,"""I just wish I looked prettier...""",8,28 May 2011,"I recall thinking how daring it must have been for Dustin Hoffman to put it all out there on the line when this film first came out. Sure, Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis did it in ""Some Like It Hot"", but they went mostly for laughs. Hoffman plays it straight (in a manner of speaking), and even though the film has many funny moments, there's also an understated nuance in the way he handles his character in serious situations. I'll have to credit that to Hoffman's unique ability to take entirely disparate characters and make them his own, just as he did with Ratso Rizzo, Jack Crabb and Raymond Babbitt.The supporting players here are first rate, and perfectly cast to match their characters. The surprise for me was seeing director Sidney Pollack in front of the camera as Michael Dorsey's agent. My favorite scene is the one where Michael reveals he's Dorothy, and Pollack is completely beside himself with disbelief. It's just what you'd expect from an agent who just reamed his most temperamental client for being impossible to work with.The picture does have it's expected situations that attempt to compromise Dorothy Michaels' relationship with men, but they're intelligently done and don't resort to slapstick. Les Nichols' (Charle Durning) attempt to romance Dorothy was handled discreetly by the script, and the ensuing confrontation between the two as men was handled professionally. This all could have been done quite differently with an over the top approach to Michael Dorsey's 'womanhood', but then you would have had a mediocre film filled with stereotype and caricature. Instead, you have one that offers the viewer a good time without sacrificing intelligence at the expense of humor.",Tootsie
7,gavin6942,"Perhaps a Bit Overrated, But Still Good",7,26 November 2012,"An unemployed actor with a reputation for being difficult (Dustin Hoffman) disguises himself as a woman to get a role in a soap opera.Understandably, this film was successful and well-received by people.Dustin Hoffman is an amazing actor and he goes the whole way on this (though I found his voice a bit hard to accept as a woman's voice). Much of his dialogue is actually improvised, which is amazing... more impressive is how the other actors are able to react genuinely to his improv.The supporting actors are well-cast, too. Bill Murray was still young, but always improves any scene he is in. Interestingly, he plays a very ""straight"" character, which is not what we have come to expect from him, and suggests his range is greater than generally given credit. Teri Garr and Jessica Lange were both cast without the script even being finished, with Lange being picked solely because Pollack's daughter liked ""King Kong""!But it is not perfect, either. It is definitely dated, with a horrendous soundtrack that should be thrown in the fire. And the same theme has been done over and over again, making this film (even if original) seem stale. That is not their fault, of course, but unfortunately it rubs off on them.Somewhat unusually, the film was picked up by the Criterion Collection. Whether it deserves to be there or not is open to debate, but they did a fantastic job with the Blu-Ray and it looks great. The commentary track from director Sydney Pollack is very informative and shows how much Hoffman really carried the film.",Tootsie
8,lee_eisenberg,Feminist or not?,7,26 October 2005,"Unemployed and getting desperate, actor Michael Dorsey (Dustin Hoffman) comes up with the perfect idea: dress up as a woman. Not only does he do that, but he gets a job. The only problem is, he's in love with a woman, and now he has this other identity to contend with.When ""Tootsie"" was first released, it was apparently hailed as a feminist movie. But is it? Granted, Michael comes to understand women better through his double identity, but he continues mistreating Sandy Lester (Teri Garr). Oh well. I guess that overall, the movie succeeds in other places, namely Michael's various embarrassing situations. You'll probably like it, especially with great supporting performances by Jessica Lange, Charles Durning, Dabney Coleman, Bill Murray, and even director Sydney Pollack as Michael's agent. This was also Geena Davis' film debut. A real hoot, although I can see how some people might get a little offended by it.",Tootsie
9,jboothmillard,Tootsie,8,31 December 2005,"If it hadn't been for Some Like It Hot, cross dressing comedies like Mrs. Doubtfire, Big Momma's House and She's the Man (and, ahem, White Chicks) would not have existed, and this one of the most remembered, from Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director Sidney Pollack (They Shoot Horses, Don't They?, The Way We Were, Out of Africa). Basically Michael Dorsey (BAFTA and Golden Globe winning, and Oscar nominated Dustin Hoffman) is a talented actor, but he out of work and no-one wants to hire him because he is so difficult to work with, he has been unemployed for four months, and his long suffering agent George Fields (Sydney Pollack) is tired of it. George tells Michael that he will never got a job in the city, but when Michael hears from his friend Sandy Lester (Dumb and Dumber's Oscar BAFTA nominated Teri Garr) that the soap opera Southwest General are auditioning for a new female character, he dresses as a woman, to become Dorothy Michaels, and he gets the part after ""her"" feisty performance. As Dorothy, Michaels raises the $8,000 to give his friend and roommate Jeff Slater (Bill Murray) to produce his play Return To Love Canal, and as time goes by, and as Dorothy improvises more dramatic and feisty lines and scenes in the show, she becomes the most popular character. Michael does not want ""girlfriend"" Sandy to know what he is up to, as she wanted the part in the soap opera, and she seems too fragile to be told the truth, and this relationship and his covering up of his cross dressing is becoming complicated. He is also finding himself, as Dorothy, attracted to single mother and female co-star Julie Nichols (King Kong's Oscar and Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated Jessica Lange), who is already seeing sexist director Ron Carlisle (Dabney Coleman), but she really admires Dorothy. As Dorothy, Michael almost kisses Julie, and of she can only say that she likes ""her"" as a friend, and dressed as a woman he has admirers as well, including older co-star John Van Horn (George Gaynes) and Julie's widowed father Leslie 'Les' (The Muppet Movie's Charles Durning), who even proposes to ""her"". Michael is getting increasingly uncomfortable carrying on pretending to be a woman playing the popular hospital administrator, and it gets worse when the producers want to extend Dorothy's contract for another year. He decides to finally reveal the truth when the cast are forced to perform a scene live, and as Dorothy Michaels he performs a stirring moment, and as part of his own storyline, he reveals himself as ""twin brother"" to the character, everyone is shocked by this double revelation. Weeks later, Michael wants to confess all to Julie, having lost Sandy, and after explaining himself and his feelings for her, she does forgive him and they happily walk down the street together, we don't know what happened in terms of his acting career though. Also starring Geena Davis as April Page, Doris Belack as Rita Marshall, Saw's Tobin Bell as Waiter and Andy Warhol. In his regular manly role Hoffman is a likable guy, and he really shines under the wig and make up dressing up as the woman, Lange gives a really sweet award winning performance as the woman he loves and has her problems, Garr gets her moments as the suspicious and easily irritated ""girlfriend"", and the co-stars including Pollack and Murray gets their fair amount of funny moments too. The cross dressing aspect is played in both a funny and an interesting way, with the story being about a soap opera it also satirises the ideas that these programmes can come up with, all in all it makes up for a most watchable comedy drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing, Best Song for ""It Might Be You"", Best Sound, Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen and Best Picture, it won the BAFTA for Best Make Up Artist, and it was nominated for Best Costume Design, Best Original Song for the title song, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical, and it was nominated for Best Screenplay. Dustin Hoffman was number 24 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 21 on The World's Greatest Actor, the film was number 62 on 100 Years, 100 Movies, and it was number 2 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs. Very good!",Tootsie
10,Woodyanders,Delightful early 80's comedy smash,9,1 August 2017,"Talented, but notoriously difficult struggling actor Michael Dorsey (superbly played by Dustin Hoffman) poses in drag as actress Dorothy Michaels in order to land a role on a popular soap opera. Complications ensue when ""Dorothy"" befriends and subsequently falls for co-star Julie Nichols (a fine and affecting performance by Jessica Lange).Director Sydney Pollack, working from a clever and perceptive script by Larry Gelbart and Murray Schisgal, wisely treats the outrageous premise straight so that the humor comes across as natural and spontaneous instead of strained and contrived. Moreover, this film not only offers some biting insights pertaining to complex gender roles, the competitive cut-throat nature of show business, and the intrinsic mounting problems one inevitably encounters from trying to pull off an elaborate ruse for any length of time, but also gains considerable depth and poignancy from the way Dorsey learns to be a better man by pretending to be a woman.In addition, it's acted with tremendous skill and zest by a tip-top cast: Bill Murray lends hilarious support as Dorsey's flaky roommate Jeff, Charles Durning contributes a touching turn as Julie's lonely and smitten father Les, and Dabney Coleman smarms it up perfectly as sexist pig director Ron, plus there's praiseworthy work from Teri Garr as the neurotic Sandy, Geena Davis as the sweetly sexy April, George Gaynes as pompous ham John Van Horn, Pollack as Dorsey's no-nonsense agent George Fields, and Doris Belack as feisty producer Rita. Both Owen Roizman's crisp widescreen cinematography and Dave Grusin's bouncy score are up to par. A total treat.",Tootsie
11,ccthemovieman-1,"Lange, Hoffman Fun To Watch In This Justifiable Hit Of Its Day",8,14 June 2007,"It's strange how seeing a man dressed up as a woman always seems to be funny and popular with the audiences. Milton Berle helped make television with skits like this on his early 1950s show. It works here, too, with Dustin Hoffman applying the makeup and playing the role to the hilt.Helping Hoffman is Jessica Lange in, by far, her most attractive role. I'm not particularly a fan of hers but she looked spectacular in here, almost like Marilyn Monroe. This was a popular film because the humor was good and the two leads did a nice job, and people like a good romance story, too. Hoffman, like him or not, is a fabulous, able to play so many diverse roles. He's an amazing actor.Sometimes overlooked is the big-name supporting cast which includes Dabney Coleman, Teri Garr, Bill Murray, Chares Durning and Geena Davis. The latter was making her screen debut in here!This isn't as ""cute"" as it was 25 years ago but it sure was a justifiable bit hit back in the early '80s.",Tootsie
12,rmax304823,"Slickly commercial, and funny",6,16 February 2007,"Unemployed actor Dustin Hoffman poses as a woman, Dorothy Michaels, and lands a part on a soap opera where he falls for another cast member, Jessica Lange. Hoffman gets into the role and begins improvising snotty remarks and put-downs against his overbearing male costars, as well as coaching Lange on standing up for her rights instead of letting men walk all over her.Hoffman becomes the most popular person on the show and is irreplaceable. He's in hot water, however, since no one on the show realizes that he's a man, Lange included. (The makeup is superb.) Then things get all complicated. Lange's father, Charles Durning, develops a passion for Hoffman's Dorothy and offers him a ring. And Hoffman is locked into a contract that he can't get out of without inviting professional ruin.It's a very funny movie with clever gags that break little new ground in the transvestite genre. Example: After a friendly dinner, Lange confides to Dorothy that she, Lange, is tired of men hitting on her and fabulating compliments. It would be so much simpler, say Lange, is a man just came up to her, said, ""I could lay a long line on you, but what I really want to say is that I find you very interesting and would like to make love to you."" Hoffman, as Dorothy, nods eagerly. Shortly afterward, in his male persona, he runs into Lange at a party. She of course doesn't recognize him without his Dorothy disguise. ""You know something?"", Hoffman asks. ""I could lay a long line on you, but what I'd really like to say is that I find you very interesting and would like to make love to you."" Lange throws a glass of wine in his face and walks away.There are unusually good performances from Dustin Hoffman (looking and acting convincingly feminine), Bill Murray, Sidney Pollack, and Jessica Lange in particular.I won't give away any more gags, I guess, though there are many amusing scenes. The chief problem with the movie is that it's structured for popular taste. It's burdened with a ""meaningfulness"", namely the empowerment of women, that ""Some Like It Hot"" never dreamed of. And there are times when it's soft and cloying like the chocolate-covered cherries that someone gives Dorothy as a present. Lange and Hoffman are sharing a bed at Lange's family farm and the scene is loving and tender. A sappy love song swells in the background. It played under the end credits with a saxophone lead that sounds like Kenny G.And most of the comic situations are derivative too, as perforce they just about must be, because how many twists can be wrung out of a plot that has become this familiar. There isn't as much outright slapstick as in ""Mrs. Doubtfire."" Nobody's bosom catches on fire. But there's the same quick-change problem when Hoffman's girl friend (Terry Garr) bursts into his apartment while he's still in costume.There's something else too. It's a little demeaning to women. I don't watch soap operas (""afternoon dramas""), but I wonder if female characters are really treated as doormats. If they're called ""Tootsie,"" or ""Doll,"" or ""Sweetie,"" behind the camera, how terrible is that? How different is it from calling a man ""Pal"" or ""Mac"" or ""Buddy""? And if it were true that women were subtly trashed behind and in front of the camera, does it really take a man in a woman's guise to wake them up? The impression the film leaves with the viewer is that a good deal of thought and expense went into the production, but most of the effort was aimed not at making a good comedy but at appealing to the widest possible audience and raking in the shekels at the box office, at which I believe it succeeded.",Tootsie
13,moonspinner55,"Dustin Hoffman's unforgettable triple threat: as Michael, Dorothy, and Emily Kimberly",9,17 September 2006,"Unemployable actor dresses in drag and gets a juicy female part on a popular television soap opera. Dustin Hoffman, at this point in his illustrious career, would hardly seem convincing as a struggling New York City actor who has to beg his agent for work, but his comic desperation here is funny and real at the same time. He's so likably obnoxious that we understand both his predicament and that of his poor agent's (played wonderfully by Sydney Pollack, who also directed). ""Tootsie"" doesn't come on like gangbusters, like a razor-sharp satire of show business; it is almost nonchalant about how clever it is, how consistently smart and beguiling. After it's over, one may feel energized by the sheer good will of the whole thing. The film leaves such a lasting impression that, thinking it over a few days later, it brings back some big laughs. It also features one of the greatest comedic ensembles of the last 40 years, with Jessica Lange winning a Supporting Oscar playing a TV nurse (her lazy, honeydew drawl is infectious and lovely). The film represents a milestone: a savvy humdinger of a comedy that is also a sweet story of self-discovery, and one that never condescends to its audience. ***1/2 from ****",Tootsie
14,Quinoa1984,"Fine and funny, but overrated (Criterion Collection, for this?)",7,29 March 2018,"Tootsie is simultaneously funny/entertaining... And wildly over-hyped and dated (that score and those songs just suck). I know such things like critical appraisal shouldn't matter, but to give an example this is #2 on the AFI top comedies list, above Dr Strangelove (which is #3). That's like saying American Sniper is the #2 war movie of all time above #3 Saving Private Ryan. It's supposed to be Hoffman's movie, and he puts his all into it, but I'll be damned if Dabney Coleman (who's first rate), Sydney Pollack (who originally didn't want to even be in the movie and was thankfully forced by Hoffman for the good reason that no one could tell Michael what to do like him) and Bill Murray don't steal the movie out from under him. This is a case to me where the ""straight men"" get more of the laughs, and Hoffman gets his share. Also ups to Teri Garr and Charles Durning too, albeit the latter comes in like a realer but less funny version of the ""well, nobody's perfect"" guy from Some Like it Hot.It's a handsomely made, usually well timed sitcom. It somehow managed to be nominated at the Oscars alongside the likes of ET, The Verdict and Das Boot (Lange got a not undeserved one too as the heart of the movie).",Tootsie

Co-star in the soap opera, Jessica Lange, in a supporting Oscar performance, believes he is a lesbian. Dorothy meets her widowed father, the wonderful Charles Durning, a redneck, who begins to have designs on Dorothy for himself. Teri Garr is Michael's girl friend who doesn't know that Michael has gone drag and further believes that he is carrying on with Julie (Lange)Of course, there is Dabney Coleman as the director of the soap opera who mistreats Julie as well.It appears that Dorothy is able to solve the problems of others whether it be on the show or off camera. How she finally shows herself to be Michael is brilliant film-making.Tootsie received a well-deserved Oscar nomination for best picture. It lost to ""Gandhi."" Hoffman was nominated for best actor.

17,sunwarrior13,Watch Tootsie For Hoffman Alone,10,4 June 2016,"Dustin Hoffman remains popular among movie fans especially when it comes to portraying difficult roles such as the autistic brother of Tom Cruise in the ""Rain Man"" and that being a woman in this film entitled ""Tootsie"".The late Sydney Pollack directed this film about Michael Dorsey,an unemployed actor who is unable to get a job due to being difficult to work with despite the fact that he is extremely talented. When he could no longer find any work,he decided to disguise as Dorothy Michaels,an actress who lands a role in a popular soap opera.Here is where the fun begins.....No question that the viewer will definitely be amazed by Hoffman's performance considering anyone who does not know would surely never doubt him at all as a drag.Even his voice which is of a Southern accent is pitch perfect.Aside from it, we also are treated to an intelligent comedic screenplay that revolves around Michael/Dorothy from his relationships with his friends Jeff and Sandy as well as his cast mates Les and April.We also get to see how Dorothy's career takes off and how he finally reveals in the end who he really ends. Finally, the development of the relationship between Michael and April was definitely worth watching.It was a big hit when it was released back in '82.But despite the fact that a lot of things have changed since then particularly when it comes to many themes it made fun with such as the increase of women in workplace together with the limited acceptance of LGBT's which are no longer issues today,it remains one of the most popular comedies at present. Watching Hoffman alone is a big delight.",Tootsie

19,hitchcockthelegend,I'm only glad that I didn't kiss you.,8,26 November 2008,"Michael Dorsey is an out of work actor, unable to get work because he is either too small, too old, too young and etc. After final getting to the end of his tether he decides to drag up as a woman and audition for the role of Dorothy Michaels on a daytime soap opera. He not only gets the job but Dorothy becomes a massive hit with the television audiences and studio bosses alike, but success has its drawbacks, it plays havoc with his love life and brings unwanted attentions from members of the same sex!Terrificly entertaining comedy that showcases the best of Dustin Hoffman and brings our attention to a whole ream of quality supporting actors. Feeling very much like an old school type comedy, Tootsie (superbly directed by Sydney Pollack) fuses all the traits needed to hold the audience right to the credits role. What's noticeable now when revisiting the film is just how cheeky the piece is, poking the ribs of soaps, the pedal stool building of celebrities, and of course the bad taste that is left in the mouth because of sexism.....especially in the film industry, yes Tootsie is pretty astute work from Pollack and his team of writers (way too many to mention here).Though very much a blunderbuss vehicle for Hoffman's range (he may be difficult to work with but he's one of his generations best actors), Tootsie's ultimate success is down to the ensemble cast. The twin sexiness that is Jessica Lange and Teri Garr both put in tremendous work as the two women in Michael/Dorothy's life, then there is Bill Murray as Michael's flat mate, Jeff, deadpan comedy gold from the sozzled face master. Sydney Pollack (yes the same), Charles Durning, Dabney Coleman and Geena Davis round out the roll call for excellent performances fleshing the bones of this delightful picture. Not without its bitter sweet moments, or indeed a touch of drama, it's with the comedy that Tootsie is most remembered for, and rightly so. As Dorothy struggles to fight off amorous men, or the simplest thing like hailing a taxi, the laughs come fast and furious in this cross dressing delight. 8/10",Tootsie

Auditions that lead to rejections don't set well with his ego, or his livelihood. Since he can't land a part on a soap opera as a man, he decides to try it as a woman, only to become an instant success. But the problem is to keep the fictitious Dorothy Michaels alive and not make an obvious mistake that will make him lose the badly needed income.Little does Michael know he will become friendly with the beautiful female star Julie Nichols, who sees in Dorothy a kind soul who she can identify with. To make matters worse, Julie's father Lee, also finds beauty and possibly romance with the her daughter's co-star! In the meantime, Michael must juggle his newly found fame with the dwindling relationship he has with Sandy, his long time girlfriend. Michael is playing with fire and it will be only a matter of when he will be found out.Sydney Pollack, a director not associated with comedy, made a tremendous contribution to this film. He must have been having a great time because it shows in the end product, which is a satisfying comedy that can be seen again, and again. It helps too that a talented man like Larry Gelbart wrote a great screen play that is fun and light.Dustin Hoffman did a wonderful job of Michael/Dorothy. He is always a joy to watch as a man, or as a woman. Mr. Hoffman always gives his everything to anything in which he appears, as it's the case in this movie. Jessica Lange made the most out of the beautiful Julie Nichols, a girl with the heart in the right place. Charles Durning also is at his best playing Lee Nichols a man that thinks he has found love with this earthy Dorothy. The rest of the cast does amazing work. Teri Garr, Dabney Coleman, Geena Davis, and even the director himself, bring conviction to their characters.""Tootsie"" has the right ingredients and intelligent contributions by Mr. Pollack and its star, Dustin Hoffman.",Tootsie
21,Doylenf,Another man as woman comedy...but one that really works!!...,7,3 September 2006,"There must have been something in the drinking water at around the time of TOOTSIE because Julie Andrews had just played a woman pretending to be a man and here we have DUSTIN Hoffman in the same situation and for the same reason--gainful employment.Anyway, Dustin does a believable job as Dorothy Michaels, the character he invents when it seems his job tryouts are all in vain. He's a man who seems to attract enemies like flies but when he puts on his Dorothy make-up they're more like moths attracted to a flame.This makes dealing with his girlfriend TERI GARR even more difficult, not to mention the fact that he's smitten with JESSICA LANGE, the soap opera actress who treats him like her best girl friend.With director Sydney Pollack and Bill Murray in supporting roles, TOOTSIE gets by because Dustin's Dorothy character is so appealing and believable. She has to be, otherwise all the other cast members would be able to see through the disguise.It's enjoyable light comedy fluff that wound up getting so many Oscar nominations I lost count. JESSICA LANGE did win for her Best Supporting Role and DUSTIN Hoffman at least did win a Golden Globe for his impersonation of the title character. An Oscar win would have been justified.Forgive the upper and lower type discrepancies. For some reason, my software doesn't type Hoffman in capital letters.",Tootsie
22,preppy-3,Very good,8,31 May 2004,"Great comedy about Michael Dorsey (Dustin Hoffman).  He's a struggling actor who's a perfectionist and is so difficult nobody will hire him.  So he dons drag and becomes Dorothy Michaels.  ""She"" gets a job on a soap opera and falls in love with one of the actresses--Julie Nichols (Jessica Lange).  But Lange tries to hook Dorothy up with her widowed father (Charles Durning). 
Now the plot is ridiculous--it could NEVER happen in real life.  But great performances, good direction and a sharp script make this work.  Hoffman is believable (probably because he IS a perfectionist) as Michael and Dorothy. Lange won a Best Supporting Actress Award for this....and she's just great. Durning isn't in the movie much but he IS funny.  Also on board are Teri Garr (terribly unfunny and whiny), Dabney Coleman (playing a sexist jerk--again) and Bill Murray (unbilled) who is HYSTERICAL as Hoffman's roommate (he also has the funniest line).  Also it's Geena Davis' first role (a good sport considering she's introduced wearing very revealing underwear).Now this was considered ground-breaking for its discussion of sexual roles--but that's where I have a problem with this.  The women are portrayed as whiny, borderline alcoholics with no self-esteem.  Yet when Hoffman enters as a woman who makes them stand up for themselves and become stronger.  The message here seems to be a woman needs another man to teach them to be self-sufficient.  Basically a man is better being a woman than a real woman!  It does play some lip service to Hoffman saying playing a woman made him a better man but I didn't believe it for a second.Still, this IS a great comedy and ground-breaking in its day.  Also Hoffman is VERY convincing in drag!  An 8",Tootsie

Is very funny at times though, with some hilarious scenes and lines.However, it does get rather silly and farcical at times. Just when you want it to get serious and make a point, it has some silly scene, just to extend the farce. Dustin Hoffman is great (as you would expect) in the lead role.

25,Boba_Fett1138,Dustin Hoffman dressed as a woman...brilliant!,8,10 May 2006,"The greatest strength of the movie is in the fact that the main character is being played by a well known and much acclaimed actor. Hoffman was nominated several times for an Oscar before this movie and even won one in 1979 for his role in ""Kramer vs. Kramer"". This is not the sort of role you would expect an Oscar winning actor to appear in. All the more reason why this movie works surprising as well as brilliant. Hoffman prevents the movie from getting silly and adds some seriousness to the movie, even though the story itself is of course still quite silly on its own.But it is of course more than just the leading actor that makes this movie work. The movie is also very well and clever written, unlike most comedies that are being released today. The movie doesn't rely on visual or comical situations but more on the cleverly written and directed situations and also the more realistic situations. ""Tootsie"" is a silly movie but not an unlikely one. Movies like this one and others like these from the same period are the reason why the '80's are often regarded as the golden decade for comedies.It's not only Hoffman that acts fine in this movie. Besides the Oscar nomination for Hoffman, it was Jessica Lange who actually got to take the statue home with her. Also nominated was Teri Garr (perhaps still best known for her role in ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"") for her role in this movie. Other fine well known actors in this movie are Charles Durning, Lynne Thigpen, Sydney Pollack himself Geena Davis in her first movie role and Bill Murray (I had totally forgotten he also was in this movie, until my recent last viewing).The movie was actually nominated for 10 Oscars, including Best Picture, which is a real big achievement for a comedy. No way this could ever happen this present day, especially not with the sort of comedies that are being made now.But still there are some issues that I have with this movie. First of all this movie carries the curse of almost every '80's movie, it has a typical '80's soundtrack which sounds incredibly dreadful now this present day. The movie could had also used some more style on its own. It's an overall pretty formulaic made and even predictable movie that still works fine and powerful enough thanks to its clever story and professional actors. Sydney Pollack never really has been my favorite director. Don't get me wrong, he did a good job with this movie and its story but his movies always feel like they are lacking something, mostly in its style and perhaps also pace.All in all this movie surely will become and maybe already is a comedy classic, mainly thanks to the surprising Hoffman and the well written script.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Tootsie

Classic contemporary comedy and one of the most popular movies ever made. Hoffman (Best Actor nominee) is trouble-making actor Michael Dorsey who is so unbearable and unemployable, so says his agent (director Sydney Pollack, fellow Oscar nominee, in a very funny performance) that he dons drag as ""Dorothy Michaels"" and lands a gig as a recurring character as a successful soap opera. There he learns what it's like to really be a woman including the sexism, harrassment and daily regimen of just getting dressed that women face every day. Hoffman is great fun and adds dignity to what easily could have been a kitschy role and some excellent performances by Garr (Best Supporting Actress nominee) as his no-longer platonic girlfriend and neurotic actress; Coleman as his chauvanist pig director with glee and unbridled insensitivity; Murray (who received no billing on his own accord) is dead-pan perfect with one of the film's best lines at its climax (""that is one nutty hospital!""); and Lange, lastly, is a pure and perfect delight as the soap's ingenue who learns some life lessons and earned her a Best Supporting Actress Oscar.Crackling nominated screenplay by legendary writer Larry Gelbart.A comic gem.",Tootsie
27,evanston_dad,"Go, Tootsie, Go",10,28 January 2008,"1980s cinema mostly sucked, but one thing the 80s got right was the R-rated comedy. ""Tootsie"" is perhaps the premier example of 80s adult comedy at its best, and it's a dynamite film.Dustin Hoffman plays a struggling actor who lands a job on a soap opera under the guise of a tough-talking woman. Things get complicated (as such things do, of course) when he/she becomes a national sensation and has to face the prospect of pretending to be a woman for the indefinite future.Hoffman gives a master class in screen comedy, and the success of the entire film rests primarily on his ability to pull off a tricky role. At one point, his character says something about being a better man as a woman than he ever was being a man, and the movie, and his performance, conveys just that. He's ably abetted by a terrific ensemble that includes Bill Murray, Teri Garr, Charles Durning and Sydney Pollack, who also directed. Jessica Lange plays his love interest and won an Oscar for her performance, though I've always found Lange's mannerisms to be distracting and she's not comfortable with some of the more comedic elements.The film is so well written that you can sit back and enjoy it without having to roll your eyes at how implausible it all is. Sometimes clichés say it the best, and such is the case here: they just don't make 'em like this anymore.Grade: A+",Tootsie
28,AlsExGal,You know you're old when...,9,16 March 2013,"Somebody describes Tootsie as ""an older movie"", and you remember it well, seeing it in the theatre on your 25th birthday, but I digress.Don't think that this is some low-brow film that focuses on cross-dressing. It's not. This smart comedy is about how both sexes perceive themselves and each other. Dustin Hoffman plays actor Michael Dorsey, who's a dramatic purist. He wants to bring pure art to theatre whether people like it or not, like feeding spinach to a toddler. He's trying to raise money for a rather dismal play about people moving back to the location of a toxic waste disaster, Love Canal. In the meantime Michael is trying to get his aspiring actress friend, Sandy, a job on a soap opera. She doesn't even make the first cut. Later Michael has a show-down with his agent, George, who basically tells him he's been labeled as trouble and nobody will ever hire him.These two events come together and the next shot - on the streets of New York City - is Dustin Hoffman dressed as a middle aged lady going after the part that Sandy crashed and burned at the previous day -he's going to prove his agent wrong. At first Michael/Dorothy looks like she's going to be snubbed too, but by using what he knows the soap opera wants in the character as fake personal characteristics he gets a reading and gets the part.Now the hard part, he has to keep up this charade without anybody knowing, especially Sandy, since as an actual woman she couldn't get this job. Here is where Michael makes his first mistake. Waiting for Sandy to come out of the bathroom he undresses and tries on some of her clothes since he is going to need a wardrobe. Sandy comes out unexpectedly, Michael is standing in his underwear. Michael's reaction? Tell this extremely vulnerable woman that you want her and sleep with her of course! This really made me dislike Michael. Sandy even recognizes this might just be sex and says ""she'd like her pain now"". But, no, Michael falsely promises it's the beginning of a relationship. It is not.Michael starts out his job with two quests - to raise enough money to do the Love Canal play himself, and to prove to his agent that people can work with him. But then the problems begin. He begins to catch on as a performer and his/her little bits about handling difficult men in the workplace cause Michael/Dorothy to become a feminist hero, the show's ratings rise, and scads of fan mail arrive. Most of all, Michael becomes interested in Julie (Jessica Lange) an actress on the show who is involved with the lecherous director of the show (Dabney Coleman). Although Michael demonizes the guy, he really isn't treating Julie any worse than Michael is treating Sandy. Remember Sandy? Waiting for dinners that never happen and dates that are never kept? Michael/Dorothy also gets a taste of how aggressive men can be when they want something or someone, and in the process of courting Julie he attracts the romantic attention of Julie's father, old fashioned widower Les (Charles Durning). Michael also discovers what women say they want from men isn't always the truth, even when they (think they) are talking to another woman.Special mention to Sydney Pollack as Michael's agent. He was perfect as a guy at his wit's end dealing with a person (Michael) who doesn't exactly have normal coping skills. Bill Murray gets honorable mention as a self important guy who hangs around when the others are talking theatre like he's some great philosopher when he's actually just a chronically unemployed bag of wind, but at least he's an amusing bag of wind.They just don't make smart modern films like this anymore that take a few chances. Think about it, if this film had been done badly, it would be the stuff of cult film fans such as Faye Dunaway in Mommy Dearest screaming ""No Wire Hangers Ever!"". I think there's no chance you won't like it if you give it a try and look at all the subtle stuff going on as well as the big picture.",Tootsie
29,anaconda-40658,Hoffman in Drag.,10,16 February 2016,"Tootsie (1982): Dir: Sydney Pollack / Cast: Dustin Hoffman, Jessica Lange, Teri Garr, Dabney Coleman, Bill Murray: Easily the best male in drag film since Some Like It Hot. Dustin Hoffman plays struggling stage actor Micheal Dorsey whose difficult reputation has him losing acting opportunities. To prove his value to his agent he accepts a part in a hospital soap opera but the catch being that he shows up in drag as Dorothy Michaels and wins over everyone with her direct attitude. Trouble is that Dorothy is a hit on the soap leading to all sorts of amusing dilemmas. Director Sydney Pollack delivers a film that showcases the genders in the work place as seen from the opposite perspective. Hoffman is brilliant going from struggling actor to someone whose suddenly popular despite co-worker not knowing that Dorothy is really a male. He often wings his scenes and also deals with two suitors, one being an older co-star while the other is the father of his co-star Julie. As played by Jessica Lange she is a single mother dealing with a low level relationship with the sexist egotistical director, played by Dabney Coleman. Teri Garr plays an acting student confused with regards to her relationship with Michael. Bill Murray plays Michael's roommate and fellow actor looking to get a play going.

The only person who made me laugh in the entire movie was Bill Murray, who perhaps gives the funniest performance he has ever given in this film.Never, never will I understand why people think this movie is one of the best films of all time.

""Mrs. Doubtfire"" is all about seeing Robin Williams in drag (really not that much there).Sure, you could argue that ""Tootsie"" is pretty much all Dustin Hoffman, but he's backed by one hell of a cast. And this movie's main draw - besides seeing the lead in ghastly makeup - is its unimpeachable ability to draw you into Hoffman's story and then cold-cock you with a priceless one-liner. This happens a lot. And it doesn't just play gender confusion for laughs, there's actual sympathy for the plight of the modern working woman.And don't let me forget Bill Murray, whose deadpan deliveries are a big chunk of the movie's humor.7/10",Tootsie

35,JamesHitchcock,"Go, Tootsie, Go!",9,16 May 2012,"During the late sixties and seventies, Dustin Hoffman never seemed to be away from the cinema screen for long, but in the eighties he made far fewer films, probably because he was concentrating more on his work in the theatre. I have never seen ""Ishtar"" or ""Family Business""- in the case of the former I have been dissuaded by its reputation as one of the great turkeys of all time- but his other three films from the decade, ""Tootsie"", ""Death of a Salesman"" and ""Rain Man"", although very different from one another, are all among his best.Here Hoffman plays Michael Dorsey, a New York actor who is finding it difficult to obtain work. Not through any lack of talent, but because he is so difficult to work with. He is the sort of perfectionist whose obsessive attention to detail and inability to suffer fools gladly make him the bane of every director's life and the despair of his long-suffering agent George. Michael decides that desperate measures are needed. He decides to audition for a part in the popular, hospital-set soap opera ""Southwest General"", and does not allow himself to be deterred by the fact that the audition is for a female role. He disguises himself as a woman, renames himself ""Dorothy Michaels"" and wins the part. The film explores the complications which arise, especially after Michael finds himself strongly attracted to his pretty co-star Julie Nichols. How can he declare his love to Julie without exposing his deception? To make matters worse, Julie's widowed father Les is equally attracted to the supposed ""Dorothy"".There are obvious similarities between ""Tootsie"" and that other great American cross-dressing comedy from around a decade later, ""Mrs Doubtfire"". In that film too the main character, played by Robin Williams, is also a talented but temperamental out-of-work actor, although his motives for dressing as a woman are different. There are, however, also important differences between the two films (quite apart from the fact that Hoffman makes a more convincing woman than does Williams).""Tootsie"" is, like ""Nine to Five"" from two years earlier, a comedy with feminist overtones which satirises male sexism in the workplace. Julie is in a relationship with the show's director Ron, who treats her badly both on and off the set, and both she and ""Dorothy"" have to cope with the unwanted attentions of the show's ageing star John Van Horn who despite his advancing years still fancies himself as a ladies' man. The satire in ""Mrs Doubtfire"", by contrast, is not so much feminist as masculinist, criticising the way in which the American divorce system discriminates against fathers and the distress that such discrimination can cause to the children of broken marriages. The other targets of the film's satire include soap operas; there must be plenty of real-life examples which share the low production values and abysmal acting standards of ""Southwest General"". (One infamously bad example that comes to mind is the British-made ""Crossroads""). Even Michael himself is sent up; he might be the film's hero and, strictly speaking, in the right in most of his confrontations, but his short fuse and his dogmatic, self-righteous manner make us realise just why everyone else finds it so difficult to work with him.The main reason for the film's success is Hoffman's brilliant performance in what is essentially the double role of Michael and Dorothy. Although Michael becomes quite unrecognisable, both in voice and appearance, when he assumes his feminine persona, Dorothy is similar in personality to her male alter ego, being just as feisty and bloody-minded as he is. The difference is that she can get away with it, and is even applauded for being a strong, determined woman, whereas he is just dismissed as a pain in the ass.Jessica Lange well deserved her Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, the only one the film won out of the ten for which it was nominated. The previous year Lange had achieved some notoriety for her role in the steamy remake of ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"", but here she shows a quite different side to her talents as the sweet and gentle Julie, who, under the influence of ""Dorothy"" finds the strength to stand up for herself. Julie is a single mother, something which shows how much social attitudes had changed by the eighties; at one time the idea of a romantic comedy heroine who had produced a child out of wedlock would have been unthinkable. There are also good contributions from Teri Garr as Michael's neurotic, self-pitying ex-girlfriend Sandy, a sort of female Woody Allen, from Charles Durning as Les, Bill Murray as Michael's playwright friend Jeff and Sydney Pollack, who also produced and directed, as George. A young Geena Davis appears briefly in her first film role.The film was nominated for the ""Best Picture"" Oscar but did not win. It would, in fact, have been surprising if it had won; the Academy in the eighties and early nineties was going through a prolonged bout of high seriousness, and no comedy won ""Best Picture"" between ""Annie Hall"" in 1977 and ""Shakespeare in Love"" in 1998. At least 1982 did produce a worthy winner in Attenborough's ""Gandhi"". ""Tootsie"" did, however, achieve belated recognition when the Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry, something well-deserved as it must rank as one of the greatest film comedies of the eighties. It is one of the few comedies which can successfully combine satirical social comment with real human emotions. 9/10",Tootsie

37,blanbrn,"Funny heartfelt film that proves one will go to extreme measures for success, while still remaining the same underneath.",9,13 February 2016,"1982's ""Tootsie"" is one film as you watch you laugh and are entertained all at the same time while your emotions are touched as you see what a person will do to gain some success in dire moments when push comes to shove one will even take a gender identity transformation! The cast rounds out well too as the chemistry on screen between the characters is what makes the film go, as director Sydney Pollack moves the film along just fine while trying to show the inner conflict of the central character Michael Dorsey.Anyway the story involves one Michael Dorsey(Dustin Hoffman one of the best actors of all-time)who's in New York city and all of a sudden he's hit a bump in his acting life he can no longer find any work no one will take him no roles are left he even struggles to find work in commercials so maybe it's back to the stage for him. His only side life aside from still trying for auditions is living with his roommate Jeff(in a early turn from Bill Murray)and on occasion he has one night stands with a fellow actress named Sandy(Teri Garr). So you guessed it Michael decides to disguise himself as a woman to land some work! And it works he gets what he takes or should I say that Dorothy takes her new part on a trashy hospital soap and his audition did impress director Ron(Dabney Coleman) and slowly but surely Dorothy/Michael finds new fame as his role takes off making the show a hit and it gives his acting work new life again! And along the way a relationship is formed with an onset actress named Julie(in a strong performance from Jessica Lange)who's a single mother only in the end truth is revealed between the two and love and understanding is reached. Also look for a good supporting turn from a young Gina Davis as a sexy actress named April who spices up the set with Julie and Dorothy.Thru it all this film proves that even though one changes identity still it doesn't change what's inside of you deep down and that what's is in one's heart matters most as still even though one may wear a mask they feel and love the same and still bring affection to others. Overall beautiful film that's funny and heartfelt and the Stephen Bishop song ""All of my Life: ""I've Been Waiting For You"" played during the film moves the picture along so nice.",Tootsie
38,DKosty123,Comedy Period Piece,6,27 July 2013,"As this is 1982, criticizing this film with today's woman in mind is not an accurate way to do it. The same goes for the outdated main plot of a woman doing a soap opera the way it is done in this film. Soap Operas are withering on the vine today with only a scant few left. Women now have much more meaningful careers than that line of work. In fact many women have now passed their husbands as the money maker in the household. There are still equal rights issues but as Manufacturing Jobs have gone off shore men are being reduced in importance in their roles in marriage.Then there is the gay marriage issue which is not really addressed here at all as only ground breaking TV series like M*A*S*H had addressed homosexuality much at all by 1982. HIV/AIDS was just getting started in this time period.This Sydney Pollack directed Comedy is all about fun, but is rooted in the type of role reversals that had been done many years prior to this film. That is why Dustin Hoffman is the perfect choice for the lead here. He always does sexual comedy well as if you witness The Graduate, Meet The Fockers, and others, his biggest successes have to do with comedy based on this genre.This film is a lot more than Dustin as the supporting cast sparkles and is very talented around him. There is a lot to like about the movie but this update of Some Like It Hot is not at the same level as Lemmon-Curtis-Monroe were many years earlier.I like the movie, but it is not great. This is not one to release in IMAX 3D. It actually is very stereotypical of this type of comedy in the 1950's and before.",Tootsie
39,lasttimeisaw,"a brilliantly made comedy, TOOTSIE stands tall among director Pollock's otherwise patchy filmography!",8,3 February 2015,"The synopsis of Sydney Pollack's drag comedy TOOTSIE can be construed as follows: a struggling thespian/acting coach Michael Dorsey (Huffman) cross-dresses as a woman Dorothy Michaels to secure a role in a popular daytime soapie, and scoops up massive acclamation as a single, middle-aged role model who disseminate fresh air of women being independent and self-confident, which profoundly inspires her fellow actress Julie (Lange), whom Michael has a huge crush on. If one has yet watched the film, the synopsis might get on someone's nerves, how on earth a man at the end of his tether can so easily thrive in the same line of business as soon as he acts in the opposite sex? What is more, he even becomes some sort of the guiding light to the dismissive gender while sporting a hard-on under his dress, it could only be a straight guy's pipe-dream with a penchant for sexism and male chauvinism, the movie could have been a total train wreck under a lesser brain. Thankfully, TOOTSIE is never the case with Pollack on board and a scintillating script bristles with no-hyperbole but heartfelt dialogue and organic humor and romance, plus an all-star cast spearheaded the ever so androgynous Hoffman. Instead it becomes one of the best and the most successful comedies ever in US. A giant crowd-pleaser and a top-dog in the Oscar-game too (although only Lange won one out of its overall 10 nominations, even that golden statue is a bit iffy in hindsight, since it is more like a consolation prize for her breathtaking turn in a biopic of Frances Farmer FRANCES 1982, 7/10 ). Michael's double personae is the refraction of his personality from different genders, as a man, he is an impulsive prick towards Sandy (Garr), the altruistic girl in his acting class who believes they click together, but in fact they only have a one-time shagging based on an inopportune occasion, Sandy is given the cold shoulder whenever Julie is available for him. However, as a woman, Dorothy, she not only has to keep an eye on her leery co-star, the old goat John Van Horn (Gaynes), as her attachment with Julie becomes stronger, she accidentally becomes the apple-of-the-eye of Julie's widower father Les (Durning), who is somehow convinced Dorothy should be Julie's new mom. You see, as a woman, Dorothy not only being objectified for her sex appeal (truth to be told, Hoffman's female outlook does look superior to his normal bearing), more reassuringly she is also courted as a true lady for a serious marriage, which creatively justifies the dual standards in the present man's world (although this film is made 33 years ago), it is a farce for sure, but it is a revealing one. Apart from the accomplishments of the make-up and costume sections, Hoffman's performance is terrific, the tricky part is his voice changeover since it is so dialog-ridden, Dorothy has an old-maidish front but inside she is quintessentially a feminist cannot tolerate women being bullied, belittled or indulging themselves in self-pity, that's why she is one-of-a-kind and so riveting to watch on screen. Hoffman's acting is wholesomely fluid, our laughter is being accordingly induced up until the premeditated big reveal - again the script rounds up a pragmatic scenario for Dorothy to perform the live act - it is a cliché, but indeed a perfectly engineered one.Lange is also letting out her impactful presence in a less demanding role, Julie is that kind of pretty girl with a degree of integrity, often curbed by her own indecisiveness, and needs a little extra push to find her self-worth, she is always on the rational side of the line, by contrast, Garr (also Oscar-nominated, but criminally lost to Lange in an unfair game), brings about an adorable and spontaneous adroitness as an excellent comedienne, her Sandy is the irrational type of gal often being exploited by men for her kindness and innocuousness, Garr pushes the limit in her well-timed fit of rage sprinkled with just-right-amount-of mockery, in a perfect world, Michael should have ended up with her. Bill Murray is knowingly not billed in the opening credit, but as Michael's roomie, he has a medium-sized role to balance out Hoffman's edginess with deadpan drollness and occasional wisecrack. Two veterans Gaynes and Durning, both manifest their caricatural segments at full throttle. All in all, it is just a brilliantly made comedy, TOOTSIE stands tall among director Pollock's otherwise patchy filmography!",Tootsie

41,sddavis63,A Seriously Good Comedy,8,12 July 2013,"Without any doubt, I would have to rank this as one of Dustin Hoffman's best movies. He plays, in essence, two characters - or, really, one character who is both the character and another character. And the issue is that the other character the character is playing is a woman. And Hoffman pulls it off brilliantly. Both as Michael Dorsey and as Dorothy Michaels, he never misses a beat in his performance, and he's completely believable.As Michael, Hoffman is an unemployed, struggling actor who can't find work and ends up working as a waiter - which is probably not unlike what happens to a lot of actors. But then, needing money to help a friend finance a play that he's going to star in, Michael stumbles upon an opportunity to be in a soap opera. The catch? The part is for a woman. So he disguises himself as Dorothy (Hoffman can be surprisingly convincing as a woman) and he gets the part, but it spins totally out of control. Dorothy becomes a huge star, and what was supposed to be just a limited and minor role becomes his life. In the midst of the situation, Michael falls in love with his female co-star Julie (Jessica Lange) - but because she knows him as Dorothy, Julie can't be anything other than his (or her) best friend. But, after being invited to spend a weekend at Julie's family's farm, Julie's widowed father (Charles Durning) falls in love with Dorothy - a relationship Dorothy can't reciprocate because she's actually a man. In the meantime, Michael's friends Sandy (Teri Garr) and Jeff (Bill Murray) get drawn into the situation in different ways, and his lecherous soap co-star John Van Horn (George Gaynes) decides that he wants Dorothy. In a way it's all quite straightforward and yet it's wonderfully bewildering at the same time.The two hours moves by quickly, and the movie is fun. You never lose interest, you chuckle (and sympathize) with some of the situations all the characters find themselves in, and you wonder how Michael is going to get out of this unexpected stardom that he wanted - except that he wanted it as himself, not as Dorothy. Definitely a strong 80's movie, and one of Hoffman's best. (8/10)",Tootsie
42,thesar-2,"No Doubt, the Original Fire",9,23 August 2015,"Sophia was in this, too?? Wow. Everyone wanted a piece of Dorothy. I remember when I was young and this was playing on T.V. When ""Dorothy"" walked down the steps in the finale (no spoilers) my dad busted a gut. I didn't understand the film that much, but got the gist. I just know I loved it when my dad was so happy. Nowas an adult, this movie equally makes me happy.Almost thirty-three years after its release, Tootsie hold up and true. Absolutely hilarious, the right amount of montages and exposition, nice romance and performances out of this world – in front of, behind and again, in front of the cameras. The fact that this movie that includes one of the best movie songs of all time (It Must Be You by Stephen Bishop,) was so horribly all-but snubbed at the Oscars for so many awards, it proves some crimes go unpunished.Practically everything worked here, including, but not exclusively Dustin Hoffman. It's a wonderful film that brings up issues (of 1982ish and beyond) and never asks us to take them too seriously. Likewise, this plus the two years prior Nine to Five would make a perfect double feature.I loved this movie. No matter how many times I see it, I laugh and in the end tear up. And the entire Dorothy/Michael may/may not be gay/lesbian dialogue is not just priceless, but one of the best in film history. I actually put that clip on my (1990s) answering machine once. My mom did NOT appreciate that.I know more people appreciate Mrs. Doubtfire, and I love that movie too. But, see the movie that took the risks first and is probably 5x the movie the Robin Williams drag-for-hire take was. * * *Final thoughts: If I could ""choose"" my lifestyle, I would certainly chase after Jessica Lange. I've always had a major girl-crush on that graceful woman. From this to American Horror Storythat woman is sex. (Just don't tell the Gay Council I said that..)",Tootsie
43,Robert_duder,A lot of anticipation for a film I thought was...just good.,7,10 March 2014,"I love Dustin Hoffman, he is a master of his craft and easily one of the best actors in history. I don't know how I managed to never see Tootsie until this afternoon at a Classic Cinema presentation at our local theatre. I was very excited to see it! Now please don't get me wrong, I enjoyed Tootsie but it was the furthest thing from flooring me. I thought it was a decent film, a representation of its times (early 80's) and the pacing of the film felt a little off to me at times. Now I am the last person to trash a film that is absolutely considered a classic and beloved by millions so I won't do that. Tootsie is a good film. I just failed to see it as a great one. I suppose if I had seen it sooner than I did I would see the social commentary aspect as more important. There are some genuinely funny moments, and some iconic lines that are well deserving of their status. It wasn't until after I had seen the film that I read which lines were considering ""iconic"" and yet as soon as I heard them in the movie I knew there was something special about them. The chemistry with the cast was good and Hoffman's performance is excellent and yet I still felt like certain parts of the film dragged and even stumbled more than it should have.This is Dustin Hoffman doing what he does best. He completely becomes this character both as struggling actor Michael Dorsey and then of course as the legendary Dorothy Michaels or ""Tootsie."" Hoffman really is a complete ass and sort of irritatingly pompous as Dorsey and because of that you see the complete change he does as Dorothy. Most importantly he truly is believable as a woman and that's the heart and soul of this film. Jessica Lange is stunningly beautiful and in a subtle role is excellent as the successful actress struggling to make her personal life work. Her and Hoffman have great chemistry and she is good enough that her character grows on you as you learn more about her. Teri Garr is an interesting character because she is a complete mess. She is manic and over the top and her character is sort of pointless and you just constantly feel terrible for her. Hoffman really does treat her like crap. There is no particular development or arc to her character but that's not a reflection of her performance because she is good. Bill Murray is also very good as Hoffman's roommate and best friend. Murray is very often Murray in his scenes but that is what we want from him. He is definitely sidekick to Hoffman but it works very well. I was very impressed with the supporting cast of this film. Every face nearly was familiar. Truly great performances from Dabney Coleman, Charles Durning, George Gaynes and Geena Davis. Also the director Sydney Pollack. Easily some of the best scenes in this film are the often fiery confrontations between Hoffman and Pollack (which allegedly were more real than staged.) Their chemistry is epic and some of the best dialogue is done in their scenes together.Pollack really does craft a great story. Obviously because the film is without a doubt a classic. I think perhaps the film was victim to my extremely high expectations so I was less than amazed by the film. I found some of the relationships a little drawn out and the comedy is definitely overshadowed by a dark undertone. With any film like this the build up to the reveal is a big part of the movie and when Hoffman confesses what he has done to everyone it is definitely memorable and one of the great scenes in the film. I don't know why I didn't ""love"" it but don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it and thought certain aspects of the film were very near brilliant but other little things dragged it down just a little. Regardless of what I say, this film is a hands down classic and a must see. You will have your own opinions on it bad or good. This was just my Tootsie experience. Perhaps it will grow on me even more in future viewings. 7.5/10",Tootsie
44,ElMaruecan82,It Really Takes Balls to be a Woman ...,10,19 July 2011,"""I was a better man with you, as a woman... than I ever was with a woman, as a man."" This impenetrable quote should be the movie's tag-line.There's a moment when Jessica Lange mentions how it's ""complicated"" to be a woman in the 80's. This summarizes Dustin Hoffman's realization in the film, but the real challenge is to make first a convincing woman out of Dustin Hoffman, not a drag with a falsetto voice, but an attractive woman, as far as you can pull back your camera. And God, not only he's totally believable, but it's also one of the greatest performances by an actor, as a male character Michael Dorsey, playing a woman, Dorothy Michaels, and this woman playing a TV soap character, Emily Kimberley.That would undermined the credibility of the film, even for a screwball comedy, if the main character wasn't an excellent actor. Through this convenient plot device, we can believe that Michael is so good, he can play even better than a woman. In a scene where he rehearses with his friend, Teri Garr as Sandy, for the role he would ultimately play, she admits ""I can't be as good as you"" while the tactfully edited opening credits sequences proved how the man's ego and temper were the major obstacles for his career.When you look at the AFI's Top 100 comedies, you find ""Some Like it Hot"" at the top, followed by ""Tootsie"". but cross-dressing is not the theme that would systematically make a great comedy work, and ""Tootsie"" would have never had the same success and appeal if it was a 80's version of Wilder's classic. Interestingly, both are rarely compared, ""Tootsie"" stands on its own because contrarily to its gloriously screwball predecessor, it relies on a realism that makes slapstick even more irresistible, and a sincere sensitivity while the movie tackles more serious issues.The realism is indeed the key element, because we laugh at the situations, not the characters. When Michael as Dorothy meets the director of the TV soap, Ron, played by Dabney Coleman, and he immediately dismisses her because of a too gentile appearance, we have a first glimpse on how it feels to be like a woman, treated with this condescending smoothness. And Michael's improvised reaction is incredibly authentic in its defensiveness, and ironically got him right into the character, Emily Kimberley, a woman treated by Dr. Brewster, George Gaynes (as John Van Horn) like Dorothy by Ron. No wonder he became a feminist icon, he was literally a woman with balls.The actors' world setting is perfect to give an authentic flavor to all the zaniness. ""You were a tomato, a tomato doesn't have logic, a tomato can't move!"" This hilarious line shouted by an angry George Fields, Michael's agent played by an excellent Sidney Pollack, is surrealistic but I'm sure this kind of dialog would be plausible between an actor and his agent. Pollack isn't a comedic director but when you think of it, nothing is funnier than serious people facing funny situations. When Michael as Dorothy sees Geena Davis's tits hitting him right in the face; we can imagine his surprise as a man, and the next hilarious slip of the tongue. When he yells for the taxi, and his voice is too high, he uses his man's voice. And the realism of the film is enriched by the friendship growing between Dorothy and Julie. There is an inner tenderness in Jessica Lange as she really provides the love involvement that would develop Michael's character whose disguise was the only way to reach Julie. As a man, he tried, and he got quite a wet treatment.""Tootsie"" is a characters' films, on the scene-stealing department, Michael's irresistible roommate, Bill Murray as Jeff Slater, who improvised all his lines, for our greatest delight. There is absolutely no line he doesn't deliver that is not hilarious, either its from its nonsensical absurdity or hilarious cynicism, Bill Murray is just the spice that gives the film a sort of unique flavor, when it could have been only a romantic comedy. And from the hysterical Sandy, to the sweet and tender Charles Durning as Les, Julie's father who develops a fondness on Dorothy, and Van Horn, who takes Dorothy's resistance as an encouragement to seduce her, each character has one line, one scene, one occasion to shine. And all these misunderstandings lead to one of the most nightmarish episodes where everything gets mixed up, including a tender marriage proposal and an uproarious 'rape' attempt and concluded by Michael explaining to George that Sandy thinks he's gay, and Julie that he's a lesbian.All the comedies have the excuse to be disorganized as long as they make you laugh. ""Tootsie"" is perfectly orchestrated by Sidney Pollack: take the climactic scene, where Michael reveals his identity, the timing, the editing, the build-up conclude in an apotheosis while we've get to watch all the protagonist's reactions. A perfect musicality ending up with the dramatic reaction of Julie, the betrayed one, and his reaction is so brutal, it needed Van Horn asking if ""Jeff knows"" and Michael pushing the pantomime in the scene after.The movie ends with the right tone anyway, with Michael's apology to Les, and then Julie. After delivering the line I mentioned in the top, he concluded it with the most beautiful declaration of love ""the hardest part's done, we were good friends"" and this touches something in Julie's heart, as she wonders if finally, conducted by the beautiful Stephen Bishop's song, 'something's telling her it might be Michael'.""Tootsie"" is the movie I genuinely laughed at as a kid, and after 20 years, I still love the film with all my heart",Tootsie
45,g-bodyl,A Classic Comedy!,9,10 March 2015,"Tootsie is a film that is remarkably ahead of its own time as it deals with issues such as feminism and cross dressing. I also find it an 80's classic that is really funny at times. It also features a poignant story and heartwarming acting. I didn't think this movie would be all that special, but it looks like I was wrong. Dustin Hoffman shows remarkable range as an actor by playing a woman, and he pulls it off big time.Sydney Pollack's film is about an actor named Michael Dorsey who is known for his reputation for being hard to work with. In dire need of money, he accepts a role in a soap opera.....but playing as his opposite gender. Once he is on the show, he is instantly loved but problems arrive when he falls in love with one of the actresses, Julie Nichols.The film has a well-respected cast and they all churn out marvelous performances. Dustin Hoffman simply is amazing as Dorsey/Dorothy. He really pulled off the role of Dorothy and made her role a likable woman. Jessica Lange likewise does an excellent job as Julie, the woman who needs the support of Dorothy. Charles Durning had some great scenes as Julie's father who falls in love with Dorothy. Bill Murray is really funny as Dorsey's roommate. Finally, Teri Garr is funny as Dorsey's other lover. Her monologue with Hoffman is very, very good. Overall, Tootsie is an American comedy classic and one of the best comedies of the 80's. The movie may have themes regarding feminism and women's rights in the entertainment industry, which of course are valid themes. The movie is an unthinkable romance, one that likely took Hollywood by surprise, but in a good way. I had a very good time with the film and I couldn't stop laughing. I also though the ending was one of the sweetest endings I have ever seen. My Grade: A",Tootsie
46,lesleyharris30,"Very Funny and Surprisingly Sweet,",8,14 January 2015,"Tootsie is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and a fantastic cast that succeed in both comedic and dramatic scenes.There are plenty of very funny parts,which is exactly what I expected from a movie were Dustin Hoffman pretends to be a woman to succeed as an actor,but the movie also contains a lot of very sympathetic and dramatic scenes that make us connect and feel for these characters so much more.There is great chemistry between Hoffman and Jessica Lange which is what made this unusual love story so great,you can tell that they loved working together and are both some of the best actors Hollywood has ever been lucky enough to discover.A near perfect mix of both comedy and drama,Tootsie is a very enjoyable movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for either genre. A desperate unemployed actor gets the role of his dreams and instant fame,but no one knows this new female television star is actually a man.Best Performance: Dustin Hoffman",Tootsie
47,Irishchatter,Good film with Hoffman!,8,16 January 2016,"I really thought Dustin Hoffman looked absolutely spot on dressing up as a drag! He actually did look like a woman with a deep voice, you would be mistaken so easily for his alter ego! I say the Drag queen community would have love to see him wear his woman clothes and that way, he would party with them lol! I honestly never knew Bill Murray was his roommate! He really didn't have enough scene's in this film and I think he was still in ""Saturday Night Live"" at the time. I would've loved to have seen him more in the movie, he is just such a legend to be left out!

This is because he makes so many critical comments to the directors of plays, commercials, etc, that he is viewed as a major pain. His agent (Sydney Pollack) can't recommend him for any new project and he urges Michael to get ""some therapy"". Meanwhile, Michael's roommate Jeff (Bill Murray) and his best acting friend, Sandy (Teri Garr) are still in his corner. In fact, Michael is hoping to do a new play by Jeff at a playhouse in upstate New York. But, funds are dry. So, when Sandy tells Michael about a soap opera job she didn't get, Michael decides to ""show the world"" that someone will hire him. Dressing as a woman and calling himself Dorothy Michaels, Dottie lands the soap job. Absolutely no one thinks he is a man, not even a beautiful co-star, Julie (Jessica Lange) who is involved with the jerk director (Dabney Coleman). Making the most of his smaller part, Dorothy is soon so popular that her role becomes much larger. But, because Dottie may be falling in love with Julie and she/he doesn't want to spend the rest of his acting days as a female, just what will Dot do to become Michael again? Then, too, when the truth comes out, will Michael ever act again? Especially tricky is the fact that Julie's father (Charles Durning) is smitten with Dottie! Anyone see fun times ahead? This is a belly-bouncing, thigh-slapping comedy that chases away despair, in a big way. Hoffman, in one of his best roles, is the cat's meow as Dorothy, while Lange, Coleman, Geena Davis, Durning, Garr, Murray and all the rest are mighty fine as well. Naturally, one must applaud the costumes, since Dorothy has a certain look that must be maintained, while the sets, dazzling script and perfectly-timed direction should be praised highly, too. What, you've never seen Tootsie? Don't miss the chance to let go of any and all worldly cares and get it very soon.",Tootsie
49,atlasmb,A Comedy Classic And More,10,1 August 2020,"This film deserves a top score for the performance of Dustin Hoffman alone. But, thankfully, it has so much more to offer.Hoffman plays Michael Dorsey---a New York method actor who cannot dumb down a performance or cheat his craft as he sees it. As a result, he can't land a part. Directors see him as too difficult to work with.Out of desperation, he goes to an audition for a woman's role in a daytime drama. He gets the part and finds that his success leads to many complications, personally and professionally.The deception also has ramifications for him as an individual. Forced to embrace his feminine side, he gains a different perspective.A fine supporting cast and a terrific script make this one of the best comedies of its era. And it manages to include insights and thought-provoking questions about gender that complement the humor. There are many different views on what feminism is, and this film touches on all of them. The viewer can choose to see whatever version he prefers (or none) or he can take a more comprehensive approach, considering all the perspectives in the film and seeking a more reasoned and profound understanding. In the end, the film never advocates for only one view.Not many films can offer romance, comedy, drama, and philosophical inquiry. ""Tootsie"" does it all well.Though the entire cast is wonderful, I feel compelled to single out Charles Durning, who plays the part of a widower with sensitivity and layers of emotion.",Tootsie

""Tootsie"" is a modern screwball and romantic comedy, and at the same time a satire of sexism and the world of the entertainment industry. It is based largely on excellent dialogue and intelligent humor, but it has its moments of slapstick and a few scenes that made me laugh to tears. If ten Oscar nominations and names like Jessica Lange, Bill Murray, Sydney Pollack, George Gaynes, and Geena Davis don't tell you enough, I'll also say that Dustin Hoffman's Dorothy Michaels stands side by side with Robin Williams' Mrs. Doubtfire. 9/10.",Tootsie
51,ironhorse_iv,Tootsie was a sweet movie.,7,15 March 2013,"Before Mrs. Doubtfire ever donned a dress, Michael Dorsey (Dustin Hoffman) did. Tootsie was on a popular roll that follow up the same humor as Some Like it Hot (1953). Hoffman does an incredible job as the nervous, slightly overbearing, not-so-slightly arrogant theater teacher Michael Dorsey who is forced into an unbelievable set of circumstances as a result of his rather unorthodox method of finding work. Michael's agent George Fields (movie director Sydney Pollack) can't even get his client a commercial since Michael complained that the tomato he was playing wasn't properly motivated. After screaming at Michael for being so obnoxious, he warns Dorsey that he might never find work as actor again. Dorsey doesn't think so, so when he hears of an opening on a popular Hospital soap opera for a woman role. He applies for the job by posing as 'Miss Dorothy Michaels'. The debut camera shot of Dorothy walking on the New York City's Street is amazing. Michael wins the part and becomes a widely known popular actress due to Michael acting out his character as a feisty, feminist administrator, which surprises the other actors and crew who expected her to be another swooning female in the plot. While Michael is on the soap, he falls for his co-star Julie (Jessica Lange, in an Oscar-winning performance) but, as Dorothy, is courted by Julie's widowed father (Charles Durning). The vocal exchange between Charles and Dustin is just funny as hell in the film. Michael ultimately finds that his disguise as a woman has made him a better man when dealing with women, due to quickly learning a little about what life is like for the opposite sex. The movie has this great message about gender equality in its humor. Still, he cannot hide in the role any longer. Michael must finds a clever way to extricate his character before he lose Julie's love forever. The final scene with Dorothy is funny and need to be watch. Yes, it's truly a nutty hospital. Tootsie's gender bending premise was great. The movie work with all the main leads, and support by memorable comic performances from Dabney Coleman, Teri Garr, George Gaynes, and Bill Murray. Also the movie makes the film debut of future Oscar winner Geena Davis. ""It Might Be You,"" sung by singer Stephen Bishop was a work of genius. I also like to mention Metamorphosis Blues by Dave Grusin being a great song in the film as well. I love how they were trying to avoid writing a farce while making the film, but still at 116 minutes Tootsie is simply too long to support its one gag; Hoffman as a woman. While the movie offers its share of amusing moments, it eventually wears out its welcome and emerges as a fairly forgettable. Dustin Hoffman's acting as Dorothy can be a bit over acting. While I don't know if it's on purpose or not. It get kind of annoying hearing a cheat mocking Southern accent from him. Some homosexuals might find the movie a bit offending or degrading. The reason for this is because of movies with male cross dressing tend to be comical or mock about. Also straights being confront by homosexual acts in film tend to be funny. Not only homosexuals, but women can find this movie a bit offended as the movie is saying that strong independent women have to be manly. Cross dressing for example in comedy usually revolves around caricaturing and making fun of the other sex like women, albeit in a lighthearted way. Still, Tootsie was a pop hit!",Tootsie
52,kenjha,Enjoyable but Preachy,7,8 June 2013,"An unemployed actor goes drag and not only finds work but also becomes a hit on a soap opera. Hoffman is fairly convincing as a woman, but really comes off more as a caricature than a person. Also, given her homely looks, it's hard to believe that men are attracted to her. Although the cross-dressing premise is used to make points about feminism and becoming a better man after walking in a woman's shoes, the film tends to be a bit preachy in doing so.

53,The-Sarkologist,This story simply does not work any more,4,21 December 2013,"Back when this was made, there was probably something funny about a man dressing up as a woman, but now it is not an uncommon occurrence, that a movie like this, to me, comes across more boring than funny.The story is that an actor is having so much trouble getting a job that he decides that he will pretend to be a woman and become an actor that way. The thing is that the reason he is having problems getting work is that he is simply way to difficult to work with, doesn't bring in the money, and basically is one big pain in the butt. Also, the way he treats the girl that he takes to bed (simply so that nobody, other than his flatmate, knows that he is the woman) is far less than honourable.I guess the comedy is supposed to be in the fact that people are treating him like a woman and don't know that in reality he is a man. In a sense, his characters are quite similar, both Micheal Dorsey and Dorothy Micheals. Micheal has practically ostracised himself from the entertainment industry with his attitude, while Dorothy gets away with saying and doing what she does simply because she is a woman.I guess this movie irritated me, especially at the end where they wind it up far too quickly. After revealing that he actually made a fool of everybody he worked with, and of Julie's father, he is simply able to make up with them all too conveniently. Most people, especially somebody in the shoes of Julie's father, would be so ashamed and embarrassed as to what happened, that upon seeing them again, they would be flattened. Julie also caves in a bit to quickly for my liking.The critics praised this film as being a masterpiece and a work of literature. I label it a potential garbage. Sure Bill Murray and Dustin Hoffman were good actors, and Dorsey's sexual identity was supposed to be confusing, but for what he did, he seemed to get off way to lightly, and it seemed that he was very easily able to uphold the façade, and then able to remove it at his own timing when things started to get a little hot. The critics praised it for its ingenuity, but when one considers that women are from Venus while men are from Mars, I find it quite unbelievable that a man, even a trained actor, could pull off such a stunt so successfully.",Tootsie
54,slightlymad22,More To This Than Just Hoffman In Drag,7,6 January 2015,"There is so much more to this film than Dustin Hoffman running around in a dressed like a woman. Tootsie is one of the most intelligent comedies It is perfectly cast and full of surprises.Plot In A Paragraph: Dustin Hoffman plays Michael Dorsey. He knows everything about acting except how to get employed as an actor. We see him auditioning for numerous jobs where he is either too old, too young, too tall, too short, simply not the right guy for the part, or in some cases impossible to work with. We also see him teaching some young wannabe actors, and working at a restaurant to pay the bills. After his agent says ""No one will hire you!"" The very next shot has Hoffman in drag walking down the street to an audition for a soap opera part his friend (Terri Garr) was unable to land. Hoffman lands the part, and is soon winning over fans all over the country.Hoffman should be very proud of his work here, as should Garr and Jessica Lange (but I was surprised she got an Oscar for this) Charles Durning was a delight here (He always is) George Gaynes is a lot of fun and Geena Davis shines in her first movie. I didn't even know the brilliant Bill Murray was in this, and whilst browsing the trivia section on here it states that he agreed to omit his name from the opening credits to prevent audiences expecting a ""Bill Murray movie£ along the lines of 'Meatballs' or 'Caddyshack'",Tootsie
55,sol-,My brief review of the film,7,5 February 2005,"A funny film with some things to say in terms of relationships, it is nevertheless predictable with a capital P, taking a very familiar concept, and using the familiar clichés. But for all the film's problems, it is at least well acted by Dustin Hoffman, both in and out of costume, and the film's director, Sydney Pollack, who has a great supporting role. Jessica Lange won the 1982 Best Supporting Actress Academy Award for her role, and Teri Garr was nominated, but it is only really Hoffman and Pollack who actually stand out in this enjoyable and rather well made, but ultimately far off being perfect, or special, film.",Tootsie

It was really a place in where the small, tenacious nobody could become famous and successful by working hard! Trying to find characters like that today is like hoping for a swimming pool in the desert! Next, the movie asks the question of gender and the answer it gives is surprising as it seems to say that a gender is a visual identity: if you are dressed like a woman, so you are a woman! Around those notions, the movie have a good fun when Dustin has romances being a woman and being a man as well! His acting is very good and predates Robin as Miss Doubtfire: Being the same generation with Pacino, Dustin has his features to be more playful . Here he has as well a strong support with Jessica Lange, Geena Davis, Bill Murray and the late Charles During (for me, seen in « home for the holidays », « dick Tracy », « Etoile », « dog day afternoon »).

59,SAMTHEBESTEST,An overrated comedy that lost the practicality even in cinematic liberty.,5,30 November 2020,"Tootsie (1982) :
Brief Review -An overrated comedy that lost the practicality even in cinematic liberty. Tootsie is the same idea taken from Billy Wilder's Classic comedy 'Some Like It Hot' with little changes here and there. A struggling actor disguises himself as a female actor and finds the success he was looking for. In this scam those expected turn arounds like him falling in love with a girl, other men falling in love with her and then inner confusion spoiling the actual life of him are followed. This was a great idea actually and by the halfway point it was looking interesting and funny too. But then after the first half it lost all the practical senses and literally drowned the good script. The man is dating a girl he knows for 6 years, they had sex (god knows why, they didn't do it for 6 years but one day all of sudden they did it) falls in love with a girl who has a child (don't know whose) and she is involved with the pervy director and then he's the one who acts fair in front of girl. The height of rubbishness is the same guy is furious about the director having other affairs, while he's the one who is cheating a girl. I am not getting too deep, i could tear apart many scenes like this and explain how they did not make sense but i don't wanna give spoilers. Like i said the idea was great it was shaping very well then some impractical scenes during the show which was meant to be a big hit, like how did they cut it or show it on tv, or what did actually happen to the show and the rating after the big surprise was over and all that, it all remained unanswered and incomplete. The only watchable performance in the film is given by Dustin Hoffman, rest are okay. Sydney Pollack stumbled while directing this one as many scenes were shot roughly, thoughtlessly and bleakly. It could be a fault of writing maybe. Overall, a decent flick but looking at commercial success it's highly overrated. Even Hollywood goes wrong some times, it's no big deal.RATING - 5/10*",Tootsie
60,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Hoffman makes ""Tootsie"" an original cross-dressing classic",7,19 December 2008,"Men playing women is far from unheard of in film and especially the theater, so why does ""Tootsie"" feel so original? Perhaps it's the fact that based on the plot, it's intended to be deceptive cross-dressing, or maybe it's simply because Dustin Hoffman is such a prominent male actor that it gave the concept a renewed intrigue. Either way, there's no doubt that ""Tootsie"" played a role in redefining character acting in movies.The film stars Hoffman as Michael Dorsey, an actor who has been out of work and according to his agent, played by the film's director Sydney Pollack, is impossible to work with. To prove everyone wrong, he takes on the guise of Dorothy Michaels and lands a part on a daytime soap opera. Not only does being a woman change Michael's perspective, but he also happens to fall for the show's leading lady (Jessica Lange).Hoffman truly steals this film. He's incredibly convincing as Dorothy while also nailing the ignorant, conceited fool that is Michael. While the script could better show how his dual life changes his perspective as a man, Hoffman makes the most out of it. His versatility is astounding. ""Tootsie"" also brags an impressive supporting cast that aside from Oscar- winning Lange includes Bill Murray as Michael's odd roommate, Charles Durning and Teri Garr.As a comedy, ""Tootsie"" is not exactly laugh-out-loud funny. There are some classic lines, but most of the jokes comes from the plot itself and how the events unfold. As a drama, it sort of acts as the first film to make feminism a central theme. The goal of the film in one sense is sort of to address feminism, or at least what at the time was sort of the growing movement among women to claim back their independence and womanhood. By creating a character who is a man both literally and figuratively walking in a woman's shoes and surrounding him with a couple women characters struggling with their independence, the writers have set up an interesting perspective for audiences to look at the differences between men and women. Seeing men hit on Dorothy not knowing she's a man is humorous but also eye-opening.On the comedy/drama spectrum, ""Tootsie"" might clearly belong on the comedy side, but neither aspect of the film is too extreme. It's a comedy that tries to reveal some of the most basic struggles that people in the working world deal with every day that often aren't at the center of attention in both our lives and on the silver screen.",Tootsie

62,imseeg,Dustin Hoffman is a better man being dressed as a woman.,9,15 April 2018,"A male actor dresses up as a woman to get rid of his bad reputation in the movie world in order to get out of unemployment. Will he pull this trick off? That's the story of ""Tootsie"". Sounds silly, but it is hilarious.I remember that I saw it first back in the eighties and it was a huge box office hit then. I loved it, but thought of it as just a feelgood comedy. There is much more to this extraordinary script though. I have seen it over 10 times now and this picture is truly a great comedy classic, because after decades this movie still stands the test of time: it's got tremendously witty dialogues and has got just the right balance between over the top humor and serious acting.Director Sydney Pollack commented ""No one ever laughed during the shooting of any scenes of the film. It's only funny because of its story structure.""The actors are all to die for! What a cast: Dustin Hoffman, Jessica Lange, Bill Murray, Terri Garr. Those two last named actors came straight from a line of other comedies. Hoffman and Lange however were only known for their more serious roles. To indicate how seriously Dustin Hoffman took his role as dressing up as a woman, he made several appearances in real life to check out if people actually believed he was a woman. He passed with flying colors at his daughter's school and also during a raunchy encounter with actor jose ferrer in an elevator. (for more fun anecdotes check ""Trivia"" in the imdb menu) The director Sidney Pollack was at his peak of his carreer and plays a cameo role in his own movie as a grumpy movie agent. Amost all of Sidney Pollack's movies have won numerous oscars, ""Out of Africa"" is best known.His movies really stand out and ""Tootsie"" does so as well ! (By the way checkout the metacritics rating which scored 87 points which is much higher than the imdb score).""Tootsie"" is really hilarious. And I mean REALLY hilariously funny. And it has got some lighthearted romance as well. The very well scripted story and the serious quality acting gives the movie the structure and believability which makes it rise out far above any other average comedy. For all of those too young to have ever seen it, please try it out, it is truly a lovely, witty, surprising and endearing modern comedy. Kids would love it. Adults would love it. Anybody would melt for the charming humor of ""Tootsie"". I feel so good having watched it for the 11th time...",Tootsie
63,jzappa,A Plainly Commercial Sitcom Exercise in Star Ego and Basically Juvenile Clowning,7,21 October 2010,"When the AFI released their list of the 100 Funniest American Films long ago now, two cross-dressing comedies, Some Like It Hot and Tootsie, ranked at the top. Funny is a wholly biased term though, so I don't especially resent the organization's pick. I never have had much conviction in honors granted by committee, as the broadest, most mainstream films viable are inclined be awarded, as the Oscars reliably demonstrate. Nevertheless, I don't think that I would be able to provide a sure response to the question asked by the survey. Even some of my favorite comedies wouldn't truly meet the criteria as funniest.Tootsie rests on an actor that's so tarnished for his fastidiousness that he gets black-flagged. The film puts him into women's attire with much less complaint than Some Like It Hot does, fortunately, but once he's disguised as a woman, no genuine comic dilemmas are produced. He develops an acquaintance in his masquerade with his female co-star, and, unsurprisingly, grows to love her. In chorus, he acquires the admiration of his co-star's father, and a national viewing audience. The film doesn't appear to be much involved with Hoffman's gender swap past the detail that it inhibits his relationship with Lange's character. The political principles of the film appear to be somewhat misaligned, too. The interpretation of Dorothy seems to imply that an empowered woman is on some level behaving as a man beneath her feminine pretense. The film seems somewhat homophobic too. Much of the intended hilarity surfaces when men are made to unsuspectingly kiss another man. Scandalous.The main thing is that it's not that funny. It handles its peak comic appeal when it works at its simplest level, but continuously manages to elaborate on its laugh cues for too long. It entertains through merely showing its lanky male lead as he uncomfortably moves about in women's outfits. It's disappointing that the director of They Shoot Horses, Don't They? felt it essential to make a significant film about such an ultimately childish subject. Maybe that's why the proceedings feel strained.Sydney Pollack was a straightforwardly commercial director who was happily a part of the mainstream for most of his career behind the camera, unlike such contemporaries as Sidney Lumet and Woody Allen. He worked in staple genres, this time the classic, star-studded Hollywood comedy. And as a Pollack film, there is strong acting all around. But save for Charles Durning, playing the mistaken father of Lange, who plays a stereotype with such unforced straightforwardness that she nearly steals the film, and Murray, who does steal the film, the remainder of the cast, while not deficient in comic energy, gets nothing particularly funny to say or do.One of the more engaging elements of Tootsie is that the middle-aged actress is able to hold most of her own scenes as herself, even if she weren't a man's disguise. The male actor under the dress discovers to his curiosity and ultimate panic that Dorothy begins to take on a life of her own. Although his rise to fame as Dorothy Michaels is shockingly instantaneous at the same time his personal relationships become a minefield, I'll concede that Tootsie has a lot of fun with its plot hurtles. We get just about every likely variation on the premise of mistaken gender identities. The movie also manages to make some blithe but well-aimed notes about chauvinism. It also nudges satirically at soap operas, New York show business agents and the Manhattan social ladder. But all in all, it's just a sitcom ode to the Hoffman ego. Like Hoffman in drag, it doesn't look at itself very carefully. Instead of meeting what it sets up head-on, it takes the one joke and runs, till it runs out of steam. Paging Billy Wilder.",Tootsie
64,videorama-759-859391,83's big hit comedy surprise,9,27 January 2016,"Like Birdman, if you're an actor, or more correctly, an out of work actor, you'll truly identify with this movie. Straight down the line, Tootsie is constructed brilliantly. I loved this movie, ever since I saw it, when verging on 13. Hoffman, an actor's actor, is wonderful, parading as an old woman on a soap, called Mass General. His character, Michael Dorsey, is an out of work actor, desperate for work. And why? Cause he's a difficult actor. No one will work with him. He had even argued over a tomato, having feelings. Hey, I've been there where Michael was, but luckily, on a much smaller degree. Michael is a good actor, where in a very smart opening of shots, we see the pitfalls of going to auditions. ""You're too tall, you're not exactly what we're looking for"". Never more true. The wonderful, and beautifully crafted script, the writer has really honed in here on what it's like, and what it takes if you really wanna crack it. To make matters worse, Michael has of course, fallen in love with a co actress, Julie (Lang, wonderful of course) so of course, you're waiting for the fireworks, to inevitably ensue, and it's a killer comic moment. As shown in Mrs Doubtfire that came out a decade later, complications arise and as Hoffman's roommate, Bill Murray is a hoot, playing it deadpan, in wonderful Murray style, while Dabney Coleman, as the sleazy smooth director, doing every woman on the show is great. Although it doesn't have the best of endings, Tootsie is an honor to watch, where Dorothy's wine red glitzy dress, and that march pose, has created another legendary character. Seeing Geena Davis in bra and panties is truly an honor as well. Excellent.",Tootsie

This movie has an all star cast, a very excellent plot, and a very surprising twist. I think out of all the movies where men disguise themselves as women, this movie is the tops. Dustin Hoffman as Michael Dorsey AND Dorothy Michaels. This is hilarious as it would get. Hoffman in my opinion was the best woman in any movie. he looks great in any movie perhaps. Sharing a room with Geena Davis would be nerve-racking. Both feeling would come to mind. being aroused and nervous at the same time. Watch it1 Don't blow the cover. Teri Garr is always great in any movie. Playing the sad sack actress and girlfriend of Dorsey. I would say, ""Get a Life woman"", ""you're making me look down at ya!"" This is a movie I can really relate to. Being from New York is really a no brainer, but it's good to reminisce those times being there. Fooling everyone is a crime, getting away with is sometimes worth it, but when the scheme goes too far, there are consequences. At least Dorsey got himself a new girl.

67,bsmith5552,Tales of Hoffman!,8,9 January 2020,"Some would say that Dustin Hoffman's characters in ""Tootsie"" closely resembles his real life persona. Hoffman has always been difficult to work with and seemingly is never satisfied with a script as written.

His beleaguered agent George Fields (Sydney Pollock) tells him that no one in town will hire him because of his ""attitude"".Dorsey wants to raise $8,000 to produce a play by his roommate Jeff (an unbilled Bill Murray) and have his girlfriend Sandy (Terri Garr).

As Dorothy Michaels, he land a job on a network soap opera as a Hospital Administrator.Dorothy is paired up in a dressing room with the voluptuous April (Geena Davis in her first role). Michael as Dorothy has an eye for fellow cast member Julie (Jessica Lange) but is unable to express his true feelings. She meanwhile is involved with the show's director Ron (Dabney Coleman). An over the hill actor, John Van Horn (George Gaynes) has the hots for Dorothy.

The clashes between him and Hoffman mirrored their real life relationship such that Pollock never directed Hoffman in a film again. Bill Murray, whose dialogue was largely improvised, chose not to receive billing over the credits in order not to detract from Hoffman's performance.Geena Davis in bra and panties made an immediate impression and was off to a roaring start to her career.

After trying & failing to help a female friend secure an acting role Michael (out of desperation) decides he will apply for the role himself even if that means he has to pretend to be female...Despite the fact that Dorsey is painted as being somewhat objectionable I never quite saw him in this light; he was more the sort of person who would question/challenge something if he didn't understand/agree with what was being asked of him - this is something I can personally relate to as it's the sort of thing I'd do (although I'm not an actor of any description I hasten to add). Does Dorsey deserve the harsh treatment that has been levied on him? Possibly not, but I can fully see this as being an insight into how some actors may be treated and possibly exams the rocky road some may face on their way to stardom. It's actually interesting because Hoffman and director Sydney Pollack frequently disagreed whilst this film was being made so a lot of their angst seemed to have been channelled in their performances.That being said, outside of all this, Tootsie is a really good film. One of its strengths was in the way that Dorothy's character was handled; in his role as Dorothy Michael suddenly becomes things that he's never been before - he's become both popular and a household name. He has to ward off unwanted advances from his co-star and his co-star's father whom of course don't realise that he is a man in drag as well as having to try and suppress his feelings for his female co-star who doesn't realise that Dorothy is a man. All of this is handled with sensitivity and the main focus of the film actually sees Michael using Dorothy as a platform to become a better person whereas in the early stages she was his ticket to stardom. Tootsie has its funny moments, but the film earns a lot of its laughs honestly rather than cheaply (Tootsie's ingenious way of preventing her male co-star from kissing her was one such moment).Jessica Lange won the Best Supporting Actress for her role in this film, but Dustin Hoffman is the real star of the show here. What really sold me with his performance here is that with Michael and Dorothy Hoffman managed to create 2 completely separate characters and at times I almost forgot that I was watching the same person. Of course, some credit is owed to the director, writers and make-up department, but Hoffman was the tour-de-force here. Terri Garr is on hand to provide some of the laughs and she too puts in a good performance (even if she was just Dorsey's bit on the side for much of the running time). As Dorsey's friend Jeff Bill Murray is not given an awful lot to do and his contribution here is barely memorable.It's been nearly 10 years since I last watched Tootsie and I seem to remember finding the film funnier when I last watched it. Having said that the film does still have its fair share of laughs, but it does become more dramatic in its second half when Michael begins to have long-term concerns about his new role and as his love for Julie continues to grow.Still, Tootsie is heart-warming, funny, likeable and it manages to do all of this without ever feeling cheap or crass which just goes to show the strength of the writing and directing in this picture.",Tootsie

Tootsie's feminism is equivalent to Avatar's respect for native culture.Now, it wasn't just Hoffman that made this picture great. The cast also included Jessica Lange, Teri Garr, Dabney Coleman, Charles Durning, and Bill Murray. Lange won an Oscar. Hoffman and Garr were nominated.Has anything changed in the intervening 31 years? Just tune in next year to the Super Bowl to find out. Super Bowl commercials too often opt for sexual objectification in place of a clever idea, with negative results for both men and women. Many of the commercials objectifying women are not particularly flattering to men either, portraying them as mindless, gullible and sex-obsessed.But, they are STILL objectifying women. We have a long way to go, baby.",Tootsie

Oh and Bill Murray is in it too!",Tootsie
81,Movie-ManDan,One of the Top Movies of Its Kind.,10,2 October 2015,"Tootsie may be one of the best comedies ever made. There's many hilarious iconic scenes that are just perfect. But what makes this the timeless hit is the stuff other than the humour. The comedy is laugh-out-loud and the other stuff has a lasting impact.In one Dustin Hoffman's finest roles, he plays a talented actor from New York named Michael Dorsey who is still looking for his big break. The problem is he is very mean and nobody will work with him. Desperate for money, he transforms himself into a woman named Dorothy Michaels and lands a leading role in a soap opera. Dorothy becomes an international success and influence on woman across America. As a gender-bending comedy, there's some funny scenes where he struggles to changes sexes. But the serious factor is really what separates this from other gender-bending films like Mrs. Doubtfire and Some Like it Hot. As Michael tries to keep his real identity under wraps, he gets a chance to see what life is like as a woman in the early 80s. That affects his relationship with his girlfriend (Garr) and co-star (Lange) who he falls for.This is one of the few times where Dustin Hoffman fairly lost an Oscar, which was to Ben Kingsley as Gandhi. If no Gandhi, the gold would have been his. He is so awesome as a talented yet difficult actor and even better when he puts on the dress. This multi-layer portrayal is one of the hardest to do and most entertaining to watch. Dustin Hoffman plays a guy who plays a woman who plays another woman. Most other actor would miss layers to the portrayal. Hoffman also brings layers to each layer of his performance. Each make for one of cinema's most illustrious roles. The love triangle that erupts is also one of the best.Tootsie is the second best gender-bender ever (behind Some Like It Hot). The performances, character development, humour and drama are above all else in its category.4/4",Tootsie
82,nycritic,Masculin/Feminin,10,21 November 2006,"It's been called a one-note joke as well as the best romantic comedy of the Eighties. Sydney Pollack's sharp contemporary comedy about gender-bending in a world that values artificiality struck like lightning at the time of its release. It took the premise started (and hinted) in SOME LIKE IT HOT and ran with it. Dustin Hoffman gives one of his immortal performances as the abrasive Michael Dorsey, a man purportedly based on his younger persona, a virtually unemployable actor who just won't take orders, even when playing a tomato for a commercial. Coming upon a casting advert for a role on a popular soap opera and at the edge of desperation for a job, Michael takes a big leap and decides to apply -- except that the role is meant for a woman. Dressed to the nines as Dorothy Michaels (something of a reverse form of his own name), he manages to win the part (even when it's a guest spot, slated to end after a short appearance). As Dorothy, however, Michael creates a vibrant character and his part is expanded, mainly due to Dorothy's unwillingness to play her role by the rules. Such a bold move -- which includes Michael's disdain for his director (Dabney Coleman) who insists on calling Dorothy ""Tootsie"" -- has raised ratings and thus created a media frenzy over this strangely empowered woman. Julie (Jessica Lange in an equally textured performance), a co-star, becomes Dorothy's friend and confidant.In the meantime, where Dorothy is gaining a cyclonic force, Michael's life is unraveling. His girlfriend Sandy (Teri Garr) suspects Michael may be cheating on her (since he frequently leaves her hanging), another fellow actor, John van Horn (George Gaynes) has the hots for Dorothy, and Julie's father Les (Charles Durning) has also become enamored of her. Sitting quietly by as the madness takes conscious shape is Jeff (Bill Murray), who is seeing Michael taking his role as Dorothy a little too seriously and stressing over what item goes with what in terms of dressing. Virtually every combination of gender confusion is thrown at the viewer, especially in a virtuoso sequence where poor Michael has to all but perform a miracle in order not to become another statistic on the front page of the New York Post, but when his contract becomes extended indefinitely, he decides he has to take matters into his own hands if he is to have his own life as a man.TOOTSIE is, plain and simple, excellent. It takes its subject matter seriously. Hoffman doesn't play the role like a man playing a woman but a man learning to be a woman and thusly, understanding how they tick, but using his natural abrasiveness to create an assertive female in a world that tends to treat women (like Julie) as submissive objects. His performance is so spot-on that it's no wonder the men in the movie fall for Dorothy: he inhabits Dorothy down to her vaguely Southern mannerisms and ante-bellum decorum. Just watch the montage in which Dorothy, now a media sensation, is being photographed in an assortment of outfits. It's what today's premiere drag performer Charles Busch would also do in his performances: use the nuances of a strong yet feminine energy to its fullest advantage. (As a matter of fact, Charles Busch himself would play a variation of the Michael Dorsey role in a soap opera.) TOOTSIE is a tour-de-force of Hoffman's acting as he is in perfect control of his character's duality. One of the premiere examples of gender-bending comedies -- VICTOR/VICTORIA being its feminine counterpart -- this is a movie that paved the way for future incursions into men not just donning women's clothes, but inhabiting a feminine persona. It's extremely sensitive as well: once the climactic sequence takes place and all is revealed, it's a surprise how affecting and emotionally satisfying this movie is.",Tootsie
83,Sergeant_Tibbs,Hoffman and the humour are great but unfortunately Lange and the drama are no match.,7,10 July 2013,"Dustin Hoffman's 80s was surprisingly sparse especially after a busy and successful 70s. Before his longest break from acting and after his first Oscar, he starred in Tootsie and it's the strongest testament to his power as an actor, especially as his character is an actor who takes acting deathly seriously. He drives the film with such powerful energy with his performance having layers of acting upon acting upon acting and pitch perfect delivery in every moment. It's a truly astounding performance and ranks among his best. My favourite of his is his portrayal of Lenny Bruce in Bob Fosse's Lenny which make my top 20 performances of all-time, but Tootsie is an easy number two. This is only my second Sydney Pollack film too, my first being They Shoot Horses Don't They, which is exactly the opposite end of the tonal spectrum so he has an impressive range (and gives an impressive performance as Hoffman's agent here). It's a very witty and sharp film focusing on the comedy before the drama, reminiscent of the His Girl Friday style as well as a very obvious influence, the cross-dressing Some Like It Hot. It's often laugh out loud funny even if there are many moments sacrificed to mere gags rather than jokes which deaden the pace rather than quicken it. The drama isn't as powerful though, partially due to Jessica Lange's character being severely underwritten and not very impressive in general. I have no idea why she won the Oscar (particularly over the more eccentric Teri Garr) as she didn't seem to do enough with the material she was given. It was very pleasant to see Bill Murray and Geena Davis in supporting roles here too, though most of the other characters besides Hoffman feel somewhat one dimensional. Tootsie is a very entertaining (if not powerful) film showcasing an incredible performance, also a great 80s soundtrack of original songs.7/10",Tootsie
84,sme_no_densetsu,A decent comedy but vastly overrated by critics,7,23 November 2008,"""Tootsie"", according to the AFI, is the second best American comedy of all time. At the time of its release, the film was lavished with ten Oscar nominations, virtually unheard of for a comedy. Does the film live up its reputation? I don't think so.For one thing, I just don't think that the film is that funny. Sure, it's funny, to a degree. However, the romantic/dramatic elements of the plot are just as prominent, if not moreso. Also, I find that this is a film that is preoccupied with a 'message', though at least it isn't delivered heavy-handedly.I see no reason to complain about the acting, though. Dustin Hoffman, in a dual role, delivers the sort of performance upon which his reputation is built. There are some good performances in supporting roles too; notably Teri Garr, Bill Murray, Charles Durning, Dabney Coleman & George Gaynes. Jessica Lange won an Oscar for her role but I didn't think that there was anything special about her performance.Sydney Pollack's direction is solid and keeps things simple. The music, on the other hand, leaves much to be desired. Personally, I can't stand the glossy, commercial eighties sound which the Dave Grusin score typifies. The two original songs don't help matters though the Oscar-nominated hit ""It Might be You"" isn't completely without its charms.In the end, this is a decent romantic comedy but I wouldn't accord it classic status by any means. That being said, there seem to be plenty of folks out there who love this movie, so maybe I represent the minority.",Tootsie
85,bobsgrock,One nutty hospital.,9,21 June 2011,"Tootsie still remains to this day, nearly 30 years later, as one of the funniest and most endearing of American comedies. In many ways, it is like the classic screwball comedies like Bringing Up Baby or His Girl Friday, which combined rapid dialogue with absurd situations to create a story about people whose lives are on the verge of collapsing, causing them to put themselves in impossible circumstances to survive.Beyond the comedic items of cross-dressing and duplicity, there is also great tenderness and decency amongst these characters. The least likable, Michael Dorsey, must undergo the most dramatic change in order to better himself. This gives way to several hilarious moments but also shows how in the modern world men and women have had to meet on a level plane in society. Indeed, an underlying theme of this film is the societal construct men and women have had to deal with and how it would seem that now those roles can either be reversed or discarded. Whether you agree with that or not, there is no denying this is a true statement.Even so, this is a wonderfully entertaining film with a brilliant performance by Dustin Hoffman as the unemployed actor turned woman soap star that holds the film at its center. Supporting him are a beautiful and sweet Jessica Lange, sturdy Sydney Pollack who pulls double duty as the agent and the film's director, and Bill Murray as Michael's roommate whose dead-pan deliveries keep the audience on an even keel so that we have some sense of realism in this crazy story. Nevertheless, all the plot threads come together in a most exciting and funny conclusion along with new insight into how men can be deceitful, women can be self- loathing and both need to compromise. Simple but true, isn't it?",Tootsie
86,ODDBear,Gem of a comedy,9,10 November 2005,"Tootsie is one of these all-too rare comedies; it just never stops being funny, no matter how many times you watch it.Hoffman plays a struggling actor who, in desperation, disguises himself as a woman and gets a part in very popular daytime soap. He succeeds brilliantly and becomes a very prominent public figure, but things get very complicated for him when he falls in love with one of his co-stars who only knows him as a woman (and to top it off, her father falls in love with him, as her...).An incredibly witty script, with an endless number of funny (and quotable) one-liners, a flawless cast, superb direction; Tootsie quite simply has it all. Dustin Hoffman has never been funnier, Bill Murray is a riot as his roommate Jeff, Dabney Coleman is hilarious as Hoffman's boss and complete scene stealer Sidney Pollack (also the film's director) nearly walks off with the movie.The intelligent script is also rich in characterization and is firmly grounded in reality, this never succumbs to slapstick. The film also benefits heavily for using the ""drag thing"" before it became tiresome and ultimately boring and unbelievable (Mrs. Doubtfire springs to mind). Never too sentimental (again, Mrs. Doubtfire...) but always right on the mark, Tootsie is a gem of a comedy that only gets better with age and repeated viewings.",Tootsie
87,sharky_55,I knew there was a reason she didn't like me!,8,11 December 2016,"On Dorothy Michaels' first day, she's asked to do a scene with the shameless womaniser of the show, and cop a kiss from the doctor. Michael reacts instinctively as most straight men would when asked to kiss another man, batting him away with his clipboard. Cut! The scene is a rousing feminist success because of his improvisation, and everyone congratulates him for it. Van Horn does too, and then quick as a flash, he lays on the kiss that he missed when the cameras were rolling, only this time it's with feeling and sincerity, and Michael is so stunned he can barely react. It's funny, but it's also one of the moments of genius in Tootsie. It is here that Michael first discovers how there are two layers of fiction and reality to the struggles of woman in show-business, something he would never ever have encountered as a man. The clipboard might be merely attributed to Michael's innate artistic integrity; he doesn't want his character demeaned and submissive on her debut episode, so he takes it in his own hands to fix the fictional story. This works because it's a natural extension of his snobby, pretentious actor persona, but slowly and surely, he begins to wonder about the larger social issues at stake. The creators of Tootsie could have made a damning, documentary-style expose on the treatment of women in the industry, but that would have been forgotten quickly. They also could have made a straight comedy, and some may see the film as simply that. The strength of Tootsie is how the idea of having to cross-dress to get a role in New York is so silly, but also in how silly that one could change genders and be instantly treated in a completely different manner. A guy who has been chasing and picking up women all his life suddenly has men throwing themselves at him. One uncomfortable moment has Van Horn serenading him outside his apartment late at night, and out of sheer embarrassment Michael invites him up. The thinly veiled threat is mitigated slightly because we know that Michael could probably fend him off, but we also understand how inappropriate this proposition is, and how another woman might not be so lucky to have Bill Murray conveniently interrupt. And what does Van Horn say when Michael calls him out on this? Not sorry, but ""I love the way you never let me get away with anything"", and tries to go in for another kiss. Dorothy's assertiveness is actually being sexualised and used against her! Van Horn treats it as flirtation, and though we laugh, it's also a condemnation of the men who think they can act this way. The surrounding cast are surprisingly complex for a cross-dressing comedy. Perhaps it's because Tootsie doesn't care to delve on the usual messy slapstick shenanigans of keeping up appearances and having to bustle around, constantly switching genders and changing voices. In more recent films like Mrs Doubtfire, White Chicks and She's the Man, the overall intelligence of the characters surrounding the cross-dresser have to be lowered significantly to make the gags work. We can see Dustin Hoffman in almost every shot of Dorothy, but he isn't forced to fumble around and bluff his way into the role. Nor are we treated to the typical process of transformation and assembling the persona - Pollack simply cuts to her striding confidently down the street, and we take it for what it is. The sexist, chauvinist Ron is a requirement for the plot, but there are real life examples of the same personality, so emotionally devoid of empathy or tact when they go to rationalise their cheating and womanising. He acts as a mirror for Michael, who sees a little of himself in Ron, and when he gets a drink thrown in his face, realises that perhaps he isn't all that better of a person. Sandy is another heightened personality; insecure, needy, but self-aware about her plight, awkwardly shoved into a juggling rom-com plot that's below her. She just wants some self-respect and dignity (as an actress those are in short supply), and after being conveniently ignored and treated poorly by Michael, erupts like some shrill caricature of an 80s feminist. Although it's funny, with Teri Garr applying the right amount of lunacy, it also cheapens her character and their long friendship. There are also real people like Les, raised in the country, who see things simply and in broadly defined categories. When he talks about the battles of the sexes, and weaves in his own past experiences into minimising discrimination, we understand that he means well, but lacks the ability to see further than his own perspective of the farm, where there are objective physical measurements to how much someone can lift and work (in the end all it takes is a bit of beer and male bonding to patch things up). Perhaps this has been passed on to her daughter, who is forced into uncomfortable situations weekly because of her gender and knows no other response than to chirpily take it into stride (""I'm the hospital slut.""). Julie's been raised on a brand of traditional femininity, taught to kiss back instead of hitting back, and Lange hides her behind pretty eyes and sad smiles. She's smart enough to call herself out on shirking personal responsibility and not standing up for herself, but doesn't have the confidence to actually go through with it. That is, until she meets Dorothy. Hoffman may be the titular character, but Lange's Julie is the star, asked to carry the huge emotional burden of weighing the value of Dorothy's wisdom and friendship against the betrayal and dishonesty of Michael. The movie is formulaic enough that we see her decision before she makes it. I was expecting her to slowly crack in front of the fumbling Michael, but I was surprised when I found myself smiling along with her.",Tootsie
88,johno-21,Kinda silly but it ain't no drag,8,13 March 2006,"Director Sydney Pollack really had a good run for about 20 years as a versatile film director during which he made such films as They Shoot Horses Don't They, Jerimiah Johnson, The Way We Were, Three Days of the Condor, the electric Horsemen, Our of Africa, The Firm and of course Tootsie. If you can get past the implausibility of a man playing a woman and all the characters who know him as a man don't recognize him in his disguise than this film will work for you much the same way as in Mrs. Doubtfire years later. Then add to that premise that it is one of the world's most well known dramatic actors, Dustin Hoffman in the role of the guy in drag which continues to stretch the plot beyond belief. But you know what? Hoffman is so good and funny and surrounded by such a great cast that somehow it actually works. Jessica Lange, Teri Garr, Dabney Coleman, Charles Durning, Bill Murray and Director Sydney Pollack co star in this film penned by comic writers Larry Gelbart and Elaine May along with Murry Schisgal, Don McGuire and Barry Levinson. Nominated for 10 Academy Awards including most of the majors for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor in Dustin Hoffman, two Best Supporting Actress nominations for Teri Garr and Jessica Lange in her Oscar winning role and Best Screenplay in addition to Film editing, Cinematography, Music and sound.

89,KnightsofNi11,Great film but not for me,7,11 July 2011,"When you hear the idea of Dustin Hoffman in drag you can't help but think, ""No way. That's just wrong."" But that's just what Tootsie is. Hoffman in drag. And lo and behold it was a huge critical success that garnered multiple Oscar nominations including best picture, as well as an Oscar win for Jessica Lange. The film is about out of work actor Michael Dorsey, played by Dustin Hoffman. Dorsey has built his reputation as one of the most difficult actors to work with and so now he is hopelessly desperate for a role. He is so desperate that he dresses up as a woman and becomes actress Dorothy Michaels. He tries out for a role in a soap opera as Dorothy and scores the part, becoming a media icon and a role model for empowered women everywhere. The film sounds absurd and impossible but it is surprisingly believable and very entertaining. It's the sort of film with a wide audience appeal and a crowd pleasing attitude that comes off so well that it is hard to criticize the film harshly. Instead you just want to enjoy it and have a good time.The nice thing about this film is how tasteful it is. The story is told in a friendly and respectable manner that I'm not sure could be twisted into something offensive and tasteless no matter how hard you tried. The film is not exploitative in any way and instead it is a human story about love and life. It's a story with a message that we are all fond of and can easily warm our hearts, only in a very unconventional way. It's a film full of spirit and life that transfers so well to the audience. The film has a sharp script that I can buy into every detail of, never feeling my intelligence insulted. This isn't easy to do when you have a plot as outrageous as the one in Tootsie so the film deserves a ton of credit for pulling off a feat like that.I will say on a more personal note that, despite the quality of this film, it's not exactly my style. This isn't a film for me to fall in love with and the romantic aspect doesn't really intrigue me or draw me in. Instead I just have to sit back and enjoy the movie for what it is. These are things that can't be changed because that is what the movie is. It is a romantic comedy told in an amusingly unorthodox manner. I did enjoy the quirkiness of it and I did find it funny, but overall this isn't a film that I would die for or call a masterpiece. But it is a good film, don't get me wrong, and I can respect the quality in the script and creative storyline, and, most of all, the acting.Dustin Hoffman truly delivers one of his best performances. As Michael Dorsey he is determined and stalwart, playing a character motif he plays a lot of the time. It is the typical hard headed Hoffman that we are all familiar with. But as Dorothy Michaels he is something completely different. For one, he plays a female almost too well. He dons one of the most convincing accents ever, as well as hitting the mannerisms of a southern belle so perfectly. His makeup is impressive, as he really does look like a woman in this film, but everything aside from the physical aspects is perfect as well. He shines in such an odd way but it works all too well. The supporting cast is excellent as well with fine actors such as Jessica Lange and Bill Murray. Murray plays one of the funniest characters in the film. He is Jeff, Michael's roommate who doesn't want any involvement in Michael's shenanigans yet always enjoys throwing his own opinions into what Michael is doing with lines that guarantee copious amounts of laughter. It is obvious that this film wouldn't be complete without all of its fine actors.Tootsie is a well acted, well written, well put together film, but it is not one I would watch again. I enjoyed it as a fun and entertaining use of two hours of my day but that's it. I don't see the film sticking with me but I have undying respect for its quality. Hoffman's performance is incredible, the film is so hilariously unique, and it actually elicited quite a few laughs from me. Tootsie is a fine film that is hard to dislike but requires a certain taste to truly love.",Tootsie
90,TOMASBBloodhound,Funny AND intelligent.,10,11 September 2005,"There is so much more to this film than Dustin Hoffman running around in a dress trying to act like a woman. Tootsie is one of the most intelligent comedies I've ever seen. It is perfectly cast, well-layered, and full of surprises.Dustin Hoffman plays Michael Dorsey. He seems to know everything about acting except how to stay employed as an actor. In an early montage we see him auditioning for numerous plays where he is either too old, too young, too short, simply not the right guy for the part, or in some cases impossible to work with. We also see him trying to teach his craft to some young wannabe actors, and working at a restaurant to pay the bills. After a hilarious argument with his agent, he is simply told ""No one will hire you!"" The very next shot has Hoffman in drag walking down the street to an audition for a soap opera part his friend (Terri Garr) was unable to land. So intent is the chauvinistic director (Coleman) on casting a woman that looks tough enough for the part of a hospital administrator, Hoffman is denied without so much as a reading. He responds with a hilarious tirade that opens the door to his television career. Hoffman lands the part, and is soon winning over fans all over the country.While Hoffman finds it wonderful to be working regularly, his personal life is understandably put to the test. He alienates Garr, is constantly made fun of by his roommate (Murray) and falls in love with one of his co-stars (Lange) who of course cannot learn his secret or he's out of a job. Things are further complicated when two older men fall in love with him. It would be pointless to try and describe some of the awkward situations he finds himself in. You must see the movie to experience them for yourself.The film is so well-cast it's incredible. There are so many fine actors at work here that it almost becomes a contest of who can steal the scene first. Murray gets his share with his improvised lines. His lamenting of the state of his plays during a party scene will have you howling. The icing on the cake was director Sydney Pollack agreeing to play Hoffman's agent. They only have a few scenes together, but they are the film's best.Tootsie is head and shoulders above other films I've seen that deal with men in women's clothing. Mrs. Doubtfire for example was all slapstick without much heart. In the end it tried to redeem itself in that department and just got way too sappy. Tootsie also wisely holds back in the feminism department. Although Hoffman's Dorothy Michaels is clearly a woman who inspires others to stand up for themselves, he is advised to tone it down by Pollack in one scene. Hoffman feels his Dorothy character should be doing specials and giving advice and whatnot, but Pollack reminds him, ""You have NOTHING to say to women, Michael."" In other words, you're lucky you've gotten away with the stunt up to this point, now you should be looking for a way to get out.Overall Tootsie is wonderful experience. It made a fortune when released, and is still very relevant today. Don't miss it! 10 of 10 stars from the Hound.",Tootsie

I really love everything about Tootsie, its adult substance material, the great cast (Dustin Hoffman and T. Garr, J. Lange, D. Coleman, director Pollack, Murray), the humor, it's goodhearted brilliance and the terrific funny characters with its easy going nature, but, as much as I enjoy the fuming switch-a-roo romance between Dustin and the all-time beautiful lovely Jessica Lange, or the spark shared with Dustin and Garr, or all the funny occurring moments when Hoffman is playing as Tootsie, nothing quite compares to seeing Geena Davis in her silky little panties during those awesome dressing room scenes, not once, but twice, and in a different pair too. I love Geena Davis. Tootsie was Davis' first big break role as Geena was posing as an apparently convincing store window mannequin before Tootsie and she was a Victoria's Secret lingerie model at the time. Pollack and company wanted a model who could act for the part so they called up the ol' model agency and told them to send their best down straight away for movie auditions and Geena obviously showed and obviously mesmerized them with her beauty and her talent and her charm but apparently the casters were left so mesmerized that they had forgotten to ask Geena to appear in her swimsuit during her audition so that they could check her body out to best know if she was good for the part or not so they were left wanting Geena but not knowing if she had the body for it, so, some lucky chap had to locate the latest Victoria's Secret catalogue to look for Geena in it and find her pictures to see if her body was good enough just to make sure that this gorgeous and talented, all-time beautiful babe named Geena looked good in her underwear. She was a Victoria Secret's panty model! There's no fooling you guys, seemed like an exercise in futility if you ask me, but, I was happy to do it and at least I got paid for it, just kidding, I wasn't even alive in 1982. Based off what I'm seeing, it was the right choice. This is Geena's hottest movie moment, even hotter than she is in Earth Girls Are Easy! It's a close call. A tiny secret to Tootsie's success is just how cute Hoffman appears as Tootsie. I love Teri Garr in this but Jessica Lange is the reason for the season and Geena has all the best parts, physically and in Tootsie. Oh by the way, Tootsie is an all-time beautiful and all-time amusing classic. In retrospect, I definitely didn't talk about Jessica enough, but, I'm young and I promise to make it up to her in future reviews and Geena's butt.",Tootsie
93,gab-14712,Still Remains Funny And Relevant As Ever!,9,30 July 2019,"Tootsie is a gem of a movie and is way better than I completely thought it would be. This film is more than just Dustin Hoffman dressing up in drag. It is a story that has many things to say. Even more ironic is the movie speaks positively towards the side of feminism-something you would not expect a movie about cross-dressing to do. Like many comedies of the 1980's, we get a story that goes from Point A to Point B. This is not a comedy that provides belly-roll laughing, but it is a thought-provoking story that will make you think while making you laugh. When a comedy film is able to effectively tell a story without sacrificing the laughs, then the filmmakers have succeeded into making comedy gold! This movie harkens back to the golden age of Hollywood-where comedies would be absurd but would also be dramatic and a little tender. That is the main reason why I was able to smile so hard after the completion of this movie.Michael Dorsey (Dustin Hoffman) is a 40-ish actor from New York who is having a hard time finding employment. According to his agent, George (Sydney Pollack), he has a reputation so bad that no one wants to work with him. Great actor, but not the best people person. He lives with his roommate Jeff (Bill Murray). He is also a man who doesn't treat women very respectfully, especially his good friend Sandy (Teri Garr.) One day, he comes up with an idea to find himself a job. After Sandy was unable to grab the role of Emily Kimberly-a tough-as-nails administrator on some famous soap opera, Michael assumes the role of Dorothy Michaels. Michael, as Dorothy, auditions and wins the role after a lovely tirade. The only people who knows of Michael's cross-dressing are Jeff and George. Things will get very complicated for Michael. The director of the soap opera, Ron (Dabney Coleman) is a sexist pig. He becomes friends with and falls in love with Julie (Jessica Lange), who plays a nurse on the show. He cannot tell her that he is actually a man. Finally, two older men falls in love with him; Julie's father Les (Charles Durning), and the main actor of the show, John Van Horn (George Gaynes). With all of these complications, how will Michael be able to keep his disguise as Dorothy intact?The direction and the performances are tremendous. One of the reasons why this movie is less gimmicky than one would expect is because Sydney Pollack was behind the camera. The director was originally doing to be Hal Ashby, but post-production on another film kept him away from this movie thus opening the door for Pollack. Pollack was able to take influences from the older films and create an old-fashioned comedy that is both hilarious and thoughtful. He was also able to get the best out of his actors.Dustin Hoffman said his role reminded himself of what he used to be like as an actor when he first arrived in Hollywood. Hoffman came to fame with movies like The Graduate and Midnight Cowboy. He may have been a little arrogant, a little know-it-all, and someone who may have been difficult to work with. Because he sees himself, he was able to deliver an incredible performance. Jessica Lange is likewise very good. You know, I keep forgetting Bill Murray is in the movie. He was very funny here as Michael's roommate, but he was overshadowed by the likes of Hoffman and Lange. Murray should also be in every movie I might add.
I had lots of fun watching Tootsie. Nominated for ten Oscars and Jessica Lange taking home the trophy for Best Actress, this is one of the best films of 1982. Dustin Hoffman and Jessica Lange lead a barrage of excellent performances. I do mind Dave Grusin's music to be quite.... interesting. Although a bit cheerful, the music is cheesy at times-perhaps a bit too cheesy. The movie is a light-hearted romp, but it does make some keen observations about sexism and gender identities, especially within the movie/television industry. These observations are just a few examples why people in today's climate should view the movie. Perhaps that is why we can currently see an adaptation of Tootsie on Broadway. If you want a funny movie that does not sacrifice jokes at the expense of its plot, here ya go!My Grade: A",Tootsie

The feel is partially 70's throwback feminism (I know the movie was made in 1982), partially great comic/entertainment values, to wit:  A great script, great character development, excellent comic timing (including the editing). I mean, the movie walks a tightrope between espousing feminist ""strong woman"" ideals, and standing back and laughing at how funny we could look espousing those ideals.  Quite an accomplishment for the time, and a sterling counterexample to the suggestion that Hollywood at that time had an unrelenting, strident ""P.C."" voice.Very good acting, all 'round.  I really can't fault anybody.  Though I do want to extend a special reference to Teri Garr.  Man, she was one of the most fun people in that movie!It's got me thinking.  I'm thinking of all times I've criticized movies because ""the premise wasn't believable.""  But this movie reminds me of what is really important.  Tootsie's premise was plainly not believable, yet it's still a perfectly fine movie.  Why?  Because the point is not the premise; the point is the invisible, mysterious process that invites your to suspend your disbelief, makes you *want* to suspend your disbelief, and *take that ride* with the creators.

The 1982 film TOOTSIE became an instant classic and is just as funny twenty-three years later as it was at the time of initial release. I love this movie because, like THE WIZARD OF OZ, no matter how many times I watch it, I always see something I never noticed before. Sidney Pollack's inspired direction (and those who know Hoffman, know he probably ""collaborated"" with Pollack)perfectly brought together all the elements of this winning story about an unemployed actor/acting teacher/waiter named Michael Dorsey (Dustin Hoffman) who, despite being a wonderful actor, cannot get work as he has earned a reputation for being ""difficult."" Desperate to earn $8000.00 in order to produce a play that his roommate (Bill Murray) wrote, he dresses in drag and auditions for a role on a soap opera and actually gets the part. Complications ensue when he falls in love with the soap's leading lady (Jessica Lange), butts head with the soap's creepy director (Dabney Coleman), and has to hide what he's doing from his neurotic friend (Teri Garr, in a performance that should have won her the Oscar)who also auditioned for the soap role he got, a ruse that has the woman convinced Michael is gay. And if that weren't enough, Lange's father, played by the always solid Charles Durning, falls in love with Michael's female alter ego, Dorothy Michaels. Everything works in this film. Towering above everything is the amazing performance by Dustin Hoffman as Michael Dorsey/Dorothy Michaels. Unlike Julie Andrews in VICTOR/VICTORIA, Hoffman is completely believable as a woman. As a matter of fact, his screen time as Dorothy is the strongest part of his performance. Jessica Lange is a charming leading lady (though I still think the Best Supporting Actress Oscar should have gone to Garr, not Lange)and even director Pollack makes his scenes count as Michael's agent George Fields. This film demands and deserves multiple viewings and will always be considered a benchmark of American film comedy.",Tootsie

Very little off the street business made it tough to meet the monthly payments. In order to offset customer decline I had outside accounts. One of them was Judy's Café where I provided her establishment with ice cream deserts. Judy was sort of attractive. Shoulder length blond hair and glasses which didn't diminish from her alabaster complexion. Judy also had an average build and always well dressed. I was very lucky to have her business and she always payed her bills on time. ""Tootsie"" focuses on what extremes an actor will go through to land a job. Michael Dorcey (Dustin Hoffman)is a respected actor and has dream of some day raising enough cash to produce a play. Trouble ensues when our obstinate, precisionist Michael who is portraying a tomato questions the director's authority. Ultimately he gets fired and his agent George fields (Sydney Pollack) tells him that no one wants to hire him. Months go by without work. His female friend Sandy Lester (Teri Garr) tells Michael of an opening in a popular Soap Opera, ""Southwest General"" for the part of the new administrator Emily Kimberly which Sandy read for wasn't chosen. Michael slips into action shaving, plucking putting on makeup and wig and transforms into a middle aged woman the alias Dorothy Michaels. Our female impersonator goes down for the read ands nails the part. Dorothy's standup/forcefulness and riotousness shines through the very first episode as she shows her newly acquired fan base that she's in charge. The internal workings of the show get complicated as costars react differently to Dorothy. Dorothy lays down the law to the shows producer/director Ron (Dabney Coleman) as he refers to Dorothy as ""Toots"". Her reaction was caustic to say the least as she shows him she's no swooning female.. To add to the confusion, Dorothy/Michael develops a crush on Julie Nichols (Jessica Lange) a single mom who by circumstance asks Dorothy to help her with her lines for the next days show. Meanwhile Michael's apartment roommate Jeff (Bill Murray) watches the transformation of his male roommate and questions him, Is he doing this for the money or do you like to dress up in woman's attire? One of many humorous lines to come from Jeff throughout the film. As the shows go by Dorothy's popularity grows as the producers want to extend her contract. Michael wants out but other fronts appear in the way of older male suitors. Two in particular Julie's Father Charles Durning and co-actor the George Gaynes who serenades Michael from his window perch. Meanwhile Sandy who wants more of a relationship with Michael. Sandy is even more confused when Michael is caught trying on her clothes. Well written story Don McQuire and Larry Gelbart who is never short on farcical lines. As for Hoffman's performance the only flaw was the voice her used which wasn't in my mind convincing. The story is what kept me interested in the film as the ruse was kept despite near misses along the way, but you'll have to watch the outcome yourself and I'm sure you won't be disappointed. One thing I will tell you is that Dorothy will never go away as long as Michael Dorcey lives and breathes . As he states Dorothy didn't leave. he's right inside me. As for Judy's Café I learned through other retailers she used to be a man but that didn't deter our relationship.",Tootsie

And if there is a common denominator to all of that, it's the cruel lack of consistency on every level, whether the story itself quite predictable and linear, or the under-developed characters who lack charisma, or the gags... because yes, though it's supposed to be a comedy, the humour is very little present, you barely laugh which is inevitably extremely penalizing.

104,mcfly-31,Hardly a *drag*....,8,15 September 2008,"Not too long after the dawn of film, when comedy writers were desperate for something envelope pushing but not tawdry, they threw a guy in a dress. The old reliable: guy in make-up, fidgeting with his new clothes, and basically, his new body. Flash forward several decades and it's still in full force.The only difference in ""Tootsie"" is that this typical ""one joke"" formula is only relied on a couple of times. A tug of pantyhose from the butt, a stumble on the heels, but that's about it. Fortunately for us (and something completely lost on today's screenwriters), the scribes decided to write a COMPLETE movie around this premise! Hoffman is tapped to portray a struggling actor who --- much like many unemployed thespians --- teaches acting classes on the side to make money, as well as wait tables. (Which is one of the extra aspects of the film that will delight those living the Unknown Actor life.) After watching a female friend bomb out at an audition, as well a finely scripted argument with his agent (Pollack, who is lights out), cut to Hoffman in womanly transformation, stumbling his way down a New York City block.As mentioned, because the screenplay doesn't rely on stand-by schenanigans involving bodily jokes, Hoffman ends up fleshing out a completely believable firebrand type female. Even admitting at one point, he wishes he had her aggressiveness. A strong intro to his ""Dorothy"" involves some spit-fire dialogue directed at a womanizing Coleman, his potential director on the soap opera he's auditioning for.But it's shortly after this where I was the most impressed. This script doesn't just introduce a second tier, but a third, and even a fourth. The complications faced by Hoffman --- and the way they are so masterfully juxtaposed --- layers this story like you wouldn't expect. Garr wants Hoffman, but Hoffman wants Lange. Lange's father wants Hoffman, but so does Gaynes. Garr thinks Hoffman is either cheating or gay. Lange believes Hoffman to be a lesbian. It really does present an ordeal of endless exploring for a screenwriter. And they nail it.A fine supporting cast includes Murray, not overdoing it as he was at that time, and Garr is nicely manic. Lange is a little bland, but acceptable. Coleman shines in another limited role, and Durning even gets time to win us over. But really it's Pollock as Hoffman's agent that grabs your attention. Not only directing this classic, but delivering such an embattled, comic performance that you wish you could've seen more of him.The film is only sluggish a few times, and some of the mechanics of the soap opera are stretched (teleprompters, going live, auditioning for a director instead of a casting director), but are hardly enough to detract. Throw in a terrific score from Dave Grusin and one of the most heartfelt movie theme songs from Stephen Bishop, and you've got a flick that'll be playable for another 25 years.",Tootsie
105,DavidSim240183,"Warm, witty and humane. A comedy that's withstood the test of time",10,16 October 2007,"For a film with such a troubled production history, Tootsie emerges as a surprisingly polished, tightly plotted comedy. Despite numerous rewrites, a turnover in directors, and some off-screen conflicts between star Dustin Hoffman and director Sydney Pollack, its all the more remarkable that Tootsie is so successful.The film is like a well-oiled machine. Everything about it works. Right down the middle. From its inspired ensemble casting to its slick direction and witty script, Tootsie has endured for 25 years and is still going strong.Of all the films Dustin Hoffman has starred in, this surely must count as his finest. Perhaps because the character of Michael Dorsey so neatly captures aspects of Hoffman in real life.In the opening scenes, Michael is shown as an exacting method actor. He has tremendous range, an incredible variety of vocal chords, and a lot of interesting ideas. But they're ideas at odds with every director and co-star he works with.Michael may be a terrific actor, but he's rubbed a number of people up the wrong way through his constant critiquing and reinterpretations of the parts he's supposed to be playing. This has all given him a very bad reputation. And its gotten to the point where nobody in Hollywood will hire him.Now of course Dustin Hoffman has been constantly employed for the past 40 years. But everything else I said about Michael is pretty much the story of Hoffman's life. And its that key that allows Tootsie to flow as smoothly as it does.Hoffman must realise on some subconscious level he's playing a character not all that far removed from himself. And that's the genius of Tootsie. We already know and identify with Michael Dorsey, making it that much easier to go a further distance and identify with his alter ego, Dorothy Michaels.Michael hits on the idea if he can't get work as a man, maybe he can get work as a woman. So he invents Dorothy Michaels. A ballsy, brassy Southern belle with an acid tongue and opinions aplenty. And the ruse works! 'She' becomes the new hospital administrator on daytime TV's hottest soap opera, Southwest General.But what happens when Dorothy becomes an unexpected success? And the studio refuses to release Michael/Dorothy from his/her contract? The result? An hilariously madcap series of neverending complications! Tootsie is not the first film of course to tackle the themes of cross-dressing. But its every bit as accomplished as Some Like It Hot. Tootsie is a film I find very difficult to dislike. It's such a good natured film. And disarming in its ways. I've never met a single person who didn't find something to enjoy about Tootsie.The delights come from a wide variety of areas. Not only does Sydney Pollack's direction move at a marvellous gallop, but the wonderful cast breathes such life into an already witty screenplay. Its the efforts of everyone involved that gives Tootsie such spirit.Dustin Hoffman's performance is quite faultless. Not only does he excel as Michael, but he pulls out all the stops and turns Dorothy into a completely different person altogether. But its not just on Hoffman's shoulders. The rest of the cast do their part too.Tootsie has one of the most wonderful ensemble casts I've ever seen in a comedy. They all add something. And not a single actor is wasted. Jessica Lange turns in a nicely defined performance as Julie Nichols, Dorothy's co-star on Southwest General. The woman he falls for. Something that only adds more complications to Michael's life.Teri Garr does a wonderfully ditzy performance as Michael's neurotic girlfriend Sandy, who becomes more and more flustered by his increasingly odd behaviour. Dabney Coleman's on fine obnoxious form as Ron, the director of Southwest General and Julie's two-timing boyfriend. And Charles Durning adds a bit of sweetness as Les, Julie's father who falls for Dorothy. Talk about a bizarre love triangle!In a nice touch, Sydney Pollack also co-stars as Michael's exasperated agent George. Their disagreements so obviously mirrors the exact same thing that occurred between Hoffman and Pollack off-set. But they're just as funny as anything else in the film. Also look out for an early appearance from Geena Davis as one of Southwest General's hospital sluts.But of course its the wonderful Bill Murray who steals every scene he's in as Michael's laidback laconic roommate Jeff. It sometimes seems like Jeff is the sanest person in the entire film. His dry observations on the shifting complications in Michael's life are positively sidesplitting. And his response to walking in on Dorothy and a male co-star making out holds one of the funniest lines Murray has ever delivered in his entire illustrious career.Pollack's direction is right on the nose, allowing Tootsie to glide from one classic scenario to the next. I'm especially partial to the part of the film where Dorothy has to babysit Julie's daughter, go on a date with Les, and fight off the sex-starved affections of a co-star all within the course of a single night.But Tootsie is a screwball comedy with a heart. Its not only an hilarious pileup of spiralling difficulties, but an extremely touching love story. Michael loves Julie, but she only sees Dorothy. There are many character arcs surrounding Hoffman and Lange, but they're relationship is the heart and soul of the picture. And everything converges beautifully in the final ten minutes. When Michael unmasks himself on live TV! And professes his love for Julie. His confession is not only sweet. But funny too.Tootsie is a true classic. It fires on every cylinder. Hits every target. And provides non-stop laughter, heartfelt moments where you least expect them, and even finds the time to gently satirise soap operas and they're often quite ludicrous plot lines.Unmissable entertainment!",Tootsie

Dustin Hoffman is brilliant in his dual role, for which he earned an Oscar nomination for Best Actor, portraying both the unemployed male actor, Michael, and the highly successful female TV soap star, Dorothy.This wonderful comedy revolves around an unemployed actor named Michael Dorsey, who disguises himself as a woman, Dorothy Michaels, in order to land a part in a TV soap opera...a role which proves incredibly successful. Meanwhile, Michael falls in love with the soap's female star, Julie, but cannot divulge Dorothy's secret or will lose his acting job. Unfolding events are further complicated by the fact that Julie's father, Les, is in love with Dorothy herself. Really, it's all too much...I'm still cracking up. There's an excellent story here too, not just detached laughs, and of course all the while, you're cheering for the romance, which naturally cannot possibly run smoothly. The love interest, Julie, in fact treats Dorothy like her female best friend. Situations are by turns awkward, emotional, moving, outrageous, and most often simply side splitting hilarious.The lovely and talented Jessica Lange deserves her Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her role as Julie. The other supporting cast is good here as well, Charles Durning portraying Julie's dad and Terri Carr as Michael's original girlfriend, Sandy.This seems to be a genre which, when well done, can be pretty funny, as in the older Some Like it Hot (Jack Lemmon / Marilyn Munroe) and the modern Mrs. Doubtfire (Robin Williams / Sally Field), another of my favorites. Tootsie's Dustin Hoffman offers a marvelous performance that would by no means have been an easy act for Robin Williams to follow, though in my opinion, the perennially funny Williams managed to succeed.",Tootsie

110,Rockwell_Cronenberg,An absolute joy.,7,1 February 2012,"If Tootsie were made today, it would be absolutely awful. Some hack actor would be yucking it up in the leading role and the entire thing would be based around it's one-joke premise; an out of work actor dresses in drag to finally land a role on a soap opera. It would have been two hours of jokes about a man putting on stockings, with a few lazy subplots tossed in to fill up time. Thankfully, this one was made in 1982, before the ""hilarious"" idea of a man dressing as a woman became a tired and trite excuse to get a few cheap laughs from the people shameless enough to shell out money for a ticket.Tootsie is a sign of how far we've fallen, because thirty years ago a film like this was made and was actually good. Yes, it's relatively light entertainment, but it's entertaining and so enjoyable and filled with good humor, life and, most of all, heart. That's where it really shines and what the difference comes down to here; this movie has so much heart that it's overflowing with it. Things don't feel staged and the jokes don't feel like they are being forced down the audience's throat; sure the premise is hard to buy, but once you move past it there is so much to gain here.They set up the premise and then the rest of the film happens organically, as opposed to one ridiculously staged and flat joke after another. The care that they take into establishing Michael Dorsey and Dorothy Michaels as their own separate characters is mightily impressive. When I was watching Dorothy on screen, I felt like I was watching a real woman, not watching Michael in drag. Part of this can be attributed to the care and depth of the script and of Sydney Pollack's direction, but of course a lot of it must be credited to Dustin Hoffman's masterful performance.This is a whacky premise, but where the brilliance of it comes is how everyone, especially Hoffman, plays it completely straight. You never doubt that he is fully absorbed into this character, as Michael Dorsey is as well. There's never a wink at the audience or a tongue in the cheek, and that's what makes it so enjoyable and good-hearted. They couldn't make one like this these days, so I'm very glad they got one done before it was too late. A very enjoyable picture.",Tootsie

⚪
In order to celebrate the 83rd birthday of a legendary and unparalleled artists and my third favourite actor of all time, Dustin Hoffman, I thought I would yet watch another film from his magnificent oeuvre. While my last watch with him (""Rain Man"") has been only one day prior and is deemed as one of his best works so far (what I can confirm), I jumped back six years and watched this apparently muchly beloved yet not quite far-known comedy from the early eighties. All I can say is that it is indeed a tremendously delighting film, and the thing is that it isn't just a mindless piece of nonsense that offers a few laughs from time to time, but a surprisingly intelligent and wonderfully written amusement. In a manner that reminds me of the Robin Williams lead drama ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" (I am aware that it came out later, but I have seen it first), the New Hollywood legend plays a double role, as both the unsuccessful actor Michael Dorsey and highly acclaimed TV actress Dorothy Michaels (those names are just splendid) and once again proved why he is one of the greatest of all time. While watching it, I mostly forgot that both are played by Hoffman and that he played two totally different personalities only shows what an amazing job he did as an actor. Next to him, the rest of the cast was hilarious as well. From a Bill Murray before he was Peter Venkman, over ""King Kong"" lead actress Jessica Lange, ""The Fly"" star Geena Davies, ""Frankenstein Junior"" superstar Terri Garn and the director himself to ""Police Academy"" star George Gaynes, there is not a single role that feels miscast. Even if all of this sounds already phenomenal, it isn't only the humour what makes this film so utterly important for society. In comedic yet not less serious manner, this film marvellously calls attention to emancipation, feminism and in some way even to transsexuality. Accusing the film of male saviourism would be wrong, and even if it is a man disguised as a female that revolutionises the television landscape by portraying a strong and powerful woman, it works extremely well as an educational piece, especially for men. When Michael turns into Dorothy, he (as well as the viewer) learns a lot about what it is like to be a woman in the show business. From devious co-stars and producers who constantly try to hit on him and seem to not accept a No as an answer to directors who call him/her defamatory names Dorothy experiences it all and allows Michael to be a better man himself. It is been thirty-eight years and this message is still important as of today. All in all, this film disguises itself as a light-hearted flick and is a witty comedy on the outside, but on the inside, it is a powerful and meaningful piece of social criticism that gives people (especially men!) and necessary, educational insight into the lives of women and how they constantly have to deal with toxic masculinity, not only in a male dominated business. I came for the laughs, but I am so glad that this film is so much more than that.",Tootsie
112,jackasstrange,"Intelligent, smart and funny",8,11 March 2014,"While I disliked the intense 80s vibe this film carries, I fully enjoyed the script and the performances.i don't think Sydney Pollack is a good director, but his (annoying) vision turned Tootsie a classic. Yes, It's unimaginable this film being made in another age, even if - In my opinion - it would work much better as a 90s or 00s comedy. The screenplay is fantastic, it depicts very well the struggle of unemployment, the struggle of being a woman and also the egocentricity and self-awareness of the protagonist, which as 'Dorothy' conquered US with 'her' charisma and different attitude. Looks like a metaphor to Margaret Tatcher government, if you think well.The film is one of my favorite comedies from the 80s, so I hope you'll enjoy as well. 8.5/10",Tootsie
113,michaelradny,Hilarious Unaged Humour,8,19 August 2015,"Tootsie possibly is Dustin Hoffman's finest role, the gender swap. Having seen a bulk of his films prior, Dustin Hoffman already proved himself as an outstanding actor, but Tootsie furthers his resume and adds one of the funniest movies to it. It never feels old, everything in it feels modern and fresh, and to be honest, I haven't seen a film like it ever (except maybe for Mrs. Doubtfire). The story is original, and the directing phenomenal, whilst the cameos and minor parts of other big actors shines through to make this more than a film about Dustin Hoffman. A great comedy, suitable for everyone and funny enough for the majority of the family to get stitches from. Whilst it's not always a laugh fest, what fills in between the humour is beautiful characterization, which furthers the development of this iconic film.",Tootsie

I've seen it countless times, and it's still a great watch.Dustin Hoffman plays Michael Dorsey, an unemployed actor, who can't seem to get along with any director or writer in town. One day, he takes his friend, Sandy to audition for a part in a soap opera. She is turned down, and because he is so desperate for work, he dresses up like a woman, and goes in for the interview himself. He is hired because of his ( I mean, her) defiant attitude, and throughout the rest of the film, he is now known as, Dorothy Michaels.The film is hysterical, and well-written. There is not a time that I've seen this film, where I didn't laugh or smile. It's light, but has some adult material that might not be appropriate for anyone under twelve. It's cute, and there's really not much more to it than that. I think everyone will love it, once they give it a chance.",Tootsie

I do remember that Hoffman plays an actor who pretends to be a woman to land a part on a TV show. It's funny and has a lot of charm, but it comes from Tootsie, not Dustin without the dress.

A wonderful comedy which has Dustin Hoffman at his prime, giving a remarkable performance. When he is in drag as Dorothy, it's really difficult to discern his male character, he absolutely gets lost in it. Definitely one of my favourite performances of him. Jessica Lange is another who shines in her role as Julie, an actress with a steady job in a soap opera, involved with a jerk, womanizer of a director who doesn't treat her the way she deserves, and with a small child to take care. So, when things get difficult she has her good friend Dorothy by her side, comforting her and being a good friend, but very much within her, there lies Michael who is eager to get in touch with Julie, as he wishes to be by her side, since he fell madly in love. But that would mean he would be out of a job, ending a quite clever and desperate move to get the gig in the first place, since no one in town would hire him because of his problematic ways.The whole film is just a very rewarding experience, one you'll be thankful to have, as its filled with superb acting, and an interesting plot that keeps adding layers as it goes and it heads towards an ending you won't forget.",Tootsie
118,jeremy3,"Overly indulgent movie, saved by great acting",6,3 September 2006,"The premise of this movie is rather weak. The idea is of a man who cannot find any roles, so decides to play a woman on a soap opera. Of course, it ends up being the same old story of the woman versus ""the overly played in this kind of role"" ""Dabney Coleman, as the male chauvinistic director. What saves this movie is the acting. Dustin Hoffman plays both Michael Dorsey (struggling actor) and Dorothy Michaels (soap star). What I like this is that it is an authentic portrayal of a woman, not the usual over exaggerated role. Hoffman plays well the prim and proper Dorothy Michaels. Sydney Pollack plays a very funny and witty acting agent, who can't believe and is downright embarrassed by Dorsey's charades. Jessica Lange is her usual good self as Julie Nichols. I was most impressed by the Finnish-born actor - John Van Horn. As one of the only good things about the Police Academy series, he certainly showed acting talent. Charles Durning plays the Father. He is very believable. I guess it wasn't that great a plot, but the acting was good.",Tootsie

120,antagonist117,"A comedic but conscientious variation on the ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" theme, with some bumps",8,27 June 2014,"""Tootsie"" is a socially conscious movie, so it requires some realism to engage with and critique. But it's also a comedy, which means that realism is sometimes secondary to laughs. The way ""Tootsie"" manages its dual nature is that the premise provides a platform for commentary, while the way it actually plays out is unbelievable but very funny. Dustin Hoffman is not a believable woman. Maybe he could have been, but his dollar-bin clothes and clownish makeup and mincing voice are all wrong and come off like cosplay or parody. Who could believe that a major actress like Hoffman's character could do four photo shoots for major magazine covers in those clothes and that wig, or that she would be allowed to do her own makeup at home before filming her daily soap, or that as a new and unknown hire she could walk onto an established TV set run by a tyrant director and so thoroughly blow everyone away with one-take improvised line readings that the crew would abandon scripts and camera cues to suit her whims? Nobody, but it's funny to see Hoffman do those things. Sometimes the jokes are found in the likeliest places, like the banter between Hoffman and slovenly roommate Bill Murray about dieting and whether certain clothes make one's ass look big. A lot of the best lines, both the dramatic and the humorous, go to Teri Garr in a supporting role that is more interesting but smaller than Jessica Lange's, and this creates a certain imbalance in the romantic chemistry. But such misses are excusable in a movie with its heart so clearly in the right place. The premise is a broad one to match the occasionally broad humor, and it's really the same one that drove Hoffman's earlier starring vehicle ""Kramer vs. Kramer"": that society's assigned roles for men and women are artificial. ""Tootsie""'s way of saying this is less sharp than ""Kramer""'s, and while the latter is carefully structured so as to leave no room to interpret is as anything but a powerful statement of equality, it is possible to see ""Tootsie"" as a movie that plays with social conventions without fundamentally overturning them. In the final analysis, though, the movie's intent is to challenge the status quo of male privilege. This is made clear in a scene in which Hoffman calls out the sleazy director who's dating and cheating on his leading lady, only to have the director ruefully acknowledge his behavior in a way that highlights how similar it is to Hoffman's. The movie may have its cake and eat it too, mixing comedy and commentary, but it doesn't let its characters get away with inconsistency. That is to say, it's a smart movie and a good movie.",Tootsie
121,HelloTexas11,excellent cast in hilarious comedy,9,13 December 2008,"'Tootsie' is, first and foremost, a marvelous updating of the old screwball comedies of the thirties and forties. It's almost a shame to burden it with any deeper meanings than that, as that is quite sufficient. But there are some 'messages' in it, I suppose... more on them shortly. Dustin Hoffman plays Michael Dorsey, a pain-in-the-ass actor who can't get hired anywhere because he's a pain in the ass. So he hits upon the idea of posing as a woman, Dorothy Michaels, to get hired for a soap opera. It works. Is Hoffman really so convincing impersonating a woman? No, I don't think so. But he's dead-on in his portrayal of a man pretending to be one. He's always just a little too made up and well-dressed and perfectly-coiffed to be believable next to the more natural (and real) women he interacts with, mainly Jessica Lange and Teri Garr. But aside from a stray comment here and there, nobody seems to notice. The entire cast is wonderful; I have to single out Teri Garr though. Her character, Sandy, is a very complicated and moody variation on the classic ditzy blonde and Garr is perfect in the role. Her mood can change in the blink of an eye, and it does, often. At a party early on, Sandy comes bursting out of the bathroom holding a plunger and says to the first person she sees, ""I've been trapped in there for a half hour! Didn't anybody hear me?"" Then she looks around, instantly cheerful again, and says, ""Wow, so everyone's having a great time, huh?"" Her prepping for an audition for the soap opera part is priceless too. To say complications arise from Michael becoming Dorothy would be an understatement. John Van Horn (an actor in the soap opera) lusts after her, and Les Nichols (Charles Durning), who is the father of Jessica Lange's Julie Nichols, actually proposes marriage. With a ring. But it's Julie that Michael/Dorothy is interested in and of course he can't do anything about it with revealing his identity and losing the job. Jessica Lange won an Oscar; the film was nominated for ten Academy Awards altogether. Not surprisingly in a story like this, the men are portrayed none-too-flatteringly, and Ron Carlisle (Dabney Coleman), the soap's director, is the worst of them all- a vain, male chauvinist egomaniac. The role fits Coleman like a glove (how many times has he played a variation on THIS character?) and he too has his share of funny lines and moments. Okay, so the 'messages.' One of course is that men are clueless when it comes to women and their feelings. Michael himself, even though he is now able to see things through a woman's eyes, doesn't necessarily understand them any better. His general reaction seems to be, what a crazy way to act, dress, and live; after a certain point, he can't stand it any more and can't wait to go back to being a man. There are some gentle digs at women too. That some females have an undying capacity to feel victimized no matter what the situation has Michael/Dorothy falling back on typical male feelings. As in, if a guy abused 'her', Dorothy would kick him in the nuts. And so on. Oh and Bill Murray is in it too, unbilled in the opening credits, as Michael's roommate, and he's quite funny, essentially playing, well, Bill Murray and offering wry commentary on the goings-on. So, as they said in the forties, 'Tootsie' is a laff-riot, and the chuckle quotient is sky high. It's definitely right up there with 'Ed Wood' as one of the best cross-dressing movies ever.",Tootsie

""Tootsie"" is entirely unpredictable and implausible, and watching Dustin Hoffman pull off the act of dressing up as a woman makes me laugh hysterically every time I see it. Hoffman was robbed of winning the best actor Oscar for 1982. The supporting cast, including Bill Murray, Dabney Coleman, Charles Durning, Teri Garr, and Jessica Lange, is also excellent. Syndey Pollack also proves to be as great an actor as a director. The song ""It Might Be You"" is one of the best original movie songs I've heard, and it really adds to the film. ""Tootsie"" is similar to films such as ""Some Like It Hot"" and ""Mrs. Doubtfire,"" but this movie is much funnier, as it doesn't deal with topics such as divorce or trying to escape from gangsters.

Associated with films such as ""The Firm"", ""Eyes Wide Shut"", ""Random Hearts"", ""Out of Africa"", ""Michael Clayton"" and ""Cold Mountain"" just to name a few. He directed this film which stars Dustin Hoffman as a struggling actor Michael Dorsey. Michael Dorsey is struggling to get an acting role and when his girl friend Sandy (Terry Gar) fails to get a TV soapy role he becomes infuriated. He decides to pretend to be a women ""Dorothy Michaels"" and auditions for a role in the TV Hospital soapy and succeeds. He is able to fund his friend's play and continue with the disguise. He becomes exceptionally successful when his true masculine self emerges through his female nurse character. Dorothy Michaels becomes a national phenomena with her persona as a mature and emancipated liberated feminist and women including the female cast and crew look up to her. Dorothy becomes close to fellow actress the beautiful Julie Nichols (Jessica Lange) and they spend much time together. As he develops feelings for Julie her father also develops feelings for him and his disguise as a women commences to unravel. The film has great acting performance by all characters and won an Oscar for Jessica Lange and nominations in several categories. A delightful blend of comedy and romance this film explores the meretricious TV soapy and the struggles in undertaking an acting career if your poor. The film was released during the era of women's liberation as was a great success for its contemporary relevance and original story. Dustin Hoffman's acting skills are exemplified by acting as an actor pretending to be a women an extraordinary challenge.

128,cosmorados,That is one nutty hospital,8,14 June 2008,"The opening sequence of Michael Dorsey teaching an acting class, intertwined with him applying the appropriate make-up while going for auditions and failing is a telling one. We see Dustin Hoffman's character as a consummate professional who will do anything he can for a role. This is very much like the Dustin we know from other films, and we feel that there are certainly strong elements of his own personality in here. However in this film it is taken to a ridiculous level as his attention to detail make it impossible to move out of character for the sake of a part to understand a director's point of view and putting him at loggerheads with his agent who cannot find work for him due to this meticulous attention to detail. Having been told that he will get no work in either New York or Hollywood due to people finding him unmanageable, he takes the drastic step of going for an audition as a woman in order to try and get an acting job.Thus begins the best cross-dressing film of all time. The script from this point on is superb as Michael Dorsey's alter ego Dorothy Michael's star rises, due to her appearance in a daytime soap, beyond anything that he thought would have been possible, Michael has to contend with both his lives becoming ever more confused as each life imposes restrictions of the other one.Unable to tell the woman he loves how he feels as she thinks he's Dorothy, unable to tell his girlfriend that he has got the role she originally auditioned for, and getting great counselling from his best friend and playwright, superbly brought to life by Bill Murray, who steals every scene he is in, within the film, we are treated to a film that could so easily have wound up in the farce category but manages deftly to avoid it.The rest of the cast in the form of Dabney Coleman, Jessica Lange and Sydney Pollock are great in their roles as Director, object of affection and agent respectively with everyone else in equally splendid form it's a masterclass in acting for anyone wanting to know what it takes to become a great actor.One of the films of the eighties.",Tootsie

130,StevenKeys,Tootsie,10,31 March 2021,"Staying on theme (women's wear), this one is more uplifting than a ""Pour-Moi"" push-up bra. If Oscar were given for Best Scene (Russian Tea), I see Syd accepting one to hearty applause (""For what! For what!"") with a smile as big as Dot's hair. Look for the box of candy that changes hands like a Winchester73 and then take note of Grusin & Co's beautiful soundtrack that rides nicely on a script so warm, so clever you begin to realize why TV laugh-tracks came in vogue (good writing's rare). We knew Pollack had dramatic directing chops (Jeremiah-Johnson Three-Days-of-the-Condor), Tootsie proved he had a flair for funny as well, behind and in front of the camera.Now that Hoffman's fallen out of favor with the PC media, it's a challenge for those critics to find much good in a film where Dustin appears in nearly every scene doing double-duty (Michael - Dot). So then much of their attention has shifted to its surprise, lone Oscar winner, Jessica Lange, a terrific actress (Frances Rob-Roy) but whose fickle Julie is the film's weak-link in one chock full o' fantastic acts, pulling the hardware from hands of Teri Garr, its best support in the funny, sympathetic and wise Sandy (To an under-the-weather Mike: ""Take 1000 units of vitamin C, with milk, every hour!""). What are you gonna' do? Give everyone due-process, for starters.Gandhi was the darling of the 1983 Oscars (8), but I count 3 films that could've taken top honors instead, including Tootsie (The-Verdict Das-Boot). Thank heavens for the Golden Globes as this comedic gem garnered a trio, including B/P and Actor.

What they both have in common is a wicked, twisted screenplay and solid acting from every character.You can't talk about Tootsie without making specific mention to Dustin Hoffman. At that time, there was not another actor alive who could have tackled that role so brilliantly. The frustrated actor, cross-dressing to get a role to raise money to finance a play that no-one is likely to see, and becoming a national icon without anyone catching on - the premise is ludicrous but Hoffman makes it believable, and even makes you sympathize with him along the way.Every scene in this movie works. From the pie-in-the-face one-liners delivered by Bill Murray, to the wonderful scene near the end when Dustin Hoffman goes to return the engagement ring to his otherwise would-be fiance, the father of the girl he longs for.The best example of just how good the writing is in this movie takes place in a conversation between Hoffman and his agent, played by the movie's Director, Sydney Pollack. By this point, every far-fetched, over the top plot line has been played out. The two characters discuss Hoffman's stressful situation, and in a sense, summarize the movie to that point.

A majority of them struggle their way into limelight by doing any role and every role they are offered. Only those who stand the test of time emerge acquire legendary status. Dustin Hoffman belongs to that elite category.He couldn't deny the fact that Michael Dorsy was Dustin Hoffman himself- the way he had to struggle as an actor, how directors despised his imperiousness. In short, he felt it was a semi-fictional autobiography.Michael Dorsy is a universally rejected actor. Directors despise his improvisation and often end up in heated altercations. He offers tips to fellow aspiring actors on the Do's and Don'ts of acting from his personal experiences. Being unemployed and penniless, he decides to disguise himself as a woman to get a part in a soap opera. Beautifully dressed as a woman, he doesn't shed the man in him and his life as a well-mannered woman who speaks for the rights of women, Dorothy Michaels makes him (or her) the symbol of an ideal woman across America. She is offered a bounty for her role and her fan base explodes. He tries to balance his love for a fellow actress with his on-screen persona and reveals his true-self to the television world one fine day.Whether it's the brilliant script or Sydney Pollack's equally-brilliant direction that made this one of the greatest comedies ever made, is a ridiculous question if one is ignorant of one of the greatest performances of all-time, a performance an actor of Dustin's stature with the filmography- Midnight Cowboy, The Graduate, Kramer vs Kramer, Marathon Man, and Lenny- would deny without a second thought.The movie and Dustin were unfortunately victims of 'Oscar-snubs'. A 10/10.",Tootsie
135,wchngliu,Tootsie Is A Hoot (sie)!,9,21 December 2007,"Dustin Hoffman and Robin Williams have two things in common: 1) they both starred in Steven Spielberg's Peter Pan remake,'Hook' opposite each other as Captain Hook and a grown-up Peter Pan and 2) both actors appeared in drag in Tootsie and Mrs Doubtfire. But whereas Mrs Doubtfire played on sentimentality and comic laughs, Tootsie was a straight out comedy film for much older audiences and yet, this was arguably the original and best.Hoffman plays Michael Dorsey an unemployed actor, who eventually takes on the role and the identity of Dorothy Michaels, who ends up on a soap opera as the character, Emily Kimberly. He shares his apartment with his friend, Jeff played by Bill Murray before he had hit the big time with Ghostbusters. There are also appearances by Sydney Pollock and Geena Davis, of whom was making her debut role in Tootsie. Along the way he falls for his co-star, Julie played by Jessica Lange, whilst experiencing relationship problems of his own with his girlfriend: the neurotic and slightly mad, Stacy. She herself has no idea that Michael has been dressing in women's clothing that when she discovers a dress on the table for instance in one scene, she assumes that Michael is seeing another woman. He tries to convince her that it's not the case, although as the film develops, so does his feelings for Julie as well.It's not long before two other guys have the hots for Dorothy- one of them of whom is Julie's father, and thus complications set in afterwards. Alas, the charade takes a turn towards the end when Michael finally reveals his true identity to everyone.I saw Tootsie for the first time this year when it was on TV and I have also seen Mrs Doubtfire countless times. The similarities and links associated with these two movies are somewhat evident. The thing is that with Mrs Doubtfire, the wisecracks whilst they were humorous became silly but also, it tackled the whole 'drag' theme in a kind of kiddie-friendly-yet in a corny, cheese ball and sugar-coated way that some people found nauseating. Tootsie, in contrast, did so in an intelligent, witty,-yet mature way.Therefore, unlike Daniel/Mrs Doubtfire and Miranda, with Michael/Dorothy and Julie, you really felt for them and the emotions and feelings that they had to deal with each other and Michael's attempts to convince Julie that he does indeed love her. Particularly when Michael suddenly realises his feelings for Julie have become more serious that he is livid- well not that livid but startled when, as Dorothy he sees Julie in the arms of his director, Ron Carlisle. Daniel and Miranda though argued most of the time and to be honest, in Robin Williams and Sally Field, they were miscasted in Mrs Doubtfire, well Sally Field was- but still they didn't look that convincing as a couple on-screen.Dustin Hoffman offers an sterling performance as Michael; his versatility as an actor is as such that he can play almost any part- be it serious or humorous- and still he gives it everything, 9 times out of 10. Yes he is more renowned for doing dramatic film work; the Graduate, Rain Man, Kramer vs Kramer to name but many but its always nice to see him play a character that we generally don't associate him with, and to do it as well as he does in Tootsie and Meet the Fockers. Although with the latter, Hoffman is not at his very best.The closure of the film, disappointed me a little because whilst Michael got his woman, Julie, the way it had unfolded was a slight letdown, given how great the rest of the movie was. Nevertheless, they got together in the end and alas, romance blossoms for the pair.Overall, Tootsie is a wonderful film: amusing, witty, interesting and also subtle too, Dustin Hoffman excels as the guy who becomes a woman. This is more than just a film about drag, it is a definite must-see. Highly recommended.",Tootsie

I never knew he was in this movie and didn't realise he was acting in movies as early as 1982.On a slightly negative note it does take a bit to get going and the cinematography isn't brilliant. Most of the film is obviously filmed in a studio and it did seem a bit low budget at times.But overall this is a belter of a movie!",Tootsie
138,RachelLone,Surprisingly good,9,6 November 1999,"Michael Dorsey (Dustin Hoffman), an idealistic actor who had a reputation for being difficult to work with, had been unemployed for two years (jobs that concerned acting) and therefore working at a restaurant as a waiter in New York City with his room-mate Jeff (Bill Murray). Michael had to raise 8000 dollars immediately for a new play written by Jeff. He disguised himself as a woman to take a female role in a soap, because there seemed to be no other ways to get the money he needed. But Michael didn't know that this would become an unexpectedly educational experience in his life.Later in the film he gradually realized how hard a woman's life could be, people's (especially men's) discrimination, prejudices against women and he also found out that he had been one of the other men who didn't treat women as well as they should had. In the end he became a better person and understood that men and women are people. The ending suggested that men and women should treat one another as friends.""Tootsie"" is a hilarious film, and it also means something more, not just another ordinary (or even hollow) comedy that makes you laugh only.  It is probably the best comedy I've ever seen. A comedy of quality.",Tootsie
139,suzy q123,One of the best!,10,16 May 2001,"Certainly of the 80's. Hoffman is great, so is Jessica Lange and a early performance from Geena Davis. Get the DVD and hear the director talk about the making of this film- it's fascinating. Funny and touching- I particularly liked Charles Durning wooing Dustin Hoffman, and his extreme shame at realizing he's a man. And Bill Murray is just right. An all around good time at the movies.....",Tootsie
140,padawanmovies,Pull the camera back to Cleveland... How do women afford to keep themselves attractive w/o starving. Totally changed my thoughts on this film.,8,21 August 2017,"(SPOILERS AHEAD) Initially I always thought this was jus a funny cross dressing flick; definitely was wrong... This movie gave insight into how genders are viewed by both sexes. It would've been very easy to downplay the directors sexiest attitude: calling the women Toots, Honey; while calling the men by their names, not allowing Julia to give her answer when asked if she wants a bagel, Jon's trying to force himself on Dorothy. It no doubt could've been a movie where being a woman was the sole basis for the comedy but there was a real subtle quality to the funniness. It allowed a man to understand the difficulties of being a woman especially in entertainment where looks r to a fault, seen as more important than talent; in addition to the comedy I believe these r the reasons this movie is viewed so positively. Two slight inquiries I have r how was he able to come up with the idea of becoming a woman so quickly and y on Earth did he agree to sleep with Sandy just bc she caught him with his pants around his ankles (he couldn't find any other justification)???Some of my favorite moments: The absurdity of being asked to walk across a stage while ur dying, the tomato scene in his agents' office, the scene where Mr. Carlisle tries to guide Dorothy out the studio and calls him a macho sh*thead (plus the great line ""power makes women masculine or masculine women r ugly""; hope ppl, men mostly, don't feel that way), the part of how far could they pull the camera back to make her look attractive, the taxi scene where Dorothy's cab was swiped by a guy and she hit him with a shopping bag then threw his suitcase out before yelling thank u (lol), the way Dr. Brewster eyes Dorothy and his cue cards (haha), the photo shoot was Hilarious, when Michael pushes the mime in the park, the line ""I don't like u"" to baby Amy (feel that way about most babies), and of course the big finale: i don't know y the Tangiers part cracks me up and the stammering is Wonderful. It was a great reveal that really makes me enjoy this flick. Believe it's a good portrayal of gender studies since a lot of these mindsets still unfortunately exist.",Tootsie
141,lauraeileen894,"Brilliantly realized, man-in-drag comedy",10,20 December 2006,"Michael Dorsey (Dustin Hoffman) is one of the best actors around. A gifted performer who's dedicated and knowledgeable of his craft, he knows the ins and outs of an actor's life and can capture every nuance of every character he is assigned to play. So how come he hasn't any steady work in almost twenty years? It's because Michael is cursed with an artist's temper, a demanding, know-it-all attitude that makes him a pain to work with. For instance, Michael loses a job in a commercial when he accuses the director of logic problems regarding his part. Michael's role in the commercial? A tomato (""tomatoes don't sit!""). According to his fed-up agent (Sydney Pollack, ""Tootsie""'s director), no one, in New York or even Hollywood, wants to hire Michael. As if that weren't bad enough, Michael is struggling to raise money for his friend Jeff's (Bill Murray, never more deadpan) avant-garde play that he's agreed to star in. When Michael's high-strung, platonic friend Sandy (Teri Garr) loses a part on the soap opera ""Southwest General"", Michael stumbles upon a solution to his problems. No one will hire Michael Dorsey... but surely someone will give ""Dorothy Michaels"" a chance. So with a red wig, lots of makeup, a fake Southern accent, and an outfit fit for a schoolmarm, ""Dorothy"" wins the part of strong-willed Emily Kimberly on ""Southwest General"". Michael's plan is simple: he'll slum it on a hit soap for a season or two, get the money he needs for Jeff's play, and just have ""Dorothy"" disappear into oblivion. Since he's such a good actor, everyone falls for his charade and his portrayal of a strong female character makes ""Dorothy"" a star overnight. Michael is initially thrilled with his newfound success, but it soon brings unexpected difficulties. In his guise as a woman, he is faced with sexual harassment by the show's heartless director (Dabney Coleman, pretty much doing a rehash of his ""9 to 5"" character). Michael is also forced to share love scenes with his fatuous, untalented co-star John Van Horn (George Gaynes), who develops a crush on ""Dorothy"" off-screen. Things are further complicated when Michael falls deeply in love with one of ""Southwest General""'s actresses, the beautiful but insecure Julie (Jessica Lange). Still, they are able to become close friends, even though Michael longs to tell Julie the horrible truth. Julie admires the fun and feisty ""Dorothy""... and so does her widowed father Les (Charles Durning). Michael's life spins even further out of control when the producers want ""Dorothy"" on the show for three more years. He's going to have a hell of a time climbing out of the hole he's dug for himself, and an even harder time trying to win the woman he loves. ""Tootsie"" is easily the best comedy of the '80s. A sophisticated, intelligent update of one of comedy's oldest conventions (men in drag), it's Dustin Hoffman's brightest moment. True, he's not that physically convincing as a woman, but he manages to capture women's mannerisms and quirks so well that with just a little suspension of disbelief, you buy the act. What a shame he didn't win the Oscar. Hoffman's not only a hoot in drag, he brings a lot of depth and character development to Michael, who starts off as a selfish opportunist but who grows into a nicer, more empathetic man who now knows how difficult it is to be a woman. Bill Murray nearly steals the movie as Michael's pretentious, decidedly weird friend whose only goal in life is to have people watch his plays and ask, ""hey, man what was that about?"" The only acting Oscar went to Jessica Lange (for Best Supporting Actress). Though her performance in ""Tootsie"" isn't as compelling as her role in ""Frances"" (coincidentally, she was nominated for the Best Actress statuette that same year for ""Frances""), she really brings a lot of dimension to the typical love interest character. Plus, Lange has excelled in playing hardened femme fatales throughout the years, so it's refreshing seeing her kinder, gentler side. She also never looked lovelier than she does in ""Tootsie"". She and Hoffman have a deliciously tense chemistry, and even though what Michael did was wrong (on so many levels, really), you still want these two to get together. I must make special mention of Teri Garr, who is hilarious and sympathetic as Sandy, who has no idea that Michael is not only in love with someone else, but that he indirectly stole her part on the show. Whenever people mention comedies about cross-dressing, ""Some Like it Hot"" is always mentioned first, followed by ""Mrs. Doubtfire"". If life were fair, ""Tootsie"" would be the undisputed first choice.",Tootsie
142,AuroraLaude,Hilarious!,10,16 June 2021,"One of the best comedies of all-time, which is why it did not win more Academy Awards. Jessica Lange deservedly won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar, but Dustin Hoffman lost to Ben Kingsley for Gandhi, which is a crime. Hoffman is brilliant in his performance as the title role, playing three different characters. Granted, the third characters arrives briefly at the end of the film, but it's still more than Kingsley. Teri Garr and Charles Durning shine in their supporting roles, delivering excellent performances. Bill Murray and Dabney Coleman enhance the comedic narrative to a Hollywood classic.",Tootsie
143,andrewnmiller,A delightful and intelligent comedy.,10,22 December 2014,"When some people think of Tootsie, they probably think of something akin to Mrs. Doubtfire with lots of slapstick and Dustin Hoffman running around in a dress being goofy. Yet when I saw this movie, that's not what I got, I saw a well-layered, well-acted and well directed comedy that had me laughing at every turn but also had quite a bit of heart added to the mix. After watching Tootsie, I wish we had more comedies like this rather than the same dull, unfunny, clichéd comedies nowadays.The film follows a struggling actor named Michael Dorsey who can't seem to stay employed as an actor because of his obsessive attention to detail and that he's too difficult to work with, but when an opening for an admired soup opera presents itself and Michael's friend doesn't get the part of a nurse, he decades to audition and disguises himself as a woman named Dorothy and revives the part. Once on the show, he portrays his character as a spunky commissioner rather than the swooning women the script calls her to be and Dorothy quickly becomes a phenomenon on the show. While he finds it great to be have a regular acting job, Michael's personal life is put to the test. He isolates his girlfriend, is made fun of by his roommate and falls in love with a co-star named Julie who can't find out who he really is or his career is ruined. Things get even more interesting when his co-star's father starts putting the moves on him.Now, some might consider Tootsie to be the first film to address the subject of cross-dressing , however the film is as every moment polished as a film like Some Like It Hot. The charms of Tootsie come in a lot of wide-ranging areas such as how Sidney Pollock's directing moves at a wonderful speed allowing the movie to drift from one great situation to another, like one classic scene where Dorothy haves to watch Julie's daughter, has to go on a date with her father and deal with a co-star who wants her all in the same night, but also how the cast injects the movie with such a sparkle that it comes across as a truly memorable comedy film and it's the energy of everyone involved makes the movie such a joy to watch.When it comes to ensemble casts in comedies, Tootsie has one of the best and all the actors enhance the film with their performances and it seems that in every scene in the movie is a contest to see which actor can steal the scene more. Teri Garr does a superb job as Michael's scatterbrain girlfriend Sandy, who becomes more and more rattled by her boyfriend's ever more odd demeanor, Dabney Coleman is on-point as the detestable director of the show and Julie's boyfriend and Charles Durning brings a bit of charm to the man who falls in love with Dorothy. Also, Sidney Pollock stars as Michael's frustrated agent George and while the quarrels he and Dustin have in the movie clearly echo the issues that happened between the two on the set of the movie, but nonetheless, it's still hilarious to watch them both play off each other. Bill Murray is also wonderful as Michael's relaxed and to the point roommate Jeff. Throughout the course of the movie, it seems at times that he is the more rational person in the room. Murray's deadpan thoughts on the escalating problems in Michael's life are absolutely hysterical along with his reaction where he sees Michael as Dorothy kissing a follow male co-star is one of the funniest lines ever uttered in Bill's entire career. Jessica Lang is also fantastic as Michael's love interest, Julie Nichols, bringing a ton of range to her character and at the same time, showing a more tender and loving side when it is called for. But the cherry on top of this comedic sundae is Dustin Hoffman and while he might not be as believable as a women as say Robin Williams in Mrs. Doubtfire, he's still able to nail a women's body gestures and traits so perfectly, that with some termination of doubt, you understand what's going on. Hoffman's performance as both Michael and Dorothy is rather flawless and not only does he do a splendid job as Michael, but he also no punches as Dorothy and turns into a totally different human in general. Out of all the movies Hoffman has starred in, Tootsie has got to be one of his top three best performances, probably because the character of Michael so expertly nails characteristics of Dustin in his actual life which allows the movie to flow as nicely as it does. It really does anger me that Dustin Hoffman never won an Oscar for his performance in Tootsie, because he was so great in it. Ben Kingsley is a good actor, but Hoffman's performance is this film beats Kingsley's role in Gandhi any day of the week.While Tootsie is a zany comedy, it still does maintain quite a bit of heart, far more so than most modern comedies. It's not just a hysterical pileup of rough goings for the led, but also a moving love story where the love comes naturally rather then just because the plot requires it. There are a ton of character arcs for Michael and Julie but at the heart of the movie is their relationship and everything comes together so beautifully in the final minutes of the film. When Michael takes off his mask on pubic TV and confesses his feelings for Julie, it's both heartfelt and hilarious at the same time.I really can't say anything else about Tootsie, it's a wonderful comedy that provides plenty of laugh-out-lord moments but still has a lot of heart to it. Go watch it already, you'll love it!",Tootsie

146,enmussak,Women's issues for all audiences,9,30 December 2002,"First let me say, that this is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. There's something about deceitful cross dressing (when done well) that makes people laugh.  Some Like It Hot established itself with the same gag. Tootsie was a different movie though, it was far more serious and dealt with feminist issues in a way that wasn't preachy or annoying.  For an example of that check out the abominable Adam's Rib with Tracy and Hepburn.Dustin Hoffman is simply amazing.  He is the reason you are drawn into this movie.  His Dorothy Michaels is so convincing that its hilarious (because you're in on the gag too).  This film is never silly though, because there are well-established relationships between the characters.  Miraculously, the feminist message of the film does not come off as corny as most issue based movies tend to be.  I wouldn't even say this is a feminist film, its many more things at the same time.  That is why it is so effective. 9/10",Tootsie
147,L. Lion,one of the greatest comedies of all time,10,1 March 1999,"This is one of the greatest film comedies of all time.  Interestingly enough, it came out at about the same time as Blake Edward's Victor Victoria, which was another film about cross dressing and also terrific - that time as a woman disguised as a man disguised as a woman.  But whereas V/V was a brilliant screwball period farce, Tootsie has more heart as a story about sexual stereotyping and woman's rights.  The performances are all extraordinary.  Jessica Lange's performance as a sad, self-abusing soap-opera star, who has all the tools for a wonderful life - phenomenal beauty, a good heart, and brains - yet traps herself within the bounds of her boyfriend's definition of what her life should be even though she knows better, is wonderful.  Hoffman pulls off his two roles virtually flawlessly. Even the bit parts, supporting roles, and cameos are done well; Sydney Pollack directs as well as playing the role of Michael's agent.  Bill Murray's turn as Hoffman's roommate is hilarious.  Of lesser note but just as funny is George Gaynes as the aging, lecherous thespian who can't act. An actor who can act playing an actor who can't.  Wonderful.  A great, great film.",Tootsie

His own agent George Fields played by the director Sydney Pollack tells him no one will hire him. It seems whatever job he gets as an actor he is always fighting with people over how the job should be done. So, Michael comes to a crazy conclusion that he should dress up as a woman so no one will be able to tell it is him and try out for a soap called Southwest General. A role that his good friend turned lover Sandy (Teri Garr) tried out for. He is turned into Dorothy Michaels.A wonderful film that hits a lot of marks and strikes a lot of strings, too. It is quite funny with lots of laughs, but it is also sad especially dealing with Julie (Jessica Lange who won an Oscar for her performance) who is on the soap. Hoffman is brilliant, but really so is everyone else in this film. Sensational cast with love triangles everywhere which just adds to its beauty.Also starring Dabney Coleman as Ron the unlikeable director of the soap, Charles Durning (who is really great in his role) as Les the father of Julie, Bill Murray as Jeff, Michael's roommate and Geena Davis in her first role as April who is also on Southwest General.",Tootsie

150,IkuharaKunihiko,A shining comedy,10,3 August 2005,"Michael, an unemployed actor in New York, takes desperate measures by dressing up as a woman called Dorothy Michaels and gets a job at an TV soap opera, where he falls in love with Julie. But how to tell her that he is actually a man...? Winner of 3 Golden Globes ( Best movie comedy/musical, best actors Dustin Hoffman and Jessica Lange ) and one Oscar ( Best actress Jessica Lange ), ""Tootsie"" is a small masterpiece of intelligent comedy, full of emotions, love and interesting observations about the relationship between women and men.-------The situations are deliciously written. Just take the scene where Dorothy is auditioning for the role in the TV soap opera but is turned down because she is ""too soft"". Her response is gold: ""Yes, I know what you want! You want some gross caricature of a woman to prove some idiotic point, like power makes women masculine, or masculine women are ugly...! Well, shame on you, you macho sh*t a**!"" When later asked from the producer if she was just acting when she said that or if she was natural, she responded: ""Which answer will get me the job?"" Needless to say she got the job that instant, and a special place in my heart. But the best scenes are the ones where Dorothy is constantly improvising on the set, like when she was supposed to say to a woman who was beaten up by her man to take a therapy, but instead decided to tell that she would never let a man raise his hand on her( and then she threw a vase of flowers into the wall! ). Wonderful fun! Billy Wilder would be proud!Dustin Hoffman is pure genius, more as a woman then as a man, as are Terri Garr and Bill Murray, before his critical fame with ""Lost in translation"" and ""Broken flowers"". ""Tootsie"" is quite simply a classic all the way through!Grade: 10/10",Tootsie
151,BobbyT24,Simply the best cross-dressing movie of all-time.,10,11 January 2016,"With no disrespect for the classic, ""Some Like It Hot"", I love ""Tootsie"" even more. While ""Some Like It Hot"" was designed for laughs and had Billy Wilder at the helm of a fantastic movie, ""Tootsie"" was a comedy set in real-life situations without the intention of getting a cheap laugh at anyone's expense. It's still marvelous these many decades later.In today's movies, cross-dressing has become a punch line. It has become so time-worn that if the character isn't flaming gay, people don't ""get"" the character. That's why this movie has been all but forgotten for the ground-breaking skill and imagination it took for a very straight Dustin Hoffman to inhabit the body and female persona of ""Dorothy Michaels"". The desperation he portrayed on screen is as real as it gets for out-of-work actors in that profession. He was willing to do ANYTHING for a role. He knocked it out of the park. For those of you too young to have seen the periodicals of the day, Hoffman was borderline nominated for an Academy Award in BOTH the Best Actor AND Best Actress category. He was simply that special. Some people believed voters were confused as to whether to vote him in as Best Actor or write him in as Best Actress. He was that compelling. The fact he lost to Ben Kingsley for ""Gandhi"" and was nominated with the likes of Jack Lemmon, Paul Newman, & Peter O'Toole tells you just how competitive a field with which he was competing.This movie is special not because of how funny it is. It is special because while they were making this cross-gender story, the entire cast and crew treated the subject matter with grace, class and seriousness. Director Sidney Pollack makes a point in his retrospective on the DVD of how there wasn't a single laugh on the entire set during the shooting. The only laughs they heard where once the movie was screened for a live audience.Dustin Hoffman plays both characters of Michael Dorsey and Dorothy Michaels with such passion, energy and honesty, you would never know it wasn't the real Hoffman out there on screen. In reading about this movie, I understood Hoffman even started relating to women more on an honestly level than superficially as he had done his entire life up to the making of this movie. When you have an actor who tells us that before the movie was made, he wouldn't have spoken to the woman/character he portrayed simply because he/she wasn't pretty enough and that he regretted not speaking to other non-attractive women who were interesting people... It tells you this character touched his soul. Plus you have one of the most accomplished supporting casts in recent history. Teri Garr (Oscar-nominated for this role), Jessica Lange (Oscar-winner for this role), Bill Murray, Dabney Coleman, Charles Durning, George Gaynes, Geena Davis (her first role), Estelle Getty (in cameo before she was famous), Sidney Pollack as the agent... Simply ""WOW!!!"" casting. The payoff at the end of the movie with each and every character getting their own reaction on film is a revelation in movie direction. Pollack deserved more than just a nomination for this masterwork.There's nothing about the movie that isn't stated in the reviews on this site. The clothes, hairstyles and music may be a bit dated now since it's original 1982 date. However, the concept and the frustrations/humor/flawless execution are as pertinent today as they ever were. If you haven't watched it, please do. You won't be sorry. And if you are like me and have watched it more times than you can count, please stand with me for my standing ovation for a true classic movie. This one is near-perfection. Easily 10 out of 10.",Tootsie
152,silva-w-pius,transvestite-tastic comedy caper,7,22 May 2014,"What do Midnight Cowboy, Kramer vs Kramer and the Graduate have in common, if you don't know already because you haven't seen any of those films, and then you my friend are in bad need of Netflix, otherwise as you are going to go through life always feeling like that there is a small part of you missing. What those films all have in common is the fantastic, electrifying and unpredictable acting juggernaut that is Dustin Hoffman. Claiming to love cinema and at the same time not having seen a Hoffman film, would be like going to Disney land and not seeing Mickey Mouse or meeting the President of America and not asking him if area 51 exits, because it simply means you're missing put on the best part! The multitalented Sydney Pollack (Out of Africa) directs this transvestite-tastic comedy caper about a talented actor called Michael (Dustin Hoffman) who lives in new York, but despite his years of experience still can't land a gig because he thinks he knows better than everyone else, so one day to boost his chances of success he decides to adopts an identity as a women to gain a role in a local TV soap opera, oh damn I mean day time drama, going by the name of Dorothy, much to the bemusement of his house mate Jeff (Bill Murray) and his agent George (Sidney Pollack). Things start of great, Dorothy proves to be an instant hit on the show; she is loud, confident and vivacious, much to enjoyment of all the female fans of the show, whilst being to the annoyance of her womanising director Ron. But things quickly get a whole lot more complicated as a massive love triangle, with his fellow cast members and best friend soon manifests itself with the potential of creating a lot of broken hearts. Clearly in the same mould as Some Like it Hot, where cross dressing is involved, but while SLH nailed the love triangles with such humorous precision, I felt the ones in Tootsie were far too complicated and drawn out as if the writers ran out of material and used them as filler for dead space. I also didn't like how the most entertaining characters were marginalised, they had a great comedic weapon in Bill Murray yet they refused to exploit for all its laugh inducing potential and I would have preferred to have seen a whole lot more of Sandy. Ultimately I felt the film was just another imitator of SLH, although competent in its own right, it just didn't give you anything fresh and unique. Not the best of Hoffman's CV, but certainly way above the worst (cough, cough Meet the Fockers and Runaway Jury)",Tootsie

I found Tootise however to be low grade, patronising garbage on just about every level. I'm aware it's a comedy (well, duh) but the whole tone of the film is as mercilessly shallow and inane as the average Adam Sandler movie. It just isn't funny. All the characters squawk around like wind-up dummies, oblivious to the obvious, and react to utterly implausible situations like hypnotised zombies. The whole thing gets repetitive and boring too early, and lost me well before the end. Even a fine musical score by soundtrack king Dave Grusin can't save this pretentious, hammy mess from its own campy stupidity.

154,faterson,"I Really Love You, But I Can't Love You",7,22 April 2008,"A great comedy, no doubt, but perhaps lacking a trifle more to transcend the genre even more impressively, and to be ranked among the very greatest movies *as such*, independently from the genre it belongs to. It is certainly entertaining and fun to watch from start to finish. What else could you expect from a movie starring two of the greatest American actors of all time: Dustin Hoffman and Charles Durning? (They were to repeat their collaboration 3 years later, to an even more impressive effect, in the 1985 definitive screen version of Arthur Miller's classic ''Death of a Salesman''.) Plus, Bill Murray is another icon, of course. Sydney Pollack himself, the movie's director, is hilarious as the egomaniacal TV producer. True, there were a few moments where you could see the film-makers were trying to evoke a few cheap laughs from the audience; such as the baby throwing food at Dustin Hoffman in disguise; or Dustin struggling with his women's apparel, much reminiscent of Tony Curtis's similar afflictions in _Some Like It Hot_. However, apart from such upper-layer, obvious comedic moments, there were others, truly unforgettable ones: such as, when Michael delivers ""the perfect line"" to his beloved girl, only to receive the content of the girl's drink in her face; now *that*'s what illustrates the difference between theory and practice so picturesquely. What's more, the screenwriters *repeat* that amazing feat once again later in the movie's action; with Michael again, but another girl; and the other girl's hysterical shriek upon learning the truth -- the very thing she had demanded to hear from Michael a few moments ago -- is one of the movie's greatest moments. So is the line delivered by her following her shriek: ""I can't take this s*it from friends -- only from lovers."" Yet *another* way to powerfully illustrate the difference between theory and practice -- as experienced by women. And, it's admirable that both of these unforgettable scenes and women's explosions center around their love interests; yes *love* is the movie's central theme; and there is at least one immortal moment of insuperable greatness in _Tootsie_. That is when, appropriately stuttering and rolling her big eyes, the beautiful Jessica Lange impeccably delivers the wondrous line, ""I really love you, but I can't love you."" That is a line of genius; in no other sentence has the paradox of love been better captured; or the paradox of humans using language and words that are woefully inadequate and imprecise -- such as the verb ""to love"" that involves so many meanings, some of them contradictory, that Jessica Lange can deliver her line and this line can seem perfectly logical *and* impossible at the very same time! The actors' performances are uniformly excellent. And there's a nice touch towards the end, when we see Bill Murray reading an ultimate tough guy's novel (a Dashiell Hammett book) in a movie that purports to examine the nature and essence of femininity.",Tootsie
155,bbSouthstreet,Actors and writers rake in the chips,10,23 January 2006,"This weekend, if you feel like having a piece of popcorn entertainment, make it a good run for the money by buying tickets to Sydney Pollack's new film Tootsie, a story about a job that requires the most greed, acting, sorry to anyone who believed it was a gig at a Las Vegas casino. But really, this person must be really self-conceited if he thinks that dressing up like a woman will really get him calls from casting agencies. Of course, as a Hollywood story would have it, the plan works but slowly unravels like a cheaply made tapestry. The story is a poorly made fairy tale about how a ridiculous plan always works and when it falls to pieces and the guy gets the girl. But it is not the story itself that makes this movie a winner. It is the actors playing the characters in this guilt-ridden fable.In this story we have Oscar winning actor, Dustin Hoffman playing Michael Dorsey, an out of work actor who is getting no slack from his talent agent played by director, Sydney Pollack. Michael also has his experimental and often quirky roommate played by Bill Murray. There is also Michael's love interest, played by the brilliant Jessica Lange. The story may sound ridiculous but we have the actors that reel in the audience. Dustin Hoffman, a magnificent actor if I do say so myself, I remember when the world really got a taste of him in Kramer vs. Kramer, which got him his first win as best male actor in a lead role. To be honest, anybody could play this role, John Candy could've played a role like this even Jerry Lewis, but none of them could project the charm that Hoffman gives us in this film. Then there is Sydney Pollack, who plays Michael's talent agent. The lines written for the agent were witty and hysterical and who knows how to give witty and hysterical lines better than the director himself? When Pollack said the lines, ""YOU WERE A TOMATO,"" I couldn't help it but I had to laugh it up because the delivery by Pollack is just gold. There is also the ravishing Jessica Lange who plays actress Julie Nichols, who is also Michael's love interest in this story. Most Hollywood movies of today cast no-talent blondes with bosoms as big as a man's head to play love interests but this time we have a woman with substance to play the part. A woman who uses words to express herself, not shaking her breasts to receive rave reviews by the male critics, a woman who is smart and articulate to play a role in a movie, a woman named Jessica Lange. Then there is the surprise cast member, Mr. Bill Murray, also known as the Ghostbuster, Carl the grounds keeper and Tripper Harrison. It has been reported that Mr. Murray asked not to have his name mentioned in the trailer or any other advertisements because people would mistake this as one of his comedies. But a man such as myself was rather surprised to see Bill Murray's name in the opening titles and more surprised when I didn't see him eating a Babe Ruth candy bar from out of the pool. The players in the story were an educated pick to make this story a hit, but there were also the writers who gave us the witty dialog.Larry Gelbart, the writer to the hilarious George Burns comedy Oh God!, returns to save a clichéd story with snappy and witty dialog to make the audience laugh. When Bill Murray's character came up and said, ""I don't like when somebody comes up to me the next day and says, ""Hey, man, I saw your play. It touched me; I cried."" I like it when a guy comes up to me a week later and says, ""Hey, man, I saw your play... what happened?"" I thanked the lord himself that Larry Gelbart was here to give this movie the humorous dialog it needed. There was also dialog that was more dramatic and thought provoking, for example this quote from Dustin Hoffman, ""I don't believe in hell. I believe in UNEMPLOYMENT, but not hell,"" this line made me think that Gelbart reached into my brain and wrote it down on a piece of paper that happened to be a page to the script of Tootsie.Tootsie, is a story about greed, courage, self-discovery and, what every movie needs, love. Basically, what every movie nowadays already has, very clichéd. Please, by all means, do not see this movie for its story but for great acting done by Dustin Hoffman, Jessica Lange, Sydney Pollack and Bill Murray. But let us not forget where the words coming out of their mouths come from, Larry Gelbart the screen writing genius. So when you go to the theaters to see Tootsie, be ready for a night of entertainment.",Tootsie
156,tupungato,A Special Film (in its time),9,6 September 2012,"The last time I watched Tootsie (early in 2012) I actually came away from the experience feeling a little depressed. No specific scene got me down this time, nor did the behavior or personality of any character. No particular performance disappointed me either. In my eyes the story remained the same. My reaction to Tootsie, however, had definitely changed.I gave Tootsie a high rating based on the effect the movie had on me the first time I saw it within a few months of its release. The various characters in supporting roles delivered clever lines naturally, Dustin Hoffman played a difficult part convincingly, and the writers presented social issues intelligently. Tootsie received awards and deserved them.Older movies don't show their age all at once. As a story about actors and acting, television production and direction, scripts and improvisation, Tootsie has not lost any appeal. As a story about romance, it hasn't become entirely dated either. Because the nature of relationships (despite the communication afforded by cell phones and computers) between men and women has evolved little since Tootsie -- many men still pursue women for sex, and women live to regret their choices -- Sandy's (Terri Garr) overly accommodating approach and frustrations regarding Michael Dorsey (Dustin Hoffman) and Ron's (Dabney Coleman) macho style in his less than ethical romance with Julie (Jessica Lange) remain relevant. Michael Dorsey's astute words at the end of the film, in fact, when he tells Julie in a final effort to win her over that he knows much better now how to treat women because he has lived as one, still sound profound.I don't consider women's struggles to gain understanding and respect from men, whether in social, professional, or political settings, then, as an issue that has had its time, but I do think that humorous films that feature men who carry on double lives by dressing and conducting themselves as women have lost much of their power to suspend disbelief.",Tootsie
157,FatPhil,Hoffman is always good - but cannot save this dated nonsense,4,17 November 2004,"An exceptionally dated film - stuck right in the 80s. Chock full of hackneyed films about the performing arts clichés. Chock full of schlocky music. And due to that soundtrack is sometimes even feels like Hills Street Blues without the cops. It's _that_ 80s.If you're prepared to turn off your brain, and just let the slapstick roll over you, you'll probably enjoy it. Don't look for deep, though. Take the cheap laughs when offered them.Not annoying enough to make me turn off, but not one I'd watch again, and would actually try to avoid.FatPhil",Tootsie
158,jamdonahoo,this film is not a drag,9,6 February 2007,"Tootsie is a classic. Hoffman, Murray, Coleman, Garr and company create a laugh out loud movie. There are many great lines in the film and Sid Pollack's scene with Dorothy in the old Russian Tea Room is priceless. The Russian Tea Room was on 57th street and Dustin changed for the scene in a nearby apartment. When he was coming down on the elevator he noticed Jose Ferrer on the elevator. To test his costume and makeup he asked Ferrer' "" I heard you were not circumcised, Mr Ferrer, is that true?"" Ferrer did not recognize Hoffman and thought he was trapped by an unbalanced woman . He was getting panicked when Hoffman identified himself and they both had a good laugh",Tootsie
159,KMR,Don't forget Teri Garr,10,6 December 1999,"I love this movie--one of the best modern comedies ever. As wonderful as everyone in the cast is -- Dustin Hoffman, Bill Murray, Sydney Pollack, et al -- special mention should be made of Teri Garr, who manages to steal every scene she's in here. I still think she should have gotten the Best Supporting Actress Oscar over Jessica Lange (who was, in fact, the Leading Lady), but that's just me. I can watch this one over and over and I never get tired of it. Major-but-hardly-fatal debits: the totally bland, muzak-cum-lite-jazz score by Dave Grusin, augmented with a pair of cheesy Stephen Sills ballads (the ""Roll Tootsie Roll"" song in particular is pretty dire). Overlooking those unfortunate musical choices, this movie is about as perfect a comedy as you are likely to find.",Tootsie
160,elwinter,"Actor cross-dresses to find work, causes much mayhem and becomes a better man",9,20 October 2002,"Dustin Hoffman plays a ""difficult"" out-of-work actor, who dresses as a woman and auditions for a soap opera out of desperation.  He gets the part, and his deception leads to a bewildering array of complications: He falls for another cast member (played by Jessica Lange), her father falls for him, an acting friend is depressed she didn't get the part herself, and so on. The scene where the soap must broadcast live, and his character unveils him/herself  to the astonishment of all, is perhaps one of the funniest moments in film.  Being a comedy, all ends well.  Hoffman has commented he was disappointed he didn't make a better looking ""woman"".",Tootsie
161,McQueen1980,Starts well but Jessica Lange ruins it,5,19 June 2019,"The concept starts well enough when we are introduced to loser actor Michael Dorsey (Hoffman) and his agent (pollack) and roommate (Murray) among others . Michael needs to raise money for a play so he dresses up as a woman to get an acting job in a soap and ironically falls for an actress Jessica Lange , oh my god that woman is detestable and she nearly ruins the movie. One example is she tells Dorothy she wants a guy to come up to her tell she's really interesting and that he would love to make love to her. What happens? Michael Dorsey does that almost as instructed at a house party out on a balcony and Lange throws water in his face ! What a xxxx and it's never explained why she did that or mentions it to Dorothy afterwards. I never saw any reason that Michael Dorsey via Dorothy would fall in love with the detestable Jessica Lange which undermines the whole movie and the last scene. I mean he still chases her down the street after she had punched him in the stomach! Go figure",Tootsie

Sympathize with Sydney Pollack.  Pine for Jessica Lange and Geena Davis.Then throw all of that away.

163,zwrite2,Well-written story overcomes very bad disguise,8,24 July 2008,"Whenever I see a man pretending to be a woman in a movie or vice-versa, I can't stop thinking ""are you kidding me?"" Whether it's Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon in ""Some Like It Hot"" or Greta Garbo in ""Queen Christina,"" I just can't accept that people around them are fooled by very bad disguises.""Tootsie"" is no different. Dustin Hoffman was superb as Michael Dorsey, but he was just not credible as Dorothy Michaels. ""Dorothy"" just doesn't look, talk, nor dress like any woman I've ever seen.Besides, Dorsey  like the Curtis, Lemmon and Garbo characters  acts stupid. You'd think he'd breathe a sigh of relief after each work day that he wasn't unmasked. Instead, he dramatically increases his chances of getting caught by spending a weekend as a woman with Jessica Lange's Julie Nichols character, not inventing a boyfriend so men won't pursue him/her, and stunningly, uttering a pickup line as Dorsey to Nichols that Nichols told Michaels she wanted to hear.Nichols was beyond dumb not to realize Michaels was Dorsey. Even their names were very similar. And how could no one working for the soap opera he/she acted on nor the magazine and TV reporters who interviewed him/her not be suspicious of a middle-aged person with no proof of a pre-soap opera life?Given my history of cynicism, though, I have to accept that I will never find cross-dressing disguises credible and judge ""Tootsie"" by other criteria, including its many funny scenes. The best laughs occur while Dorsey is talking to his roommate (played by Bill Murray) or his agent (played by Sydney Pollack). Murray and Pollack, the movie's director, are superb.The best thing about ""Tootsie,"" though, is that its well-written script has a lot of heart. While pretending to be a woman, Dorsey inspires other women on the soap opera to be more assertive and less accepting of misogynistic behavior by standing up to men and he transforms his TV character into someone who inspires females around the U.S. to become more independent. Being treated as an inferior as Michaels also gives Dorsey a new perspective that makes him more respectful toward women.Dorsey also exhibits heart by choosing friends over wealth. He only wants to make enough money in TV to ensure that a play written by Murray will be produced and give a financially struggling friend played by Teri Garr a co-starring role. Thus, Dorsey wants to leave the soap opera although it could make him rich.The story also sets up a lot of interesting character conflicts, including an overall man vs. woman conflict. Since Dorsey is both, his internal battle as he pursues a woman as a man, spurns two men as a woman, wrestles with how to treat Garr as she pursues a relationship with him that he is not interested in, and hides his identity while dressed as a woman is the most compelling conflict.The conflict between a macho director played by Dabney Coleman and Michaels is probably the most interesting external conflict, but there are several other examples of women challenging men. The conflicts lure viewers deeper into the story and make us more interested in what happens to Hoffman, Lange, Coleman, Murray, Garr, and Charles Durning, who plays Lange's father.If I had seen a movie where a man credibly posed as a woman, I would harshly penalize ""Tootsie"" in my rating. I haven't so I will have to focus on the fact that the story, dialogue, comedy, acting, and character conflicts are almost good enough to give ""Tootsie"" a 9.I deducted one point because Dorsey should have been smarter around Nichols, she should have been more suspicious about Michaels, and the climactic speech was way too convoluted. I gave ""Tootsie"" an 8. ZWrite",Tootsie
164,peterlonglongplong,Romantic Comedy - dated,5,20 January 2009,"I'll rate this as a decent movie. It's worth watching, though it's a one time is enough for me. Now what is it with the AFI? They gave this a #2 spot out of the funniest movies ever in Hollywood's history??? What kind of a joke is that? This movie was voted on by """"""experts"""""" as being better & funnier than Dr. Strangelove, Blazing Saddles, Airplane, Harold & Maude, Animal House, Silver Streak, Caddyshack. You've got to be kidding? Most of the movies under Tootsie are better, The Odd Couple, The Apartment, It's a Mad, Mad, etc. There are so many great movies that are better than & funnier than Tootsie that are not even acknowledged by AFI; Trading Places, Kentucky Fried Movie, Bad News Bears, all of the Pee Wee movies, Friday, both of the Parent Trap movies, quite a few Hitckcock movies. I've got to stop counting the better movies. It might change my opinion on Tootsie as being decent. Who, in their right mind, as members of this ""AFI"", even do this voting???",Tootsie
165,rbylakx,"Terrific Film!!! Funny, Intelligent and Full of Heart. (SPOILERS)",10,10 February 2015,"Tootsie is a wonderfully told story about Michael Dorsey (Dustin Hoffman), a twenty-year down on his luck perfectionist, self serving, struggling actor who is told in no uncertain terms by his agent that he will never work as an actor in either New York City or in Hollywood again, so he decides to dress up as a woman named Dorothy Michaels and auditions for a hit soap opera and gets the job. Now he must maintain the facade for as long as he is under contract and risk alienating himself from the many friends he has who he must keep the secret from, and the new people he has now developed personal relationships with as Dorothy on the set, including his pretty and talented co-star who he has fallen deeply in love with.Michael Dorsey is a deeply complex character. To quote him, ""He busts his ass to get every audition right"", but in the process he has become that ""difficult actor"" that directors don't wish to work with. Michael hasn't worked on a paid acting gig in a couple years, so to make ends meet he teaches an acting class, waiters at a local restaurant, and does free theater. He has celebrated a birthday and seeing himself get older and not achieve the success he thought he would have attained by now has left him feeling inadequate. He is selfish even if he insists that he never does his acting work for the great reviews. His next great venture is to get his roommate's play produced for eight thousand dollars for him and his best friend, Sandy, to star in. Michael is desperate which lends to the credibility that he would go to any lengths to book a gig and make some money. Even so far as to secretly dress up like a woman and work on a soap opera.The only two people in on Michael's secret are his quirky roommate, Jeff, (Bill Murrary) who prefers people not like his play, but rather question ""What happened?"", and his overworked agent (Sydney Pollack) who insists that Michael seek some therapy. Sandy (Teri Garr) is an actress and Michael's best friend of six years who has her own deep seeded issues of inadequacy and insecurity. All the while longing for acceptance and insisting she receive her pain and rejection from her male lovers upfront rather than prolong the agony over a period of time. Due to some mitigating circumstances that leaves Michael caught red handed trying on some of Sandy's dresses, he lies and says he wants her sexually and she agrees. Michael never tells Sandy about him dressing up as a woman to work on a soap opera because she was up for the same exact role and was told she wasn't right for it, thus complicating the lies Michael has to make up to not see her because of his busy soap opera schedule.Dorothy Michaels is Michael's female alter ego. The talented actor that Michael is allows him to portray Dorothy with a sweet southern charm and personality, but the man that Michael is gives Dorothy a male foundation which comes across as a strong, take no nonsense kind of woman who speaks her mind. To the surprise of everyone, including Michael, Dorothy Michaels becomes a huge soap star that receives thousands of fan mail per week. Dorothy's persona positively intrigues Rita, the soap's main executive producer and befuddles Ron (Dabnet Coleman), the show's womanizing director who doesn't understand why Dorothy is not only immune to his charms, but also doesn't like him.Julie (Jessica Lange) is the talented, gorgeous single mom and the soap opera's biggest star who becomes Dorothy's best friend and confidant. She is dating Ron much to Michael's dismay, who witnesses how sexist and disrespectful Ron is towards Julie and every woman on set, much like how Michael is in his real life. All Michael/Dorothy can do is be a friend and keep giving good advice to Julie about being a strong woman who stands up for herself, and in the process Michael falls in love with Julie. To further complicate matters, Julie's dad, Les, (Charles Durning) has developed an infatuation with Dorothy after a few meetings together and proposes marriage.During this entire process, Michael has developed a deep level of guilt at the continuous lies he is forced to commit knowing that the truth of who he is will eventually come out hurting a lot of people who trusted and cared for him. He has also learned that the man he once was wasn't always the nicest or best person to be with especially around women. In a rather fortuitous and desperate attempt at making amends, Michael/Dorothy is forced to perform a soap scene live in front of the camera for the world to see and decides to disrobe and let the truth be known to all that he is not a woman, but in fact a man.In conclusion, Tootsie is one of those laugh out loud, touching, moving and human films that is easy to connect with and leaves you wanting to know more as the movie progresses. Everyone who got to know and interact with the Dorothy persona has become a better person including Michael. The once sad and selfish character that Michael is in the beginning of the film has become this deeper, likable and more human character by films end. One can't help but feel good that Michael and Julie do wind up together in the end because the Michael of old one would figure would have somehow ruined the relationship, while this new humbled and experienced Michael has the great potential to have a long lasting loving relationship with Julie.Tootsie stands the test of time and continues to be relevant and funny today as it was back when it first premiered in the early 1980's. Highly recommend!!",Tootsie

167,waynec50,One of the best film comedies ever,10,17 February 2006,"""Tootsie"" is that rarity, an extremely funny movie that doesn't drop down to the lowest common denominator. This is a story, that while somewhat off the wall is believable. The characters' motivations are plain as day, from Michael/Dorothy taking on a feminine persona to work in the soap, to Julie and Sandy's relationship to Michael/Dorothy. Dustin Hoffman is at his peak in the dual role, Jessica Lange is beautiful as Julie, Terri Garr is sweet and loyal as Sandy, and Charles Durning as fantastic as Les, Julie's Dad and Dorothy's suitor. The supporting cast is also top notch, featuring Dabney Coleman as the smarmy soap director, George Gaynes as a hammy soap doctor, Geena Davis in her big screen debut as a soap opera ingenue, and Sidney Pollack as Michael's agent among others. Bill Murray is hilarious as Michael's roommate, who helps with his deceptions and disguises, even though Bill didn't want a top billing. There are several hilarious scenes, my favorite is the one where Dorothy forces John Van Horn (George Gaynes) to look at her instead of the teleprompter. If you're looking for a real comedy that won't insult your intelligence, this is one for you.",Tootsie
168,DoctorHver,Dustin Hoffman massquenders as Woman to get film role,3,10 August 2020,"This film is such a bore, men dressed as woman are horribly unfunny. I don't think need to explain way but I have always felt that men dressing up as women completly miss the point of what's actually means to be a woman its not feeling or look. The Dorothy Michaels part of Hoffman's character obvious comes of as your stereotypical woman but thats unfortunetly how many men tend view women. Which is afwully sexist if you ask me.
But still not going to lie Hoffman does live up to his reputation but the funny thing is looking at his filmogrpahy it turns out that Mr Hoffman hadn't had a filmrole since Kramer vs. Kramer (1979) and didn't have another aftor Tootsie until Death of a Salesman (1985) so maybe Hoffmand was indeed deserate for another filmrole so he decided to masquender as woman in film about actor who masquender as woman.",Tootsie

As Dorothy, (s)he is direct and strong willed and one can easily understand why the viewers of the TV series love her. As Michael Dorsey he is less sure and got his whole life messed up. Can't think of anything I didn't like about it. Easily recommended to a large audience.",Tootsie

I feel discomfort in his performance. Although this film had serious scenes, it made me smile once in a while so that I was not bored with it. This title also has humor. Watching the peculiar man who dressed up as a woman, I felt that it was fresh because I have never been disguised as a woman. In addition, there is another thing I learned. To have desperate efforts to do what we want is important and wonderful. For example, Michael Dorsey was fired from his job, but he decided to apply for the role of a woman in one drama none the less. This is just his passion to act the part even if he must become a woman. As a whole, I like this movie.",Tootsie

I thought that Dustin Hoffman expresses a woman by how to speak or way of standing, so I felt that Dorothy is a different person to Dorsey. also, I wonder that when Dorsey says something to someone, I felt these are sarcastic, but when Dorthy says something, I felt she has strong belief. I was attracted to her. Second, this genre of this movie is comedy, so I enjoyed myself. This movie makes us laugh and keep us in suspense. Third, I thought this movie express human growth of Dorsey through Dorothy and by involving with Julie. I think that initial Dotsey is different to Dorsey at last.

He has a profound effect on a lot of people as he always is himself. Also, he falls in love with co-actress through performance.

So he is held in deep antipathy by some companies. However, he becomes famous as an actress by chance. Then, he meets a popular actress - Julie, and they make friends. In this film Michel notices true love by performing as a woman. At the beginning he has everything his way, but he changes in mental state when he meets Julie.

However, while giving a helping hand to Julie, a single-mother actress in the drama with him, he comes to love her This film keeps me watching the whole time due to whether Dorsey's disguise is revealed to others or not. A technique for being a woman such as feminine sign, a way of talking and makeup must be difficult for a man. Yet, Dorsey, Dustin Hoffman, completely performs the woman's part well without any doubt by others characters in the film, and even he attracts a couple of men.

His performance is so brilliant and attractive that it seems like another actor stars as Dorothy Michaels. Dorothy is a strong-minded and brisk woman. The personality is characteristic and impressive with the audience. I think this original and eccentric personality was required for woman at this age. In this film, at first, he has a purpose to need a job, but in the end, he falls in love with Julie who struggles to handle both her career and raising her baby.

He needs a lot of money to play in a theater with his play companions, so he pretends a woman, and he appears in a TV drama. This movie focuses on the complicated mixtures of a lot of characters' feelings. I was impressed with the feelings of a woman who is at the mercy of the man's act. I can understand that she adores him first, but she would like to build a better relationship with him after that her voice, expression, and action. I was also interested in the change of the way of expressing her feelings. First, she is weak at describing him anger, but she can get angry fiercely through his bad treatment. Moreover, it was memorable that the worry of a woman who is a single mother and has a boyfriend who has a tendency to cheat. I can know her feelings that she would like to trust him, but she cannot do that completely through communication with him. After she says goodbye to her boyfriend, her expression conveys her sadness and distress whether her decision is right or not deeply to me. I like this movie since I can feel the transition of the feelings of many characters. I can also understand to live honestly from his situation that tells a lot of lies to many people, so he loses a job.",Tootsie

Dustin Hoffman gives one of his best performances as Michael/Dorothy and he was def. Oscar worthy but he was overshadowed by the powerful Ben Kingsley who did deserve his Oscar IMO.Jessica Lange was good but there was no way she deserved her Oscar win.

179,bachispicaqtmz,Like a real woman,8,6 July 2017,"This movie is breathtaking. I was wondering when Michael's true identity come out to others. I think this is a kind of suspense movie because the audience knows that Dorothy and Michael are the same person, but other characters in this film do not know this fact. The most impressive scene for me was that Dorothy comes back home after shopping and said being a woman is tough. Michael was selfish and seemed to be poor at treating woman until he started to disguise himself as an woman. He realizes how women are different from him and how they make an effort to keep themselves beautiful and attractive by putting on makeup and dressing up. Through pretending to be Dorothy, he becomes sensitive to how Julie or Sandy feels. The scene when Dorothy tries to hail a taxi by Michael's deep voice makes me laugh. His avoiding kissing from John and dancing with Julie's father are also amusing. This is because we can see that these men do not notice Dorothy is a man and predict how their reactions would be when they know his identity.",Tootsie

182,spencer10,Hollywood has never made a better comedy than this. An American Masterpiece.,10,22 November 2007,"I cannot believe it has been 25 years since ""Tootsie"" was first released in 1982. I was not alive then and there have been many funny movies from the last 25 years. But I guarantee you none of them were as original, as hilarious and as entertaining as ""Tootsie"". It might be my love for Dustin Hoffman as an actor but I have never seen a better comedy than this. This was also rehashed sort of as ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" 11 years later and that film was a terrific story and was excellent in its own way. But it did not have the entertainment or comedy value of ""Tootsie"". I also think with the exception of ""E.T."" there was not a better film in 1982 and I think it is ridiculous that the Academy gave ""Gandhi"" Best Picture when that Oscar most definitely belonged to either ""E.T."" or this. That was a huge mistake. I also don't like the fact that people when they want to watch a comedy watch some dumb and mindless garbage when they can be watching terrific entertainment like this. This is not mindless but you do not have to overly think. I also have not seen Sydney Pollack do a better film and if it had not been for ""The Graduate"" or ""E.T."" ""Tootsie without a doubt would have been my all-time favorite movie. I also think Dustin Hoffman should have picked up his second Oscar for this rather than ""Rain Man"". Yes he was terrific in that movie, but there has never been one actor who dresses up as a woman and has played a woman to perfection like Dustin Hoffman. Jessica Lange also deserved her Oscar for this as well. I urge you if you have not seen this get a copy of it immediately. I mean sure Will Ferrell and Adam Sandler might come out with another good movie coming up but it will not be to perfection like ""Tootsie"". Simply put there is no other way to describe this film other than an American masterpiece.",Tootsie
183,Streetballa,Like a tree that grows halfway and then dies,4,5 August 2008,"The movie built good themes. It set up strong plot points. And then, it branched into the worst possible direction. Add to this the deadwood thrown in solely for the purpose of soliciting cheap laughs and you can't help but be disappointed once it's over.As a comedy, there are laughs, but they are spaced out intermittently. Much of the comedy came from the awkward moments of tension from the natural flow the movie. It could have stood on it's own, but they decided to keep in about 30 minutes of dead end gags which just make the movie feel crassly commercial. The main story arc goes completely unresolved, and you feel like the protagonist has learned nothing by the time the movie is over. It's harder to get a more shallow feeling from a so-called ""happy"" ending.If you want a deep romantic comedy, watch Groundhog Day instead.",Tootsie
184,Drew48,An Oldie but a Goodie!,9,23 September 2008,"I had the good fortune of revisiting this film recently and I had forgotten a lot of the detail. Suffice to say it is a water tight and flawless script, the pace of comedy and emerging anxst is perfectly timed. The story involves Hoffman as a good but ""difficult"" actor, struggling to find work and love in the Big Apple. His success rate at both tasks is becoming evermore elusive and impossible. After a disaster of a Birthday Party in which his dilemmas are acutely focused, he consoles himself by helping a struggling female friend and actor, to prepare for an audition; the part of a hospital soap matriarch. When the friend fails to get the part the idea to try himself as herself emerges. Truly brilliant themes are comedically explored, sexual politics, self identity and exploration and the equality of the difficulties of being either male or female emerge. Made all the more powerful by it's lead performances, Hoffman and Lang are outstanding, the film is also strengthened by having being made in the 80's; the ultimate sexual politics era! A must see, you'll miss ""Dorothy"" just like Lang does!",Tootsie

Yeah, me too. What happened? If you're in the mood for a great movie that will get you to cough up a boatload of honest laughs, then you ain't gonna do better than TOOTSIE. You are not going to find a better written, acted, and directed comedy anywhere. There are plenty as good - but none better. This is a career highpoint for all involved, and when ""all"" includes names such as Sydney Pollack and Dustin Hoffman, you know that's a sentiment that carries some significant weight.

186,Tabitha Lenox,One of my favorite movies,10,9 February 2003,"This movie is one of the greatest classics of all time, regardless of what some people think. Dustin Hoffman delivers one of the best performances of any actor/actress. Robin Williams' portrayal as a 60 year old housekeeper 11 years later wasn't bad, but doesnt compare to a middle aged, outspoken southern belle.My favorite lines: Dorothy Michaels: ""And just zap him right in his badoobies.""

187,DrJoTab,Best writing and performances of any 80s comedy,10,21 October 1998,"This is a truly great movie--but unquestionably the best thing about it is the writing. I have seen few scripts in the history of film that are as tightly constructed, as witty, and full of as much real genius as you will find here. On top of that, Dustin Hoffman, Teri Garr, Jessica Lange and Charles Durning give the performances of their lives.But the real standout among the actors is Bill Murray. As silly and tedious as Murray can be in some roles, he is perfect here as a self-important playwright who has just the right ""zinger"" lines to bring everyone else down to size.

The simple fact that Dustin Hoffman required hours of make-up work before each scene should be enough to make that obvious. Despite the film's flaws, Hoffman actually does pull it off and makes a convincing female soap-opera actor. The ending brings the whole film down to the level of a soap-opera, perhaps intentionally so. Enjoy Hoffman's performance but don't expect anything profound; this movie does not aim at gender politics, merely cliches and predictable audience tittering.",Tootsie

This movie goes to show that Dustin Hoffman  is best at playing the oh-so-very-different characters.  Whether it's his unforgettable character in Rainman or Michael Dorsey/Dorthy Michael in this, Dustin is at his best when he plays someone DIFFERENT, someone who is not your average person.This film will make you laugh, that's for sure, but it'll also make you rethink about the things that really make you happy in your life, something too few of us think about...almost never.",Tootsie

If Dorothy appeared in front me, I don't have confidence to notice that Dorothy is a man. I think Dustin Hoffman's acting is one of the highlights of this movie.In this movie, interestingly enough, Dorsey becomes tremendously popular among American people as an actress who has inner resources of character. Dorsey provided people with new woman figures in spite of being a man.It is very interesting that only viewers know the reason why Dorothy is so powerful.The ending is so sudden that I wasn't able to accept it soon.",Tootsie

194,shobhadeepthi,Interesting Woman,6,19 July 2013,"What does being a woman mean? Beautiful, docile, soft spoken, and most importantly submissive? And is that a definition by men? If so, will they be interested in this woman? If yes, do these men stop there? Do they really be happy with the woman that you are? The more weepy, needy you are the more they would pretend to be interested in you. And before you know there is already another woman in their life's. And this does not end cause a man who's interest is just skin deep is as weaker as a woman he wants. On the other hand, not many men appreciate a level-headed, strong-willed woman. These are some ghastly traits that a woman should have according to them. But there are gentlemen who really admire a strong woman and find them interesting. And the movie Tootsie just shows that in the most dramatic way possible ;).Tootsie is a movie from Comedy Genre. How did I end up watching this? One of my friends shared a link where the actor in from the movie Tootise, Dustin Huffman tears up talking about making this movie and about every woman who wants to meet and match the expectations of a man. Michael Dorsey, has trouble getting a role in acting. Mostly cause of his nature and behavior. He finds it foolish to enact a scene which is beyond logic or reasoning. In a scene where he plays a man on his death bed, when the director asks him to walk across to the center and deliver few dialogs, he flares up asking how can a man who is dying walk across just because the director thinks that is what the audience want.In this struggle to meet the ends, he decides to dress up like a woman for a female role in a SOAP. His desperate attempt somehow wins the role to his surprise. As he starts acting like a woman on the sets and in his real life, he himself falls in love with Dorothy Michaels, taking care of her looks and dignity. He influences people around him, especially women. They feel empowered by him. Who believes in no phony, to be what you are and to stand for what you are and not let anyone treat you less than what you deserve.He meets Julie, on the sets who he instantly falls in love with. And like any other clichéd movie, she falls for the wrong guy Ron, the director of the show. Ron treats Julie like a doormat, and he cheats on her, hitting on every other woman. And has a convenient explanation of why he does so. And there goes a love triangle, but would Julie ever get to know who Dorothy is? And that the man behind Dorothy is really in love with her?If its a movie made in 20's, I sure would not have appreciated it. But I can understand the applause or awards this movie/ actors got. Dustin Huffman/ Dorothy Michaels is really an interesting woman ;-)",Tootsie

196,ibrahimctit,"Initially promising, poorly developed story (with a few laughs)",5,3 January 2018,"What I liked about this film: 
-The movie begins with promise. We are presented with a very motivated and driven character who has a desire- to be a successful actor- and an obstacle before that goal, no one wants to hire him. This leaves the audience excited for what he will do to get their. 
-The themes of identity and how it is connected to gender are refreshing, if not communicated as well as they could/should have been.
-Most of the interactions between Michael and his agent. What I did not like about this film:
-When Does Micheal Grow/ The Conclusion: Let's just right into it. The conclusion of this film is not good, for a number of reasons. I'm not talking about the last scene, I'm talking about most of the second half of the movie and how it leads up to the ""resolution"". Michael is a talented actor who can't get work because his obsession over character, so he decides to go to extreme measures. He pretends to be a woman and auditions for a part in a Soap so he can finally start acting working and so that he can raise money for a production he and his friends are putting on. He gets the gig, and as Dorothy, the character his is playing, he develops the reputation as a woman who doesn't put up with the shit you usually have to deal with in the business. At this point, the viewer is expecting the film to be simply about the trials Michael faces in trying to maintain this facade. Michael begins forming a deep connection with one of his co-workers, a woman also starring in the show, and he falls in love with her. The goal then shifts from how will Michael maintain this facade, to how will Michael win the heart of this woman when at some point she will inevitably discover she...is actually a he. This on top of the established challenge. The movie spends a lot of time showing us Michael dealing with the degrading treatment woman can face in working in the TV/Film industry. The audience now expects the film to show Michael learn what it is like to be the opposite sex. This actually allows the story the potential to go in some interesting directions. Here are the problems.
Michael experiences ""being"" a woman and sees how they often get treated in the business, but he doesn't start out as someone that is particularly sexist/ oblivious to the challenges others face. Michael falls in love but doesn't start out as some averse to love. What does Michael ever actually learn? How does he grow? 
-Michael's Friend: Michael has a female friend who he's been close to for years, and one day they have sex. No promises are made about oh, I guess we're in a relationship now, but he treats her poorly. He doesn't see her when he says he will see her and he's not up front about how he doesn't truly love her, but another woman. This is a perfect reflection to the relationship between Julie, the woman he falls in love with, and Ron, the director of the show they're both on. Dorothy/Michael continually advises Julie to dump Ron, as he does not treat her as well as she deserves to be treated. This holds up a perfect mirror to Michael's own actions, providing an opportunity for a powerful character moment, but the movie never really acknowledges that what Michael is doing is wrong. They just kind of skip over it, seeming to be more focused on getting Michael and Julie to end up together. Feeling bad for the people you hurt doesn't equal growth.
Julie's Dad: Michael meets Julie's dad in a bar after Julie discovered his true identity and reacted poorly to it. He basically gives him his blessing in being with his daughter, and this makes no sense. Why? Julie's dad kinda fell in love with Dorothy. Julie' s dad, a man who has been with no other woman since his wife, begins to yearn for another ""woman"" one again for the first time. He even tries to marry ""her"". By this point in the movie, he has become privy to the fact that Dorothy is actually Michael, as he watched the unveiling on TV. He is clearly quite the traditionalist based on the things he says to Dorothy and the way he reacts when a man, Michael, tries to return a wedding ring to him in public. In reality, this man would be furious. To have been made a fool of and for Michael having been lying to him and especially his daughter. They slept in the same bed for the Flying Spaghetti Monster's sake! Michael watched Julie's child while she was gone! A man clearly being afraid as being seen as homosexual fell in love with a man! He would be furious, I repeat! But Michael has a rational conversation with the mildly upset dad, asks about his daughter, and manages to to escape with a begrudgingly forgiving punch on his shoulder, things presumably settled between them. Not at all believable. -Julie: To Julie, the (should have been) protagonist of the film, Dorothy is a person she admires, enjoys the company of, and looks up to as an empowering figure. Julie has issues with her belief in her own self-worth and Dorothy/Michael makes her feel more worthy. So much so that she has the confidence to leave Ron. If we focus on the one character who actually changes, this is a movie about Julie finding her identity. So at the end of the movie, when Michael approaches her to rekindle their relationship and clearly have in be romantic in nature this time, instead of Julie learning to be independent as she has been learning all along, and Michael seeing that he doesn't need to be with her in that sense or even really expect to after all that's happened. In the end to go strolling off into the sunset. What? Okay, okay. I obviously don't blame Michael for disguising himself as he did or falling in love with Julie, but in the end he lied to her, whether he meant to or not. In the end does it make sense for Julie, who has spent the movie building up a sense of self-worth, to fall in love with a man who has essentially been lying to her all along. Does it not make more sense for he to either completely turn him away, and Michael must learn to reconcile with this. Or perhaps even, she accepts him back into her life, but as a friend filling the roll emotional guide as Dorothy did, because after all didn't Michael tell Julie that Dorothy was still here? In a movie about identity, Julie is still the prize/ ultimate goal, when the culmination should have been both character realizing who they are.

In Mrs. Doubtfire Sally Field said ""We miss her.""  It made me realize that there really isn't a first anymore. There was also an awesome scene where Dustin Hoffman comes out.............well I don't want to ruin it, but it was so hysterical that my dad and I were almost rolling on the floor.  LITERALLY.  I suggest this movie for anyone who likes comedy or was even a slight Doubtfire fan because it is nothing compared to the original.",Tootsie
201,emcrn,"Great, Great, Great!",9,20 September 2003,"For me, the only criteria for what makes a film great is: does it stand up over multiple viewings?  If you know every line, every cut, every camera angle, every note of the score, and every costume, does it still get your attention?  If you're channel surfing at 3AM and you see the movie in question, no matter how far along it is, will you stop and watch it anyway? When the answer is yes--and for me, it is ""yes"" to very few films--then it's great.  ""Tootsie"" is GREAT.  The writing is sharp, the performances are uniformly excellent, and the subject matter remains timely, even now, twenty years later.  The casting people outdid themselves with ""Tootsie"", as every role, even those where the actor has only a line or two, is so well done. Sydney Pollack--what a find!  His performance as the totally hassled agent is superb, and honed, no doubt, by a professional lifetime of dealing with real agents.  Bill Murray (why was he uncredited, anyway?) is, as usual, a joy.  (His reaction when he interrupts Dustin Hoffman and his much-too-ardent admirer--""You slut""--is hysterical even after 100 viewings.) Jessica Lange and her cute little overbite have never been used more effectively.  Charles Durning's portrayal of Les strikes a perfect note of old-fashioned sanity in this movie's crazy world.  And Teri Garr is priceless!  When she screams in frustration over having been stood up AGAIN by Hoffman she is the icon for every woman who's ever been forgotten, thrown over, dissed, or dropped.  I could go on and on--Dabney Coleman, George Gaynes, Doris Belack--they are all fantastic.Somehow the Oscar voters got carried away by ""Gandhi"" and voted it the Best Original Screenplay award.  Of the other nominees I think either ""Tootsie"" or ""ET"" deserved it far more--they were, after all, ORIGINAL stories!  The only Oscar for ""Tootsie"" was to Jessica Lange for Best Supporting Actress, but I think she was given it as a consolation prize for losing Best Actress to Meryl Streep in ""Sophie's Choice""; really Teri Garr, who was also nominated, was more deserving.  Hoffman lost, too, but perhaps deservedly so, given the competition.  Again, however, I'd quibble with the winner (Ben Kingsley for ""Gandhi"").  Personally I would have given the statuette to Peter O'Toole for his great work in ""My Favorite Year"".If you haven't seen ""Tootsie"", watch it.  You'll never regret whiling away a couple of hours with this wonderful ensemble.  And it will get you thinking about gender roles, something we as a society are still struggling with today.  I've often thought of Hoffman's moment of truth, when he explains to Lange near the end, ""I was a better man with you, when I was a woman, than I ever was with any woman when I was a man.""  If you can puzzle through the logic you'll see that this simple statement holds a world of truth in its couple of dozen words.  Enjoy!",Tootsie

They are with himself.  Yes, it's an old theme, but it's one most of us wrestle with on a daily basis.  My pleasure comes from watching Michael's slow redemption while all of the zany sub-plots of this wonderfully convoluted story swirl around him.

It's your typical guy chases the girl romance with that cool twist. Set in the backdrop of your typical 1980s movies, this movie will keep you watching.

In interviews I've heard Dustin Hoffman say that he learned the same thing, and I believe it. I am STILL bitter that Hoffman didn't win the Oscar for this film. The transformation he makes in his performance as Dorothy is so complete and engaging and subtle that one almost forgets she is a man until with one tiny peek over the tops of her glasses at a pretty girl's derrière, we are shocked into remembering.

This is the most witty, hilarious and relaxed movie that so many actors and directors have missed completely when dealing with the whole 'drag' subject.The storyline is a hot tempered and highly opinionated out-of-work actor(Dustin Hoffman) is told by his agent (Sydney Pollack) in all kindness that nobody will hire him. He takes it upon himself to dress as a woman just so he is not recognized by those he has p'ed off in the past.

214,achamblee,Teri Garr on male-female relations,9,10 February 2006,"It's plain to see Bill Murray's hysterical drop-dead delivery in this movie that he takes to the lead character in his future films. However, the unsung hero of the supporting cast is Teri Garr. I love her riff on male-female relations.When she roars at Hoffman she is wonderful. ""I read 'The Second Sex.' I read 'The Cinderella Complex.' I'm responsible for my own orgasm. I don't care about 'I love you.'"" ""I'm just going to feel this way until I stop feeling this way.""All this was improvised, according to her male co-stars. They said they couldn't decide whether to laugh or be very scared.""So. Are those REAL chocolate-covered cherries?""",Tootsie

216,ser3d,Brilliant Film,10,4 August 2000,"While the premise of a man dressing as a woman may be a cliche in the world of slapstick comedy, this film is so much more.There are so many great characters and lines in this movie, but what truly makes it great is the development of Hoffman's character as he adapts to life as a ""woman.""  He begins the film as a typical male chauvinist, but as the story goes on, he finds himself being increasingly empowered as he becomes a feminist.  There's a line near the end where he says something to the effect of that he was a better man as a woman than he ever was as a man. This movie managed to make me laugh and think at the same time.Best line: ""Does Jeff know?""",Tootsie
217,dewdropdaddy,Sheer genius,10,4 September 2006,"Its often been said that I was born in the wrong era! I love Tootsie! Its one of my most favorite movies! The improvisation of Bill Murray and the sheer excellence of Dustin Hoffman to pull it off! I mean, how easy it is to forget that hes a man?! I cant walk in those heels, could you!!! Sheer genius and Hoffman at his best. There's nothing I love more than gong through the IMDb most memorable quotes with my husband and realizing that I should have been in that movie! Word for word, no problems!!! Its absolutely hilarious and one of most favorite scenes (that I didn't fully appreciate until I had children!) is the apple sauce one! Fans of Tootsie will appreciate this I'm sure!",Tootsie
218,jtymedubee,We do what we have to,7,19 April 2020,I would say I was thrilled with the movie although I've seen it when I was younger and the possibility of actually pulling that off then was maybe within reach but for today I doubt but then again if I needed to I would try my hardest to still be an actor and if I had to do what tootsie did then so be it I give this movie a double thumbs up and a 2 tears applause,Tootsie

221,red_hott_mamma,Excellent!,10,24 August 2002,"I really enjoyed this movie.  I've been wanting to see it for quite some time now, and never got around to it.  I finally watched it and was really impressed.  Dustin Hoffman is truly an incredible actor, and it was interesting to see a man pose as a woman, especially in that time, because women were still inferior to a certain extent.",Tootsie
222,hpcompston,Hoffman's best comedy,8,1 November 2009,"This film follows the struggling actor Michael Dorsey played by Dustin Hoffman as he tries to seek an acting job but finds it difficult to find because of his ""know it all"" mentality. After being shot down on several casting calls he takes his girlfriend Sandy played by Terri Garr to an interview for a new daytime soap opera. After coaching her unsuccessfully he comes up with the brilliant idea to change his identity to a woman and try out for the role himself. He lands the job and quickly becomes one of the more popular characters on the show. Unknown by the rest of his coworkers, girlfriend, and agent, he continues this charade of being a woman even off of the stage. He quickly becomes attracted to one of his cast mates, Julie, played by Jessica Lange and several awkward moments occur thereafter.This comedy was excellently done and is one of director Sydney Pollack's triumphs. The movie does a good job of exploring what could happen when one person tries to become someone else, and the lives that could effect in the process. The film does a good job doing this while not taking itself too seriously. This is probably Hoffman's best comedy. It reminds me of some of the funnier parts in the Meet the Parents film he did.This picture is at times essentially a play within a play at times. When Hoffman is on stage as Dorothy all attempts have to be made by the film crew to make her not look to ""manly."" Makeup artists also comment on the ""five o'clock shadow"" that Dorothy has. These are just a few little things done that add to the comedy in this film.The film finishes with everyone being surprised at Hoffman's double life. The ""coming out"" of Hoffman helps him realize some of his priorities. Even though he did a lot of good things, and gave out great advice as Dorothy, his priorities were neglected as Michael. He mends old friendships and makes new ones as himself. The soap opera gets enormous ratings as a hilarious plot twist occurs, unknown to the cast mates, producers and director. In the end everything works out for everyone involved, as Michael turns this situation into one of the more funny moments I have ever seen.",Tootsie
223,Miss_Turnstiles,"when in doubt, a dress works wonders....",8,30 October 2009,"Previously tackled in Shakespearean plays and films like ""Glen or Glenda"" and ""Some Like It Hot,"" a man masquerading as a woman was not an innovative storyline by the time ""Tootsie"" was released in 1982. Unlike its in-drag predecessors, though, ""Tootsie"" successfully captures a thoughtful, although improbable, portrayal of a man who discovers his inner beauty by wearing a wig and a dress. The theme of self-transformation is two-fold in the film; man dresses as a woman and physically becomes an actress, and man dresses like a woman and becomes emotionally whole. Both the internal and external development of ""Tootsie""'s leading man/woman, Michael Dorsey/Dorothy Michaels, is unearthed simultaneously. Although Michael voluntarily changes his looks, he is unsuspecting of the inward overhaul he is about to experience as well. Dustin Hoffman is at the helm of the film as the dual characters, giving a doubly honest, uncensored performance to secure his future stardom. As a blacklisted actor in New York, Michael is impossible to work with and utterly self-obsessed. To himself, he is a class act, a star awaiting his big break. His agent, however, bursts his bubble, asserting that Michael will be permanently unemployed because of his defiant attitude. After this eye-opening conversation, Michael hatches a plan, determined to find work as an actor.In the subsequent shot we spy a petite, unbecoming woman walking down the bustling streets of New York. It is very obviously Michael in drag. Because of the spitfire alter ego he creates in Dorothy Michaels, he lands the coveted role of Miss Kimberly on a popular soap opera—the exact role his best friend, Sandy, auditioned for but was rejected. Terri Garr, who is luminous as Sandy, portrays her struggling actress character with just the right combination of insecurity and spunk to make her completely likable. She remains in the dark during Michael's stint as a woman, but gleefully feeding the ruse is Michael's roommate, Jeff, a subdued yet hysterical Bill Murray fresh from his ""Stripes"" performance.Flash forward to a couple of weeks into his gig, and Michael has already achieved soap glory as Miss Kimberly while utilizing his disguise to gain the trust of enchanting television starlet, Julie. By spending time with Julie, a beauty with a heart of gold, effortlessly portrayed by Jessica Lange, Michael begins to feel the twinge of love. What is intended as an acting job soon blossoms into a way of life; he encompasses the character of Dorothy to the point that he is more comfortable in her heels than his own shoes. For this reason, he prefers to be in the company of Julie, who brings out the best version of him, even if it means he has put on makeup to feel this way. Later in the film, Michael confesses to Julie that, ""I was a better man with you, as a woman...than I ever was with a woman, as a man."" While hiding in his female counterpart, Michael's self-transformation runs full circle. Once an egocentric, self-important Lothario, Dorothy opens him up to genuine sensitivity and compassion. He is able to step outside of the role of playboy actor he reveled in and find the decency in himself as well as others, most notably with the aid of Julie and her father Les, an impeccable Charles Durning. The emotionally closed-off Les finds himself inexplicably falling for Dorothy with disastrous results. Because Les is a true gentleman who believes he has found a kindred spirit in Dorothy, we root for him to get the girl, even though impossible and hopeless. When Michael finally confronts his suitor, sans the Dorothy costume, it is heartbreaking and heartwarming in the same breath. Director Sydney Pollack eliminates any question of Dorothy's affect on Michael by capturing his transformation through elements like extreme close-ups and montage. Throughout the film, while Michael is playing Dorothy, the audience gets up close and personal with every cosmetic product used on Dorothy's face. Some shots are almost too invasive, but this serves as a constant reminder that the gentle, loving woman behind the mask is actually a man. While viewers may get lost in the character of Dorothy, those close-ups—like during his reveal speech on live television—pull us back to seeing the man under the makeup when the shots are magnified. The montage summarizing Dorothy's trip with Julie to her father's farm is another route Pollack takes to illustrate self-transformation. Clips of the threesome eating dinner, talking, sitting outside, etc., are edited together to confirm Michael's emotional changes and his first acts of selfless love, all to the glorious tune of Stephen Bishop's ""It Might Be You.""Many films parallel the theme of ""Tootsie"" while experimenting with gender roles. The concept was not novel in the 1980's, and tons of more of the same sprung up after its release. Among my favorites is the sappy, and equally implausible, guilty pleasure of a film, ""Just One of the Guys."" Released three years after ""Tootsie,"" this film depicts what transpires when a self-centered, yet charismatic, high school female tries a boy's pants on for size while seeking validation of her writing talent. Comedy and mistaken identities ensue, and when her spell as a teenage boy ends, she has learned life lessons, matured on the inside, and fallen in love with a fooled, and forgiving, guy. In films, like ""Tootsie,"" that fearlessly explore appearance alterations, inescapable self-transformation is brilliantly expounded. Michael sets off on his journey as a conceited joke of an actor with the vendetta to prove his worth, but comes into his own when he switches genders. The trick to self-discovery may not involve cross-dressing, but rather just examining the world through an untarnished, new perspective.",Tootsie
224,jbrousar,"Academy Award nominated ""Tootsie,"" stars Dustin Hoffman, Jessica Lange, Bill Murray, and Geena Davis.",10,1 November 2009,"Academy Award nominated ""Tootsie,"" stars Dustin Hoffman, Jessica Lange, Bill Murray, and Geena Davis. It's directed by Sydney Pollack with the screenplay written by Murray Schisgal. It is an upbeat, gender-bending romantic comedy that is as fun to watch the 3rd time as the 1st. Nominated for 9 Academy Awards, and winning one for Jessica Lange as Best Supporting Actress, the film is most notably remembered for Dustin Hoffman's outstanding portrayal of Dorthy Michaels, a conservative, masculine looking woman whose no-nonsense approach to life and female discrimination are an inspiration to all women. Much like Robin William's Mrs Doubtfire, Dustin Hoffman's Dorothy, is a character who comes to life out of necessity. Michael Dorsey, (Dustin Hoffman), is an actor with a bad reputation for being exceedingly difficult to work with. Unable to obtain and keep an acting job, he is forced to wait tables and teach acting to others. Viewed as a challenge because his agent tells him he will never be hired as an actor again, Dorsey decides to disguise himself as a woman and auditions and lands a role on a soap opera. Michael's adds her own spin on the hospital-based soap script and takes this tired show to new heights. Dorothy Michael's rise to fame is almost instantaneous. Her character portrays a liberated women who is strong and independent which makes her a quick hit with women dedicated to the soap. Dorsey takes turns being a mother to some, confessor to others, best friend, and object of lust. Dorothy and Julie Nichols (Jessica Lange), who plays a nurse on the soap, become fast friends. Julie looks at Dorothy as an inspiration and comes to her for advise and support, while Dorsey's feelings for her continue to grow. Dorothy is courted by Julie's father and in fact is presented with a marriage proposal. Julie admits she has feelings for Dorothy, that she can't quite understand, and wants to break off the friendship as she feels her feelings for her/him are wrong. Dorsey realizes he can no longer play this charade and outs himself on a live filming of the soap. He confesses to Julie ""I was a better man with you, as a woman... than I ever was with a woman, as a man."" Julie misses Dorothy and decides that she sees Dorothy in Micheal and agrees to a second chance. Dustin Hoffman gives a priceless performance. Tootsie is a funny, well-done, entertaining movie, definitely a must see!! The cast and script work together in perfect harmony and certain to be enjoyable for anyone who loves romantic comedies.",Tootsie
225,cat-iwanchuk,Unemployed New York actor Michael Dorsey (Dustin Hoffman),8,22 March 2005,"Unemployed New York actor Michael Dorsey (Dustin Hoffman) goes through harsh measures in order to establish a name for him self. His arrogant attitude and stubborn temper irritated every producer in the city leaving him job-less. Michael's room mate, Jeff (Bill Murray) plays a witty, positive character that has an offer to make. If Michael can come up with eight thousand dollars in order to fund his production, Michael can play the lead role. In bringing an acting friend/love interest, Sandy (Teri Garr), to an audition Michael is overcome with an idea that would change his acting career in the most positive way. No producer would higher the arrogant Michael Dorsey, but Dorothy Michaels who is a strong-hearted, threatening woman would be sure to get the job as Emily Kimberly in ""Southwest General"" a day time drama series. This comedy would not be complete without a silly love twist involving a ""Southwest General"" nurse (Jessica Lange), her father (Charles Durning) and another co-worker (George Gaynes). The complications of having two identities provoke hilarious encounters with both of the sexes interested in Michael-Dorothy. You may not be a fan of the cheesy music and some of the corny humor, but seeing Dustin Hoffman dressed up as a woman and actually caring about how a dress hugs her hips could put a smile on anyone's face. The dialogue adds to this humor with sharp, quick wit often referring to the stereo types portrayed in both men and women. I would suggest Sydney Pollack's ""Tootsie"" to people of all ages looking for a light-hearted comedy.",Tootsie
