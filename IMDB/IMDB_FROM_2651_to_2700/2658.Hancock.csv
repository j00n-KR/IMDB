0,TheLittleSongbird,"Brilliant idea and great idea, but a classic example of the first half being much better than the second",5,17 December 2011,"What drew me into seeing Hancock in the first place was its idea, which I found one of the most interesting for a film in a while. I am in all honesty not a big fan of Will Smith, but he has given some solid performances so I thought why not.I have to say that I didn't think Hancock was a bad film as such, it was somewhat underwhelming and I'm sorry to say I do understand the criticisms against it.Hancock does have a fair number of good points. It is stylishly filmed, with some well above average special effects, the music is dynamic and the directing is solid. The best asset about Hancock is the acting of the three leads.Will Smith is very commanding, with a lot of subtlety amongst all the wisecracks/gags that don't feel forced(ie.flying under the influence). Charlize Theron shows a glowing presence while also showing a sympathetic side, and Jason Bateman's dry humour contrasts perfectly too.However, Hancock is a very uneven film. I loved the first half, it was well paced, the script was witty and fresh and the scene where the titular character brings a speeding train to a halt as he can't be bothered to lift the car up from its path is one of the better and relevant scenes of the film.It is in the second half where Hancock is less than successful. Here the film starts to drag, the script becomes soapy and heavily melodramatic and the film has one of the daftest twists of any film not to have M Night Shyamalan's name on it.The story's tone isn't the only asset to feel uneven, the script is too, it has wit and freshness in the first half, but becomes mawkish in the second. I also felt that there were only three likable characters(Smith's, Theron's and Bateman's) and the others I barely noticed, with the villain especially flat.So all in all, an uneven film but not a necessarily bad one. 5/10 Bethany Cox",Hancock
1,SnoopyStyle,good potential good action no suspense,5,9 November 2013,"John Hancock (Will Smith) is a drunk mess of a superhero. He destroys as much as he saves. The LA public has turned against him. He saves PR expert Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman) and Ray is determined to return the favor by saving Hancock's image. Ray brings Hancock back home for dinner but Ray's wife Mary (Charlize Theron) isn't happy to have Hancock around.On the surface, this is a great premise. It has good comedic potential. It would work better if he was a klutz instead of an alcoholic. Hancock is just too unlikeable. And the last half of the movie leaves me confused with more questions than answers. Was there even a climax? That one handed fool can't be the criminal mastermind that is his nemesis. Is there a nemesis? Director Peter Berg has now become an expert on action scenes. I have no doubt about his action directing. But he needs to think about what the story should be. Who the heck is Hancock? I can't really answer that properly after watching it twice. The movie clunks along without much suspense or tension. Every once in awhile there's an action scene.",Hancock
2,Prismark10,Scuzzy but super,6,10 March 2014,"A comic book action film featuring a scuzzy, drunk as the superhero who causes mayhem and destruction every time he gets involved. The police, public and civic officials wished he remained a barfly.Things change when Hancock (Will Smith) saves the life of Jason Bateman, a Public Relations expert who wants be a corporate do-gooder and wants to revamp Hancock's image even if it means doing a stretch in jail because of his various misdemeanours.Bateman is married to Charlize Theron who remains cool and suspicious of Hancock but something is drawing them together.The premise of an inept and drunk super hero has some novelty as we see him become a better and more sober superhero who the kids eventually look up to but this does not keep the engine of the movie going.The sub plot involving some bad guys intending revenge is minor as they will never realistically be able to challenge Hancock leading to some plot contrivances involving the weakening of his powers.Yet the film is not over-long, moves at a good pace. Despite its edginess and some bad language even younger kids will find it enjoyable and funny.The film does have plot holes the more you think about it afterwards as to where Hancock came from and the amnesia is a convenient plot point.",Hancock
3,claudio_carvalho,An Anti-Hero is Born,4,17 November 2008,"The powerful alcoholic and clumsy John Hancock (Will Smith) is the most hated person in Los Angeles, since in spite of saving lives, he also destroys properties causing high cost to the city to fix his damages. When he saves the life of the PR Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman) from a train, the executive feels in debt with Hancock and decides to change his image. He brings the anti-hero to have dinner at his home, and introduces him to his son and fan Aaron (Jae Head) and to his wife Mary (Charlize Theron) that does not want Hancock in her life. But sooner the dangerous connection between Hancock and Mary is disclosed, threatening the American Dream of Ray.""Hancock"" is a movie that never works: the idea of an anti-hero is interesting but the execution is terrible since the lead characters, Hancock and Mary, are unpleasant and anti-charismatic. Only Ray and Aaron are nice, but the plot is too stupid for my taste and waste the excellent cast in a story that is not funny. This anti-hero journey should be light and with humor, but it is hateful indeed. My vote is four.Title (Brazil): ""Hancock""",Hancock
4,kosmasp,Inconsistent,4,12 September 2008,"That PG-13 blockbusters (especially) normally don't explore the sexuality of it's main characters is one thing. But with a twist (that gladly is not revealed in the trailer) like the one revealed in this movie, there should've been a bigger exploration of that issue. For a regular super hero movie, it wouldn't really matter, but for a movie that tries to stay/ground itself into reality, it's more than a wasted opportunity! The twist also brings up a few questions and should at least bring us a big conflict, but neither (really) happens ... especially not the conflict. Another wasted opportunity. Of course every movie has it's weak points, what really makes the difference is the things that one finds in the movie, that makes it look good. But the trailer moments are the best (jokes) in the movie. Of course you know where this is going from the get go, but it still could've been more ... let's say sympathetic. And there are too many scenes that are repetitive (how many times can Hancock smash into things/destroy them, without getting boring). It might look good, but it could be more diverse too. It's a shame, because all I could see here, were many missed opportunities ... and I don't think a longer cut on DVD will make a big difference ...",Hancock
5,jboothmillard,Hancock,5,17 April 2009,"From director Peter Berg (Welcome to the Jungle, The Kingdom), I will see almost anything with the leading African American star who saved the world many times before. Basically John Hancock (Will Smith) should be praised as an all powerful superhero, but he is an alcoholic hated nuisance who saves people in Los Angeles very clumsily. When Hancock saves the life of public relations expert Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman), the executive decides to try and help Hancock get a better public image and be less clumsy. Ray also introduces Hancock to his family, son and fan Aaron (Jae Head) and wife Mary (Charlize Theron), who is very moody around the superhero, and it is revealed later that Mary is not only has the same powers as Hancock, but she was apparently his partner. But this is a big problem when it appears that being opposites, they lose their powers getting too close to each other, making them both very vulnerable, but don't worry, all is well in the end. Also starring Eddie Marsan as Kenneth 'Red' Parker Jr. and Johnny Galecki as Jeremy, also look out for film director Michael Mann as an executive. Smith is sort of likable as the anti-hero, but it is mainly the special effects that stop this film from being boring, and making one or two giggles too. Worth watching!",Hancock
6,ccthemovieman-1,Delivers What You Want In A Superhero Film - Entertainment,8,12 December 2008,"I was nicely surprised to find this a very entertaining movie, start-to-finish, about a reluctant super hero who winds up getting an attitude change for the better. What changes him? A man who cares and his little boy, who also cares and looks up to him. Corny? Maybe....but I liked it.Yeah, it's a nice, sentimental story in those regards which is why the cynical national film critics didn't care for the movie. Nice message: thumbs down; evil - thumbs up. Pretty sad, eh? Being this is a ""superhero"" movie, I didn't expect any credibility: just a fun, escapist story, and that, pretty much, was what was delivered. It had a nice twist near the end, too, which I won't go into for anyone who hasn't seen the film. It's not a total shock, is all I will say, because you can see it coming if you read between the lines.Was this film enjoyable enough to watch a second time, or a third? Most definitely.",Hancock
7,Tweekums,A superhero with a difference,7,6 November 2014,"John Hancock isn't like other people; he is immortal, has super strength and cannot die he is a superhero. He isn't like other superheroes either; he has no super villain arch nemesis and thanks to the damage he causes every time he catches a bad guy or saves somebody in danger he isn't even popular. One day he saves the life of less than successful PR man Ray Embrey and Ray decides that he could help Hancock by providing some good PR. To this end Hancock stops refusing to accept responsibility for his actions and goes to jail. Here he waits for the inevitable call from the authorities asking for help; the crime rises and eventually he is called to foil a bank robbery. After a celebratory dinner with Ray and his wife Mary we learn more about our protagonist, including the fact that he isn't the only one of his kind and like most other superheroes he has a weakness one he doesn't know about.This is a decent enough film; Will Smith puts in a fine performance as Hancock; possibly the scrungiest superhero to date at least until he cleans up his act and Jason Bateman is likable as Ray. I liked the fact that Hancock was dealing with ordinary low grade criminals rather than super villains and criminal masterminds and the fact that he was unpopular was fun too; even if the idea of Superheroes being too much trouble because of the damage they cause was done previously in 'The Incredibles'. The humour is a little crude but it was impossible not to laugh when he followed through on a threat to shove one cons head up another's backside! Most of the fun was to be had in the first half; the big reveal concerning the second superhero seems a coincidence too far and the ending was too twee. Overall though this was an entertaining way to pass an hour and a half and it is fun despite its flaws.",Hancock
8,Quinoa1984,"there are complaints to be had, but mostly it's a fun summer action movie",6,3 July 2008,"Will Smith is a great star in Hollywood, and it's fun to see him in Hancock work his way with a character who's an ""a-hole"" (don't call him that, by the way, that's the buzz word) for the first half and then starts to open up and not be so much one in the second half. If for no other reason to see the film it's for him and for people like Jason Bateman and Charlize Theron to show what potential they have with their talents; Theron especially reminds an audience every once in a while that she won an Oscar for a reason. And, it's also for the first half of the way through the 90 minute running time a wonderful dark comedy that takes itself seriously but also pokes fun at a superhero who doesn't give a flying f*** and bums around saving people while also drinking his ass off and destroying lots of property.But at some point when the writers decide to develop the mythology of the character, who is apparently somewhat God-like and is immortal under specific circumstances but also has 'another' like him (I won't say who, spoiler), and they don't give it enough time to really sink in after the somewhat 'twist' occurs 2/3 of the way through. And anything humorous in the first half is gone pretty much by near-movie's end, leaving it in the hands of Peter Berg, the director. This was the aspect of Hancock that grated down at me. Berg and his cameraman's style is to usually not bother with things like steadicams or dollys or a camera simply still on a tri-pod or other and to make everything hand-held and wobbly and oddly shot and (in the case of the hospital climax) just awfully lit and shot. It comes off as more-so amateurish than being intense or realistic, and it definitely doesn't fit the kind of movie it's meant to be placed in (i.e. JULY 4TH SUMMER BLOCKBUSTER, hello!) And yet, even with the problems I had, I wouldn't stop anyone from seeing Hancock, as a good way to kill an hour and a half and to enjoy some of Smith's best work to date. He's a charismatic and multi-faceted actor, but his star quality meshes well, and it's a performance that's worth every minute to see he's on screen for. If only the rest of the movie were as good as he and his co-stars.",Hancock
9,edwagreen,Hancock-Don't Put Your John H. On this Stinker *1/2,2,21 June 2009,"This is a film that starts out with a great premise- a young black guy who is the modern day superman while still causing havoc.I have never seen a movie to fall apart so rapidly as this one did. Charlize Theron had better cut it out. She is getting too typecast in monster-like lunatic parts. This is not a good way at all for her career to go.The story, as stated, falls apart due to the most absurd writing imaginable. Theron and Will Smith going back through the ages, and each time they're near one another, there is havoc.They should have stuck with the beginning of the good things that Will Smith did as a hero.",Hancock
10,michaelRokeefe,Not your ordinary superhero.,7,28 November 2008,"A Peter Berg film. Action packed comedy with fulfilling special effects. And hey, we get a superhero that didn't originate in a comic book. Hancock(Will Smith)is a hard-living, sarcastic hero with super human abilities; maybe misunderstood and real down-and-out with a lack of people skills and out of favor with the public in general and with public officials for lack of property damage control.Hancock saves a public relations expert, Ray Embrey(Jason Bateman), from being being ran over by a train. Embrey in turn convinces Hancock to agree to an extreme makeover and pull his reputation out of the gutter and make nice with the public. In meeting Embrey's wife(Charlize Theron), Hancock discovers she has similar and even stronger powers than his own. Plus she holds the key to unlock his secret past. Will his popularity rise or will this prove to be his demise?",Hancock
11,Theo Robertson,The Confused Tone Makes For An Uneven Film,6,10 March 2014,"When I heard this movie was getting produced I jumped to the conclusion this was a bio-pic on the British comedian Tony Hancock "" Will Smith is Hancock "" Hmmm . There might have been a serious fly in that ointment but rest assured if Smith pulled it off then we'd have the greatest acting performance in the history of cinema . As it turned out this wasn't in fact what HANCOCK was about and concerned itself with a burned out super-hero . One wonders if studios should put a bit more thinking in to film titles ? After all can anyone remember that sci-fi epic called JOHN CARTER ? Not really a title you equate with sci-fi As it turns out I thought HANCOCK might be the sort of super-hero to appeal to someone like me and that is someone who doesn't the avalanche of films featuring Marvel comic book characters and the like . A burned out hero with super powers and a drink problem finds himself unable to care about the world about him . Not a premise you see every day and one that is original . It also deserves some credit for a lack of post-modernism and any temptation to include references to the likes of Bruce Wayne , Peter Parker and Clark Kent has been curtailed . If you're going in to this film thinking it's an extension or at least inspired by the comic book blockbusters that were coming out at the same time then that's what you're going to get . After seeing the movie I'm not entirely sure what I got There's a very strange and often uneven tone to the movie . Peter Berg has a bizarre directorial technique where the camera zooms in and out of the action in a hap hazard way . Some scenes are played totally straight and serious and then there's a big set piece done in a manner done in a manners that apes the films it's giving the impression it's not trying to be . It also seems to contain a bit too many ideas for its own good which has led to a lot of comments here that HANCOCK is a bit of a mess . I don't totally disagree with this view but as someone who feels the need to once again state that there's far too many movies about super-heroes I did enjoy this movie to a limited extent though I find it very difficult to explain why",Hancock
12,jotix100,Don't ever call him an A.H.!,6,31 August 2009,"Hancock is a slovenly clad man who is into drinking and shows that even though he saves people facing precarious situations, he is an angry man. The worse offense, as far as Hancock is concerned, appears to be calling him a nasty epithet; that will turn this homeless man into a rage. Hancock causes a lot of damage as he go exercising his good deeds. When Ray Embry gets stuck on a crossing rail track, Hancock gets him out of his predicament, and a sure death. Ray is a man working for a P.R. firm who wants to thank the man that saved him by changing his image. After all, he is a genius doing what he does best. But there is a problem in this whole proposition, the moment Ray brings him home for a meal, his wife Mary takes an absolute dislike to her husband's guest.The secret of the animosity between Mary and Hancock is revealed in the last part of the story. It comes as no horrible surprise to the viewer by then since we are all guessing what the secret was about.""Hancock"" directed by Peter Berg, with a screenplay by Vincent Ngo and Vince Gilligan, is fun at times, but the story is too far fetched to really make the viewer care for this type of confused anti-hero. We don't believe for a moment when we learn about Hancock's past. Will Smith is bigger than life in his take of the comic-like hero. He has done much better in action films before. This one will not be one of his most accomplished times in front of the camera. Charlize Theron does what she can to bring her Mary Embry to life. Best of all is Jason Bateman, an actor that gets better with each new film in which he appears. Of course any Will Smith vehicle is marked by fantastic special effects, and this one is no different. Colby Chamian and Francine Maisier's editing works wonders for the film. We can see in cameo roles the director, as well as some of the producers, Akiva Goldsman and Michael Mann appear as members of the board that Embry is addressing at the start of the film.",Hancock
13,poolandrews,A different kind of superhero film.,5,3 March 2011,"Hancock is set in Los Angeles where John Hancock (Will Smith) lives as a powerful superhero fighting crime, he can fly & is invincible to all injury. However the residents of LOs Angeles dislike Hancock because of the vast amounts of damage he causes & lack of modesty, feeling alone, unwanted & unappreciated Hancock has slipped into alcoholism & depression. Hanacock saves public relations man Ray Emrey (Jason Bateman) from being hit by an oncoming train & as thanks Ray invites Hancock to his home for dinner, Hancock agrees & meets Ray's wife Mary (Charlize Theron). Ray suggests to Hancock that he needs an image makeover to make him more appealing to the public & when Hancock is branded a public menace & an arrest warrant is issued Ray feels it would be a perfect opportunity to turn Hancock's lowly image around by giving himself up in order for the authorities & public to realise how much they need him when he is not there...Directed by Peter Berg this romantic fantasy film is an alternative on the recent spate of superhero/comic book hero films that been released over the past few years, while a few of the ideas & set-pieces in Hancock are fun & as a whole it's a watchable film I wouldn't call it anything other than watchable. Available in both it's original theatrical version & an extended 'Unrated' cut that runs about nine minutes longer I will be basing my comments on this shorter theatrical version. The one thing about Hancock that puzzles is the uneven tone as it can't quite decide what it wants to be, does it want to be an all out slapstick comedy or a serious superhero film that deals with real issues or a tragic romance? Aspects of all three are here all mixed together in a very uncertain manner, the first half of Hancock is far more enjoyable than the second with Hancock a depressed hard drinking superhero who gets a rough ride from those he seeks to protect while the second half of the film introduces this huge twist that comes from nowhere. I didn't think the twist worked that well to be honest & it just gets sillier & sillier in this sort of fantasy romance that turns to tragedy that as expected gets a nice happy Hollywood ending anyway. While amusing at tims Hancock is never that funny with the gags & jokes feeling flat, while some of the action scenes are cool it never excites that much because of the silly tone & the romance between Hancock & his sibling has no emotional impact & feels like it's there to stretch the running time out a bit. The lack of any significant enemy or super-villain for Hancock doesn't help either & the film feels a bit empty as a result. No explanation is given for Hancock's origin & any serious issue the script tries to raise like prejudice & racism have little impact. At about 90 minutes long at least it's fairly short, the pace is good & Hancock certainly isn't boring but as I said, it just sort of passes the time rather than enthrals or really engages.As expected from such a big budget Hollywood blockbuster there are loads of CGI computer effects sequences here, from car chases to tornado's to people flying to general mayhem & destruction. The effects are good, you can see that they are just CGI effects but they look alright & obviously a lot of money was spent on them. Apparently conceived as a much darker film the tone was made much lighter for a family summer release which maybe explains the uneven mix of silliness & seriousness.With a supposed budget of about $150,000,000 this has to be one of the biggest budget films ever made, there are plenty of effects for sure & lots of visual trickery I suppose. The acting is alright but it's odd seeing Will Smith as a rude & rather ordinary person rather the quick fire one-line spouting charmer her usually is.Hancock is a decent enough film, sure the tone is uneven & I am unsure about the giant twist but it entertains & is quite fun in it's own absurd way. You could do a lot worse that's far sure, worth a watch if nothing else.",Hancock
14,dbborroughs,Major misfire with too much going on. Only comes alive in sporadic moments,3,5 July 2008,"Major misfire from Will Smith concerning a superhero with a drinking problem who decides to redo his image of destruction.Based on what many have considered a great script ""Tonight He Comes"" (which I haven't read but which I've read about) this is a movie with some really good ideas, which after bobbling them for an hour drops them as they add another 15 to the mix.The idea is that its lonely being a superhero and that one would eventually begin to drink because one was all alone. Drink causes problems as does anger problems- usually resulting in millions of dollars in insurance claims. The idea is rather clever and its one thats been used before in better films like Superguy: Behind the Cape a pseudo-documentary about the problems of being a superhero. Its a good idea as I said and there are moments here where they pull it off but its only in the odd moment and every now and again.(even if there are tons of unanswered logic problems) Which is fine for the first hour where the jokes and the effort to put something together comes across as an okay time filler (which I hated to spend money on-at its best this is a cable flick). The trouble is that about an hour into the movie it begins to add in plot points that come out of left field. First there is a twist that plays out badly over the next half hour then a major plot development occurs that drives the film to its conclusion. In that last half hour enough plot for at least another 90 minutes is set up and the rushed through.Of course the twists are so WTF that with in the context of the film that as it stands now that the film completely falls on its face. I kept wanting to reach for the remote to jump to the end (curse the movie theater experience).There is a good story in there somewhere but someone-probably several someones- botched the film.(I read there were lots of rewrites and passes through the editing suites) A perfect example of how not to make a movie by committee (and will probably be on my worst of the year list for that reason).a final 3 out of 10 (despite some early moments and great lines) This kind of skirts the PG13 and R border. I thought it was R until I saw other wise. Frankly its probably more R then PG13 thanks to language and violence",Hancock
15,Bunuel1976,"HANCOCK (Peter Berg, 2008) **1/2",5,24 January 2010,"I had decided to dedicate the start of this year mostly to the viewing of foreign-language films but, since my father rented this atypical superhero flick, I took the opportunity of a break from the relative seriousness and watch something that was not too demanding. The premise in itself – of a reckless and uncouth alien whose superhuman abilities prove singularly alienating – is not half bad, but it is let down by the unreal CGI effects and the equally fake machismo displayed throughout by star Will Smith. Mind you, the results are entertaining enough – but, again, the baffling emphasis on vulgarity negates the film at least part of its intended audience! The twist involving the character of Charlize Theron (wasted here) was kind of unnecessary, too, especially since it inserts an incongruous dose of sobriety (vis-a'-vis her subsequent conflicted relationship with the conveniently amnesiac Smith and oblivious hubby Jason Bateman) – eventually giving way to outright and unwarranted sentimentality, only to be dispelled soon after by the obligatory 'happy' ending. While I admit to not expecting much from it in the first place, I did enjoy the film on the wholebut, at the end of the day, it is all pretty bland and not sufficiently quirky to live in the memory.",Hancock
16,lastliberal,Did you shove a man's head up another man's ass?,6,24 June 2009,"OK, the concept is funny. A ""super hero"" that is nothing but a lush and causes so much damage that the mayor wants him to leave; ""Go to New York."" I only tuned in to see Charlize Theron.

17,zardoz-13,"There Is Nothing Half-Cocked About ""Hancock!""",8,16 July 2008,"The Will Smith superhero saga ""Hancock,"" co-starring Charlize Theron and Jason Bateman, qualifies as the most original superhero movie of summer 2008. Indeed, ""Friday Night Lights"" director Peter Berg with ""Hostage"" scenarist Vincent Ngo and ""X-Files"" writer Vince Galligan devote themselves entirely to the origins of their offbeat and unusual titan and leave everything wide open for an inevitable sequel. This amusing, irreverent, occasionally violent comedy-drama boasts a dynamic cast, a tidy 92-minute running time, and an inventive premise brimming with audacity that more than compensates for its chief liability, shoddy computer generated special effects that appear campy rather than cool. As much as ""Hancock"" poke fun at superheroes, it also details the disadvantages that come with being a superhero. Adam Sandler got the ball rolling earlier with ""You Don't Mess with the Zohan"" where he played an ordinary guy with superhero characteristics. ""Hancock"" takes the ordinary guy with superhero powers like ""Zohan"" to even greater heights. The closest that anybody has come to making something like ""Hancock"" is the cable series ""Smallville"" where young Clark Kent never dons superhero spandex, but he possesses the power to thwart evil. Basically, ""Hancock"" is an enigmatic hero. The filmmakers assail us with his superhuman feats and the troubles that he spawns long before they reveal his origins. Unlike all superheroes, Hancock is a homeless guy who guzzles far too much liquor for his good. However, when adversity arises, Hancock can hurl himself into the air and through the skies at supersonic speeds to settle the score. Bullets ricochet off his impervious physique, and he can hoist things ten times his own weight. Hancock's problem is his unruly attitude. He wrestles with an anger management problem. Further, he creates more problems than he solves with his superhero powers. In the opening scene, for example, he rids Los Angeles of three Asians joyriding in a white SUV on the freeway who blasting away motorists with sub-machine guns. Hancock rips the roof off their SUV and suggests they surrender. They try to riddle him with lead, but they only obliterate his whiskey bottle. Hancock is so upset at the loss of good liquor that he digs his heels into the pavement and halts their SUV. Afterward, he flies away with them screaming in their SUV and impales the vehicle on the tower of the Capitol Records building. Everybody in Los Angeles hates Hancock, and they wish he would leave the city.Hancock's salvation lies with a schmucky public relations guru, Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman of ""The Kingdom""); Hancock saves Ray when poor Ray finds himself trapped in traffic gridlock at a railroad crossing. Naturally, Hancock creates more havoc when he tries to help out society. He flips Ray's car onto another vehicle and stops the locomotive dead on its tracks with his body. Predictably, a string of boxcars connected to the engine jackknife and pile up into huge mess. Since Hancock saves his life, Ray repays him with his public relations savvy. Ray convinces Hancock to serve time in prison as a way to gain the respect of the public. The District Attorney has leveled lots of charges against the superhero, but he has had no way to make them stick. Initially, Hancock hates Ray's plan, but Ray assures him that the crime on the streets that results from his absence will prompt the police chief to spring him from prison. Mind you, it doesn't take long for a real scumbag to rise to the occasion and take hostages in a bank robbery. Meantime, Ray has gotten Hancock to shave, soften his image, complement the authorities for a job well done, and don an X-Men style flight suit. At this point, ""Hancock"" takes a surprising turn and veers off into another direction. ""Hancock"" looks a little like ""Highlander"" in this respect as the filmmakers provide everything that we need to know about him that ties up all the loose ends.""Hancock"" is a refreshing change of pace for a superhero movie. Good movies take chiseled-in-stone conventions and shatter them for maximum effect. This superhero satire delivers beautifully with its reinvention of the superhero. Will Smith gets to play a character with some tragic depth and he undergoes change later on during the course of the action. Alas, the special effects are pretty substandard, and the vengeful villain named Red (Eddie Marsan of ""Mission Impossible 3"") never poses a serious challenge to ""Hancock."" In fact, Ray comes to Hancock's rescue in another surprising turnabout. The biggest surprise of the movie is ""Æon Flux"" actress Charlize Theron. She plays Ray's meek, mild-mannered wife Mary. She turns out to be more than anybody bargained for, including our super-heroic superhero. Saying anymore about Mary would spoil the surprise about her character. Altogether, despite is obvious faults, ""Hancock"" ranks as Will Smith's best science fiction fare since ""Men-in-Black.""",Hancock

19,view_and_review,A new brand of superhero,7,3 July 2008,"Hancock is certainly your abnormal or unordinary superhero... a reluctant superhero. Whereas most anyone with the powers he possessed would be clamouring for fortune and fame, he tried his best to shy away from the lime light.What I liked most about Hancock, the movie and the character, was Hancock's grittiness. They made him a complete unrefined, alcoholic, foul-mouthed a-hole that had an attitude of giving the finger to the world. That persona really worked, or I should say that Will Smith did it well. It was apparent that he didn't care for anyone and he only helped when it was absolutely needed, or when he felt that he was obliged to do so.The story also had a pleasant surprise in it that wasn't the least bit hinted to in the plethora of trailers. Besides Hancock's internal and external transformation, a lot of light was shed on the story via Mary Embry (Charlize Theron).The CGI was good as was expected. It is kinda funny because the same CGI five years ago would have been awesome, but what was awesome in 2003 is expected today.Overall the movie was above average. There were some haha funny moments and some sensitive moments as well. It didn't wow me enough to consider it a great movie, but it was definitely worth the price of admission.",Hancock
20,george.schmidt,Giving new meaning to 'anti-hero' ; Big Willie is the bomb,8,14 July 2008,"HANCOCK (2008) *** Will Smith, Charlize Theron, Jason Bateman, Jae Head, Eddie Marsan. Nifty spin on the superhero flick with Smith having fun as the titular reluctant superhuman whose great powers he finds difficult incorporating great responsibility until his encounter with luckless PR agent Bateman (a model of comic perfection) who decides the foul-mouthed, drunken anti-hero really needs a make-over and fast if he wants to be accepted into society. Vincent Ngo and Vince Gilligan's sharp, satirical screenplay smartly streamlines comic book ethos and mythology by eschewing the noble cause and instead focus on the fatal flaws while director Peter Berg incorporates the right blend of over-the-top visual effects, spot-on comedy and some depth to the characters at hand ; not an easy task and frankly the third act's 'surprising twist' is seen too far in advance. But Big Willie is the bomb.",Hancock
21,neil-476,"If I was allowed to shout I would shout ""Avoid Spoilers!!!!!!!!!!!""",10,2 July 2008,"Let me start by saying two things. Number one - go and see this movie! Number two - steer clear of spoilers.I like Will Smith well enough, but I've never yet been to see a movie simply because he's in it. But I like superhero movies well enough, and that was sufficient to get me into a cinema with a good-sized audience of mostly young people.For the benefit of those who haven't caught a trailer, Will Smith is Hancock, a super-powered drunk. He does good deeds in a messy way and is generally frowned upon by society as a result. He saves the life of a PR consultant who determines to rehabilitate him. Not the easiest project in town, as first of all, Hancock has to want to be rehabilitated....The trailers are fun and, as expected, there are laughs to be had. Most of these derive from Hancock's curmudgeonly character and couldn't-give-a-stuff way of doing things. But most of the stuff in the trailers feature in the first half hour or so. The film then takes a turn in an unpredictable direction - not featured in the trailers at all, and certainly not spoilered here - and becomes rather darker before heading for a satisfying but unexpected ending.The superhero stuff in Hancock is excellent - a totally convincing depiction of superpowered activity in the real world. Hancock works as a superhero movie. It also has its share of laughs, although it isn't a comedy - far from it. Instead, it's a film about people - Ray (Jason Bateman), a decent man who simply wants to turn Hancock from a perceived liability into an asset, his wife Mary (Charlize Theron), who is deeply concerned about the impact this graceless drunk with godlike powers is having on their life, and Hancock himself. Smith's portrayal is not unlike his morose detective in I, Robot, but sunk even further into depression and unhappiness for reasons which become clear.I loved this film.",Hancock
22,evanston_dad,Original Ideas Stranded by Chaotic Script,6,7 July 2008,"""Hancock"" may be many things, but it's certainly not a traditional superhero movie. That's either a good thing or a bad thing depending on your point of view.I appreciated the many original ideas swirling around the perimeter of this movie, but it's a shame that no one idea ever fully takes hold. The script feels like the product of a brainstorming session before anyone has had a chance to make sense of the notes. And not only is the script somewhat of a mess, but the tone veers all over the place as well. The movie gives the impression of having been directed by several different people.About an hour into ""Hancock,"" the script throws in a surprise twist that director Peter Berg handles deftly, and the movie, that had already been ticking along pretty enjoyably, gets an extra jolt of energy and fun. But that sense of fun drains immediately from the film as the entire tone turns nasty, unpleasant and extremely violent. Bad guys come from nowhere, plot developments don't make a lot of sense and back story is apparently made up as the film moves along. The movie itself is only 90 minutes, so I don't know why the filmmakers felt compelled to rush through to an ending without tying things together in a way that made sense, but on the other hand, I'm glad it wasn't any longer because I was tired of the arbitrariness of the whole thing.It's hard to talk about what could have been without revealing the plot twist, but let's just say that the film could have gone in any number of interesting directions that it chooses to ignore. Due to what it reveals about one of the major characters, the script could have given Hancock either an ally or a compelling villain, but it does neither, and all of the actors -- charismatic as they are -- feel somewhat stranded. Jason Bateman alone keeps things buoyant for as long as he can on the strengths of his goofy charm and comic timing.Grade: B-",Hancock
23,ferguson-6,Call Me That One More Time,4,2 July 2008,"Greetings again from the darkness. No question that Will Smith is a movie star and can pull off a super hero ... even an apathetic, alcoholic, amnesiac-stricken super hero. Here he is very physical while at the same time using facial expressions to try and get in touch with his more human side.This mess goes wrong pretty quickly. The special effects are overboard and director Peter Berg (""Very Bad Things"", ""The Kingdom"") way over directs ... especially with the 360 degree facial close-ups. All the eye gazing between Will Smith and Charlize Theron take away any mystery in what the big plot twist might be. Even the score is weak. Is it too much to ask for a decent theme song for a super hero? This one sounds like it is straight out of a John Ford movie, or maybe ""Wagon Train"".Jason Bateman has almost as much time as Will Smith but really isn't able to bring much to a nothing role. Smith is the only one who shows any depth as his is the only character with more than one dimension. The cartoonish special effects just don't work and the great little idea of the rehabbing super hero just falls flat. This one has the feel of MULTIPLE edits and cuts with the result of one that just isn't much fun. Go see ""Indy"" or ""Iron Man"" again as you wait for ""The Dark Knight"".",Hancock
24,anaconda-40658,A New Kind of Superhero.,8,2 July 2015,"Hancock (2008): Dir: Peter Berg / Cast: Will Smith, Jason Bateman, Charlize Theron, Eddie Marsan, Jae Head: Here is an unusual take on a superhero movie. Hancock classifies as a hero but his heavy drinking render him disliked due too massive amounts of destruction left as a result. When he saves an ad executive from a train he is convinced to serve time is prison for damages. Directed by Peter Berg with a decent screenplay, interesting developments, and an insightful conclusion regarding Hancock's power. Berg previously made Friday Night Lights and The Rundown. This is perhaps his most unusual work and it pays off. Special effects are superb but Will Smith steals all attention as Hancock who goes from carefree bitter alcoholic to discovering his past and why his wife cannot be near him. Jason Bateman plays the executive who sees potential in Hancock but unaware of the craziness within his own household. Bateman's character ultimately steps up when it becomes apparent that it is his turn to save the day. Charlize Theron plays Bateman's wife with an interesting background that results in much humour. Eddie Marsan leads the criminals but they are unfortunately just underwritten thugs to be beaten up. Not as funny as it should be but it serves as a satire of the genre and explosive special effects that pay off with its blunt realism to superhero lifestyles. Score: 8 ½ / 10",Hancock
25,zetes,The big twist completely ruins it,5,6 July 2008,"This was a major disappointment. It's not that it looked like it was going to be fantastic and wasn't. No, the problem is that it was fantastic for about forty minutes, and then it became derailed so completely that it absolutely ruined all of my enjoyment. Will Smith, the king of the Forth of July, stars as a superhero. The gimmick: he's a screw-up and a drunk, and his heroic actions generally cause far more collateral damage than the actual problem he's trying to solve. The public hates him. One day he meets a down-on-his-luck PR expert (Jason Bateman) who has some ideas on how he can improve his image. It's a great premise, but the first thought you might have is, can they stretch it out to at least 90 minutes without breaking it? I honestly think the answer is yes, they could have. Their answer is, no, let's throw in an insanely idiotic twist that changes the film from a hilarious action-comedy to a dark, romantic superhero picture. I knew as soon as I saw Charlize Theron in the film that they were saving her character for some big twist, as the advertisements for the movie didn't include a single shot of her. You don't hire an actress that big and not give her something important to do. They had something so great here. The first half of it had me laughing out loud frequently. I've been waiting for Hollywood to skewer superhero movies intelligently ever since Batman Begins, where Batman's chase with the police causes millions of dollars of damage. I know it was pretty much universally hated, but My Super Ex-Girlfriend covered similar territory and, while it was never great, it didn't screw up anywhere near as royally as Hancock did.",Hancock
26,mm-39,A poor version of Ironman,6,16 July 2008,"With Ironman and the Hulk we now have Hancock. I did not mind Handcock, but the movie is just OK. Humor plays a huge role for the movie. The humor saves the movie from being forgettable, and the scripts kills the movie with a sad storyline in the 2an half. The Hulk and Ironman had the huge climax, while Handcock was more anti-climatic. Not the worse movie, but I would not buy the film either. My friend knew the guy who wrote the comic or story. I went to see how the film played out. 6 dollars out of 10 for movie entertainment. Why is there so many superhero movie out there? I wonder if there is going be one too many superhero movie out there. Batman this week? I wonder what will be in the next 2 weeks.",Hancock
27,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Hancock,10,5 July 2008,"I'll stick my neck out and state this: Should anyone tell you Hancock is not a good superhero movie, then that somebody probably isn't a superhero comic book fan to begin with. Or perhaps prefers the heroes as morally upright boy scouts with unexplainable fetish for Lycra tights. And for those who reckon that the Hancock trailer had shown its hand, for once I thought that a trailer barely, and I mean barely, scratched the surface of what surprisingly was a thoroughly enjoyable story, which will take its stand proudly amongst this year's line up of comic book/super hero movies.But first, I'd got to admit, I'm a Will Smith fan. So at least you might have this review put into perspective. I've been enjoying the Will Smith Express with the kind of movies he's been doing for his career, even for the badly received Wild Wild West. But this guy has been in almost every genre from action (thanks to Michael Bay) to science fiction with I, Robot, romantic comedy with Hitch, a powerful dramatic performance with Pursuit of Happiness, and the recent remake I Am Legend, and each one I find little or no fault with. In fact, save for one or two movies in his filmography which I have not watched, it's no wonder that Smith's A-list material for his legion of fans around the world, having a name that can marquee a blockbuster movie, and one of the more consistently bankable contemporary stars.And Hancock (ok, for this review I'd lay off all the jokes) continues in this tradition of entertainment that isn't frivolous. To tell you more about the story would be to ruin whatever surprise it has in store, so I'll not do that. Suffice to say that like all superhero movies, Hancock is also about sacrifice, and I think that's a theme that the genre cannot do away with. It's almost always an exploration about doing the right thing, be it for the love of mankind, or those that touch on the more personal. If you'd believe the trailer as it suggests, then it's suffice to say that Hancock had to grapple with bad public relations from his jerk like behaviour (stuffing heads up arses being his arsenal of choice), and that assistance comes free through the services of Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman), a life which he saved by, well, causing millions of dollars in damages. If I were to scratch the surface just a little bit deeper, then I'd say that Ray represents the kind of normal life that Hancock probably wished to have, the simple, no save-the-world responsibility lifestyle, with a nice little family with wife Mary (Charlize Theron) and son Aaron (Jae Head) to boot.Director Peter Berg, who last brought us The Kingdom, dabbles with plenty of technology to bring us a man who can fly, possess incredible strength and being invulnerable to bullets. What I'd enjoyed about his take on this superhero movie, is that he didn't find a need to explain everything in verbatim, i.e. what are the powers he possess, where did he come from, and so on. sure they are addressed, but there's no need for putting it in your face, which I suspect lesser directors would have filmed flashbacks, origin subplots, enemies who are megalomaniacs who want to conquer the universe, and so on. They can be mentioned in passing, or a glance, or to let it work it out in your imagination, which of course is a powerful tool. And keeping it simple helped too, as I was really thrilled at how effective, and deceptively simple, its crescendo was developed, that it's tough to fight back tears as it goes for the juggernaut to reach out for your emotions.Clearly there were bits from the trailer which were probably put in as red herrings, or likely to have been reserved for the DVD as deleted scenes. While it runs at just over 90 minutes, the pace is frenetic, though of course not without the usual loopholes, especially with a major sequence probably to show off some cool graphics. If I were to gripe about certain things, it would be how YouTube got a significant product placement, and not actually having the actual, exact clips available (I may be wrong but I did do a search), and having the camera seemed to want to take a jab at Will Smith action movies of old by continuously circling around his face ala Bad Boys. Some may also gripe about not having to see much of the born again Hancock in action, but again, the strength of this movie lies not in how it delivers its set action pieces.So what's my verdict? To Berg, Smith and the rest of the cast and crew, Good Job! And don't be a jerk and bolt for the exits the minute the end credits start to roll, or you deserve to have your head stuffed up another's arse.",Hancock
28,siderite,"I have to under grade this, It cheats on so many levels it's disgusting",6,10 September 2008,"I like Will Smith, he can act like the best of them. but what does he do? He plays superheros and futuristic cops or lonely scientists in doomsday worlds. If it weren't for The Pursuit of Happiness, I would say his career is going downwards.The film itself is a cheat. It has trailers and ads about Will Smith being some sort of disgruntled super hero with a horrible attitude, while some funny looking PR guy is going to great lengths to ""fix"" him. Not so in the movie! The whole convincing takes about 5 minutes of film!Then there is Charlize Theron. I mean, OK, it wasn't a role unfit for her, but it felt like the only reason she was in the cast to begin with is some weird ""let's see Smith kiss Theron"" thing.And then there is the actual plot. Jeez, what an underachievement. It actually had some very good ideas and they were unexploited, abused and thrashed, giving way to silly special effects and silly dialogs.Bottom line: for presenting itself as an original movie, with a true anti-hero as lead character, and for hiding the real ""jist"" of the story in the commercials, I give it a big BOOOOO! Watch it on TV when it comes out!",Hancock
29,Smells_Like_Cheese,"""It's you! Handjob!""",6,11 July 2008,"The moment I saw the preview for Hancock, this just looked like the most ridicules movie that could be made, I was sure that it was going to flop or get horrendous reviews. But after talking to people who saw it, it was half/half of either they loved it or hated it, so I guess this was just a movie I had to see for myself. So I watched it yesterday, I am dumbfounded, I'm the half/half, I loved it and I hated it. I felt like the beginning was just silly and rushed, not to mention that the villain was just under developed and didn't have any depth to why he was so bad. But however, I did like the little twist they had, which I refuse to give away, even though I did predict it sadly, it's one of those things you'll have to see. But I also did enjoy the originality, it's not just a typical super hero movie with all the stereotypes, it was John Hancock(which by the way should've taken place in Chicago after it's famous building).John Hancock is a homeless bum who just has a bad attitude along with a horrible drinking problem, he also is different, he is a super hero. The only problem? He causes a lot of damage when he ""saves the day"" and doesn't care what people think. But when a failing advertiser, Ray Embroy, is saved by John, Ray offers John a chance to look good and be the ultimate super hero. But Ray's wife, Mary, isn't so excited and has a little secret about her and John. But Ray is determined and will make sure that Hancock is a great super hero for the whole city.Hancock is over all an alright film, it's not bad by any means, but I feel like it could have been so much more with a better script. Not to mention some of the camera angles were a little extreme, there were times where I thought the cameraman was on a tilt-a-whirl and I felt sick. But for the story I'll admit that it was original and fun at times, Will Smith is a good actor, I will always admit that, but it seems like his movies(which are always released around the fourth of July, you notice) have become like a love letter to him and how great he is. Hancock is worth the look, but I'd recommend the rental, it's just a notch under a great blockbuster.6/10",Hancock
30,DKosty123,OK Will the real Super Hero Smith Please Get a Great Script,7,11 April 2009,"Will Smith is a very talented actor. One of these days he will get a great script and prove it to everybody. This is film better than I Am Legend, but it is not the one with a great script. Smith plays a rude & crude super hero who has no idea why he is a hero and does not like being called A-Hole. I watched the unrated DVD version of Hancock which is 10 minutes longer than the movie theater version of it. The extra minutes help the film as the theater version is chopped up too short.It is kind of neat to me having a hero named Hancock. Hancock is a common name used for towns in several states much less being an acronym for everyman as in John Hancock which is the full name of Smith's character. To me, the lack of a master/super villain helps this film because the film isn't long enough to develop that villain. The film title reminds me of a football coach I had. We were playing a team from the town of Hancock, and doing sprints in practice prior to the game. As we started the sprints he said, first you run 20 yards and yell Han, then you run 20 yards and yell c-ck. Then after realizing what he said, he decided we should not do the yelling, especially within ear shot of the horny female cheerleaders.",Hancock

32,KineticSeoul,Didn't match the hype but it's watchable,6,21 October 2015,"This movie delves into the more human aspect of superheroes. Where it shows the characters flaws and all that. And I thought Will Smith did a fairly good job playing a hero that just doesn't give much of a crap all that much. Now did it meet my expectations when I first saw this movie in theaters...Not really. But it's a very watchable movie that delves into a superheroes loneliness and overcoming his demons and emotional obstacles. While dealing with publicity and the public eyes that are on him. Over fighting a arch nemesis, rival or just villains in general. The progression of the story and characters was sadly mediocre though, and I just didn't find it all that entertaining or amusing to watch. But the movie does have it's moments when it comes to Hancock just being human with superpowers although it didn't really delve into it in a impactful manner or anything like that. Overall, it's watchable but just didn't match the hype when it was released.6.5/10",Hancock
33,Buddy-51,failed attempt at something different,5,14 July 2008,"Despite his generic-sounding name, John Hancock is not your average, run-of-the-mill reluctant superhero; he's a reluctant superhero with a drinking problem and anger management issues. Disheveled and unshaven in his appearance - and equally rude, crude and belligerent in his demeanor - Hancock lives by himself in a broken down trailer on the outskirts of L.A., a self-appointed outcast, for all intents and purposes, from the society around him. Alternately either inebriated or nursing a hangover, Hancock seems to have as little use for other people as they have for him. For even when he's out and about thwarting crime and rescuing the innocent, he's doing so more out of a sense of duty to his superhero DNA than any overwhelming love for humanity. Plus, his antics usually result in so much collateral damage to any buildings and motor vehicles that happen to be in his vicinity that the ungrateful citizens of the city would just as soon he leave them to their own devices and find some other metropolis that might be more amenable to his services. One day, however, he saves the life of Ray Embrey, an image consultant who believes he can turn the public's perception of Hancock around if only the superhero will allow him to work his magic on him. And perhaps, along the way, Ray will also be able to somehow reach that untapped vein of goodness residing at Hancock's core.Directed by Peter Berg, ""Hancock"" deserves kudos for at least attempting to inject some new life into a genre that seems well on its way to cannibalizing itself out of existence through tiresome repetition and massive overkill. It tries for a slightly more intimate experience by concentrating on Hancock's all-too-mortal weaknesses and by not having him go up against one of those arch villains that come as part of the standard package with the genre (Hancock has enough internal demons to wage battle against to have much time left over for anything else, I suppose). Unfortunately, after coming up with a fairly original and promising premise, the filmmakers let it get away from them through a combination of unfocused storytelling, gear-grinding tone changes, and CGI work that seems a trifle on the substandard side for an action film of this size and scope. Part ""My Fair Lady,"" part ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith,"" part ""The Pursuit of Happiness,"" and part whatever-else-they've-managed-to-throw-into-the-mix, the Vincent Ngo/Vince Gilligan screenplay wanders all over the map before finally settling into the slushiest, most rheumy-eyed superhero finale this side of ""Spiderman III"" (though let me just state right up front that ""Hancock"" is still miles above that fiasco). That's a shame, too, since Will Smith is as amiable and likable as ever, while Charlize Theron, Jason Bateman and adorable little Jae Head (from TV's ""Friday Night Lights"") are equally appealing in their supporting roles.""Hancock"" is not a bad movie really, just one that feels halfhearted and half-baked, earning it a Gentleman's C+ in the final analysis.",Hancock

35,Robert_duder,If it had been anyone but Will Smith I might have walked out,5,30 July 2008,"It's not very often that I can say I agree with professional critics who usually hate films for the sake of hating them but when it comes to Hancock I'm actually blown away by the amount of people that liked it. This was a Will Smith vehicle that was ONLY held together by Will Smith. If it had not been for him this film would surpassed Waterworld as the stinker of the decade. Only Will Smith could pull off a good performance and keep you watching through a dreadful plot, a barely existent story and a hack job of editing that must have left anything that made this film worthwhile on the cutting room floor. They simply left scenes of Will Smith and the biggest explosions and action scenes but didn't bother to connect them with any substance. The supporting cast is barely existent and all eyes have to be on Will Smith because no one else even makes a blip on the radar. The film is a dark comedy with action and the comedy also lies on the shoulders of Smith and he pulls it off decently playing the alcoholic super hero but even Hancock himself gets such a little story to his character. There was really so much there to delve into and they don't scratch the surface sadly.So now I've mentioned him a few times...Will Smith. One of the most talented actors in Hollywood and needless to say Box Office gold and then some. Smith is good in his role as Hancock. I feel his stress at trying to find something more to give the audience with this character but the script just doesn't do it. Given a much better script Smith could have made this character stunning. Jason Bateman's character is as dry as a desert and again I don't blame him, I think the script gives them next to nothing to work with. Bateman is great at humor and probably can pull off drama but he just looks like a zombie and bombs every scene. I barely realized Charlize Theron was in the movie as Bateman's wife and a character with a secret past of her own. Theron looks bored much like Bateman and although she gets some action scenes of her own it doesn't much matter. Her and Smith have decent chemistry opposite each other but her relationship with Bateman is a dud right from the first scene. I doubt, as popular rumor states, that there was chemistry between Smith and Theron because it was like watching paint dry on screen.The action scenes are overblown and try to distract from the fact that there is NO story or plot or character development. This just proves that special effects can't carry a film. Although apparently it can since many seem to enjoy the movie. I wanted so much more...especially from a Will Smith action film having seen him in some really incredible action stories like I Am Legend, I Am Robot, and Independence Day. The film isn't the worst thing I've seen this year but it wouldn't be anything I'd let myself sit through again on purpose. The film is mercifully short, won't disappoint in special effects, a few laughs, and it does feature Will Smith so that is where the 5 points I'm giving it comes from. I suggest watching this with low expectations and maybe you'll come out not feeling so bad but this isn't on par with other films of the summer by any means. 5/10",Hancock
36,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Okay in parts, but you get the idea Will Smith should be more careful of the scripts he's offered",4,26 January 2009,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning John Hancock (Will Smith) is not your traditional superhero. He seems to have more trouble sorting out the sh!t in his own head than the sh!t on the streets, and is something of an alcoholic. When he causes yet another catastrophe, he is approached by PR guru Ray Emery (Jason Bateman) who invites him into the house he shares with his wife Mary (Charlize Theron) and their young son. Ray wants to get Hancock to change his image and manners and try to improve the public perception of him, even convincing him to turn himself in and serve a little time in jail. But it all changes when he learns that Mary has the same superpowers as him and a new villain, Red (Eddie Marsan) is on the loose...Obviously intended as a humorous slant on all the superhero movies we were seeing last summer, Hancock further got Will Smith in people's faces after a string of movies as of late. But unfortunately, the lasting impression is that he should be more choosy about the script's he chooses...There's just nothing to Hancock. No depth, no substance, no...anything, really. It's just one of those scripts that you wonder why someone didn't look at it and think...this just doesn't work as a movie. The clever special effects, including a sequence where the two superheros battle with tornadoes tearing the streets of New York to pieces, certainly don't cover up the cracks in the weak script and a plot that just fails to have any sort of narrative flow at all. The Kingdom director Peter Berg's shaky camera doesn't help much either, and Hancock as a character is understandably flawed and depressed. Superheros are meant to be concealed characters, and certainly have more impressive powers than to just blast off up into the air and toss huge things up into the air. Rising star Marsan's villain hardly gets enough screen time to make much of an impression.It may not have been a massive flop, but it's certainly left a lasting impression about Smith for all the wrong reasons. **",Hancock
37,ElMaruecan82,"A 'kick-ass' film and the film ""Kick-Ass"" should have been...",8,30 September 2019,"Peter Berg's ""Hancock"" really took me off-guard, I avoided it for many years expecting some spoof of the superhero movie genre, which I'm not even a fan to begin with. And the beginning almost fooled me, a spectacular car chase intercut with a hung-over Hancock (Will Smith) sleeping on a bench and awaken by that kid from ""The Middle"". It takes him a while to get up, which is plausible for someone who still got the bottle in his hand, and when he took off, it just reminded me of Woody's comment about Buzz: he doesn't fly, he falls in style. And for some strange reason, despite all the obvious CGI, the flying stunts looked realistic and that's one of the delights of ""Hancock"".Indeed, there's no reason to have a superhero flying like some torpedo, missile or rocket, Hancock's flying consist of high jumping and trying to fall on the right spot, which doesn't go without costing a few bucks to the community. And when he stops the criminals by impaling their car over a tower after a ride that had its share of collateral damages, Hancock's not exactly acclaimed like a hero but booed and insulted. It's so fun and refreshing to see movies questioning the consequences of a superhero's action, ""The Incredibles"" did that in 2004 but ""Hancock"" takes that element seriously and it's the right tone. If it wasn't serious, it would have made his character a major goofball we would have instantly liked, but the point isn't to like Hancock.Precisely, he's a bitter, ill-mannered man who couldn't care less but for some reason, still cares. So when PR executive Ray (Jason Bateman) is stuck on the railroad Hancock saves him from the train collision by throwing his car backwards (instead of taking it away) and causes a train wreck by blocking it. After that, Ray sees the man who's just saved his life being insulted by an angry crowd, and naturally, decides to help him back by restoring his heroic public image. He invites Hancock to his house where he meets his son Aaron and his wife Mary (Charlize Theron) who obviously looks at him just like Jean Arthur looked at Alan Ladd in ""Shane"". We haven't seen enough movies if we don't guess there's history between them, but whatever expectation we have, it'll be a big surprise.Another surprise is in the interesting shift of genres, from comedy to drama, with an intermediary section set in a jail. The sequence shows all the efforts to rehabilitate Hancock, we see him handling the prisoners, sometimes it contributes to hilarious sight gags that remind us not to take the material too seriously, and sometimes we see the 'Will Smith' of ""Happyness"" and ""Seven Pounds"" trying to change, to be a better man. His presence in the jail is vital to the development of his character since he can go out at any time but he's ready to play the game, to accept the rules, except maybe when it comes to ""shooting some b-ball"" outside the court. After serving part of his sentence, learning a few lessons about how to congratulate the police force, how to fly and land without causing major damages and learning to be nice, the test comes.Hancock's called for an emergency, he shaves his beard, puts on a tight uniform with an eagle logo and go meet his destiny. He stops the robbery in all professionalism and efficiency, earning him finally the cheers of the by-standers, the police and the journalists. This is where the choice to have a serious action picture instead of a comedy pays off, if Hancock was comical, his ovation at the bank would have been a triumphant and happy moment, instead, it's a moving and emotional epiphany for him, and a fine transition to the third act that finally reveals the deal between Mary and Hancock. And it's such a particular story that it could have been handled in a sequel but the Mary storyline with a revenge from a few villains tie up the plot together in a heart-pounding finale.And I was surprised Roger Ebert didn't mention it in his review, because the climax reminded me totally of the bond between Elliott and E.T the Extra-Terrestrial and it might even reveal what the film is ultimately about: energy. There is a positive energy and a negative one, Hancock had the same forces and skills but before he turned into a decent guy, he was full of negative vibrations that impacted his actions. He couldn't stand people calling him a certain name maybe because he used that same insult against himself. By interiorizing his doubts, his wounds, his questions about his past for years and years, he turned himself into that bitter jerk. Ray could finally unveil the good side of him and allow him to ope to people, it's an interesting metamorphosis from one energy to another.And naturally there's the energetic connection between Hancock and Mary whose respective backstories are finally revealed and make the final confrontations not just spectacular but incredibly poignant. ""Hancock"" is a good movie because it's about a superhero who's a good man surrounded by good persons and learn how to be even better not just by being brave or polite but also selfless. And in the way Berg mixes between genres, from action-packed comedy to emotional drama, I will say that ""Hancock"" kicks ass and is the film ""Kick-Ass"" should have been.",Hancock
38,bowmanblue,Probably should have been a 'DC' superhero film,8,19 October 2018,"Will Smith made 'Hancock' in 2008, roughly at the same time when Disney's 'Marvel Shared Universe' began its unprecedented rise to global domination. Superhero movies were still a bit hit and miss, especially ones aimed at adults. Here, everyone's most charming actor plays - effectively - Superman (or at least a superhero of very similar powers), only darker (and drunk!). Apparently, the script went through numerous re-writes to actually get it down to the PG13 rating as it was meant to be R rated. And it shows.It's definitely not a bad film. In fact, it's pretty good. However, not only was it made while superhero movies weren't as mega popular as they are today, but the prospect of a more 'adult-themed' superhero movie was just about as far off as possible (how that would one day change with 'Deadpool' and 'Logan!'). You don't have to be a fan of Will Smith to appreciate this 'darker' take on the genre. It poses the question would the general populous really put up with someone so strong that they can basically do whatever they want without the consequences that the rest of us have to face? Not only that, but someone who causes rampant destruction - even in the name of 'good.'Jason Bateman and Charlize Theron are the main two other stars attached the project and I'm pleased to say that they're not just there to lend their names, but their characters do have significant parts to play in the overall story and make a distraction from this being a Will Smith stand-alone film only.
I guess one thing that hasn't held up so well over the years is the CGI used to show Hancock flying around the city (and trashing it!). It all looks very much like it was rendered for a home console and then Will Smith superimposed over the top of it. 'The Avengers' and pretty much any other film that has used mass destruction of a city since 2008 has done these kind of effects better.The other major problem with the film is that it doesn't really have an antagonist. I guess Hancock wrestling the demons of being cursed with these sorts of powers seemed to be enough for the film-makers. It's not a long film (a modest hour and a half) and it felt like the writers suddenly thought that these plot themes might actually not be enough and attempted to throw in a villain at about the hour mark. This doesn't really add that much and probably could have been taken out all together if they didn't feel confident enough to expand this aspect to be an ongoing part of the story.However, those are a couple of minor gripes. Will Smith is as awesome as ever (as are Bateman and Theron - seems unfair to leave them out!) and if you like superhero movies then you should definitely watch this one. It's not as dark and adult as 'Logan' or 'Deadpool,' yet it's certainly not as 'family friendly' as Disney's MCU, but it's still fun. Enjoy.",Hancock
39,dromasca,more trouble for the superheroes,6,19 September 2009,"One cannot say that the superheroes genre does not renew itself lately. We have seen Batman and Spiderman and the rest of the crowd as kids, teenagers, falling in love, losing and regaining their power, and even starting to look human. On the same line we can place 'Hancock' which starts with the superhero played by Will Smith in a serious moral crisis (I was almost ready to write mid-age crisis, but there is no such thing as mid-age for immortals) that alcohol does not seem to really solve, saving lives but doing too much material damage in the process and losing popularity with the press and public opinion. And then the solutions comes across - PR, how did not he think alone about it - but then the PR man has a beautiful wife, and ... not ... you did not really guess what follows but I will try not to reveal more.While the first part of the film seems to be pretty standard 'hero-in-trouble' stuff the second half hides some surprises, and the idea was pretty cool. The realization is however too standard, director Peter Berg seems to have relied almost entirely on his two stars - Will Smith and Charlize Theron to deliver the sparkles. They do to a certain extent, but this is not enough to make the film something to remember. Smith and Theron are supported by Jason Bateman, who play the more human element of the triangle, and he looks too routine, even more routine that he is supposed to be.Maybe this is the problem with Petr Berg's movies. I have seen recently 'The Kingdom', the film he made before 'Hancock'. These two films belong to very different genres, but they do have something in common. They are both action films that pretend to be more than that. Without really being bad films, both of them fail. Berg should maybe try to break the routine and dare more.",Hancock
40,MLDinTN,I didn't think it would be very good and it wasn't,4,1 July 2009,"I thought this movie was supposed to have some comedy in it; however, it didn't make me laugh. It was hard to sit all the way through it because it wasn't very interesting. Will Smith, plays superhero Hancock, but unlike other superheroes, he is rude, crude, and creates a mess whenever he tries to help. He's caused millions of dollars worth of damage and has been sued by those he helps.One day he saves Ray and Ray has the idea to change Hancock's image so the public will like him. First, he tells him to go to jail so the public will miss him, then wear a superhero costume, and say good job to the police. Throughout, Ray's wife, Mary, keeps giving Hancock weird looks, so we know something is up. She knows him from the past and the movie just tells up why, no mystery to it.The ending just left a lot to be desired. I didn't find it very entertaining. Plus, I don't get why they made the special effects so fake. Hancock flying and throwing the whale looked too fake for today's special effects.FINAL VERDICT: Teens will probably like this but I'd say most adults wouldn't. Also, the language used is too vulgar for real young kids, say under 12. The word a ##hole is used too much.",Hancock
41,Cineanalyst,"Super-Stereotype: In Hollywood, Even a Black Superhero Gets a White Savior",4,24 February 2021,"Oh, ""Hancock"" is an incongruous picture alright, but it's not merely the twist worthy of an M. Night Shyamalan movie that makes it so. This is a narrative underscored by the theme of ""otherness,"" about difference and separation, and about the discrimination of the ""other"" by society. Hancock is a superman--possibly alien and maybe even divine, but decidedly not one of the ordinary people he lives amongst. He remembers nothing after a night that he had tickets for the film ""Frankenstein"" (1931), which is another picture about a creature treated as an outcast by society. He's since turned to alcohol and being belligerent and reckless even when trying to perform good deeds, which only further alienates him from the rest. Yet, nothing here is explicitly made of the fact that Hancock is by all appearances, as played by Will Smith, an African American. Obviously, acknowledgement of race would've further supported the othering theme, but any such references are curiously absent. Instead, this black superhero is stereotyped as an incompetently alcoholic and lazy bum whose spectacular natural abilities have cost millions of dollars in property damages.He's only able to successfully harness his powers for good after being mentored by a middle-class white guy. How unfortunate for a narrative with such an unpredictable turn in one respect should be so predictable in its racial cowardice, including the white savior trope. It's also quite brazen and flippant for the filmmakers to begin the white savior's mentoring by sending the African American to prison. And the whole subplot about his trying to save the world by encouraging corporations to be generous goes nowhere--within the story and as a function of the plot.More importantly, nothing is even made of the apartheid in the romantic link between a character played by a black man and another character played by a white South African, Charlize Theron. The silence here on race seems intentionally obtuse when we get to the scene where Theron's character explains to Smith's how, by their being together through history, they have been repeatedly attacked. ""Hancock"" is a movie that jokes about Atilla the Hun being cross-eyed, but doesn't dare mention that racists might act violently against an interracial couple and that that is what makes them vulnerable--and, by extension, why they must continue to be apart even in 21st-century Los Angeles. Indeed, the picture itself maintains their segregation and otherwise portrays their coupling as something cosmically tragic and transgressive, as something to be avoided. Hancock the character was never the coward here, as the white savior once accuses him; if there was cowardice, it was in the making of the movie ""Hancock.""",Hancock
42,g-bodyl,Will Smith does it again!,10,27 November 2008,"I have always said that Will Smith is one of the best actors in Hollywood. He was great in the Men in Black series, I am Legend, and Independence Day. He was no different in this movie. This movie not about the superhero you expect. In fact, the superhero is exactly the opposite of a normal one. Will Smith's character is a drunk hero who contemplates suicide. Then with the advice of Ray Embrey, played by Jason Bateman, Hancock decides to turn a new leaf. But Embrey's wife adds a big mystery to the whole movie. The acting is great. I already talked about Will Smith but Charlize Theron and Jason Bateman were excellent cast choices. The action is fantastic. You never expect what would happen in the opening sequences. The music by John Powell goes well with the film. Overall, this is a great, must-see-again action film. My words of advice for this movie is do not listen to the negative reviews. I rate this movie 10/10.",Hancock

44,lesleyharris30,"A Fun and Humorous Movie that is Jam Packed with Flaws,",6,29 March 2015,"Hancock is a decent movie with a well written storyline and an impressive cast. It's certainly a fun action movie that has a lot of very funny parts, as well as a terrific performance from Will Smith, who takes on a role nothing like what he has done previously. It's an enjoyable movie, but it has many, many flaws, the biggest one is that the main character is not very likable for the majority of the movie, I know it's on purpose for the most part, but seeing him throw a kid up in to the sky and flinging a whale in to a boat was way too much and it wasn't necessary if you want us to support this character. Also the movies main villains don't show up until about fifty minutes in and don't start doing anything until about the last twenty, which is a significant problem, especially for a superhero movie, where a villain is one of the most important parts. There are several other problems, the cheesy effects, the anti-climactic ending, the lame twist, the lack of comedy from Jason Bateman's character, this movie easily could have been an 8, but because of all these major mistakes, I had to go down to 6. It's nowhere near perfect, but Hancock is still quite enjoyable and it might make for a good watch if you ever see it on television and have some time to kill. After a down on his luck superhero named Hancock saves a man's life, this man feels he owes it to him to make Hancock in to the real superhero he should be.",Hancock
45,CuriosityKilledShawn,Cockhan,6,8 April 2020,"With so many, many, many, many, many, many, many superhero movies bombarding audiences these days its hard to remember a time when there wasn't an unnecessary comic-book adaptation being forced in our increasingly tired faces. When Hancock was released in 2008 there was no DCEU, and there wasn't really an MCU either. Comic-book movies (of which this is not) and superhero movies were still struggling and finding their feet. Outside of Spider-Man, many of them were alienating and disappointing audiences (Hulk, Superman Returns, Fantastic Four) and while that may still be the case with most of these exhausting franchises, they are so ubiquitous that the hits cover-up the significant misses.Hancock divided audiences in 2008 with many not understanding what it was trying to say or do. Now, more than ever, is it time to give Hancock a re-evaluation?Will Smith (as his career was beginning a downturn) stars as a man with an unknown past who has superpowers, only his faith in people and enthusiasm for life causes the citizens of his hometown of Los Angeles to not appreciate his careless, lazy efforts at fighting crime and rescuing those in trouble. When he saves idealist public relations expert Ray Embrey (the always delightful Jason Bateman) from a trainwreck he is encouraged to turn around his attitude and allow the world to embrace him as a hero who really cares. But Ray's wife Mary (Charlize Theron) has secrets of her own and might know everything about Hancock's mysterious past.This alone would have been enough to make a unique, adult-themed superhero movie, but it seems that several re-writes of the script decided that some kind of villain needed to be shoehorned in there where it didn't belong, and the movie flounders in the final act as a standard Hollywood ending conflicts and deflates the many new ideas that came before it. I still enjoy it way more than Deadpool (an ugly, depressing film which I despise). The 92-minute running time screams of a difficult time in the editing room and the struggle to find a traditional narrative in the flurry of ideas that were written, re-written, re-drafted, and re-arranged during the scripting phase. The movie was originally written in 1996 with the rather worrying title of Tonight, He Comes and was about a kid who struck up a friendship with a fallen superhero - really quite different from the final product.With no toxic fanbase behind it, Hancock comes with a clean slate and is enjoyable as a comedy with some okay action scenes. We're all jaded and indifferent to this stuff by now and the physics and frequent 9/11 porn of superhero movies has been done to absolute, stone-cold, death, DEATH, D-E-A-T-H. Please stop making these! At least it doesn't end with a big blue light shooting up into the sky.Peter Berg's direction is always merely a pastiche of whatever his peers are doing at the time, and Hancock has no unique visual flair, which would have been just fine if the original idea at its core was allowed to shine through the muddle of changes it obviously went through. It's a horse made by a committee.It's a camel.",Hancock
46,atlasmb,Falling Short Of Heroic,6,19 September 2017,"What would you call someone who is bad-mannered, foul-mouthed, destructive, homophobic, unreasonable, and drunken who is a liar and an asshole? Probably not a superhero. Will Smith plays Hancock, a slacker with all those attributes who also has supernatural powers. Maybe you could call him a superzero--someone with the potential to be spectacular who falls far short.He's a reluctant hero for sure, who usually rises above his crassness only when forced to, and then leaves careless destruction in the wake of his heroics.He meets Ray (Jason Bateman), an optimistic PR man who thinks Hancock should change his image. Ray's wife, Mary (Charlize Theron), seems unconvinced. What follows is an unpredictable story about love and possible redemption. There are bad guys, of course, who complicate matters, but the resolution of this story feels messy and contrived. By the end of the film, viewers may feel like it was all just an origin story that served no purpose except to be the foundation for other real stories to follow. But who would want to emotionally invest in a hero that still feels less than realized, a temporary patchwork of questionable values?One feels that an opportunity has been missed. Imperfect heroes can be quite interesting if their story makes them lovable or compelling. Hancock strains to achieve either.",Hancock

48,tabuno,A New Brand of Superhero,8,20 January 2019,"8 July 2008. This daring attempt at a new perspective of superhero directed by Peter Berg results in a dramatic, fantasy, comedy that has mixed results. With good performances by Wil Smith and Charlize Theron, they find themselves in a different, harder edged superhero movie that reveals the human character of being superhuman but at the same time reflecting the a closer connection to the audience than may be comfortable. We get to see alcoholism, anger and its attempted management, we get to see human sacrifice. The first half of the movie reveals a more raw aspect of the frailty of the human spirit regardless of one's power. The second half of the movie reveals the nature of a curse similar to Ladyhawke (1985). Unfortunately, the risk of extending beyond the traditional tried and true superhero scenario sometimes requires experiments and different approaches that require the audience to move along and accept such changes. Sometimes the experience is bumpy, like a new developing film media form getting used to its feet. The result is jarring, jagged, almost forced to make logical sense, but never fatally nor offensively repelling. There are good connections, good interplays between Wil Smith and Charlize Theron. Eight out of Ten Stars.",Hancock
49,The-Sarkologist,One of the strangest superhero movies that I have ever seen,8,29 January 2012,"This, I must admit, is one of the strangest superhero movies that I have ever seen. Basically the protagonist of the movie (and I consider him more of an anti-hero) suffers from a major depressive disorder, which is very unusual for a superhero. However, this is explained in the movie in the sense that he is so unlike everybody else that he feels completely alone. It is a condition that he simply does not care. He will go and assist the law enforcement agenices to catch bad guys, but, unlike other superhero movies, his trail of destruction impresses nobody. However, because he is a superhero, no prison and hold him, and the police are unlikely to be able to actually arrest him.Things change when he saves the life of a public relations expert, who decides that he will attempt to reinvigorate his image, and he begins by suggesting that he should willingly go to gaol, and his plan is that with Hancock in gaol, then the criminals will have free reign, and the city will then realise that they actually need a superhero to keep the peace. This works, however, this is only half of the movie because the twist that comes in the middle pretty much takes the movie in a completely different direction.It turns out that the wife of the PR specialist also has super powers, but not only that, she is also Hancock's partner. However, the catch is that when they partner up, they become mortal and end up living like normal people. This has been going on for a long time (though Hancock suffers from amnesia and thus has not idea as to his origins). It comes out that Hancock is a superhero in every sense of the word. He begins the film as an anti-hero, and finishes the film as a true hero. We learn that the reason that they did not end up partnering up and living normal lives is because Hancock desired to use his powers to actually help people.This is truly the most unusual superhero movie that I have ever seen. In most superhero movies the villains are super villains (though Stryker in the X-men is not necessarily a super villain, but he does have a retinue of henchmen that do have superpowers). All of the antagonists in this film are normal people. It is only Hancock and his partner that have super powers, however his partner has settled down in the normal suburban life.Many have suggested that the twist in the middle of the film is completely unexpected, and it is if it is the first time you see it. However the more you watch it, the more you begin to notice the subtle hints that the partner actually knows Hancock, even though Hancock does not mention it, and the movie is actually moving to that point where Hancock actually discovers her powers (when she literally kicks him out of his house). So yes, it actually does make a lot of sense. Oh, and this is probably one of the funniest superhero movies that I have seen.",Hancock

55,zkonedog,"Could Have Been Better, But Still Quite Entertaining",7,12 March 2017,"The basic premise of this film is a fascinating one that really has never been explored in mainstream films: what happens when a bona fide superhero ends up being more trouble than he is worth? This is exactly the case with Will Smith's Hancock, who (although saving lives) also wreaks tremendous damage to the city and is a dirty, stinking alcoholic. Thus, the ""hook"" of this film involves Hancock trying to rehab his sullen, non-caring image after meeting a PR consultant on one of his ""rescue"" missions.What works in this film is the theme of ""superhero gone bad"". Coming on the heels of ""The Dark Knight"", which really toyed with the definitions of heroes and villains, ""Hancock"" takes that theme to a whole new level, as he is a terrible person in every way besides the fact that he saves a few lives every once in awhile. Thus, the most entertaining portions of this film occur as Hancock tries to learn the delicate balance between being a role model and still being ""cool"" at the same time. Early in the movie, Hancock's loneliness is so readily observed that one can believe he will try anything to gain some respect or friendships.On the other hand, I thought that the reveal of where Hancock is actually from was a bit lacking. The build-up to his origins are fantastic (as his scattered memories contribute mightily to his apathy towards being ""good""), but the reveal leaves much to be desired. In all honesty, I still don't exactly know what/who Hancock is with much certainty. More fleshing out of that angle of the storyline may have pushed this film to a five-star rating from me.Overall, Hancock is a very entertaining movie...and really, what more can you ask for?! Despite being a bit lacking in Hancock's character history, the film DOES provide some great action scenes, multiple moments of comedy, and an original storyline that will make you personally feel for the tormented ""superhero"".",Hancock
56,Floated2,Sub-par super hero movie,6,17 January 2009,"This movie is an okay movie but id say its a sub-par superhero movie. It started out good and actually kept going that way for about the first 50 minutes but then it all comes crashing down almost immediately. It was as if the writers gave up after the first half and decided to write something that would appeal to Hollywood. I was actually impressed at how quickly this movie went downhill.The story, what can I say about the story? let's be honest, it sucks. even the first half didn't have much of a story going for it. However, when the second half roles around, you'll wish they didn't try to add more of a plot because the lack of one would have actually worked with this film. The ending is really weird, Hancock tries to kill himself multiple times and he eventually starts losing his powers. Its wack how they showed the guy beating him up and trying to kill Mary. It tries far too hard to be inspirational and ""cool."" They should have kept going with the comedy thing and it would have been fine. It still wouldn't have been a great movie by any means but it would have been better than what the final product turned out to be. The scene where Hancock finds out that Mary has powers is weird. It seems that the movie falls downhill since. Wait until you can see this movie for free because it isn't worth the price of admission. ============================================================ ============== As for a rewatch after several years later (02/26/17') Hancock is a piece of film which could have been better. Their are many flaws but Will Smith's portrayal as the title character is good enough and gives enough edge to keep watching this film. The film does start off convincing and entertaining and comical than once Hancock finds about the truth about Charlize Theron's character, is when the film goes downhill. The films becomes more serious and her character and story is brought upon us. It is rather boring on her part as her character isn't in the least interesting.

57,johnnyboyz,Hancock's one-and-a-half-hour is an hour of formula done well and then a disappointing conclusion.,6,24 July 2008,"Here is a superhero film that has its superhero inhabit a world in which the inhabitants themselves demonise the superhero rather than glorify him. If we look at the film poster for Hancock, we can see him in all his 'ugly' glory, an immediately unflattering appearance; thrust into our faces with large sunglasses and an illogical for-the-genre hat which, in my opinion, makes him look more daft than anything else. But this is part of the pull for the film Hancock; the gimmick being that he does not need a mask or a costume (at first) to hide his true identity like Spider Man or Batman do but indeed almost welcomes criticism and exposure by turning up in the most unruly of manners and 'saving the day' in the most unorthodox of manners. The scene in which he stops a car from being hit by a train and a whale from dying on a beach could easily have been handled in a better and more logical manner, but it's almost as if Hancock deliberately hits the train and the boat in these scenes to create problems.But Hancock is really two different sorts of beast. You can envisage the pitch and the idea for the film revolving around a superhero of everyday 'quality' who goes on his own minute journey of discovery and re-image but I think that's as far as the film goes in terms of good ideas. That is to say, when a certain element does make itself known the resulting plot point is both disorientating and disappointing. But mercifully, rather than give us a great point of attack before lambasting us with a daft resolution, the film creates a jovial atmosphere for the first two-thirds and generally keeps us interested rather than merely entertained for this period  it is the final third that needed more care and attention with that sole plot point the reason for the film coming off the rails a tad.The first thing you do notice about the film, and you don't have to be in a multiplex to identify it, is its hero is African-American. It's good but somewhat interesting to see a superhero of the non-white variety to perhaps rival the character of Blade, comic books of course being written decades ago at times of, shall we say, 'racial indifference' and thus; the majority of comic book heroes are of course white. But the film is still needlessly racist towards certain groups: the French boy named Michael (Faerch) who doubles up as a neighbourhood bully towards Aaron Embrey (Head) of the Embrey family that takes Hancock in, is in particularly poor taste as is Hancock's stereotypical view on Norwegians and what they typically look like. Additionally, did any one else notice the ridiculous subtitles during the beginning chase as said by the Vietnamese gangsters? Some of the subtitles were not even grammatically correct suggesting the Vietnamese speak in that fashion anyway. From memory, I think one of the lines were ""What you doing here!?"" But other than this the film is a textbook, and I mean textbook, example of how to establish a down and out character before rebuilding him and having him accomplish his goals. The film runs at 92 minutes according to IMDb, 62 minutes of those are the good stuff in which Hancock (Smith) will begin as a down and out guy; meet and be motivated by a mentor of some sort; go through a training montage (which are the prison scenes); overcome some fears and doubts before getting his opportunity to put ideas into practice and win through in the end. Some scenes that are in the textbook in this case are the ones in which Hancock begins to miss the basketball hoop and begins to speak out during the rehab seminars. He is then given the chance to redeem himself one day after receiving a phone call whilst in his cell  what will await him, him having learnt these new social skills and ability to channel energy? And so I can pinpoint the exact moment in which the film ends for me. It is when, during said test, the protagonist overcomes doubts and, in reference to cheesy superheroes of the past, gives a salute; wishes everyone luck in a booming 'Captain America' voice and probably should remind everyone to recycle or something, that he flies off having passed. From here the film hits a wall, a wall that even Hancock cannot recover from so God knows what it must've been made of. Certain coincidental revelations occur and I was disappointed since the film decides it needs a villain to round things off. Hancock is no longer a villain to himself so a third party needs to enter the fray and that was rather sad. Still, while it lasts Hancock is an entertaining and somewhat amusing ride although a lot of the jokes either miss the mark (such as the repeating 'pass' at the rehab) or are just not that funny for anyone aged over twenty.While the themes of religion feel out of place and the fact a certain group of individuals lay siege to a certain location for the finale to produce one of an explosive nature, Hancock is alright for what it is but what gripe I did have involved where Hancock was during most of the Twentieth Century  surely he could've helped out during the Pearl Harbour attack or the Munich Olympics hostage situation; I guess he, the slacker that he is, took those days off.",Hancock

Personally, I am a bit disappointed by this one.It's like there are 2 movies in one: The first is about a reluctant super hero and it's good and funny. Being lazy, egoistic, the super hero brings more chaos than every thing else. It's great to have a laugh at those icons because x-men, superman and batman are deadly serious! Then, a second movie arrives with the story of twin lover gods and all the fun go away: Theron is very cold as a super woman and the story gets dumb: if they turn simple mortal when they are together, why didn't they die at the hospital?

62,Movie_Muse_Reviews,An unlikely superhero in an un-superhero-like movie,5,10 July 2008,"John Hancock is far from your average superhero, but the trailer told you that. What the trailer doesn't tell you, is that after the rogue anti-hero drunkenly parades about as advertised, he has to develop a backstory and make the film go from a clever spin on a hot- ticket genre to an emotional action drama. There are entertaining and unique elements that make ""Hancock"" standout, but they end up secondary to a hodge-podge and two-faced plot concept.It's easy to be deceived these days by the shear unruly star-power that is Will Smith, especially when he's attached to a project dealing with superheroes, a genre that has been a cash machine. He's talented no matter what he does, and in that regard, ""Hancock"" is enjoyable. While I personally felt his character was too much of an a**hole as the script so frequently and unoriginally puts it, that doesn't mean Smith isn't good at it. He's just a great hero no matter the film. To quickly summarize, Smith plays ""Hancock,"" a lonely, drunken jerk with Superman powers and a public approval rating of zero. When he saves Ray's (Jason Bateman) life, Ray offers his services as a P.R. consultant and the two work to change his image. Eventually, you get to Hancock's back story and some strange but obvious twists take the film down a different path that to explain would be a major spoiler.So from the perspective of a producer that has a decent script with a highly marketable concept written by some nobodies and with a director (Peter Berg) attached whose best action credit is 2007's ""The Kingdom,"" I would definitely want to sign someone to play Hancock who is going to guarantee me top spot at the box office. Well, voila. Smith is such a proved commodity with an amazing streak of top first weekend box office spots that he could get any contract he wants and he should do that. After Smith, the marks for ""Hancock"" are pretty much middle of the road. The CGI and Berg's directing style is too sloppy for what should be a clean-cut summer blockbuster. His refusal to use any camera stabilizing device works for a few scenes, but most of the time it's just dizzying and the close-ups become obnoxious. The plot concept, which paints a picture of Hancock as a hero and then fills it in with the origin story later instead of the other way around, makes for an interesting affect, but instead of enlightening what we know about Hancock, it ends up taking the film in another direction entirely. While you might think this movie would leave you with themes about turning one's life around and becoming the best you can be, that gets glossed over and you're left themeless.If you want summer fun at the movies that is about as clumsy, destructive and amusing as the title character is, you should check out ""Hancock."" ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com",Hancock
63,taylorkingston,An awesome movie...,9,1 May 2015,"I love this movie. It's one of my favorite movies about superheroes. It was refreshing to watch a movie about a superhero that wasn't Marvel or DC. Or maybe it was and I never realized. It's a light hearted comedy, which is also refreshing for a superhero movie, but at points it gets really emotional.This movie is about Hancock. A superhero who doesn't save people the way the city wants him too. Everyone hates him. Even though occasionally he does the honorable thing and saves someone or arrests bank robbers. When he meets a man who wants to redo his imagine, he changes for the better and it takes a while for everyone to get used to. When he realizes that the wife of his new ""manager"" also has special abilities, he confronts her and wants to know what they were to each other. The answer will make you go, ""awwwww...""Overall, I give this movie a 9 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Amazing.",Hancock
64,Chris Knipp,Tarnishing the image,7,10 July 2008,"John Hancock (Will Smith), known universally as Hancock, is an alcoholic bum. But wait! He's a superhero. He can fly, he is super-powerful, he can catch bad guys. Let's put it this way: Hancock is a superhero in need of a recovery program. Besides his drinking he has rage issues. And he just isn't very nice. He also is very, very messy. In the course of one of his rescue missions he usually causes millions of dollars in unnecessary damage. The media is full of complaints about all this.And that's where PR man Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman) comes in. They meet when Hancock saves Ray from being run over in his car by a train (of course Hancock also wrecks the train and smashes up a lot of vehicles caught in the surrounding traffic jam). Hancock takes Ray home (with his messed up car, through the air) and gets to know Ray's wife Mary (Charlize Theron) and little boy Aaron (Jae Head). Superheros do eat, and Hancock develops an instant jones for Mary's ""spaghetti madness"" dinners.The upshot of this rather unusual encounter determines the rest of the movie. Ray sets to work to remake Hancock's image and his behavior. At Ray's urging Hancock turns himself in to do prison time for all the laws he has broken (it seems superheroes can be subject to the law as well as the pleasures of pasta). In the clink, Hancock's thrown in with some pretty rough characters. He goes to meetings where men share about their problems but time after time he just says ""pass"" when it comes to him.Eventually Hancock cleans up his act in more ways than one. Released because he's needed by the city, he learns to say ""Good job"" to overwhelmed cops he's helping, shaves, gets a haircut, washes, cuts down on the booze, and wears a nice tight leather superman outfit Ray has provided. Maybe the ""good jobs"" are the most important pert.Ray's success with Hancock leads the corporations to get back in touch with Ray about his pet scheme to have them give away billions to end disease and poverty in return for sporting a giant heart symbol that will make people love them. Meanwhile a rather unusual relationship is developing between Hancock and Mary. But we can't talk about that because it's meant to be a surprise. It is a surprise. It's also ridiculously far-fetched and elaborate and requires pages of expository dialogue. And that's where 'Hancock,' which was fading once Hancock turned nice, fizzles out. The final rounds of CGI and derring-do and bangs and smashes are redundant, because they don't develop Hancock's initial premise any more.The interest of that premise was that perfection is boring. The gods of the ancient Greeks had lots of imperfections, and a superman who sleeps on a city bench in a grungy watch cap with an eagle on it, grumpy and reeking of alcohol, is intriguing. It's also potentially a little bit repulsive, especially given Hancock's foul language. A little human weakness is appealing, but we don't really want our heroes to be quite such a mess, and there's a mean and sadistic streak to Hancock that is troubling.The character of Ray helps to counteract this. Jason Bateman, a guy who has done a lot of TV and is best known for his role in ""Arrested Development,"" has a resilient nice-guy quality and at times Ray seems to be the main character and Hancock just his project. But should that be? We turn away from Hancock because his character is skewed too far to begin with. Nonetheless the movie deserves credit for taking the superhero idea in a whole new direction, and so does Will Smith for running with it, and the equally charismatic Theron for tagging along.Once Hancock gets all cleaned up and people start to like him we realize this isn't enough, and so did the writers. Unfortunately where they go from there was boring and comes from a more conventional and hokey kind of superhero movie. We want to know more about Hancock--we want to know what has become of his humanness--and instead we're getting lectured about angels and millennia.Will Smith is a superstar--never mind the hero part--and people are flocking to see this movie because of him. But Hancock coats him with a layer of meanness and grumpiness that keeps the Will Smith charisma from coming out the way it does in his best performances, most recently and notably in 'The Pursuit of Happiness' and 'I Am Legend.' And unfortunately Peter Berg, whose last outing was the ham-handed 'The Kingdom,' has yet to show much finesse as a director. It's hard to tell in the end how much of the messiness is due to the out-of-whack superhero and how much is just a lack of directorial restraint. And yet you've got to admire both Berg and Smith for attempting to take an old theme in a new direction.",Hancock
65,elshikh4,Betrays its Own New Formula !,6,25 February 2011,"A romantic comedy mixed with the superhero movie. OK. No.. Not OK!Among the superhero craze during the 2000s, this movie earns being so special duo to its different formula. Director (Peter Berg) tried to be as different by caring about the characters more than the explosions. The always shaking camera, the many close-ups.. all of that worked in terms of being more sensitive and less action driven. Though I HATED the endless rounds around Hancock's face after the bank's crisis; they went on and on dizzily. (Will Smith) dazzled me in a real sane performance, one of his best, as drunken loser superman, showing the rising of the ""man"" behind the ""super"" seriously and comically as well (You have to enjoy watching him saying ""Good Job""!). However, the movie's biggest mistake is betraying itself in the third act.In a foolish way, not a novel one that befits the novelty of the whole thing, the movie deprived its time of comedy. Till the funny moment at the kitchen, then the big ""hurricane"" fight in the street, the comedy was on, along with the romance, the action, and the fantasy. After that, exactly in the somewhat long sequence of the hospital, (Charlize Theron)'s heavily teary performance, the very weak evil men, and the detestable bloody violence; turned the movie suddenly into something other than itself. So we felt wrong, with darker taste; as if it's another movie; too sullen, more melodramatic and less attractive!For simple example, when the viewers watched how the lead dealt with the 2 bully criminals in the prison, they laughed. But when the movie makes them both the ruthless killers later, the comic situation loses its soul, becoming just ugly.At the final 5 minutes, the things don't get any better, on the contrary; it's messy whereas the heroine chooses someone while we all know that she loves another more??, then drawing on the moon??, and a last shot with one thief re-says the same insult which we all know that the lead hates?? This is unfunny and unnecessary!Some said that the surprises of the third act are the problem. I believe not. I loved those surprises very much. It's rather the disturbance that hit the formula. Now I understood why that script was refused by production companies for 9 years. It's not being different, it's being dissonant!They wanted to make totally another superhero movie, and they did. The thing is.. it wasn't totally even. 2/3 of it realizes its ambitious formula, but as a whole, it ends up as uneven ambitious movie. It's where I hate to say ""mediocre"" about a movie that is not based on comics, not about CGI mainly, not having usual story, and not having (Tobey Spiderman Maguire)!",Hancock
66,DarkVulcan29,I'd consider My Super Ex-Girlfriend a masterpiece compared to Hancock.,1,4 July 2008,"My Super Ex-Girlfriend was funny and entertaining, but not Oscar worthy, It didn't try to be something that it wasn't. But comparing it to Hancock, and My Super Ex-Girlfriend is considered a masterpiece. I mean Hancock tries to hard to be too much of everything, and it fails to hit the high note. I saw the trailer, I thought I was expecting a fun superhero comedy with some dramatic moments. Would have liked it better, if it was just about a flawed superhero, and it did start out that way at first. But has it went on it became a seriously unwatchable melodrama of trying to explain why Hancock is so special, and it didn't explain itself enough to the point where you don't even care anymore. Now I know it was not meant to be a superhero film, Like My Super Ex-Girlfriend wasn't meant to be. But it could have been better if it just stayed a simply comedy. Why are Will Smith, Charlize Theron, and Jason Bateman wasting there talent on junk like this, I seriously don't think they need the money, or there desperate. Now the special effects are the only good in this movie. To some parents out there, who's kids love Will Smith, this is not a movie for kids. Take them home and watch Men In Black 1 and 2 instead.",Hancock
67,generationofswine,An Honest Review,1,27 October 2021,"Yeah, this stank.Hancock had character at the start of the film, but that slowly faded away by the second half, that just sort of floundered until it ended.It lacked the humor that comes with a lot of Will Smith's other outings, and it lacks the charisma that usually seeps out of Smith.It just seemed to fail on every front.",Hancock
68,freemantle_uk,Superhero Action Comedy,8,11 October 2009,"Parody films have got such a bad reputation because of the horrible work of the Wayans Family and Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer partnership, that it is refreshing to see a film at least make an effort, with an original films, and not coping the best bits from other films and play them for comedy, poorly.Hancock tells the story John Hancock (Will Smith), the last of his kind and has powers similar to Superman. He has super-strength, the ability to fly and indestructible. He is also a raging alcoholic, causes millions of dollars of damage and hated by the people of Los Andreas. He is pretty much a tramp and hates what he does. However, he saves the life of Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman), an PR executive, and offers his services to improve Hancock's reputation. He get him to service time in prison and show how important he is to the city and more importantly, make him care about saving people. But Ray's wife Mary (Charlize Theron) does not truth or even like Hancock, and want the family to move away from him as quickly as possible.I could easily picture the pitch meeting, 'Superman as an alcoholic': that is the concept. It works for the most part, with some superhero scenes played for laughs, like Hancock flying drunk and clashing into road signs on the freeway and the world acknowledges that he causes a lot of destruction compared to Superman, Spiderman, Batman, etc... There is a lot of physical comedy, but the best bit of comedy is playing on superhero conventions, like when Hancock saves Ray, and he ends up arguing with citizens. Will Smith is a good comedic performer, but he play his role pretty seriously as well. This was clearly his vehicle. He was offered the chance to play Superman, but he refused because he didn't want to break racial lines, he made the right decision. I think an original superhero was the best option for Will Smith, giving him and all that was involved in the film a lot more freedom. The other actors in the film were perfectly find, Charlize Theron was good, and I personally thought she would have been a great choice to play Emma Frost in X-Men.Peter Berg direction is still a little unsure: this is his first blockbuster film. Some moments didn't quite work, and the CGI could have been better. But the action is solid, and has a good future in-front of him. He has Michael Mann as a backer and producer so he must have something. As well as playing against superhero conventions, Berg also does pay some homage to superhero films, like Superman, i.e. the music, and X-Men, the costume.Some critics complain about the film had a good idea and then the producers forced more action scenes to the film. But this is an action comedy, and the best action comedies have good action scenes, like Hot Fuzz. My criticisms are that film is a little too short, that there is a lack of a major villains and that they should have been more comedy, especially verbal gags. The film should have also stuck to it's convictions, and gone for an R/15 rating, instead of watering it down for a PG-13.A perfectly worthy film, a decent blockbuster.",Hancock

This movie is directed by Peter Berg (The Rundown) and stars Will Smith (Men in Black), Charlize Theron (Monster) and Jason Bateman (Ozark). The storyline for this is fairly clever and well done. The cast is very well selected and Smith, Theron and Bateman all deliver their characters perfectly. The script and dialogue is very good, loved the head in the ass references throughout.

The problem is: this movie, like most Hollywood potboilers, is devoid of any intellectual content. In other words, this movie verges on the brink of outright banality. Not good, not bad, not anything. Why even make this movie? Why not a cartoon instead? Now the movie's main character is supposed to be a hero. Okay, let's talk about heroes. On June 6, 1944, American soldiers invaded Europe on the coast of northern France at a place called Normandy Beach. Their objective: to establish a beach head and begin the liberation of Europe from Nazism. Everyone of those valiant soldiers who participated in that historic event were heroes. So there is no need to for Hollywood to make up heroes. All one has to do is read history books and you will find all the heroes, villains, good guys, and bad guys you want. This movie is proof that Hollywood is now stretching the Superman genre to its limits. Superman with an attitude? Duh.

The rebellious actor-turned-director Peter Berg sees to it that this cinematic creation sits neatly in his own universe and revels in it.""Hancock"" is a fun new look at the superhero. As a comic book reader, I had high expectation for this picture; what begins as a sort of original parody/satire of superheroes evolves into something else halfway through, giving us the feeling that the movie suddenly retreats to formula when things finally seem to be getting really interesting. Funny that a film such as this would be suffering from an identity crisis - it seems to have two scripts here: the superhero movie satire and the superhero movie itself.Hancock (a surprisingly engaging Will Smith) is a hard-boozing, hard-living modern-day superhero who has fallen out of favor with the public in Los Angeles. His acts of super-heroics - while super-heroic - are often highly destructive and have cost the city millions in damages. Finally, the city has had enough and a warrant is issued for Hancock's arrest.After saving the life of image consultant Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman), Embrey takes it upon himself to give the boozy, hard-living Hancock an extreme image makeover in the hopes of redeeming this once-widely admired lush and helping him to earn back his superhero mantle.I already explained that this movie is flawed, due largely to its script - or rather, two scripts, that don't turn out to be some hideous comic book mutant, like it could have been, had this movie completely derailed off the tracks - that seek to take things in two different directions when things seem to be getting fresh, original, and interesting. What keeps the project from really falling apart, in my opinion, is the fresh new look at comic book superheroes and their personal lives, as well as the plot twist two-thirds of the way through.""Hancock"" gives its title character a complex and involving origin story, one that spans centuries, and somehow involves Embrey's pretty wife Mary (Charlize Theron), who certainly harbors some interesting secrets of her own that are very engaging themselves. Of action scenes and special effects, there's no short in ""Hancock."" This is a summer movie, after all, and it's obvious that a pretty penny went into producing this film's action sequences.""Hancock"" is still an enjoyable action picture, even with its flaws.

72,meeza,Modest but not Super!,7,27 August 2008,"We have seen many fake Hancocks throughout our lifetime. That would come in the form of drunken, cocky male humanoids who think they have special superheroistic powers to conquer any other male or female humanoid that gets in their way. Those guys are really just a bunch of cocks. The ""Hancock"" protagonist in Director Peter Berg's feature in reality is also drunk and cocky, but in reality also possesses special powers to conquer any other male or female humanoid that gets in their way to harm the city of Los Angeles. However, the L.A. citizens do not partake in the appreciation process mostly because Hancock is a drunk and cocky (for lack of a better word or maybe it's the perfect word.) Cock! Blockbuster king Will Smith plays Hancock with no real superhero thespian powers but modest enough to give it a heroic effort. Jason Bateman plays Ray Embrey, the public relations guru who desperately helps Hancock in getting the citizens to dispel Hancock's cocky image by changing his superhero persona as more as a crime-fighter than a bottle-chaser. The luscious Charlize Theron portrays Ray's devoted wife Mary, who in turn Mary Mary quite contrary turns out to be a little scary. But I will leave it at that. Do not want to be a cocky spoiler! Berg's direction in the first half of ""Hancock"" is an entertaining crowd-pleaser by displaying Hancock's comedic rebellious ways, but Berg throws us a curve ball in the latter part of the film that struck out with many viewers & critics, present company included.

73,MaxBorg89,"It's a bird! It's a plane! Nope, it's a hungover Fresh Prince!",7,6 January 2009,"The summer of 2008 wasn't exactly superhero-free: we had The Dark Knight, The Incredible Hulk and, on a lighter side, Iron Man. Even lighter was Hancock, the least accomplished, but certainly most entertaining blockbuster that came by in that period.Basic idea: Hancock (Will Smith) is a flawed vigilante. So far, nothing new: the whole philosophy of Marvel Comics' production has always been ""superheroes with super-problems"", and Superman and Batman ain't that perfect either, especially on film. The twist? Hancock's case is rather extreme - he has a drinking problem, which causes him to cause more damage than good. Okay, so Tony Stark also has a soft spot for the odd cocktail or two (hopefully, that aspect will be analyzed in Iron Man 2, as promised by Jon Favreau), but even he wouldn't greet a bunch of criminals he's about to arrest like this: ""Your head is going up his ass, his head is going up his ass, and you get the short end of the straw, 'cause your head is going up my ass!"". Is it really that surprising that Joe Public's nickname for the guy is ""a**hole""? Didn't think so.Lucky then for Hancock that Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman), a PR guy, is interested in cleaning up his reputation, much to the dismay of Mrs. Embrey (Charlize Theron). This consists of sending the dude to prison for some time, so that he can sober up and understand what is expected from him. Once he gets out, he can become the real protector America needs, which is a good thing considering trouble is waiting around the corner...This isn't the first time director Peter Berg has handled action and comedy at the same time: he previously helmed Welcome to the Jungle, starring The Rock and, uh, Seann William Scott (plus Christopher Walken), and landed an acting gig (along with Bateman, coincidentally) in the misdelivered Smokin' Aces (where the humor was the wrong kind of black). In this case, he benefits from a witty script co-written by Vince Gilligan, whose knack for weird comedy is well known to anyone who's seen The X-Files (among other things, he wrote an episode where David Duchovny switched bodies with, wait for it, Michael McKean). The ""hero gone bad"" premise is managed deftly, and as long as the focus stays on Hancock's troubled nature the film remains right on track. Too bad the screenplay calls for an uninvited twist halfway through the story which leads to a sudden shift in tone that can't be shaken off, no matter how hard Berg tries. It's as if two different scripts had been glued together and separated by the 45-minute mark.However, the result isn't as sloppy as one could expect, courtesy of one of Berg's major qualities - his ability as an actors' director (quite easy, since he's an actor himself). Even Bateman and Theron, who are supposedly stuck in boring supporting roles, give truly charming and funny performances (now, who said Theron can't do comedy?). As for Smith, his drunken wise-ass act is arguably his most purely entertaining effort since Men in Black (the first one, obviously), and surely the only reason a sequel has been announced. Not that it's necessarily a bad idea: just get him off the wagon again and we'll eagerly await his return.",Hancock

This is basically an origin story of the lost soul super hero Hancock, Yes there is a ""man of steel"" vibe & there's similarities between ""superman"" & Hancock but Hancock feels more real if that's possible when talking about fantasy heroes!!! & he's basically a messed up version of ""Superman"" really but with more grit & darkness. It's another excellent performance from Will Smith who is my favourite actor, he does the big Action c.g.i fx action stuff but also hits all the darker & more emotional notes too, Hancock is a very troubled & complex character.Charlize Theron & Jason Bateman are also EXCELLENT & really do give fantastic performances that help lift this very dark super hero film up to a higher level.BRILLIANTLY directed & stunningly filmed with a real gritty & grainy look something you definitely don't expect from a big blockbuster super hero film!!! But like i said before Hancock is alot of fun & has big expensive c.g.i action scenes but the underlining story is very heart breaking & serious & emotional,this movie goes to a dark place in the 2nd half & that's how i see this movie as the first half is comedy action & the 2nd half is very serious dark drama & it works perfectly.There's actually alot of real life themes mixed into this super hero movie like belonging, friendship, love & acceptance that hangs over Hancock & its such a different way at looking at a super hero character. Hancock is troubled hero that doesn't understand his place or meaning in our world & Smith delivers with his powerhouse performance & creates such a nice hero that i wish Hancock was the start of a franchise.The look of the movie is nice too as is the lovely score & i get a very 90's feel when i watch Hancock.LOVE HANCOCK & think it's definitely one of Will Smith's most underrated films & one of his most underrated pieces of fantastic acting. Hancock is a Super Hero Masterpiece in my opinion.Will Smith has been my favourite actor, rapper & idol since i was young growing up in the 90's & watching the Classic Fresh Prince series on t.v & listening to his Classic debug album BIG WILLIE STYLE over & over again, big Nostalgic love for Will Smith.",Hancock
76,hu675,"Despite poor reviews by film critics, ""Hancock"" does have some solid surprises.",8,15 July 2008,"John Hancock (Will Smith) is a alcoholic sarcastic superhero (The only of his kind) is living in a very modern world in Los Angeles. Hancock just doesn't care what the public thinks of him anymore and he does more damage than good by helping the police or trying to save civilians. Hancock saves the life of a corporate Public Relation by the name of Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman), who wants to resurrected Hancock's career for the public's eye. Hancock refuses at first, especially since he ignores Court Subpoenas and the damages that Hancock did in the city costs him millions of dollars. Hancock agrees to go in Prison for awhile to help the law enforcements and the public's eye change their minds about Hancock. Hancock gets to be friends with Ray and including his wife Mary (Oscar-Winner:Charlize Theron) and their young son Aaron (Jae Head). At first, Mary can't stand Hancock. Because he drinks heavily and he gives an bad impression to their son. When Hancock becomes an public hero again by saving hostages at the bank. Hancock slowly falls in love with Ray's wife but Mary doesn't appears as she seems to be to her family and Hancock.Directed by Peter Berg (Friday Night Lights, The Kingdom, The Rundown) made an entertaining action/fantasy/drama that has plenty of often dark comedy as well. The premise of ""Hancock"" is somewhat original and it is completely different than what Marvel or DC Comics have to offer. Smith gives one of his best roles as ""Hancock"", which he makes his character very flawed superman, who is also human. Theron and especially Bateman offers terrific supporting performances. Director Berg offers plenty of story for a movie that runs a little over 90 minutes but it feels tight in some areas of the sub-plots in the movie and the villain played by Eddie Marsan is seriously underwritten. ""Hancock"" is one of those movies that film critics seems to hate badly (Only a few top named film critics like Roger Ebert or Peter Travers thought ""Hancock"" was unique enough). I also heard that director Berg cut a few things out of the film to not get an R-Rating. Sometimes i think that ""Hancock"" had a darker edge somewhere in the story but i am sure, it was cut for the cutting room floor and also reaching an bigger audiences for the PG-13 rating. I would love to see a Director's Cut of ""Hancock"" if Berg is planning one. I really liked the picture and most of the audiences were enjoying it, when i saw it a big screen theater. I think this is Berg's best movie since the underrated first feature ""Very Bad Things"".The Unrated DVD of ""Hancock"" adds 10 minutes of additional footage. It's includes scenes of the character of Hancock having an one night stand with an beautiful woman and longer kissing scene with Smith and Theron. DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD includes five entertaining featurettes. If you haven't seen ""Hancock"", see it at the big screen or the drive-in. I think, you won't regret it. Daeg Faerch, who's best known for playing the young Michael Myers in the infamous remake of Rob Zombie's Halloween appears in a funny sequence with Smith. Mike Epps appears uncredited in a hilarious cameo as the Hostage Taker. Smith and filmmaker Michael Mann (Ali, Heat, Manhunter) are among the film's producers. Super 35. (****/*****). Also available in two-disc set DVD or Blu-ray that includes the original theatrical cut with two more feautrettes and as well for a digital copy of the movie.",Hancock
77,JoeKarlosi,Hancock (2008) **1/2,6,4 July 2008,"I have to hand it to Will Smith... after having little use for him early on I've come to enjoy seeing him on the screen in his most recent films, even if none of them really blew me away. The guy has become an appealing actor to watch. That said, I was disappointed with HANCOCK because it started out with such promise but then took a complete turn in the wrong direction somewhere 'round the midway point and ruined for me what was shaping up to be a good film.Hancock (Smith) is a drunken hobo who, we learn right from the beginning, has been somehow endowed with special superhero-like abilities. He is invincible, cannot be harmed in any way, and spends his time flying and leaping into all sorts of local catastrophes to help people and set things straight. Yet for all his seemingly virtuous intentions, he is a cynical personality with a clumsy knack for not knowing his own strength and destroying streets and property in the casual manner in which he works his good deeds. As a result, rather than being loved and appreciated, he is vilified and condemned by the citizens of California and all of the news media. But there is hope when an aspiring ad man and his wife (Jason Bateman and the beautiful Charlize Theron) see the potential in helping Hancock better utilize his powers and gain the approval of the world.Without ruining anything for those who haven't seen the movie, the plot begins to thicken around this point and not for the better, in my opinion. What began as a touching and funny sentiment starts to mutate into something else entirely and, what's even more detrimental, there arise too many unnecessary explanations addressing Hancock's exceptional abilities which then leaves nothing to the wonderment of your imagination. These detours cripple the chance for HANCOCK to be something special. **1/2 out of ****",Hancock
78,jaybob,I wanted to like this but I did not.,6,26 November 2008,"This Will Smith film is not the sort of movie, that this fine actor usually make, I could not & neither will audiences accept him as a drunk,bum like appearing super hero. The last 30 minutes or so where we find out many surprises about him & one of his co-stars is not the least bit believable.The script by Vincent Ngo & Vince Gilligan is not one bit believable, The script for Superhero movies should have at least a wee bit of believability for them to be acceptable.Hancock has none.The director Peter Berg was asleep at the switch.Will Smith is a fine actor, & tries his best with this awful material, he almost succeeds. Charlize Theron usually an excellent actress has a difficult role & also tries hard, somehow she is not convincing. Jason Bateman with a different hair style is good but also not as good as he has been in other movies.]We have a lil boy in the movie as well- Jae Head. The kid is OK but not as good as Will's own son in his last film. - The special effects mostly CGI were good, but nothing we have not seen before.I think only die-hard Will Smith fans may enjoy this.Ratings: **1/2--out of 4--66 points out of 100---IMDB 6--out of 10NOTE: 66 points is at the low end of a **1/2 rating",Hancock
79,Enchorde,Unexpected development,8,23 May 2009,"Recap: Hancock is a superhero, but not your ordinary superhero. Alone and deeply troubled he has turned to the bottle and almost left society. His interventions cause more damage than he saves and most people would just see him go away. Until one day he saves the life of Ray, a PR-specialist (while wrecking several other cars and causing a train to derail). Ray decides to try to repair Hancock's relationship with the public, but his decision comes with a lot of unexpected consequences.Comments: Actually not at all what I expected, and that may be because the trailer (intentionally?) hints at another story entirely. I expected a action-comedy about a superhero gone bad (not evil), and it started out like one. However it didn't develop along that track, but instead took a turn to focus more on Hancock's character. How a superhero might turn out in a real world, if he felt like the only one of his kind.It still kept the humoristic touch though, but it took a step back. Instead an element of mystery and discovery entered into the mix. Somewhere the movie took a turn from simple action-entertainment to something unknown with a few surprises along the way. It is a different kind of movie, but in my opinion still a very good one.They have selected a good cast too. Will Smith does the roughed up hero very well, and Jason Bateman the trusting, hopeful and positive Ray. But Charlize Theron steals the game with her performance as Ray's wife. It is the small things, a glance, a tear, a hesitation. Small things that build up the character and give the entire story tension.So, not at all what I expected. But something else. Still funny, but more complex. Maybe even better than what I hoped for.8/10",Hancock
80,questl-18592,The Metal Light Shade of Death,4,3 May 2021,"If ever there was a movie we wanted to love only to watch it crash and burn, Hancock may be it. Smith, Theron, Bateman all together in a superhero movie about someone with Superman-esque powers who happens to be a degenerate drunk in need of an image makeover? That sounds so cool! Seeing Smith break away from his normal nice guy thing to play a real skeeze, also really cool.Then the second half of this movie happens. It's just such a 180 from the beginning, it's jarring in the worst possible way and makes it feel like the studio was pitched two ideas and rather than making both movies they just mashed them into one mess. I either want drunken, rehabilitating Hancock or I want epic battle of the gods. They clearly can't manage both.Solid background flick but beyond that I can't recommend this. Weirdly, I would say it's worth checking out some clips of it on youtube because there are a few really fun scenes, it just doesn't know how to do a whole movie.",Hancock
81,AudioFileZ,Superhero Turned Upside-down,6,14 July 2008,"What if society's superhero was endowed with superpower yet was on the fringe of society as a marginally functioning person. A street type who bungled his miraculous feats, saving innocent lives but with always with enormous collateral damage. Sounds like a great twist that begged for a real visionary celluloid treatment...I am just guessing here, but I imagine that the producers thought something which resembled this. Reinventing the genre. Brilliant! Right? In order to guarantee a degree of success, regardless of all other factors, they (producer/director) knew they needed something of a chameleon ""A-List"" actor. They got Will Smith, and when you think about it for ten seconds you have to think, of course, who else? Who besides Will breaches comedy, drama, and science fiction with so much credibility? They got it right here I would say.So why isn't it an unqualified success? It has to come down to the actual story and not the ideal itself. The aspect they chose to key on was the rehabilitation of Hancock. A sort of ""My Fair Lady"" theme within the movie itself. With Justin Bateman as his conscience/public relations manager we are dragged into the rehabilitation of Hancock. This, in this reviewer's opinion, is where the story constricts itself. The idea of Hancock wanting to be a complete person in the most moral sense isn't in itself the pitfall. If he did not see his dark side and desire to save himself as well he wouldn't be the different superhero and thus would not be of any interest outside of being a Superman by another name. So it boils down to the actual screenplay and overall writing as the lesser of all the ingredients. While the special effects are, as expected, extreme. I think the story did not live up to the idea. Somewhere at an hour and change we get an interesting twist and that is the fact that Justin Bateman's wife, played by Charlize Theron, is also endowed with superpowers. So, now the story is going to ramp up and get really interesting. Unfortunately not so much. In the end another turn that really does not serve the original idea to the extent it deserves.This movie is watchable and even enjoyable. It could have been so much more and therein lies that twinge of discontent. I would say great idea, good cast, and lots of possibilities muddled by story that is weak and execution which simply can't save that weakness.",Hancock
82,a_chinn,"Likable, though lightweight, superhero send-up",6,1 July 2017,"This film came out the same year as ""Iron Man,"" which started off the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I think this clever send-up of superhero films should have come out later, when it could have been a commentary/satire of the now very played out superhero film. This story has Will Smith as an grungy, alcoholic superhero who will fly in to save the day for various situations, but does so drunkenly, haphazardly, and always with wild amounts of property damage. That is until he saves the life of PR man Jason Bateman who offers to help Hancock with an image makeover. It's a clever script by Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan, from an earlier script by Vincent Ngo, though at it's heart it's still a lightweight summer comedy. Smith and Bateman are both quite likable, and Charlize Theron is good, though underused, as Bateman's wife. Directed by Peter Berg, who did the terrific movie and TV versions of ""Friday Night Lights,"" but who also the insipid board game film adaptation ""Battleship,"" delivers solid action and likable characters, which is better than you get in most summer blockbuster films.",Hancock
83,eric262003,The Effort is There But The Delivery is Lackluster,6,19 April 2010,"When I write a negative review, I don't just point fingers as who's to blame for the failure of a movie. The movie was just average to say the least. I'm not trying to be mean or cynical, I enjoy the superhero genre movie, ""Iron Man', ""The Incredible Hulk"" and whatnot. This movie ""Hancock"" had new twist on the superhero genre, a superhero that doesn't want adulation from others. Unfortunately, the pieces of the puzzle unsuccessfully connected, it was mostly due to the lack of direction of where it wanted to go. At first it was hilarious, then it shifts to touching and sentimental and to just plain old vulgar. It never once made up it's mind. Will Smith is the king of summer blockbusters, and I have a lot of respect for him. In ""Hancock"", he does all that he could to spark one's interest as the title character, even if the plot does not do him any justice. Charlize Theron is an extremely talented performer, but with her ability I found her sadly out of her league here. Jason Bateman also did an amazing job as the PR guy to the title character. It wasn't a terrible film, and really would've been an refreshing turn on the genre, but there were leftover pieces behind and the full picture never developed. The movie was supposed to aim towards a general audience where both kids and adults could enjoy. But that theory was shattered because of the continual swearing. I don't mind when a character throws in an odd four letter words once in while when the time is needed. But when it becomes the regular protocol to say it through every sentence, it's enough to make you cringe.Though it wasn't a terrible film, I enjoyed the laughs and the action was thrilling, it just wasn't executed like the way it should've. If they make a sequel, maybe another director should be in order. Just a suggestion, you may thank me for it!",Hancock
84,pc95,Mixed hit and miss....,5,19 August 2009,"Hancock is one of those movies that is just all over the place. At times it's trying to be a slapstick comedy or satirical, while others it gets dramatic. It has a pretty bad identity crisis. Once you let go of notions that the movie-makers and production really don't have a clue either, you realize that Handcock including all cast involved do an OK job keeping it interesting - however, the movie seems to be striving for satisfactory here, not excellence. The super-hero story is underdeveloped and therefore somewhat ho-hum. It has several entertaining scenes and dialog. Will Smith doesn't really salvage the movie, but helps to make it somewhat bearable and entertaining here and there. Wasn't surprising he produced it. Still scores a little higher than I am Legend - Mixed.",Hancock
85,screenman,Something For The Couch-Potato,4,1 March 2011,"Will Smith stars as some kind of superhero called 'Hancock'. That's about it.I missed the opening few minutes, which may have provided some infil. However, the character explained later on about his waking-up in a hospital with amnesia and Superman-like invulnerability. Who and/or what he actually was or where he came from was eventually explained in a confused and convoluted way by pouting Charlize Thieron, who might have been his sister or his wife; I'm not quite certain which. Non of it seemed to make much sense.Other than that it was just a standard Hollywood CGI special-effects fest from the dumb box. There was a great deal of set-piece destruction. How it was that no bystanders were killed or injured with all of the flying glass, cars and even a whale, only the moguls of Hollwood know. Every emotional and angst issue was addressed with corresponding juvenile shallowness, and there was a twee little ending that might have been contrived by an 8-year-old. A red heart 'painted' on the full moon - I kid you not.There is now so much of this fast-action popcorn crap being churned-out these days that I almost regret the invention of computers. Increasingly, I'm turning away, and trawling the archives of 'Amazon' for movies that have believable plots, interesting stories and characters I can identify with and care about. However, if you were born after 1990, then you probably grew up with seemingly indestructible heroes who can walk up walls and fly through the air, so may well enjoy it.I've given 4 stars because the camera-work, sound-score and other technical features were up to snuff and deserve a nod. Otherwise it's so formulaic, it's depressing. It's certainly boring.",Hancock
86,brando647,Inconsistent but Manages to Entertain,7,20 January 2009,"From what I understand, this movie went through a lot of trouble and changes during the production process. I can believe it, as the movie feels sort of erratic and can't seem to keep its focus. The film follows the title character, an alcoholic (and generally unloved) superhero in Los Angeles who is more famous for his careless destruction than his heroic acts. After saving the life of a public relations representative, Hancock begins to refine his image in hopes of becoming the hero the city needs.At least, that's what the first half of the movie is about. If the entire movie had focused on this one storyline and fleshed it out more, I think it would've been a vast improvement. Instead, the movie completely shifts gears halfway through into a story about Hancock's origins and how it's come to affect his life and those he's met. Rather than making two good movies out of these elements, the filmmakers opted to make one decent (though mediocre) movie with everything crammed into a little more than 90 minutes. It also seemed as if the movie couldn't decide on whether it wanted to be a light-hearted, fun superhero flick or a deeper, emotional drama about seeking acceptance. In short, the film feels inconsistent in content and the most enjoyable elements are the few action scenes and the performances of the main cast.Of course, Will Smith was a great lead for the film (as has come to be expected). The man's over-loaded with charisma and you can't help but love his character, even when the character is as reckless and resentful as Hancock. Even with such an average movie, Smith manages to shine through. Jason Bateman is Ray Embrey, the PR agent who makes it his mission to help Hancock become a real hero; he was an ample supporting player to Smith and brought a kind-hearted naivety to his role. Personally, my favorite performance in the film was Charlize Theron as Mary, Ray's wife. I won't say much about her character because it falls too easily into spoiler-territory but I thought she was great (especially in the final act of the film).Plot and pacing issues aside, this film does manage to entertain. It has a tendency to drag in some moments but the cast keep the whole movie afloat. While there aren't a whole lot of action scenes, the few that exist are great. It's worth a viewing though don't go out of your way for this Will Smith summer action flick.",Hancock
87,moviewizguy,There are heroes...there are superheroes...and then there's Hancock.,8,5 July 2008,"With great power comes great responsibility -- everyone knows that -- everyone, that is, but Hancock. Edgy, conflicted, sarcastic, and misunderstood, Hancock's well-intentioned heroics might get the job done and save countless lives, but always seem to leave jaw-dropping damage in their wake. The public has finally had enough -- as grateful as they are to have their local hero, the good citizens of Los Angeles are wondering what they ever did to deserve this guy. Hancock isn't the kind of man who cares what other people think -- until the day that he saves the life of PR executive Ray Embrey, and the sardonic superhero begins to realize that he may have a vulnerable side after all. Facing that will be Hancock's greatest challenge yet -- and a task that may prove impossible as Ray's wife, Mary, insists that he's a lost cause.After seeing the theatrical trailer for this movie, I didn't really want to see it as much as most summer movies. I didn't want to see Will Smith acting like an a-hole is his movies. I don't think anyone does but I saw this film anyway. And you know what? This has got to be one of the biggest surprises this summer! I loved it! Hancock is a movie where it answers the question, ""What happens if a superhero just doesn't care?"" And it does it great! Will Smith plays well as the misunderstood superhero. He does a great job. Jason Bateman and Charlize Theron are good supporting roles. What I didn't like about the film is that it was marketed in a wrong way. What you see in the trailers for this film is basically the first thirty minutes of the entire movie. It's marketed as a superhero comedy. Well, the jokes are funny but there are also dramatic scenes in here. It adds a surprising sense of sweetness in the film.Unlike other superhero movies, ""Hancock"" isn't based on a comic book so no one really has an idea of what's going to happen in this film and that's what makes the movie so great! Finally, a superhero movie that isn't predictable (in most cases). The film does a great job giving us the information that we would need to know, although it doesn't answer all the questions we want to know, like how Hancock obtained his powers and so on and so forth. The movie also has some surprising twists and turns to keep audiences interested. When you think this is going to happen, a twist comes to keep you off guard which makes the film quite refreshing and original than most superhero movies. The action scenes are good, although maybe not as big and great as you expect it to be.And I must say, John Powell does an EXCELLENT job with the score for the film. I also think this is one of Peter Berg's better films. Now don't go expecting what the TV spots and trailers show you. The film is quite sweet and has a good moral message in the end and doesn't really have as many jokes as you would expect. Will Smith does a great job playing the character and the film is quite fresh and original. Like I said, this has got to be the biggest surprise of this summer so far! And yes, this movie is quite entertaining! Go see it!",Hancock
88,bob-rutzel-1,"Okay, but hey, it's complicated",5,1 December 2008,"Hancock is a superhero who leaves a lot of destruction in his wake as he saves people or helps put people in jail. PR man Ray (Bateman) believes he can change Hancock so the public will like and accept him.We like our superheroes: Superman, Captain Marvel, Capt America, Spiderman etc. They are good people and we would like to have their powers to be used for good and so we fantasize or we used to (read ""and we still do""). But, when one comes along who doesn't fit the mold, then we cringe, and hope by some miracle (miracles now?) that the superhero will become good like we would be if we had the powers he has (still fantasizing, are we?). With all the above out of the way, the CGI again wins this one. There really didn't need to be all that destruction, but the CGI elves (hey, it's Christmas time) didn't see it that way. And, for some reason, directors think the pubic feels the same way. Not so when the CGI runs too long. They didn't run long here, they just ran too often. Now, if anyone can recall the explanation by Mary (Theron) as to who Hancock is, where he came from and why he is here along with her (hey, she's like him) you really paid attention to her words. I just paid attention to her. But, I did to up to a point where she said she was his sister. HA! You believe that? Well, don't. He is her husband (hey, I guessed it first). Yes, yes, and she is already married to Rayit's complicated. The acting was fine, no Oscars though. The CGI was terrific. The story? Well, there could have been more of it, more substance. As it is now, it's too superficial, an outline. Can we expect Hancock II? Hmmmm.Hope not. Yes, the movie is entertainingsomewhat. I wished it would have gone in different directions, but she's married to Ray and to HancockHey, it's complicated. Does the movie save itself? Yes, kinda.Violence: Yes.

89,sme_no_densetsu,A second-rate superhero movie,6,8 March 2009,"""Hancock"" is yet another entry in the flood of superhero movies that have hit the big screen in recent years. Here, a superhero with questionable methods falls out of favour with the public and enlists the help of a PR professional to repair his image.This is an interesting premise, though hardly original (""The Incredibles"" comes to mind, for one). However, apparently this premise didn't provide quite enough material for an entire film so the film-makers decided to tack on another equally slight storyline. As a result, the film feels like two different films, neither of which is especially compelling.The cast is pretty decent, though. Will Smith is perhaps Hollywood's most bankable star and while this performance certainly isn't among his most memorable it is ably handled. Charlize Theron turns in a pretty good performance as well while Jason Bateman plays the same sort of character that he always plays.Peter Berg's direction isn't bad though I'm not a fan of his style, which blends a gritty look with lots of jittery camera-work (see ""The Kingdom"" for a more pronounced example). The special effects are good enough but certainly nothing to write home about. Score & soundtrack are average and pretty forgettable.In the end, the movie is somewhat entertaining but the script could have definitely used some work. I'd rather have one fully fleshed out story than two thin stories any day. With this shortcoming, the movie is unlikely to appeal to many outside of the target audience.",Hancock

No distinguishing or remarkable characteristics, just Will Smith playing dishevelled.",6,7 July 2008,"An individual possessing superpowers who isn't exactly morally respectable is a great idea. If in their wisdom the makers had decided to expand upon that and excise their half-baked attempt at staging a mythical romance to occupy the movie's second half, then I feel that Hancock could have been a lot more enjoyable. Besides the fact that the love story we're given doesn't suit the whole 'cynical perspective' an awful lot and feels like a misguided and abortive attempt to please all of the people all of the time, the fundamental basics of how it's written just don't make sense...They're supposed to weaken one another, and yet she's still able to throw him through a window (or whatever it is that she does when they first get close) after having been around him a good deal of time, already. Funny how you're able to summon up these feats of strength in one instance, and yet conveniently be near enough helpless at a time when the writers decide that their audience will need some 'peril'. To me, this discrepancy is an elementary flaw that isn't adequately explained away, and smacks of a storyline cobbled together hastily to meet a demographically-targeted release date.I hadn't mentioned the misgivings of mine to any of my companions on the night that we saw it only because I assumed it was just me that found it so ridiculously, glaringly obvious. I'm happy to know now from other confused and disappointed users of IMDb that it wasn't I who had lost the plot - Hancock managed to get into that state all by itself.It's fun on a big scale when all it's trying to do is invert standard heroic situations to gain laughs. When it gracelessly tried to switch gears and suddenly become solemn, that's about when I stopped wanting to fly along for the ride.",Hancock
91,dunmore_ego,Upping the Ante on Anti-Heroes,7,13 July 2008,"Faster than a speeding bullet! More powerful than a locomotive! Look! Up in the sky! It's a bird! It's a plane! It's HANCOCK?! (Will Smith) Endowed with all the powers of Superman, *sans* the gay Mardi Gras jockstrap. Fighting for Truth and Justice with a massive puss on his face.HANCOCK is a ""superhero movie"" only on its surface. Deeper, where emotions are torn from desires and sorrow abides like ravenous bile, HANCOCK is a misunderstood gem; an insidiously brilliant take on the pitfalls of superherodom.All humor stems from tragedy and HANCOCK is a Greek tragedy for the comicbook generation, using the superhero idiom as a launching pad for its exploration of isolation and the cavernous ache of loneliness.The tragic figure is introduced as comic  movie opens with Hancock foiling a bank robbery by planting a getaway car on the spike of the Capitol Records building in LA, after some of the best flying and destruction scenes ever staged in CG technology.We learn that Hancock is ""the only one of his kind""; once a regular human, one day waking in a hospital with a fractured skull, no memories of his past - and super powers. With a tragic lament, ""What kind of bastard must I have been for nobody to have claimed me?"" In his pocket, two tickets to the movie FRANKENSTEIN. That was eighty years ago now he walks the lonely Earth, ageless, directionless, with no one to relate to, who can comprehend the ramifications of his powers or immortality.Smith plays Hancock's melancholy note-perfect, in one of the best performances of his career. He never takes the self-pity so far that we dislike Hancock, yet his plight is permanently etched into his demeanor. How can he forget for one second his alienation amongst the throng? Yes, it's funny at first: modern Los Angeles vilifies Hancock at every turn for the wholesale destruction that accompanies his heroic deeds; flying drunk with a bottle of wine; hurling a beached whale back to sea that hits a yacht; putting out a fire, then pushing in front of kids for an ice cream to cool down while half-naked; destroying property insouciantly during landings and takeoffs. The satire works because we are so inculcated with superhero lore - yet we don't see Hancock's tragedy for the same reason: our inculcation erroneously informs us the dark aspects of a superhero's life can't get any worse than the Death-Of-Parents or some X-Factor-Creating-Implausible-Powers. We never stop to consider it from the *hero's* point of view.All superheroes are alienated (from SUPERMAN to SPIDERMAN and all the X's in between) but with HANCOCK, the movie-makers plant themselves square in his stinky shoes and ask ""How would *I* feel?"" You can't die, yet you can't really ""live."" You are basically moral, so you prevent some evildoing, yet whenever you act, there is puling over the damage rather than thanks for the deed. But that is the price of super deeds  not pretty or cheap, but monumental repercussions. So you drink. You remain disheveled, you disregard all manners and protocol  why care? No one can harm you. If you care for no one and no one cares for you, they can't even get to you through someone else. Can anyone blame you for the puss on your face? Smith is all over this character like stank on his beanie.A plot emerges when Hancock saves the life of a publicist stuck on a railway crossing, Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman, as dry as a Bond martini). While most onlookers condemn Hancock for not ""flying straight up"" instead of dumping Embrey upside down on another car, Embrey is so thankful, he offers to PR Hancock's image.""Don't come in too hot; don't come in too boozyTell the cops they're doing a good job."" Embrey suggests jail time - a totally laughable proposition for this man who can fly and stop bullets, yet which would serve as a gesture he is sincere in improving his social persona.When Hancock meets Embrey's wife, Mary (Charlize Theron), something sparks and the two engage in Meaningful Looks in every scene  we soon discover Mary is a superhero too! Hold your Roald Dahl-horses: this is not a ""twist,"" this is the Greek tragedy kicking in.Mary explains: both she and Hancock are the last of ""angels, gods, now they call us superheroes"" and The Rules Sez if they pair up, they do the HIGHLANDER and become mortal. For 3000 years their kind walked the Earth, diminishing as they coupled and died. (I'll refrain from the obvious gag about women killing you slowly once you commit.) Now she and Hancock have run into each other again and must make a life-decision The public miss Hancock soon enough and he is summoned from jail to foil a hostage situation, arriving in a blast of Superman fanfare, clean-shaven, in brand spanking homo superhero duds (courtesy of Embrey), looking like Wolverine. Hancock's makeover a success, the movie skews from slapstick towards its dramatic climax.Many complain over The Villain (Eddie Marsan) being vapid. True. He is only a plot tool to spur Hancock into making a fateful decision on his immortal beloved. When Hancock is shot during a robbery and hospitalized to save his life, he realizes he has been around Mary too long  Mortality was bearing down on him - and The Villain is not the focus in the final scenes - it is whether Hancock will choose life or death. To die, having loved only a few hours in recent memory, or to live loveless forever.No matter the decision, he loses. And this, faithful superhero fan who walked into the wrong movie, is the complex funny intriguing tragic conundrum of HANCOCK.And we wonder why he's got that puss on his face. Now get that puss off yours...",Hancock
92,gianmarcoronconi,Nice,7,25 July 2021,A pretty cute movie about an unconventional superhero who makes disasters everywhere and strives to improve. On an entertainment level this film is very good for both the action and the funny parts even if sometimes it overruns a little.,Hancock
93,Sirus_the_Virus,A different hero.,8,24 August 2009,"Who'd thought we'd ever see a drunk superhero? 2008 showed us that many things can happen. Duh! Superhero films in 2008 were mindblowing, though they're not all on my list. The Incredible Hulk and Hellboy II: The Golden Army were both surprise hits. Another surprise hit was Hancock. Will Smith + summer movie = Box office smash. Hancock is very original. Enough chit chat, to the plot. The Plot:Will Smith plays a drunken superhero from L.A. who isn't really liked by people. When he saves a P.R. guy named Ray Embry(Jason Bateman), Ray wants him to be more popular. For some reason Ray's wife keeps giving him dirty looks like she knows him. Ray's wife is played by Charlize Theron. It turns out that Hancock is a hundred years old or something. Spoiler alert: Ray's wife is the same age. She's a superhero who's even stronger than him. They used to be a couple back in the 40's. Hancock is way too short. Like most of Will Smith's films. It's only an hour and thirty-two minutes. Hancock is filled with originality. Will Smith is great as Hancock. He is the only musician turned actor that I actually like. He is funny in about everything he is in. I like Jason Bateman also. I thought the thing between Will Smith and Chartlize Theron was kind of weird. Despite that and the short run time, Hancock is a good film. The action is good, the acting is good. Even though this wasn't critically acclaimed, I think it deserved a bit more credit than it received.",Hancock
94,Angelus2,Will Smith is the modern Superman,9,4 December 2008,"Hancock is a modern day superman, he is able to soar through the skies faster then any plane, he is invulnerable to any pain; he is stronger then a million men. Yet his world is full of loneliness and like mere mortals he turns to the drink for love... An alcoholic superhero with a foul mouth and disregard for public safety he descends upon the criminals, mutilating some, breaking others...Literally.Until he meets PR man Ray who vows to change his life and make him a 'real' superhero but in turn Hancock finds himself falling in love with Mary, Ray's wife....And then Hancock finds out he's not alone...at all....Will Smith takes on a new role and like 'I am Legend', shows his acting talents; he is a true Hollywood marvel....Many critics have dubbed Mr. Smith a Hollywood movie star...I disagree....Yes, Mr. Smith is a movie star and very fine one, but he is a true actor....I found the special effects very enticing and brought the world of the superhero to life....I loved Hancock's world....the last of his kind....The script was very good, but I thought the build up to the world needing Hnacock could have been much better....More dramatic and Hnacock's emotions... And the end could have had a true baddie....But still a great film the end fight scene and closure is perfect and hope to see a sequel..Or just leave it here...Either way works...",Hancock
95,antoniotierno,strange but funny and cool,7,7 September 2008,"My first thought to the idea of this movie was"" don't wanna see it"". Again a superhero movie... but can say that when leaving the theater thought it was enjoyable. The best of the story is about relationships and Smith's relationship with himself; so I could conclude that the film is more character-driven than effects-driven (and effects are really impressive...). Plus there is a good dose of humor that certainly helps. On the whole ""Hancock"" is not a kid's movie but kids too will love it for sure due to the lead being aloof, cool, indestructible, angry and alone at the same time. Charlize Theron gorgeous as usual but that's not surprising at all..",Hancock
96,bobsgrock,It isn't out to save the world...,7,13 July 2008,"Hancock is not nearly as bad as it is being rampaged against. Certainly it is not able to measure up to Iron Man or Batman Begins in terms of great storytelling and eye-popping special effects. Yet, it has a simple and fun tone to it that makes it pure popcorn flick material that is altogether entertaining. Will Smith dominates the screen as the mysterious and all-powerful Hancock, a superhero who looks and acts like a normal person, yet can perform incredible feats. Jason Bateman and Charlize Theron give adequate performances as two people that have an important effect on Hancock's life. There is a major twist that comes about halfway through the story, and from there the film does get significantly weaker. Nevertheless, the story moves on crisply and we are always intrigued by what might happen next. So, I say give it a chance. You may not like it at all. But, if you are a fan of the superhero genre, this is a different take on the same type of story with some good acting and decent special effects. See it for what it is: a Will Smith vehicle with plenty of charisma and style.",Hancock
97,lambiepie-2,"Eh -- not that bad, really.",7,5 July 2008,"The only thing I expected out of Hancock was summer entertainment, and that is basically what I got.And I enjoyed it, everything about it. What you have is a very troubled hero that thinks no one cares about him as a person, that he is alone in his quest and everything he does is taken for granted in this money effected world. I found the latter very interesting - and the one thing that was pretty evident in this film. A superhero who's feats of super-heroism always carried a price tag rather than a humanity tag - until a public relations pro steps in to try to change that.Will Smith, Charlize Theron and Jason Bateman are all wonderful with what they have - and yes, I do agree at points you wish the script and story would have flushed developments out further. And the nemeses for Hancock? Could have been better when you consider what we find Hancock out to be, and have done. But ya gotta wonder - is that avenue on hold for a second installment? There's a thought - and probably an impending reality, where we will have a second installment that will be infinitely better than the first for the material IS there to work with and have not been fully explored.I can also admit that I was a little kid when the term ""summer blockbuster"" began for Hollywood and Hancock reminds me of a summer blockbuster of way back then - CGI? What CGI?!? Blue screen, miniature models, imagination, lights and the wizardry of design and skill of special effects in make up and a GOOD story that is told well - yeah, those were the days. With Hancock, you DO have a ""good story"" that never gets its full due but while watching Hancock, I did get that ""back in the day summer fare"" nostalgic feeling...if only for a moment here and a moment there.It would be unfair to say the film is completely uneven - it has its moments and when it clicks, good ones at that. But not enough to give it it's complete identity. What this has done is make me curious to see a ""Hancock 2"" -- errr -- with a completely different production, post production & direction crew and a newly committed writing team to take a stab at it.",Hancock
98,baumer,"Hilarious, kick-ass and awesome",9,7 July 2008,"Here's an original superhero movie not based on a comic book, previous material or a remake of another superhero movie. This is just the story of a man with super strength, flying capabilities and seemingly invincibility. Yet there's a twist. He is not disguised, he doesn't pretend to be something that he's not and as much as he wants to help out, his drunken, unkind ways of dealing with the public cause people to dislike him instead of lionize him. In short, Hancock is the antithesis to every other superhero out there. This is part of the charm of the film.Admittedly, there is two very distinct parts of the film. You have the comedic first half and the dramatic second half. I did like the first half better but the second half is almost as good and Smith and Theron do some of their best work ever.I think the reason this is getting negative feedback is because the first half is so good that when it changes gears, people don't expect it to do a paradigm switch so quickly. But there was only so much you could do in the first 45 minutes and they do it beautifully. After all, one of the complaints of Superman is that he is Superman. What can really harm him? Where as Batman or Spiderman, at least they are fallible. So in Hancock, we need to believe there is a kryptonite for him, or else he too would end up being an impervious to pain, two dimensional character. In the film, not only is his krytonite introduced beautifully, but he is also an alcoholic and an unpleasant person. I don't think anyone ever thought of doing a superhero like this. I don't think you can count Superman III, seeing as it is a sequel. This is an original idea, and it is one that is executed with passion and fun.The best parts of the film are watching Hancock trying to reform himself. He has to remind himself to tell mortals that they are doing a good job. The first scene after he is out of prison is breathtaking. It has comedic brilliance, action and it is written perfectly. Not only is he here to save the bank from being blown up and robbed, he is here to repair his public persona. There is a real confliction with him and he is doing his best (like Terminator in T-2) to help out, but not hurt anyone in the process.I enjoyed Hancock immensely and I hope this is the beginning of a new franchise for Simth.9/10",Hancock
99,ElijahCSkuggs,Hancock....more like Foovagina.,5,2 July 2008,"When July 4th comes rolling around you know what that means: Will Smith time! From Independence Day to Men in Black 2 (saw those on or around the 4th), if you're ever in the need for a big blockbuster flick, have no fear because Will Smith is here. Sure this is a super-hero based flick, but that doesn't mean it's going to be super.Story revolves around Hancock becoming a better person and an even better super-hero. Gee, I wonder if he does become better? Duuuuhhh! Anywho, throw in another side-plot with another super-hero and you basically have the flick.My biggest gripe with this flick is it strays away from the emotionally weak and crude Hancock and introduces this other super-hero relationship. Can't their be any super-hero flicks that don't involve some type of lovey-dovey type dealy? I was diggin the beginning, where he was a drunk fumbling hero and had not a care in the world. It seriously made for some unique and fun entertainment. After the new introduction, it became this melodramatic, poorly written flick.Overall though, it wasn't a bad flick because the beginning was good, but for the last 30+ minutes, it just became a little ""been there done that"" feeling. This movie would have been great if he stayed a drunk the entire time. But oh well. Not bad for a summer movie, but a good entry into a bin of average super-hero flicks. Right ahead of Constantine and behind Howard the Duck.Oh, it may have the record for the most use of the word ""a$$hole"" in a PG-13 flick. That's a good thing.",Hancock
100,jaredmobarak,"Tonight, He ComesHancock",6,26 June 2008,"Hancock has the kind of premise that you wonder why it took so long for someone to put it on the big screen. With the plethora of comic book movies coming to cinemas this decade, it was only a matter of time before we were given a tale of a washed up superhero, drunk and lonely, being berated for his destruction rather than praised for his bravery. Alan Moore delved into this realm with his graphic novel Watchmen, (for which it seems Zach Snyder has not massacred turning it into a film itself), and Pixar's The Incredibles touched a bit on the subject with the disbanding of heroes by the government, however, here is something different. This guy doesn't hide his identity or pretend he is something he's not. No, he lets it all out on the line and most of it is unflattering and just plain rude. Jaded from the lack of respect he receives, John Hancock finds that he'd rather wallow away in solitude than try and make people like him. Sure he will still go out and help where he can, while making 9 billion dollars worth of damage, but when he's done, it's back to the bar and the bottle, his only friends in the world.All that changes with a chance meeting of a down-on-his-luck public relations man. Caught a second from death as a train barrels down on his car, Hancock swoops in and saves his life, while harming many others in the process. Seeing an opportunity to get back into the big leagues, Ray Embrey decides to make his hero his new client. By having this freak of nature turn himself into authorities for the warrant out for his arrest due to the multiple fines and disturbing the peace charges, Ray thinks that a little time away from the city will show the people how much they need him. While incarcerated, crime goes up 30% in just five days, people start to worry as the criminals begin to feel invincible, and, to top it all off, Hancock gets a little quiet time to himself so that he can rework his image. Dealing with anger issues and alcoholism on the inside, Ray also begins to work on his personality, turning him into a civil person, or at least as close as he can get, (when you see Hancock's smile for the camera, you'll understand what I mean). Once the city comes a calling, his rebirth will allow him to be ready to take control as someone the public can trust, rather than hate.Ripe for comedy, the fact that Ray is played by the immensely talented Jason Bateman and Hancock by Will Smith, the film delivers on the funny. I always assume when Bateman gets on a roll that a lot is improvised, and once again I wouldn't be surprised if that's the case here. The two build a fantastic rapport and the sarcastic wit flies back and forth. What is refreshing amidst this comic bent we expect is how good Smith is as the jerk. This guy has made a name for himself as the blockbuster hero, modest and heroic to a fault, never showing a selfish bone in his body. Here, however, he is egotistical, self-absorbed, and downright mean. It's like how I felt watching Russell Crowe chew the scenery in 3:10 to Yuma, watching a great actor play against type is like discovering them all over again. Smith is one of the best out there and he doesn't disappoint.As a whole, it really is just about these two guys, becoming business partners and friends as they ride the waves to success. I don't want to leave the rest of the cast behind, though, and must make mention of Charlize Theron. After reading an early synopsis, when the film was still titled Tonight, He Comes, I had her character pegged into a certain place. I was completely wrong and surprised to see where her role goes as she plays a very crucial part to the story. I will admit to never really getting all the hype around her, (no I have not seen Monster yet, it'll happen eventually), but she is very solid here as usual, I don't dislike her, I just don't see the unending praise. Also, like every Peter Berg film of late, this thing is chock full of cameos, (you'll even see the director himself, hearkening back to his ""Chicago Hope"" days in a split second scene). I mean, when you get director pal Michael Mann and writer Akiva Goldsman to poke fun at themselves in a board meeting, you know this guy enjoys what he does and invites his friends along for the ride.Despite all that works for it, the film doesn't quite do its premise service. If the writers would have stuck to the comedy element and continued on that path, I think the story would have benefited. Instead, Hancock attempts to be bigger then it is. Without any real villain to root against, (the only bad guy is actually Hancock himself as he tries to turn his life around), there isn't really anything to create a worthwhile climax with weight. Instead we are shown a chance coincidence and how the stakes of that event hold the lives of two of our leads in the balance. The situation wants to be dramatichence the slow-mo visualsbut ultimately becomes a bit out of place if not obvious. It all works OK, though, mostly because the film itself is very slight and devoid of true plot. The evolution of Hancock is a rapid one and at barely an hour and a half, there's not much room for more depth. The laughs are big, however, and the film entertaining, so as a popcorn summer tent-pole, Smith will most definitely deliver some big numbers, even though he's going against that cute little Pixar robot.",Hancock
101,vip_ebriega,An interesting take on a superhero-movie comedy.,7,22 January 2010,"My Take: A funny and satirical take on the superhero genre.Before it falls prey to the typical over-the-top effects-heavy summertime entertainment, HANCOCK is a surprisingly fresh take on the superhero genre, which also got a huge makeover at the time with films like IRON MAN and THE DARK KNIGHT. In a way, HANCOCK is a worthy dish to add to the buffet of surprisingly new age summertime comic book movies. Instead of the typical effects-laden movies of its kind (which, actually, is what this film becomes sometime in the second act), HANCOCK is a satire. Instead of your typical superhero origin story, which just get straight to the point: Hancock is an asshole of a superhero, and nobody likes him.For years now, Will Smith has starred in several promising blockbuster (usually coinciding with a 4th of July screening). But his character as HANCOCK is a long way from his roles in INDEPENDENCE DAY and MEN IN BLACK. Just as role in I AM LEGEND was a more serious take on his typical action hero, his John Hancock often calls for him to be totally unlikable. Yes, we have to take him as a total jerk, but then relate to him when the only reason for his actions is that the world isn't exactly a ray of sunshine for him. A public relations professional (Jason Bateman) seeks to change that, just as he seeks to change the world in his little ways. But his wife (Charlize Theron) isn't too comfortable when his husband hangs out with the chaos-prone alcoholic superhero.Although the last act boils down to another effects-heavy blockbuster with dizzying special effects (shot entirely in headache-inducing ""shakycam""), HANCOCK's real appeal is how funny it is. Smith is hilarious in the role, yet we gain sympathy from the character when he wants us to. Director Peter Berg knows how to balance summertime effects gigs and satirical comedy (even if the balance does tip a little in the final act), making HANCOCK a good time if far from an entirely perfect movie. To quote our hero, good job! Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.",Hancock
102,Stampsfightclub,Smith slumps in superhero summer,6,13 October 2009,"Alcoholic superhero Hancock (Smith) is offered a chance to redeem himself by an up and coming businessman, whose wife has a secret.Superhero summer of 2008 was won by The Dark Knight, no question. In and amongst the Batmans, the Ironmans and the Hulks was a film made for profitability and to maintain the likable Smith summer Blockbuster saga, a film that is harmless fun and a film that tries but doesn't succeed in preaching. Hancock is bubblegum entertainment with that extra zest and surprise to make it likable.Starting with the positives that multi million smash has a great selection of a cast that add the drama and point to the plot. Charlize Thereon adds a necessity to the romantic side with an unexpected twist and turn performance with a juicy underlining secret and vibe that every scene with her in gives the plot a much needed boost. Jason Bateman is sharp enough for the stereotyped content husband and ambitious but not determined enough convention guy. The business idea is actually laughable.The big positive is that this film is told and shot with entertainment intention and baring in mind it is an action fantasy you don't want to take it too seriously. There is plenty of moments to enjoy including a whale in the sea, a mid air superhero fight and one of the most awful attempts at bank robbery you will ever see on screen.To the negatives and with a heavy weight on my shoulders with this terrible burden, it has to be the central star. From the Fresh Prince to Independence Day Will Smith has brought us effortless comedy and zest with a new approach to humour styling, so where is it here? The grumpy voice, the slumped shoulders the effortless attempt to be funny.And the repetition is dreadful, with the key example at the ""good job"" moments. And whilst this isn't labelled as a comedy there are moments when it should be funny for Big Will. This effortless portrayal at a superhero makes me sad as from a young age I grew up watching his films, and it does sicken me to write this.Before all the blame gets shunted on the star it is significant to recall that he isn't a scriptwriter, so a large portion must be down to the plot. From flying through the air to a reinvented Superman theme to one of the world's worst reasons for superpowers the scripting is as dizzy as Hancock in the morning. It is never grounded, there are too many clauses and rules and regulations. Why can't it be as simple as get bitten and now you're a spider? This whole background base of Hancock whilst initially intriguing finds itself lost in clauses too deep to claw its way back, with an unbelievably cheesy ending.The alcoholism isn't as serious as it should be but as before this is built for enjoyment and Peter Berg blends action and fantasy well enough with some well directed fights and whilst Smith and the plot could be better, this is still reasonable fun.",Hancock
103,fwomp,Are The Critics Wrong?,9,14 July 2008,"I find myself in complete disagreement with the critics and their take on HANCOCK, Will Smith's (I AM LEGEND) latest Summer release. I'd heard all kinds of drastic problems with Hancock, which kept me away from the theater. Most notably that the latter half of the film sank it to obscure and muddy waters, and thus made it a bomb. Again, I couldn't disagree more.If you're looking for the standard Hollywood fodder and its take on superheroes, then I might see where you could run into some snags. But if you're looking for a bit of a twist on the superhero image, then you're in for a treat.Anybody who watches TV or has gone to the movies in the past few months knows Hancock's premise: a drunken superguy (Smith) is lost amongst humanity. He knows not where he came from, nor how he's supposed to fit in with people who are so different from himself. He tries to do good, but more often than not does millions of dollars of damage in the process, incensing the Los Angeles population. Roads tore up. Highway signs obliterated. Monuments defaced. Train cars derailed. It's all a bit much for our wayward (and intoxicated) hero. Until one day he meets up with Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman, SMOKIN' ACES). Hancock saves Ray's life in that infamous train scene that many of you have probably seen in the trailers. What results is a friendship of sorts thanks to Ray's chosen profession (pubic relations). Convinced that he can clean-up Hancock's messy image, Ray convinces the superman to ease up and fit in. In the meantime, he suggests that Hancock go to prison for his many warrants, and Hancock eventually agrees. The idea for this is twofold. First is that it'll keep Hancock out of trouble (with the exception of one episode of cranial-rectumitis); second is that the crime rate in L.A. will go up and people will demand his return.Intermixed with this is Ray's family and how they interact with Hancock. Ray's little boy Aaron (Jae Head) is lovingly appreciative of Hancock, and this helps show cracks in Hancock's otherwise indifference toward ...everything. But more interestingly is how Ray's beautiful wife Mary (Charlize Theron, IN THE VALLEY OF ELAH) deals with Hancock's sudden arrival. Not giving away too much, I will say that this surprise ...well ...surprised me in a good way.The story arc is excellent in that the focus is never on Hancock's superpowers but on the man himself and how they affect him and those around him. It is this ""human"" element that shows director Peter Berg's ability to take a solid action film and put its focus squarely where it belongs: on the people, not the powers or the special effects (although both of these are done very well). And speaking of story arcs ...It was refreshingly revolting to watch the ""asshole"" comment that Hancock so loathes come full-circle, right up to the very ending credits in the film. I was laughing myself silly at the end (Hint: stay until the credits are nearly finished rolling).Comments about the ""funny first half"" and the ""serious second half"" of the film just didn't jive with me as a criticism. The film had laughs throughout, with spikes in dramatic flair (appropriately) and some nice doses of science fiction/fantasy that held a cohesive whole.Perhaps I'm prejudiced because of a few insider things that I know about Mr. Berg, but putting that aside, I've found that almost all the film's he's directed to be very human (I'm being repetitive, I know, but bear with me a moment). From Friday NIGHT LIGHTS and it's focus on the members of the team and not the sport itself to THE KINGDOM, which showed us the internal struggles of the war in Iraq and not the war itself, Berg has a good eye for what makes cinema an effective medium. And the people seem to agree with him, even if the critics  on this one  do not (coming in at a cool 37% approval rating). People are speaking with their wallets, and Hancock was #1 at the box office until this last weekend when HELLBOY II finally knocked it off the top. But it's still holding strong at #2, ahead of WALL-E (97% approval), KUNG-FU PANDA (88%) and THE INCREDIBLE HULK (68%). Perhaps the critics should take another look?",Hancock
104,jon.h.ochiai,You're a hero...,10,5 July 2008,"During the dramatic arc in ""Hancock"" Charlize Theron's Mary confesses to Will Smith's Hancock, ""You were built to save You're a hero."" ""Hancock"" is an amazing surprise. Charlize Theron is awesome. Her powerful performance elevates ""Hancock"". Will Smith is the most charismatic movie star today, and is well deserved. His power not only derives from his swagger, but also from his humanity and compassion. With the caliber of Oscar Winner Theron and Nominee Smith in a superhero movie by Director Peter Berg, something compelling and special emerges. Along with Smith and Theron, Jason Bateman is terrific. Bateman is having a deserved resurgence coming off of ""Juno"" and here in ""Hancock"". Writers Vy Vincent Ngo and Vincent Gilligan create a new and fresh superhero mythology in ""Hancock"". Director Berg provokes killer performances, and unexpectedly veers narrative direction as ""Hancock"" transforms into the poignant homage to hero. Deep down like Bateman's Ray, we all want to ""Change the world."" Hero resonates to the soul.Hancock (Smith) has Superman-like powers: amazing strength, flight, great speed, and impervious to bullets. However, Hancock is a loner alcoholic superhero with a very bad attitude, and completely reckless. In the opening sequence Hancock subdues Asian gang members in a highway chase that costs the City of Los Angeles $9 million. Fortunately, Hancock saves Ray's life from a freight train accident. The grateful Ray (Bateman) thanks Hancock and invites him home to meet his family. Ray has a young son Aaron (cute Jae Head), who worships the renegade superhero. His beautiful wife Mary (Theron) strangely seems to recognize Hancock.Public Relations guy Ray offers his services to Hancock, who is a PR nightmare. Ray tells him, ""People don't like you, Hancock."" Mary is uneasy with Ray's good intentions. She says, ""You always see the good in people when there is none."" In guarded introspection Hancock agrees to accept Ray's offer. The Superhero image ""makeover"" is not easy. Here Ngo and Gilligan hysterically poke fun at recent celebrity jail stints as means of public sympathy. The process where Ray teaches Hancock to say, ""Good job."" is hilarious.Predictably the true hero in Hancock emerges. Then the story takes a surprising dramatic twist. In a quiet moment Hancock recalls his past and he says, ""I must have been some kind of bastard that no one came back to claim me"" Will Smith has cool gravitas that grounds ""Hancock"". He is a great looking charismatic leading man, with a deceptive poignancy. Charlize Theron is the most strikingly beautiful actress on screen. As an actor she wields such amazing will and power. She can shift from light and whimsical to stark intensity without missing a beat. Watching Smith and Theron together on screen is truly captivating. Their chemistry is electric. Jason Bateman is funny and compelling as Ray. Bateman embodies the soul of a very decent and caring man, who is stronger than he knows.""Hancock"" is about reclaiming one's greatness in the morass of circumstance, and love everlasting. It's about being a hero, and wanting to change the world for good. Director Peter Berg always keeps this theme in the foreground. He balances both a sense of humor and gravity. Berg possesses a great action sense for the dramatic. The bank hostage scene is cool and slick. The final conflict is an epic thrill ride infused with great pathos.I really enjoyed and cheered for ""Hancock"". It is a great hero story. ""Hancock"" is inventive, fresh, and completely entertaining. Will Smith powerfully delivers. Charlize Theron is totally amazing. Definitely, see ""Hancock"".",Hancock
105,Ruskington,Finally a Will Smith performance I can get behind,6,29 August 2020,"I'm normally the first person to criticise Will Smith and his corny self-aggrandising performances, so credit where credit's due- he's actually pretty good in this movie. The role of Hancock suits him down to the ground and allows him to show off his talents without making you want to stick your fingers down your throat.The concept of the flawed superhero in need of a PR expert is great and for the most part it plays out very nicely. However, the story goes off the deep end towards the end and loses its self-awareness to a large extent as the Hollywood theatrics creep in. Having said that, this is a nice short film that doesn't drag on or weigh you down with backstory and pretentiousness. The fairly average CGI and predictable ending prevent it from being particularly memorable but it is certainly far better than I expected.",Hancock
106,jpschapira,A new race,8,11 January 2011,"It's not so difficult to realize, on a first glance, the intentions ""Hancock"" has as a motion picture. It has Will Smith in the lead role and as a producer; it's an action picture with a lot of adrenaline and visual effects; it's, and this is never a little fact, a superhero movie. This said, it's also easy, with one look, to notice that the film presents a turn on the typical superhero plot development. We've got to be fair: the script by Vincent Ngo and Vince Gilligan is original and character driven, but ""Hancock"" is not the first recent film that tries to bring something different to the superhero table; animation plays with the concept of superheroes all the time, and this will continue to happen. However, when it comes to live action and in an era of mature ""Spider/Iron/Super/Bat Man"", ""Hulk"" tales (which never lack sense of humor), John Hancock represents a new race. Precisely because he didn't came from a comic book and because his story doesn't necessarily emulates the steps of the other stories, this is also a race of superhero film we won't see very often.Always comic but never a parody, ""Hancock"" presents us a man with powers, who fights crime and saves lives but has recently lost his popularity. We look at him and we sense something profound in his eyes. He's not a millionaire, or a doctor, or a lawyer He's just a man, an immortal human being with a lot of strength who drinks all the time and isn't able to do his job right. But is this his job? We don't know anything about Hancock, but Smith never plays him with a pose: too smart, too cocky, too serious, or too drunk for that matter. There's a short sequence, with beautiful music by John Powell, in which we see Hancock by himself. He's not comfortable with who he is, and it's never the film intention to mock him, even when everyone keeps calling him an 'asshole'.Therefore, on a second glance, it's once again easy to perceive that story and characters mean more to Peter Berg than the bad guys Hancock has to fight (or what I call 'events'). There are a few action sequences, but they are not necessarily impressive. It seems to me it's always more about what Hancock will do, for him, in each case, than the shock the audience will receive, visually and in terms of sound. At the same time, there's a more detailed construction in the conversational scenes. Missing elements and unsaid things in the dialog combined with strong looks on one hand; unexplained warnings on the other. Of course, this is not entirely serious or dramatic, but it's obvious and transparent. Always comic, the movie has silly musical montages and there are comic touches in a lot of situations but the actors are –when it comes to drama- well directed, focused (specially Jason Bateman); and if I don't tell you anything else is because there's a story worth watching and the way things unfold is natural and not at all definitive. Also, even though it's a short ride, when it's over it's not like there was a big case closed, a mystery solved or a lot of people saved in an event. There's just life, with its (sad) comings and goings, and we want to know more about the people whose lives we've witnessed for a while.Everything in the film is, nevertheless, completely entertaining, given the fact that Will Smith is a winning actor who understands what the audience wants, in any genre he's doing; and because Charlize Theron is beautiful and we can't take our eyes off of her. I saw in ""Hancock"" other things, specific elements I chose not to mention that made this for me a different, enriching experience. The elements are there. You can think of them as part of an uninteresting whole or you can give them more credit. Anyway, is as The Dire says: when there's a good story",Hancock
107,mario_c,Bad job asshole!,1,6 July 2008,"OK, I must admit I'm not a fan of the Super Hero movie type. Generally I don't use to watch it and I don't use to appreciate it, but even so I can distinct when it is a good Super Hero movie, or a bad one, full of clichés and ""Hollywood garbage""! That said, I just can tell you my opinion about this movie: it sucks! But it sucks so badly! Aside from some nice jokes and some cool special effects, this movie has nothing interesting to offer! The plot is pathetic and gets even worse when it starts being melodramatic. The characters are laughable and absurd, even for a Super Hero movie, and if it's true that a Super Hero film can be entertaining, at least for the action or the jokes, this one completely spoils these two positive features with a completely absurd and melodramatic plot! And that ending, Oh my God, that was definitely too bad! To sum up: Bad job asshole (I can call you that how many times I want!)",Hancock

We can relate to him.Will Smith does a good job of superstar-turned-bum-turned-superstar in this film. The acting didn't feel forced and the characters were believable.The only issue that I have with this film was towards the end. When Hancock was about to die, the criminals mentioned how ""everyone has their time."" What great way to end a movie with that message.Of course, Americans likes good endings so Hancock didn't die and everything turned out fine.But I always wonder, how much different this movie could have been if the ending was different.I'll fault that to a director's mistake.4/5.

109,jdkraus,"An enjoyable, fast-paced, 'popcorn-loving' movie",7,5 July 2008,"The movie cost 150 million dollars to make and is only 92 minutes long. Uhm? Either the movie is that good or is another poor investment by Hollywood producers. For what I saw on opening day, it was well worth the admission ticket price. Will Smith as he always is makes a funny, likable, heroic, and believable character Hancock. Ninety minutes of Will Smith can usually make a great movie, but he has some assistance with Oscar-winner Charlize Theron and Jason Bateman. Both thespians help make this an enjoyable movie that adds a little bit of character development and likeness to their characters.As with the rest of the movie, it went into the amazing CGI. Like ""Transformers"" and ""War of the Worlds"", visual effects have proved to be awe-inspiring and captivating. As unrealistic as the plot and superheroes are, CGI makes it real.""Hancock"" is an enjoyable popcorn loving, fast-paced action flick. But there are some things that I did not like in this movie, particularly the prison scenes. I found the prisoners and other criminals throughout the film to be disturbing. Even more so the scene where Hancock stick one inmate's head up another's anus unneeded. It's funny, but it's also something I don't need to see after I had eaten. I liked the movie, but it could have done without some inappropriate scenes as well as some of the violent nature of criminals. I wanted to see a movie that's about escapism, not reality. 7/10",Hancock
110,lark40,He is bad ass hero whether he likes it or not saving the world as a drunk is an after thought until he meets a stranger from his past,7,11 May 2019,"So I saw this when it came out in the cinema it was original and take on a not so clean superhero film. The will Smith explodes onto the screen in his first superhero film I think this action packed comedy from director Peter berg this is 1hr 42mins on unrated version on blu Ray. Hancock is sarcastic hard living and misunderstood superhero who destroys everything when flying after bad guys wrecking signs with know care in la and wrecking public property and tosing cars on poles and who has fallen on hard times and out off favour with the public. The when Hancock grudgingly agrees to an extreme makeover by idealist publist Ray embrey played by a funny Jason Bateman, a his life and reputation rise like a phoenix from the ashes and all seams all right again until he meets a women Charlie thereon character with similar characters powers to his and the key to his secret past the past that will have earth shifting consequences.

111,qormi,Half Cocked,4,8 July 2009,"This movie could have been a great comedy. It was a great comedy until it took a moribund twist during the last half hour. The film had a novel concept: a derelict superhero. Will Smith and the rest of the cast did a great job. Great special effects, funny situations. There could have been more jokes regarding Smith's attitude and scumbag ways. The film was moving merrily along until they injected the concept of Charleze's character as a duplicate superhero. The fight she had with Smith, where tornadoes and electrical storms topped off a battle where trucks were swung around was really over the top and from there on in, the film went downhill. The last part of the film was pure pathos and suddenly there's no more comedy. Terrible mistake - another film that tried to do too much and ultimately was ruined.",Hancock
112,DonFishies,Good ideas spoiled by a messy movie,4,5 August 2008,"I was not expecting much from Hancock. After his dramatic turn in the rather disappointing The Pursuit of Happiness, and the promising but fatally flawed I Am Legend, I was not sure I was going to be able to accept and genuinely enjoy another Will Smith movie. And sure enough, even going in with low expectations was not enough.Hancock tells the story of the titular hero (Smith), who in a rather original move, is a mean-spirited alcoholic. He helps save the day for many in Los Angeles, but at the price of causing millions of dollars worth of damage, and offending just about everyone. He saves Ray Embry (Jason Bateman), a public relations agent, from certain death, and as a thank you, Ray wants to clean up Hancock's image.The actual great thing about Hancock is that it is, for the most part, an original idea. Yes, comic book fans may recognize the alcoholism as a trademark of Tony Stark, but it makes for a hell of a character dynamic for this so-called superhero. As well, unlike the comic book film superheroes we have come to understand, Hancock does not want to be a hero. He just wants to be appreciated for what he does do, and left alone all the rest of the time. And of course, as would be typical for Smith, Hancock is a bit of a wise-ass. All of these elements lead to a superhero character unlike any we have seen (although he borrows from Superman's books and can fly and deflect bullets).But unfortunately, that is nearly the only great thing this movie has to offer.The movie plays itself loose and extremely fast. The brief explanation I gave for the film encompasses nearly half an hour of the film's running time. And for a film that runs less than an hour and a half, that may sound like a bit much to chew on. But somehow, the film flies through from point to point, only pausing for seconds at a time to explain what is happening. And much like I Am Legend, the film veers off into a completely different direction in the third act that nearly completely defeats the purpose of the previous two (although anyone who knows the big revealing moment already may be disappointed to know it does not build on much more). In this case, it attempts to explain the mythology behind the character, but fails because of how convoluted and useless it sounds. Even worse is the dramatic tone change from action romp to hardcore drama that is handled even less well.It is obvious even as early as the film's opening shots that director Peter Berg is trying to do something different. As if taking on an original superhero was not enough, Berg wanted to make it feel even less like a superhero movie, and more like a coming-of-age/outsider tale. While this is an admirable thought, the script is not nearly strong enough to let it happen. It just does not seem to know what it wants to be, and has an even bigger problem trying to understand its main character. Should we feel sorry for him? Maybe at the beginning, but less and less as the film goes along. Its three distinct acts are just that: distinct. They all want to accomplish something different, and when meshed together, they just do not work out. The ideas may be intriguing, but there should have been more experienced writers on hand to explore them.What is even more inexcusable is the lack of development in the supporting characters. While Hancock has something to work with early on, the rest of the cast has to hobble along just to hold themselves up. Bateman's character has an ongoing subplot about an idea he has for pharmaceutical companies to benefit the less fortunate, but we understand very little about who he is, and even less about how wealthy he appears to be (despite some rather negative feedback on the idea he has). He is basically negated to simply watching Hancock do his thing after he works his PR magic. Charlize Theron, cast as Bateman's wife Mary, has something about her right from the moment she pops on screen. You can tell the filmmakers are trying to play up on her development by making her so cynical about Hancock, but when her character finally needs to be used, she falters and flops in an instant. Her character serves a point, but at the expense of being useless all the rest of the time. The rest of the supporting cast, save for The Embrey's adorable son Aaron (Jae Head), are all underused to the point that crediting them would be a waste of time.Smith, attempts to make his character work, but the inherent problems at the core of Hancock's script plague his good work. Yes, he can play wise-ass very good, but he has some good moments of pathos, but not nearly enough to make the audience truly feel for him. Smith plays the character much like others, with very little regard for not basically playing himself (or at least, the image he displays for the public). Maybe another dose of The Pursuit of Happiness, where he is very un-Will Smith-like, is exactly what the man needs to wake up and actually show off some form of acting chops.Thankfully, the music and special effects pull through basically unscathed (although a few of the flying scenes looked terribly fake).While at its heart, Hancock may have been a good idea for a new superhero movie, it did not turn out to be one in the end. Bad writing and sloppy direction take away from any great ideas that could have been infused into the script, and sadly, it does not look like anyone appears to care. And unfortunately, that is the saddest thing about this mess of a movie.4/10.",Hancock
113,gigan-92,One of Will Smith's Best,8,9 April 2009,"I finally saw ""Hancock"". I've got to say this is definitely one of Will Smith's best films, which took the idea of superheroes into a completely new direction. This new direction was fresh, unique and undeniably funny and even mysterious at times. Also starring the enticing Charlize Theron, the odd love story is a blast with kick-ass action. The humor is one of the film's principle elements that, with superb Will Smith, really makes the audience connect with Hancock, despite his relatable foul mouth and drinking problems. Not to mention the movie is sad and actually touching and I already can't wait for the sequel. Some complain it's too convoluted and the language is too obscene for a superhero movie but don't be an ""asshole"" and just enjoy it for what it is. You parents criticizing ""Hancock"" for the language, the MPPA creates ratings for a reason. Simply just don't take the firkin' eight year olds. Let 'em see ""Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer"", the God-awful piece of crap. Besides, editing the movie anymore would've killed it. If you feel 95 minutes is too short of a run time for a hero flick, as I did, definitely check out the unrated version of ""Hancock"". More laughs, more character development and all together what should've been released in theaters. Minus the sex scene. Funny yes, but a tad much. The only other flaw is the lack of a real villain.",Hancock
114,rajdoctor,Hancock,3,15 July 2008,"I was lucky to be in Santiago, Chile  where I went with friends to see Hancock. To see movies in another country  and experience the cinema hall, the public and culture is a totally different experience.This is an unusual story of super-hero John Hancock (Will Smith)  who is not the typical super-hero that we see in movies. Hancock is a reckless super-hero, always drunk and dis-interested in life. His super-hero action is always costing the Los Angeles city enormous losses. Everyone hates Hancock  even the kids (who normally love super-heros). Here enter a marketing person Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman), who convinces Hancock to join correction center and improve his image. Ray's wife Mary (Charlize Theron) does not like Ray and Hancock's friendship. At this point  a story opens up with another Super-hero character. I will not tell you here to spoil sports. Hancock looses his super-hero powers and faces death, but at the end of the movie survives villains.The scale of the movie is big, the actions even bigger. The story line is interesting  but the execution poor. The script has serious flaws. It takes the audience as dumbheads, and there is too much of abusive language for someone to enjoy this kind of movie.At will, the director Peter Berg (the lousy The Kingdom fame) tries to make the audience believe what he is presenting. There are twists and turns in the movie that are foolish to the hilt. I won't go into the details of the big pot holes.Will Smith looks cool  but he carries this arrogant wrenched facial expression throughout  which after some time, becomes difficult to look at.Only fools can enjoy the movie.As Kingdom was bad  this too is a immaturish movie.I go with 3 out of 10 stars  3 stars for its grand scale and Will Smith.(Stars 3 out of 10)",Hancock

117,raypdaley182,Pretty Dire,2,5 July 2008,"Take a script thats been rejected many times and had been doing the rounds for over 10 years. Then make it into a movie by adding your own ideas. And you get Hancock, Will Smith's latest offering about the not very super Superhero.He's a bum, he's a drunk and all his crime fighting, thief taking & life saving end up costing tax payers lots of money. So he ends up going to jail to reform his ways. He gets himself a publicist to improve his image and eventually he's released early to help foil a bank robbery.The movie is OK until Charlize Theron is revealed as another superhero and then it well & truly jumps the shark, with an awful CGI fight across the city & pointless storms that are never explained. the film then gets even worse when she says she's his sister and then gets totally pointless when she admits to being his wife.The whole ""we become mortal when we get close to each other"" seemed very much like an after thought added to the script by someone who was desperate to make this movie last longer as it had run out of ideas. Hancock got out of jail way too early, there wasn't a bad or powerful enough villain to put against him so they fabricated the pointless romance to make him vulnerable.Will Smith plays the drunken version of Hancock far more convincingly than the sober side. If the film had stuck to ""what if a city had a superhero who wasn't really suited to the role"" idea then it might have played out much better & been a more enjoyable film. As it was the ""we become mortal when we get close"" idea was truly awful, no wonder this film had been rejected for over 10 years.Best avoided as it adds nothing to the superhero film genre, in fact it actually detracts from it.",Hancock
118,the-movie-guy,Hancock is a different type of superhero film,10,1 July 2008,"(Synopsis) John Hancock (Will Smith) is an unhappy and reluctant superhero who is living in his own world. For some unknown reason, Hancock is depressed and has started drinking very heavily. He has saved many lives in Los Angles over the years, but in doing so, he has no regard for damaging buildings, trains, roads, cars, or anything that gets in his way to get the job done. The last time he captured several criminals, it cost the city $9 million to fix the damages. The public has had enough of Hancock, and they want him to stop or go to another city. Then one day, Hancock saves the life of Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman) from being run over by a train. Ray is a Public Relations executive who now can go home to his wife and child, because Hancock was there. Ray owes Hancock his life, and he makes it his mission to change his superhero's image and have the public cheering him. Ray's wife, Mary (Charlize Theron), believes Hancock can not be fixed, and she doesn't want Ray to be hurt.(My Comment) Hancock is a different type of superhero film. The movie is original in that our superhero is a washed up drunk who is also a jerk. Hancock, the Rodney Dangerfield of superheroes, gets no respect. We usually love and praise our superheroes for saving us from danger, but Hancock on the other hand is hated for being an a**hole. By the way, don't ever call Hancock an a**hole when he says, ""say that one more time,"" because there are consequences. How can you love a superhero when he is rude and inconsiderate of others? With a PR man, even this superhero can change. Once Hancock is repackaged, and the city comes calling, Hancock is on his way to becoming a superhero the public can love. The movie is comical at first, and then gets a little serious by the end. The a**hole scenes are hilarious and made me give out a really big laugh. There are some twists and turns in the plot that you won't see coming. Smith, Bateman, and Theron displayed good chemistry together. The movie is very entertaining with lots of action and unusual special effects. I enjoyed myself, and you will to, if you go and see it. (Sony Pictures, Run Time 1:32, Rated PG-13)(10/10)",Hancock

It's just that his character isn't entirely fleshed out.Instead, we get a somewhat half-baked attempt at giving the character some back story through Charlize Theron's character. We know that something is up the minute she lays eyes on Hancock, and we are intrigued and I must say that I was shocked by the incident where the plot thickens.Unfortunately, after we get ""some"" exposition that relates the characters, the story really goes nowhere. After that, the screenwriters sort of ran out of inspiration. We have the ultimate showdown between good and evil and then a lame epilogue.I will say, that the first hour or so is great fun and I think that the fact it comes way short of great or even quite good is a real disappointment.Oh, I forgot Jason Bateman.

121,phenomynouss,lolwut?,3,7 July 2008,"...was the reaction I had by the time I finished watching the movie. As much as I have a distaste for using stupid internet acronyms seriously, that's quite literally how I felt.The movie had an interesting premise, in a superhero who is a moody, drinking misanthrope with a particular twitch-spot for being called an asshole.Very early on Hancock's path crosses with That Guy (Jason Bateman's character, the PR guy, whose name is completely forgettable) and they start trying to change him. Maybe 20 minutes into the movie or less, Hancock goes to prison to show people he won't flaunt the law, and to have people clamoring to have him back when crime skyrockets.The majority of the movie's fun happens within the first half, with scenes covered in the trailer (such as tossing a beached whale onto a sailboat) and some new ones not seen in the trailer (Hancock half-naked, his clothes having been burnt off from putting out a fire, cutting in front of kids in front of an ice cream truck and snatching some ice cream for himself), but these are all covered mostly in YouTube spots while That Guy shows Hancock how people don't like him.After he's changed to be more decent, it gets touchy and warm and Hancock is a good guy after all.Then comes the part that had been built up without subtlety... and spoilers follow.It was rather overt that Mary (Charlize Theron) was going to be involved with Hancock, especially when the director goes out of his way to show her face in a closeup whenever he appears near her for several seconds longer than normal. Then comes a post-party scene, in which he basically corners her in a kitchen and tries to kiss her. Then she throws him into the refrigerator and send both crashing out into the street.Oh ya, that's right. She's a superhero thing, too.Then starts the whole ""lolwut?"" moment of the film,, as they try to have her trying to explain to Hancock, her husband, and all of us the whole deal, and fails quite miserably. The story she tells is some mess of them being some sort of godly creatures that were created by GOD (though it is PC never mentioned) in pairs, and that they've lived for like as long as the Bible says earth has existed.. a few thousand years.Quite frankly, that's only my best-guess summarization of the mess of words thrown at us to see what would stick---in the end, it doesn't even matter what they are, as the point they drive home with brutal redundancy is that if the two of them are close by each other, they both lose their powers and become mortal, which is why Hancock lost his memory, because every time they get too close to each other in history, something bad happens and they have to depart, until one time in the late 20s when Hancock got amnesia (and a story of how he tried to sign out from the hospital, not knowing who he was, and a nurse asked him for his ""John Hancock"", as in signature).The story doesn't seem to change, but they repeat it so many times in so many different ways that it throws people off, as they start thinking ""wait, they're destined to be together"", then ""wait, they can't be together or they both become mortal and die"", then ""wait, they were built together by nameless-god"", then ""wait, they weren't meant to be together"", then ""wait, they're bound by fate to always be together"" and so on and so on until you really don't care anymore and you just want someone to die just to change the pace.The entirety of the movie's second-half plot no longer deals with any typical ""good guy vs bad guy"" or ""hero must overcome"" archetype, as a band of baddies escaping from jail try to kill Hancock become so unimportant that even Hancock doesn't spare a second glance at the TV when their breakout is announced on the news.The entire focus is around explaining, then re-explaining, then convoluting the entire concept behind these two ""godly"" beings to a point where their explanations run into gaping plot-holes, the biggest one being: If Hancock's been living in LA long enough to become a household name, and staying in their house around her for several weeks before finding her out, why didn't he or Mary lose any of their powers being in the same city? Considering how she not only tells him to not see her family ever again, but to leave the entire city, and how Hancock starts losing his powers when he is very far away from her, it's completely nonsensical that he only starts to lose his powers AFTER she mentions it.The ending is also nonsensical, as Hancock had earlier in the movie ended up losing his powers when he is shot in a liquor-store hold-up, who knows how far away from Mary's house, and when he and Mary are in the hospital, he starts immediately regaining his powers when he exits the hospital and starts putting a few meters' distance between them.Ultimately, the entire second half of the movie resembled a nonsensical mess of a plot-hole big enough to fit the moon through and a complete lack of actual plot to drive the story other than Hancock's whole ""should I leave the city so I can be a superhero or should I stay for... some reason never explained in the movie"" Because the movie never really does explain why he should/would stay in LA after learning all this... it's not like he fell in love with Mary after his amnesia, and despite all of this revelation, Mary stays married to That Guy and Hancock leaves anyway for their own good.

125,jordan2240,Fully met expectations,8,4 July 2008,"I guess movies like this show us why we'll never all get along. This movie has been panned by nearly every ""professional"" critic out there. Frankly, I'd stop paying these clowns if I was their employers. They don't watch movies from a layman's point of view. I saw this movie at a Friday matinée in a well-populated theater, and judging from audience reaction, it was very well received. Perhaps those who disliked the movie were expecting a spoof, which the advertising did lead you to believe. But ultimately, while there are some comic moments, the film turns out to be more of a character study in line with something like ""Unbreakable,"" which I thoroughly enjoyed as well. My sons (18 and 12) and I found ""Hancock"" to be very enjoyable and never boring. As far as I'm concerned, it's been seriously underrated by the paid critics, and somewhat underrated by the amateurs out here. Don't go in expecting a spoof, and you'll likely enjoy it as well.",Hancock
126,Shattered_Wake,A different type of superhero,8,30 July 2008,"In a world with the same old superheroes (Spider-man, Batman, Iron Man) getting their movies every other week, it was the right time for a different type of superhero. That hero is the alcoholic, media-shy, overly destructive Hancock (Will Smith).He's certainly no Superman.The story: After saving the life of a Public Relations worker, Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman), Hancock is forced into the public eye in an attempt to have Ray change his poor image among the citizens of Los Angeles. For once, Hancock attempts to work with the lowly human to attempt to work things out and remain in the city he's been protecting.The review: To be blunt, it's a good film. Very well made, very different. The performances are fantastic by the great cast of 'in' actors Will Smith, Charlize Theron, and Jason Bateman. The story, though not typical 'blockbuster,' actually works to be that. . . the couple hundred million dollars it's made in box office earnings also helps its 'blockbuster' position. There are some problems, obviously. The pacing is a bit off, switching between all the highs & lows without much of a transition. The cinematography was quite iffy and was also more frustrating than effective. But, I will say that I loved the inclusion of the endless (and obvious) social commentary. From McDonald's and overweight America to America's foreign policy (with France & Asia, for example) and the idolization of questionable leaders (an alcoholic as one of the most powerful 'heroes'? *ahem Bush*). . . the film touched on many of today's issues. John Hancock, the tortured (bordering on heartbreaking) hero, was a great symbol of America as a being that was used very effectively without being too annoying and accusatory about it.Overall, if you're looking for an intelligent, but still entertaining, 'superhero' film, then this is one to check out.Final verdict: 8/10.",Hancock
127,dfle3,Intriguing superhero movie with an interesting twist,7,16 July 2008,"Intriguing superhero story with a novel twist. Stars Will Smith as John Hancock, a derro and a wino who we learn has superpowers but despite this, he seems to have given up on life and is anti-social and even more unloved by the people of Los Angeles, for his careless destruction of property when doing 'good'.After accidentally bumping into Public Relations/marketing makeover wannabe Ray Embrey, played by Jason Bateman, John has the chance to attempt to re-invent himself as a hero the people can actually embrace. Charlize Theron also stars as Mary Embrey, Ray's wife. Charlize looks really beautiful in this movie...sort of like the blonde from ABBA (erm, the girl, obviously). It was only on reading the end credits that I realised that it was Theron...shows how much I know about pop culture!There is fun to be had in Smith's convincing depiction of a down and out superhero. Lots of good action scenes and humour that will appeal to both adults and children-whether through visual comedy or the banter.I like the fact that this movie is self-contained. It has an interesting mystery at its centre: who is John Hancock really and how come he has superpowers? We get answers to these questions, which is pleasing. Now, I mentioned that this movie has a novel twist. That's as far as superhero 'backstories' go. I don't think I've ever come across a superhero with Hancock's background in this kind of genre. When that background is revealed, you can either groan (for it being the kind of stuff you'd expect from the US) or just run with it. I did a bit of both, to tell you the truth. If this backstory interests you, I saw a vampire movie which goes down a similar path. From memory, that movie was ""Dracula 2000"". Saw it on free to air TV a few years back, a premiere, I think. Should say here that I watch and enjoy watching the TV series ""Heroes"" despite finding the nature of their powers idiotic! So, if that TV show doesn't bug you, I don't see why Hancock's story would.There is an unexpected twist in this movie which I enjoyed, though, perhaps, it did have some continuity errors. Won't spoil the surprise for you though, perhaps, it did have some continuity errors.Unlike a lot of movies I give good scores to here, I think this could have repeat viewing value. 74/100. Hopefully there won't be a sequel. Wouldn't be interested in that unless Hancock gets some foes like him, but a bit 'anti'. In other words, it's hard to see a sequel with the same kind of villains being engaging. If the makers of this movie do go down the sequel route, they will hopefully rephrase the origins of Hancock's powers so that it isn't so cringe inducing.",Hancock
128,AvidClimber,Hancock — A drunk anti-hero for laughs and action,7,7 April 2013,"Hancock is the odd super hero flick. You'll get a number of good laughs, some drama, and plenty of action.Will Smith does an excellent job of playing the troubled brooding angry emotional anti-hero who doesn't give a f*ck. The superb Charlize Theron gives us an other great emotional experience. And Jason Bateman is probably at his funniest as the kind hearted, right minded, tries as hard as he can good Samaritan.The scenes are well built, with nice connection between each of them. The dialogs are uproariously funny. The intrigued is well maintained. The action is interesting and diversified. The drama and the emotions are compelling, heart-tugging. And the setup is imaginative.The real problem lies in the fact that the movie doesn't seem to know what it wants to be. The action and the special effects are clearly the biggest assets, but the scenario says it's a funny piece, up until the third act, where it changes to a dramatic story. It doesn't have a cohesive whole. It feels like an introduction without the followup story. Most super hero film introducing their main character will have more meat to offer. The worst scene is the one with the French speaking kid. Remove the accent and it works.Still, it's great entertainment, especially if you like super heroes, action, or any of the principal actors.",Hancock

130,pfgpowell-1,Standard feelgood end treacle makes it a less good than it might have been.,6,27 August 2009,"Why does Hollywood always insist on a happy ending? Why? Yes, I know the bottom line is bucks and nothing but bucks, but doesn't someone in Tinseltown have the wit to make a movie which will keep the cash tills rolling and, for once, still avoid the buckets of treacly sentimentality which Hollywood has made its own? Someone, somewhere please! Hancock is a very good case in point. It is not your usual run of the mill film, it has several nice twists, there is a certain originality in the story and it seems set to break the mould and end on a downbeat, although not one which would be too downbeat. But no, we can't have that, can we. The Western World wants to believe in the Tooth Fairy and sundry notions that it will all come good in the end, so Hancock, too, is obliged to go down the road of slushy sentimentality and end up on a cheery note, so that the punters can 'feel good'. Perhaps there's something wrong with me that my heart actually sinks when everything ends up white picket fences and fresh apple pie. The irony is that Hancock has a good story to tell and at its centre is something of an enigma. The special effects are also something else, and although everyone and his dog now knows that the magic is nothing but several hundred special effects artists spending several months behind their Apple Macs, there's is still that wow factor. How do they do it, how do they have superhero Hancock smash into buildings and take huge chunks out of the masonry? Computers, of course. Yeah, right — but how? Look elsewhere for a synopsis of Hancock. It always seems rather daft to spend most of these reviews retelling what happened. Will Smith is, as always, Will Smith and I have always liked Will Smith, ever since his Fresh Prince days. It would be good to see him stretch himself a little with some character acting but . . . Charlize Theron deserves a great deal of credit for allowing several close-ups to be used which show her skin is less than perfect, but she is, after all, of Afrikaner stock and such people are at tad more down to earth than your average nubile Mid-West wannabe. Don't let me put you off this film (especially, of course, if you are in the majority and are something of a sucker for sentimental, schlocky closure) but all I can say is that I have a niggling suspicion the Hancock, in other hands, produced in another culture could have been a far better film.

132,emperor_bender,"Did so well for the first half, but then sloped downhill",6,18 July 2008,"This movie felt like 2 different movies almost. The plot shifts halfway through.The first half was gold. It begins as Hancock (Will Smith) is a loser superhero that everyone hates. He is careless and a jerk to everyone. Then he meets Ray, an unsuccessful image consultant who has a plan to save the world, although no business opportunities come his way. Ray convinces Hancock to go to jail and to change his life, and after much aggravation, he succeeds and turns over a new leaf.The second half is not so good. They bring in another superhero: Mary, Ray's wife. Turns out she was one the whole time and they were lovers since the B.C.'s but broke up long ago. They cannot be near each other because then they turn human somehow.Yes, this new plot is stupid and illogical. And it doesn't even fully explain Hancock's powers. It doesn't even reveal his real name. There were more holes than a sweater after the moths got to it.Over all, good movie. Funny, action-packed, interesting.

133,TheEmulator23,Not enough re-shoots in the world could save this.,4,4 July 2008,"They kept re-shooting and re-shooting this because of ""poor audience"" reactions. I can tell you that they needed to have redone just about the whole picture. I like Will Smith, Charlize Theron, & the finally getting the roles & recognition he deserves Jason Bateman, but NOBODY could have saved this. I heard that this was one of the best scripts when it first was floating around town so it really makes you wonder what happened? This movie isn't the worst thing ever made, but it is one of the worst of the summer & is Will Smith's worst summer movie (even Men in Black II is better!) he's ever done. I have a strong suspicion that a lot of the problem w/this is because of studio tampering amongst other things. Right off the bat you know something is wrong when a Superhero flick is a scant 92 minutes (only about 1 hour twenty-something minutes when you take out the credits) and the whole ""explanation"" is a cop-out. I am willing to bet this is going to be right on par with the 1st ""Hulk"" when it tanks 65-70% it's second weekend. This is probably one of the dullest Superhero movies you will ever see & I very much doubt anyone that sees this will ever want to revisit it again either. If Will Smith makes this a hit (which he probably will) he can sell any movie. The acting is good, the special effects are passable, & the cinematography isn't bad, but other than that, skip this unless you thought Will Smith's ""Wild Wild West"" was a classic. Peter Berg has yet to show us what he can really do with a big budget (""The Kingdom"" doesn't count & ""Friday Night lights"" was probably 1/5 this budget) & a good story. In a field crowded with Good Superhero movies, we don't have to swallow anymore of these if we stop going to see them. This movie will be a laughing matter as soon as ""The Dark Knight"" comes out anyway.",Hancock
134,EthanBJones_03,Just No; Wouldn't Recommend,2,25 May 2017,"'Hancock' was directed by Peter Berg and stars Will Smith, Jason Bateman and Charlize Theron. Thanks to his alcoholism and lack of charm, Hancock(Will Smith) is despised by the public despite helping a lot of people. This should all change when he meets PR Manager Ray Embrey(Jason Bateman), who wants to make Hancock a fully loved superhero.This movie is just not entertaining. If you enjoy this movie then fine, enjoy its poorness but don't come to me and say 'oh its an in depth character study of what its like to be a superhero' because I will punch you. Very little other than Smithy's little hamster legs are keeping this movie spinning, and little other than him make this movie even remotely watchable. The story is poor, the acting is lacklustre, none of the characters are even remotely likable or interesting; it's just a really shabbily made movie. I will say that the lack of a central villain(other than Captain Hook) was this movie's primary downfall. Movies can be great without a strong villain('Iron Man) or even a villain full stop('Cast Away') but for a movie like this, I feel like one was necessary and the inclusion of a more prominent one would have been to this movie's favour. If you feel the need to watch this piece of sweaty cheese, I cannot stop you but I definitely recommend you avoid it at all cost.The story was so bland in this movie, and so forgettable. It was incredibly dull and its ending sucked. They tried to add more lore in one scene that there are pages in the Qu'ran. One thing that no one can take away from Will Smith is how charismatic the guy is. He could make 'Schindler's List' an even funnier comedy just by being there. Hancock, on the other hand, is a worthless waste of space who contains no redeeming qualities and is just unlikable. He could have been written so much better, to the point where I actually care about the public liking him. As much as I like Jason Bateman, his character was very one dimensional and any attempts to make him multi-dimensional failed miserably. Charlize Theron was also entirely one note throughout the entire movie. She was angry the entire time aside from those precious moments were a character shows 'Emotion?'. Preposterous! Movies aren't about emotion. They're about slow motions lumps of fat bounding in the wind, alcoholism and The Rock. Who needs acting and emotion and WRITING AND ANYTHING THAT MAKES A MOVIE WORTH WATCHING!!!!!!!!! Jae Head was pretty weak as Aaron and served no purpose to the 'plot'. There were little to no character motivations and any attempts at them were entirely contrived and didn't need to be there. My main flaw with this movie is that Hancock has no real opposition. Movies like THIS require villains with more complexity than CAPTAIN HOOK. Go back to Netherland you handless, green tight wearing waste of space. The cinematography was awful. The editing was abysmal. Facebook live videos are better shot than this. I least the camera is straight in them. It's clear that Berg went to the CGI Fetish Anonymous meeting with George Lucas because it's just awful in this movie and is used so frequently. Lucas and Berg like poor CGI more than Hitler loved baking. The costume design was very bland and the set design was very generic. It was a very technically flawed movie.The action in this movie was atrocious. The humour was terrible and even 'some kinda Suicide Squad' couldn't 'white people that ****'. It failed to set up the characters well and all world building was terribly done. In conclusion, I despise this movie and I can't comprehend how people like it. The story was generic. The acting was very poor. The characters were very weak and there is little in this movie to hold it above complete and utter failure. Run little Smith, run because if this movie catches up to you, you're gonna be Facebook living the 'Squad'.2/10",Hancock
135,johnnymacbest,It's a good movie and I liked it; could've used more oomph.,7,13 July 2008,"Hancock is original. It's not Marvel or DC but it wears it's comic book adventure elements on it's sleeve in live-action form. Will Smith gives a good performance as well as Jason Bateman and Charlize Theron (DAMN this woman is SEXY!!) admirably. I enjoyed the action and touching moments Hancock and the special effects are good in a naturalistic setting with some well-timed comedic moments thrown in. The fact that it's not an entirely superhero movie is also a plus and that makes it stand out a little amongst the big-name superhero movies coming out this summer; namely Hellboy 2 and The Dark Knight. However, the only fault in Hancock is that there's no real central villain and not enough info on Will and Theron's origins and the possibilities of others like them (especially towards the climax). There's no doubt I couldn't help but feel that some juicy material was removed from the final cut. So in all respects, Hancock is a good film and I must say that I liked it and is original in it's presentation but the film could've used more oomph, content wise.

We're quickly alerted to his amazing skills in a full-on scenario. He catches the baddies, obviously, and comes up with a creative way of stopping them. In the process he causes of $7million damage and this feat causes the city to put out a warrant for his arrest.Between the event and the warrant being issued, Hancock comes across Ray (Bateman, in his best work since ""Valerie""), a struggling PR guy who gets saved by Hancock in a near train accident. Ray befriends Hancock and goes to work trying to improve Hancock's image. When the warrant is issued, Ray convinces Hancock this scenario is a perfect chance to build a new Hancock. Hancock reluctantly agrees and starts to implement Ray's plans.Will it work? See it to find out.The movie started really well and the storyline was intriguing....and then about halfway through there was a twist which was really annoying and took the story somewhere I decided I didn't want it to go about 3 seconds into it. What could have been a really cleverly played out story just got wasted.

It started out good and actually kept going that way for about the first 50 minutes but then it all comes crashing down almost immediately. It was as if the writers gave up after the first half and decided to write something that would appeal to Hollywood. I was actually impressed at how quickly this movie went downhill.I've never been a fan of Will Smith. I mean, I never thought he was too great of an actor and his roles are usually cliché or just plain annoying to me. This was pretty much the same. He had some really funny lines but as a whole, I didn't like his character at all. The rest of the cast was pretty good in general and there were some good characters.The story, what can I say about the story? let's be honest, it sucks. even the first half didn't have much of a story going for it. However, when the second half roles around, you'll wish they didn't try to add more of a plot because the lack of one would have actually worked with this film. It tries far too hard to be inspirational and ""cool."" They should have kept going with the comedy thing and it would have been fine. It still wouldn't have been a great movie by any means but it would have been better than what the final product turned out to be.Wait until you can see this movie for free because it isn't worth the price of admission.

Lead actors Will Smith and Charlize Theron, a big budget and a good idea should give any Director a good head start, Peter Berg squanders it all in an unimaginative disaster.The script is cliché ridden and formulaic,and the ""happy moon"" ending vomit inducing. In trying to straddle the comedy, action and superhero genres it falls flatly on its ""ass"" (sic). The ""action"" sequences are occasionally quite disturbing for a uk 12a certificate.Now I enjoy my Peckinpah and Tarrantino along with the best. however the convention for this certificate film is that the violence is ""comic book"".The opening sequence of hoodlums spraying a busy freeway, among which are chasing cops, with Uzi sub-machine gun rounds (several hundred a minute)is not Comic strip.The same is true when a Bank is held up and the robbers sprays the busy street with Uzi, heavy calibre machine gun and what looks like an RPG fire.Equally is having women and children wired up to Hamas style explosive vests funny? America has a serious problem with lone young gunmen and random massacres. The naive sanitization of these sequences helps no-one.Supporting actor Jason Bateman looks as uncomfortable as the part is, as part of the ""triangle"" between himself,Theron and Smith. The use of the formers ""child"" for the most excruciating ""kid"" moments are frankly excruciating.The cinema was pretty full, I heard no-one laugh out loud once. the idea of a ""flawed"" superhero is a good one.

The special effects are really good and it has a really good rhythm which makes the movie enjoyable and it never bores you down. The cast is pretty good. Will Smith in a role that fits him perfectly, his performance is really funny and convincing.

1. Both Will Smith (John Hancock) and Charlize Theron (Mary) give great performances.
2. The emotional scenes, with thanks to the acting and well-timed pauses, land with great effect.
3. The humour is fantastically dry and dark, which prevents the film from becoming stale.
4. The action scenes are well-choreographed and entertaining.
5. The CGI and special effects, aside from a couple instances, look great and still hold up 12 years later.Cons:
1. There are a plethora of really strange editing and camera angles which take you out of the viewing experience.
2. There are a couple plot-holes. For example, why did Red (Eddie Marsan) only take Man Mountain (David Mattey) and Matrix (Maetrix Fitten) to confront Hancock at the hospital, after it had already been established that most of the prison population was there because of Hancock?
3. During the action scenes, obnoxious and corny stock action music is played.
4. The movie doesn't focus enough on the philosophical reasoning behind a superhero negating their duties, and whether or not they should have free will to decide their superhero role.
5. The entire sequence featuring Hancock and Mary fighting in LA not only has the worst looking special effects, but the conflict just feels really forced.",Hancock
145,Jacques98,At least it tried . . .,5,6 September 2008,"Let me get this out of the way before I bash this movie: the first 2/3ds of Hancock was done flawlessly for what it was trying to accomplish. A nihilistic superhero that cares more about himself than other people. A lot of jokes and events that were slapstick and crude, Pulp Fiction-style. A plot that didn't take itself too seriously, but wasn't so ridicules that the audience couldn't take it seriously at all.Yes, the first 2/3ds of the movie were fun and near flawless, if even a bit, dare I say it, borderline original. Nothing that's going to blow your brain, but still fun and anti-cliché enough to be a fun summer movie.The last 1/3rd of the movie turns into a family-friendly episode of The Twilight Zone as the twists are revealed. All the amazing nihilism disappears, as does the ability to take Hancock seriously as he puts on one of the cheesiest superhero costumes in history. When you see this in the theater it's a lot like a slap in the face, but over time I've grown to understand and like it a little more than I did.The action scenes aren't all that well-done, and neither is the film itself. It seems a lot like a prototype for what could really be a superhero movie, and I think that is what it was going for, and I also think I liked that aspect. It's not as well-done as Spider-Man, and it's not as ridiculously dull as all the other Marvel adaptations lately.I praise Hancock for being a fun, anti-cliché movie with some crude elements to make people like me smile every now and then.

Actor/Director Peter Berg does a good job of bringing this movie to the big screen with cool special effects, some intense action, and humor but the film overall could've been better. The special effects and the action sequences are well executed but unfortunately none of them stand out. I really wanted to like this movie which I did but there were something things that weren't the greatest. Some of the surprises I saw coming and the film lacked a villain who posed as a real threat to Will Smith's Hancock. There's one the movie but his character isn't that interesting just your average criminal who lacks screen time, development, and dialogue. Smith does a solid job in the title role playing a man with powers who doesn't want to be a superhero and is looking for answers to his mysterious past. Charlize Theron is good as always as Mary Embrey who looks at Hanock as if they've met before and has a big secret of her own. Jason Bateman is funny as Mary's husband Ray who is saved by Hancock and tries to help him change his image so that people will respect him. The rest of the cast are okay in their roles but none of them have much to do. As mentioned before the special effects are cool but some of them aren't the greatest either because you know most of what you're seeing was done in a computer. Overall though Hanock is worth seeing because of the impressive performances by the cast who make it with your time. If you're a fan of Will Smith or you're just looking for a movie with some action and humor you can't go wrong with Hancock. If you can't get past it's flaws Hanock makes for a somewhat entertaining movie to watch.",Hancock
147,galileo3,Hancock is a mediocre film with some hilarious moments but more disappointing and sloppy ones. 4/10,4,6 July 2008,"Hancock (2008) Hancock will be a worldwide smash-hit, there is no doubt in my mind. Its a blockbuster with a new outlook starring Will Smith. What else do you want? Personally I love Will Smith, I think he is both a great and versatile actor and also very entertaining.Before going to see this film at the cinema I had mixed feelings. After seeing the film I still have mixed feelings. There are several reasons why I feel this way and I will explain.Firstly the film often gets caught up in many unnecessary sub-plots, has some dry moments (although they are balanced by some hilarious scenes) and loses focus. My main criticism of the film is the last act and the introduction of Charlize Theron as a superhero. I just thought all that crap about the history of superheroes and this and that was unnecessary. It should have been just Will Smith as an outcast superhero. Nothing else. I don't really care why he has superpowers and how he got them and this and that as long as the film is entertaining.A mixed bag. Good moments, sloppy storyline bad ending, I am afraid Hancock scores (just)...4/10",Hancock
148,The_Amazing_Spy_Rises,"Classic case of great idea, mediocre execution. Strong performances are marred by weak CGI and a lack of a central villain.",6,1 July 2008,"Will Smith. That's all you've got to say, and you're guaranteed a big opening at the box office. Well, from the looks of it, Smith also guarantees you at least a mildly entertaining film, which is what we get in his latest movie, Hancock. In the hands of any other leading star, Hancock would probably end up being a below average film. It's Smith's charisma, charm, and unwavering likability that ultimately save the film. He can make you laugh, cheer, cry, and even root for his character (who is a total ass, as he is reminded a number of times throughout the movie) no matter what kind of shenanigans he may cause.Hancock is not the generic superhero film and is probably one of the more ingenious ideas to come across a producer's desk in quite some time. To me, what it seems like is that the writers of the film loved the idea, started off extremely strong, and then began to realize that how hard it is to sustain a simplistic idea over the course of a full length motion picture (and it is because of this that Hancock is relatively short). The writers' plan to solve this problem is to throw in a totally unnecessary and badly handled plot twist to keep the audience guessing. The lack of a central villain also hurts the movie a lot. The character that serves as Hancock's enemy in the finale isn't even well acted. The person is laughable.This is an action movie, so it should come as no surprise to see well done and original action in the movie. However, I felt the effects could have used a few more weeks of polishing in the editing room. The camera is also quite crampy. I also have problems with the film's score, as it does not add an epic feeling to the film like it should have. I felt like something was missing in the climax of the film (which is not the end). The action scenes, while entertaining and original, were not long enough to engage the audience like say, The Incredible Hulk, nor were they as jaw dropping as those in Wanted.The film's strength rides on its three stars. Action veterans Will Smith and Charlize Theron both deliver winning performances as usual, and that should come as no surprise. Smith's charisma is enough to make anyone happy, and it's so easy to see why so many people love him. Theron is always a sight to behold (except in Monster, lol), and this film is no different. I enjoyed her performance the most, especially in the second act and the beginning of the third. Jason Bateman, who seems to be the bridge connecting the performances of Smith and Theron, is great as usual, and likable, marking a change from his recent turn in ""Juno"". There really isn't another performance to note, and part of Hancock's weakness is that there are really only three main engaging characters. It should also be noted that the kid who played Bateman's son was absolutely adorable.Hancock is the classic case of great idea, and mediocre execution. I can see this idea being remade years from now, and pulled off even better. It's not a fault of Peter Berg, the film's director, as the real weakness is in the screenplay, which falters after an excellent and wonderful opening act. It's not a bad film by any means, nor is it great. It's in between ""okay"" and ""good"".",Hancock
149,Jay_Exiomo,Smith is still charming in a wasted good premise,5,3 July 2008,"""Hancock"" is a confused production. It has an intriguing premise in that the highly charismatic Will Smith plays a reluctant superhero whom everyone hates - and he hates everyone - for the damages he cause every time he comes to the rescue. But the lead actor's charm is wasted in a material that doesn't know what to do with its setup and essentially scrambles to decide what to do next, ending up as a generic summer movie that had the potential to effectively satirize other movies of its genre.Smith plays John Hancock, a perennial drunkard who feels obligated to help the people of Los Angeles from their troubles. Problem is, no one likes him - and he retaliates by not liking them either, throwing off vulgarities that never seem offensive either because Smith is saying them, or because of the PG-13 rating.He meets public-relations specialist Ray Embry (Jason Bateman) after rescuing the latter from certain death in a railway. In return, Ray takes it upon himself to have Hancock transform into someone people will actually look forward to seeing, and this involves doing time in jail. His wife Mary (Charlize Theron) hates the idea and would rather have Hancock stay out of their lives.Then director Peter Berg, and writers Vy Vincent Ngo and Vince Gilligan hit a wall. The dark comedy turns into a conventional superhero movie thereon, with subpar CGI and a messy narrative to boot. The exposition is hurriedly done and Hancock's backstory is covered in such a flimsy manner to give way to more summer movie orthodoxy, and a twist that has been telegraphed right from the setup.Smith is always fun to watch and he'll always be a crowd pleaser, even in this film which reduces his character's edge to mere banality. Which is unfortunate, because underneath all the trapping lies a more substantial promise.",Hancock
150,mardalsfossen01,"Fun ""Superhero"" watch",7,7 January 2019,"I really liked 'Hancock', it had funny parts in it, good CGI and plot twists. Just, towards the end, one part of the story didn't impress me too much and I *think* there's a plot hole, but I am not sure.
Nonetheless, I think 'Hancock' is a fun watch. Unfortunately it passed right over my radar all the years since I didn't even know it was about Superhero-like powers etc. when I saw the title and the cover (just Will Smith with a beanie on and glasses). But I'm glad, I've seen it now. It is a decent movie !",Hancock
151,TheCorniestLemur,There is definitely potential,5,6 September 2021,"I don't know what to think of this.On the one hand, I watched it by myself and thought it was a surprisingly unique take on superhero tropes, and that's kind of impressive in a pre-MCU era, but on the other, I talked about it with some friends who also watched it, and I couldn't really disagree with them dunking on it.But let's start with the good. Firstly: Will Smith. Typically, you don't see an egotistical alcoholic and think he'd be good in that sort of role, but I have to admit he made it believable at the very least. He's certainly a little too one-note, but I do totally believe that he's completely alone, bored, and fed up with his life.In fact, the acting in general is better than you'd think a film like this would deserve. And - sue me I guess, but I did like the story that was given to me. Looking back on it now, I can't deny it would have been more interesting if they had stuck to their guns in the second half instead of trying to awkwardly make it about Hancock's past coming back to haunt him, because it does kind of run out of places to go at around an hour in and falls back on cliches, but while watching it, for some reason that just didn't occur to me. I wouldn't call the second half bad though.This is also an admittedly ugly film, for some reason it's shot like some kind of gritty action movie or war drama, and the effects are terrible, while there also aren't that many particularly memorable shots.But there is some great dialogue, a few honestly amazing scenes, and above all else, I don't think anyone can deny that this film is...unique.And even though it gets messy later on, I think a big reason I didn't notice while I was watching it is that it doesn't feel unsatisfying because of that. The sharp turn the narrative takes in its second half is more due to Hancock's character arc already being complete, rather than them just forgetting about it.It still could have been way better had they just...not done that, but I maintain this is still interesting enough to warrant a watch, even more so today than in 2008, probably.",Hancock
152,mirosuionitsaki2,Idea not put together well but other things make up for that,8,11 July 2008,"Just coming back from the movies really an hour ago that I started typing this review to see Hancock, I had mixed reactions about this movie. I thought this movie was a great movie, but I also think that there could have been more done. The movie seemed like a jumble of ideas that should've been put together a little better. Also, unlike what some people say, there is good action here, but the reason of those action scenes aren't that great. For example, a long scene fighting a woman just because Hancock called her crazy.Let me start with a plot. Hancock was born thousands of years ago but can only remember eighty years of his life. He doesn't age and people hate him. Well, with the help of a guy, Hancock agrees to go to jail for two weeks until he is called into battle. Pretty good, huh? Yeah, it was pretty good.There is a lot of action here. So that will keep you going, and also, This movie was pretty funny, too. Very hilarious scenes. This will make a great superhero movie. You should give this film a chance. There are better movies to see this summer such as The Incredible Hulk, and Iron Man but this is also a great movie to see. You will enjoy it.",Hancock

Then there's...""",5,24 March 2012,"A hard-living superhero who has fallen out of favor with the public enters into a questionable relationship with the wife of the public relations professional who's trying to repair his image.I'm going to state what I always say about superhero movies, they mostly suck. I'm not saying there's no GOOD superhero films, because they're a lot that are. But for the majority, they suck. When I first saw Hancock, I thought it looked pretty stupid. It seemed cliché, in a sense where it takes from other superhero films. It seems unfunny, as you can tell from both the trailer AND movie. And it looked just stupid, unoriginal, a pile of poop. When I finally watched the movie, I was brought back by some good things.. then some bad things. Firstly, the first thing I'd like to add, is how this film is labeled as a comedy. If I would have to label the film, I would call it a ""dark comedy"" as in it's about a drunken superhero. Aha, that's hilarious isn't it? Things could've been funny if the movie wasn't so dark in it's nature. This is a good thing in my opinion, as by the trailer you'd think otherwise... Secondly, by the last 30 minutes, the film is surprisingly really good. It's somewhat emotional, makes you think, and is pretty crazy. Sadly, the rest of the film isn't good. Hancock attempts to be (in my opinion) new and inventive, but just comes out as a wanna-be movie. The take of comedy isn't funny whatsoever and the plot is a bit cliché, SOMETIMES. It was somethings about it that I lied, and others that I just sat with a poker face. I don't know whether to recommend the movie, as it's has 50/50 likes and dislikes. It all depends on what you like, though, so I have nothing to give you. I give it 5/10.",Hancock
154,mistoppi,Refreshing superhero movie,8,16 June 2017,"Hancock has been on my watchlist since I really started liking Will Smith, which was about a year ago. When I finally managed to watch it, I didn't know much about it, apart from it being hopefully a different kind of superhero movie.At first the movie feels refreshingly simpler compared to the epic superhero movies we keep getting. It felt like most of the idea came from how in those epic superhero movies the heroes cause a lot of damage to the city and its people. But as the story goes forward the story does become richer and, even if I hate the word, more epic.It's refreshing to see a character like Hancock. He is like an asshole, clearly an antihero (it's already refreshing not to see a brooding white man antihero, mind you), but there's more to him. And what's important we actually can see how he feels about the people kind of hating him, even if he tries to save them. It's not just superficially shrugged off. I also love how the music is used so well with the story. When the movie becomes more like a superhero movie the soundtrack feels more like a classic score for that type of movies. Hancock is an entertaining and a surprisingly good superhero movie. I think I would've preferred something simpler, something more refreshing, but Hancock is good for what it is. Of course it's a bit typical, but it has several new elements, and it has great cast. And while the story is not great, there are a lot of things I like about it. Hancock definitely is worth seeing whether or not you are tired with the typical Marvel or DC movies we get.",Hancock
155,leighabc123,This Movie Was Over-hyped!,2,4 July 2008,"Will Smith has played in so many movies better than this! He is a hateful all the time superhero who destroys things while he tries to help people. The only good part of the movie was when he got that bully girl looking boy ironically named Michelle with the Russian accent. He knocked that bully away. And when he came back, he cried like a little baby. Then Hancock threatened his buddies. I should have known in the beginning that Charlize's character was immortal! She held a grudge against Hancock at the beginning of the movie. And she was not the mother of Jason Bateman's character's young son. This was revealed later in the movie. Jason Bateman has really grown up as an actor. There were touchy moments in this movie that made it much worse. And the people who Hancock threw in jail tried to get revenge with no success. Overall, this was a horrible movie, but not the worst movie I have ever seen. I didn't pay to see it, but I want my $12 back!",Hancock
156,ldavis-2,"It's a Bird, it's a Plane, it's Lame-Brain!",2,23 June 2009,"It may interest those praising Hancock for having a black superhero that the original script, which is online, doesn't specify his race. He's just your garden-variety sleaze who drinks, smokes, swears, screws, and lusts after Mary, who doesn't have superpowers. The Ray character is a department store security guard named - are you ready? - Horus Longfellow! In short, the script was retooled-by-committee so that The Fresh Prince could play action hero! Goody-goody!Does anyone find it funny how a movie that suffers from massive bouts of homophobia would have a scene of its star lying on his stomach... on a cot... in a jail cell... with his backside straight up?As Spiderman can tell you, superheroes get paid squat. Even Batman, with all of his bazillions, has to work for a living. So, how does our hero earn his keep? Uh, now that I think about the scene with that ho in the trailer, forget I asked.Just how ridiculous is Hancock? Mary warns John that she'll kill him if Ray learns of her superpowers, then they have the obligatory downtown showdown, causing millions in damages. Makes sense to me, too.Ray is a successful yet properly guilt-ridden white liberal who treats Hancock like a 2 year old. Even how he thanks him for saving his life is despicably patronizing.John and Mary have been on-again/off-again since 4 B.C., but they're toxic to each other? Sounds like a typical relationship. That bit of info is followed by an idiotic monologue about how ""they made us in pairs"". Who were ""they""? How and why did ""they"" choose John and Mary? Being ""made in pairs"" means that John and Mary ""are"" identical. Did ""they"" give John and Mary the ability to morph into different races and ethnicities or was that something that they developed? What happened to our lovebirds between 4 B.C. and 1850? More importantly, why do I care?When John didn't tear into Ray and the other retards for ignoring the railroad crossing signals, the film lost me. John should have let the train ""teach"" them all a lesson. I know I would have!",Hancock
157,rparham,Superhero movie with an identity complex,6,6 July 2008,"In the modern era of comic book/superhero adaptation movies, Hancock is an attempt to create an original character and also imbue him with all too human frailties. The resulting film, directed by Peter Berg and starring Will Smith, is entertaining and involving, at times, for it's first two thirds, but fails to wrap things up satisfactorily at the end.As the film opens, we are introduced to Hancock (Will Smith), a man with superpowers, including the ability to fly, invulnerability and super strength. Hancock also has some significant character flaws: he is an alcoholic, appears unkempt and is generally uninterested in putting on a pleasant front for the public, offending almost everyone he comes in contact with. He also has developed a bit of a problem on the legal front, as most of heroic escapades end up with an associated property damage cost, which has resulted in multiple lawsuits, and the L.A. DA wants him behind bars.After saving the life of Ray Embry (Jason Bateman), a public relations professional, from a train accident (in which Hancock manages to derail the train and upset the commuters around him) Embry takes Hancock under his wing and makes him a personal project, with the aim of rehabilitating Hancock's tarnished public image. He invites him to his home to meet his family, including wife Mary (Charlize Theron), who gives Hancock some suspicious looks . . .At the outset, Hancock is an interesting take on the superhero tale, set perhaps in the most real world yet for a film of it's type. Here, as Hancock flies about doing good deeds, he manages to crash into things, tear up buildings, destroy yachts, and, frankly, people don't seem too happy. It is a sad comment on modern society that it is very probable that if a super-hero did exist, this is how he would be greeted by the masses.The script, credited by Vincent Ngo and Vince Gilligan, features a number of funny segments in the early scenes as Hancock interacts with the public and gives them his devil may care attitude. Hancock is a tortured character, saddled with super-powers and an innate desire to do good, but he also cannot cope with the loneliness of his existence, and so has turned to liquor to try to survive. Will Smith does an exceptional job bringing Hancock to life, making him somewhat likable, simply by being Will Smith, but also not being afraid to show Hancock as the jackass he is at times.However, at the three quarters mark, Hancock suddenly transforms into an almost completely different film and runs off the rails. It moves into a more ""serious"" vein and introduces some borderline metaphysical elements, while also delving into Hancock's origin. But, frankly, this material fails to grab you. Hancock was much more interesting when trying to fight through his rehabilitation, driven by Ray, than the left-turn the plot takes the film in towards the end. Hancock seems to want to drive home a powerful, emotional climax, but it manages to do the opposite, robbing the film of it's strength.Smith, as mentioned before, is the anchor of the film and proves once again what an exceptional actor he is. Hancock largely works because of him, giving Hancock a injured soul, but one that still has good at it's center. Jason Bateman is amusing in the role of Ray, but his family story with Mary isn't anything tremendously special or unique, and Theron doesn't turn in a bad performance, but isn't really given a lot to work with either.If Hancock had stayed the course of it's original ideas, it may have been a strong contender for a great summer movie, but it's abrupt change of focus brings the film to a less than satisfying conclusion, which is a shame.",Hancock

Hancock is the new kid on the block. Unkempt, drunk and lost, but with immense powers, invulnerability, immortality and a good heart characterize the protagonist here.Not being the typical superhero, John Hancok saves lives, but unintentionally creates civic losses running into millions which leads to disdain for him among locals and the authorities. Just when he is busy doing his usual stuff, he saves a struggling PR agent from a sure death. The latter then offers his services to Hancock to make him acceptable to the society, much to the displeasure of his wife. Hancock too reluctantly accepts.Hancock then learns his ways from Ray, the PR guy and works towards making himself acceptable to the society. But things take a strange turn when he starts to feel long lost things about Ray’s wife Mary who then reveals that they were angels created in pairs and that they lose powers and be mortal if they got close. She begs him to leave her so that he can do the world good. Oh well, they had to show some vulnerability, right? Hancock is a very short a film at 80 minutes, which makes you feel as if you flew through it. You barely realize that the story is going somewhere, and lo, you have an interval break. The rest of the movie finishes in a flash. I really don’t call this piece of work as ‘tight screenplay’ as some may do. On the tech stuff, though it had its share of action sequences, the camera work and the SFX don’t seem too convincing.With Will Smith, this year’s earning actor according to Forbes can surely bring in the draw at the box office. Surely, he has the charm in him that makes you feel for a character who is so clumsy for a large part of the film and usually messes up stuff. Charlize Theron, well, at first I wondered ‘what’s she doing in here?’ till the time it is revealed that she too is Hancock type. Phew; the story gets tiresome after that! The villains too weren’t really imposing enough to really challenge someone who is shown a superhero. The editing feels as if someone wanted to hurriedly wrap up. The script begins with a promise but makes you feel that there was a lot of room for improvement. Despite it having brilliant leads in Will Smith and older but is still lovely Theron, it falls flat. Surely, I wouldn’t recommend that you burn your bucks on this!",Hancock

The man knows how to do action. He proved this dramatically with the deliriously OTT The Rundown, which was lots of fun. He channels Michael Bay here, with the signature saturated look and big explosions and appetite for destruction.Will Smith is as good as ever, and Jason Bateman is good as a straight man, though I've seen him in funnier roles. Charlize Theron is great too.The action scenes are great. The opening freeway scene, the bank scene, the city fight scene, and the hospital fight were all great and very well done. The prison scene is great too, and funny. The violence here is surprisingly brutal and graphic for a PG-13 superhero film, and apparently it had to be cut a few times to obtain a PG-13.It's a pretty entertaining movie, especially since it's an original superhero flick and not a comic book or video game adaptation.

163,jemps918,"Short, good fun!",8,7 July 2008,"Unique enough in its storyline albeit a little too obvious in its exposition, it's easy to see why Hancock would be something Will Smith would do. After all, he has admitted to his box-office formula of choosing movies with killer special effects to make him a star. He disturbed this pattern by doing The Pursuit of Happiness, but his trailblazing ways is apparent once more in choosing to be Hancock, the anti-hero.Yes, Smith plays the lonely superhero John Hancock, who acts out his depression by being an alcoholic bum. He saves ever-the-optimist PR man Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman), who insists on repaying Hancock by reinventing his image. This means hanging out with Hancock quite a lot, much to the chagrin of Ray's uptight wife, Mary (Charlize Theron) but to the wild delight of their son Aaron (Jae Head).What is surprisingly great about this movie is the acting. Of course Smith effortlessly provides the believable action/comedy necessary, but Theron did fantastic work for a role that could have easily been so shallow, or worse, bad. A formidable figure indeed! Also worth noting is Head, who was charming; thankfully not of the annoyingly perky child star variety.Hancock may be easily guessable, but while it's tame enough to give it a PG-13 rating, it has enough wow factors keep true action aficionados in their seats. Now that's smartly distributing one's eggs in several baskets.",Hancock

Hancock though, doesn't seem to care about the publics opinion about him. After saving Ray, a public relations executive from being run over by a train.

I do like Will Smith, and went to see Hancock figuring Smith would have some spin to add to the genre to make it worthwhile. I was right. This is a very risky venture for Smith and Peter Berg. Basically the ideas and realizations of 'SUPERHERO' are dissected and studied, while at the same time the movie is entertaining us with cinematic skill.Smith is dead-on with his uncaring and probably self-pitying super guy, who is also not particularly skilled at his role and is often drunk. It sort of examines the question (one I've always related to Superman) of if you can't feel anything bad then you also can't feel anything good, right? Where is the pleasure? Hancock also examines a host of other superhero issues, such as how can a superhero shave? It makes sense that when one of these last remaining super-folks (Charlize Theron is the other) get together, their powers wane. How else could they enjoy each other, love each other? Of course, this is where they are vulnerable and also where this super-comedy becomes a super-tragedy.There is so much beneath the surface of this picture that it is not really a big superhero extravaganza at heart, but it capably entertains on that level.

Then comes executive Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman), whose life is saved by Hancock, and he vows to help Hancock turn into a reputable person of society. His wife, Mary (Charlize Theron) seems to have a connection with Hancock as well.As Hancock turns a new leaf and becomes a superhero people can count on, a shocking revelation sends Hancock's life into a tailspin as he learns who he truly was, and is, and his connections with people that seem random but really aren't.This wasn't the best superhero movie to date, but it wasn't the worst. The storyline was compelling although not enough time was given to fully maximize the potential of it. Will Smith, as always, did a fantastic job, but the whole film seemed choppy and out of focus with the overall theme. Nonetheless, it was still a decent action flick.",Hancock

For the first 45 minutes or so it works, but then there is the surprise twist which didn't quite do it for me. On top of this there is no real strong villain to complement the hero. THe acting was pretty good, but otherwise this movie is just a little better than average.Hancock (Will SMith) is a drunken superhero who is the total anti-thesis of your typical hero. He swears, insults people, and uses his powers in a destructive manner, but you can see that deep down he wants to help people and doesn't know the exact way to make himself look better in the eyes of the people. Enter Ray (Justin Bateman) as a PR guy who wants to change Hancock's image for the better. On top of this we have Ray's wife Mary (Charlize THeron) who we can tell by the way she acts around Hancock that they have some type of history together that Hancock is not sure of. I 'll go no farther into the plot, but I will say that with Ray's help, Hancock does change his image for the better, and near the end of the film starts becoming mortal for reasons I can not tell without spoiling the movie.The acting is rather well done, but the special effects do not look as if 150 million was spent. I can accept cheesy special effects if the story works, but with Hancock the story never takes off because he has no real strong villain to face off against. The ending is rather weak, but the acting is well enough to carry it somewhat though not enough for me to recommend it.",Hancock
169,JaydoDre,Weird...good weird or bad weird? Up to you,6,24 September 2008,"Either the directors or the script writers must've been high when they were creating this one. I wish to be able to fill the ten lines that are required for submitting a review, but after that first line, anything else seems to be redundant.Throughout the movie one has to mentally ask himself ""what?"" several times. Perhaps if you put the story on paper it wouldn't read too bad, but the execution thereof seems to be a little trickier. A question arises whether some scenes and lines were really necessary. Surely there's something more useful to be said and shown at that time. The plot is not complicated but nonetheless twisted, and at every turn the inertia wants you to go one way, but the movie has already decided to go the other. Because of all the turns even the acting of the high rollers comes under strain.Perhaps it would have been wise to split the movie in two and make two separate parts, with the first one only concentrating on Hancock's journey from a bum to a superhero. It would've been a good movie and much easier to stomach.In any case, what no one can take away from Hancock is that it's a fresh drink of water in the long line of cliché superhero formulas. It's hard to predict what happens next. And with that freshness you still get a good amount of laughs and special effects.",Hancock
170,helmutty,Hancock!,7,3 July 2008,"Will Smith is a famous actor. He acted in the recent movie, I am Legend and his movies usually make a lot of money. His new movie, Hancock, is good fun although there are some disappointment. I have seen Peter berg's The kingdom which is intense with big gun shootout in the end. I must say that Hancock almost has the same style of The Kingdom- the unsteadiness of the camera, things that explode and some more. The fight scenes and the villains should be better, it is not what I expected but because of the story.The story: Will Smith plays Hancock, a destructive superhero who does not care about destroying people's things like cars, train and buildings. People hate him. He saves a guy, Ray, who considerably asks Hancock to do what he is supposed to. Hancock spends his time in jail, trying to turn a new leaf. Soon, when crimes rates are rising, Hancock saves the world. Just the usual superhero story but Hancock is a superhero that is destructive and says anything he want to say. Unlike other superheroes who are usually good and well-mannered, Hancock does anything he like- not taking things into consideration. I would not really call this an usual superheroes movies, it would be more of an action drama with people with powers added.Overall: Is it good? Well,I would say that it is okay. I thought it could have done more better. With the runtime, it is okay as it is made that it would not be boring. There are twists on the way to the end. Other than that, it got the humour and Will Smith is good. If you are a fan of Will Smith, you should probably catch this out. If you like superheroes movies, this one should fit you but don't expect too much. It would be good to watch this in cinema, you get to see some thrilling action rushing into your way.",Hancock
171,mr_popcorn,"McCheesy's take on ""Hancock""",6,5 July 2008,"I just saw it. I can't say I was impressed but it is something. Did you know that this is the first summer blockbuster superhero movie that didn't originate from the comic books? Well, now you know.Will Smith, the bringer of the dollar dollar bills does it once again. He made yet another blockbuster of a film and he's been doing it since 1995 when Bad Boys came out. This time around he plays not-so-super hero Hancock, an alcoholic, gruff, lazy superhero who does more damage saving the world than the villains. It starts out fantastic, complete with the delish CG effects and crass, humorous jokes but then when we get to the second act of the film, it gets serious. To avoid massive spoilers, I will only say this: The minute Hancock gets thrown out a window and into a car, it all gets overly serious for a film of its genre. Think of Ang Lee's 'Hulk' but not that serious.They say the serious-ness didn't work but I say, it worked well and it served its purpose. It is necessary to the plot and it is a device used to show Hancock's past and his involvement with some other character (not Jason Bateman).The ending will make you cringe. Its not one of those typical superhero endings where the hero fights the villain and everything around them is imploding and exploding, this one took a right turn from the typical norm alley and I must say it worked for me. Who says you need big explosions for an ending huh? 'Hancock' is a serious superhero film. But not like 'Hulk'-serious. Put aside the jokes and the laughter and you'll see it. Its not big or epic for its kind and I can't say that I was impressed but as I said before, it is something.",Hancock
172,haterofcrap,Han-Crap,1,7 December 2010,"This movie was awful!The performance of Will Smith and the rest of the cats were beyond bad.But that wasn't the worst thing about this stupid and worthless movie, the worst thing about this stupid and ugly mess, it's that the plot is so boring, stupid and irritating, that I couldn't watch the whole thing. Also it was poorly filmed. The visuals were ugly and unoriginal.This movie was simply unwatchable...It is easily the worst superhero movie ever made. If you want to see one good superhero movie, see ""Watchmen"" or ""The Dark Knight"" which are much better this pathetic movie.""Hancock"" it's a complete waste of time, and it is one of the worst movies ever made.",Hancock
173,ivko,not bad but could use some polish,6,15 July 2008,"The idea of Hancock is a fun one. A superhero, disillusioned and lonely, takes to a life of boozing and petty squabbling with the natives (i.e. us), becoming less and less popular even as he saves lives. Will Smith is always a good choice for summer fare; he has a strong charisma and boyish charm that makes you want to like him. And I'm a fan of Jason Bateman and the ever gorgeous Charlize Theron. But unfortunately, even with all that star power 'Hancock' didn't completely jell for me.I really enjoyed the first half of the movie, but it started to fall apart for me during the second half. Without giving anything away, a bit of a love triangle forms in the middle of the movie. It is eventually resolved - sort of - but for me summer movies usually mean larger than life heroes and clearly delineated good guys and bad guys. Uncomfortable moral quandaries just serve to distract me from the fun. Add to that the lack of any really good villains - most of the bad guys are merely buffoonish - and I was left feeling that I could have enjoyed the movie a lot more with some slight script changes.Finally, after a climactic revelation in the middle of the film, the movie felt a little lacking in direction. No big ""saving the world"" moments, just a kind of ""eh"" feeling. Still, all in all I didn't feel ripped off afterwords, so I sort-of recommend 'Hancock' for a decent if unspectacular Friday or Saturday night movie.",Hancock
174,moutonbear25,Hancock Signs Off,6,1 July 2008,"It isn't fair to write a film off in the first few minutes but you can sometimes get a pretty good sense as to what you're in store for from the way the film introduces itself. The film opens on an L.A. freeway, where four punks are being chased in their van by countless police cruisers while they fire their semi-automatic weapons into the air. Where's Spider-Man when you need him? (Right, I forgot  Spidey's a New Yorker.) Cut to a passed out bum on a park bench. Who is this man? Of course, we know it's our hero, Hancock (Will Smith), because we know a thing or two about the film before sitting down to watch it. Director, Peter Berg, takes this for granted though and it soon becomes apparent that convention and presumption will drive this unconventional tale. In HANCOCK, Berg, and Smith team up with writers, Vincent Ngo and Vince Gilligan, to debunk superhero iconography as well as the genre itself. The goal, and a noble and exciting one it is, is to rip the superhero out of the sky, strip him of his glory and send him hurdling toward the earth. Only Hancock is pulled down to an earth that is an awful lot more like a movie than the world I know.It wouldn't be so terrible to set this enormous Hollywood action film in typical scenarios if Berg weren't trying so hard to give the film a decidedly un-Hollywood look. The aesthetic is often shaky and unstill, crossing back and forth between odd close-ups and frames finding their focus. Berg seems bent on giving HANCOCK a gritty, guerilla film-making tone but the erratic style is at odds with the predictability of the plot. The borrowed independent style works in its original context because independent films are, ordinarily, about something deeper. Removing the gloss from a Hollywood feature only allows the viewer to see how little there is underneath it all. In HANCOCK's case, the man beneath the lacking luster is a reluctant hero who would rather waste his days drunk in a dive than diving into the action itself to save the day. There is some loose discourse on realizing your destiny but little else. Again reluctantly, Hancock agrees to some help from a struggling public relations person (Jason Bateman) and is set on the path to making the most of his life and abilities. Hancock is such a complex character (lonely, disinterested, depressed) that it would seem ripe with possibility but this is mostly squandered in favor of half funny humour and sometimes hokey special effects that it feels at times like a over produced Nike ad.Luckily for HANCOCK, the film is still somewhat enjoyable thanks to the strong performances of all its leads. Smith continues his streak for picking complicated characters with broad appeal and he also continues his streak of pulling them off. After a heartbreaking turn that pushed his dramatic abilities in THE PURSUIT OF Happiness and his commanding yet vulnerable turn that pushed his presence in I AM LEGEND, Smith plays a character we don't ordinarily see him as. His impossible-not-to-like face is covered in stubble and his physique is hidden by baggy, dirty clothes but his eyes are what give away his disenfranchised soul that shows his hurt for being shunned by society and disinterest in placating to that same society. Smith is joined by the modern master of comedic timing, Bateman and Charlize Theron, as Bateman's wife, who is simultaneously frightened and intimidating. This trio of talent is HANCOCK's salvation. Their grasp of their characters in unfailing and they pull the elements of the film together despite how flimsy the elements are to begin with.HANCOCK is occasionally astounding but mostly mundane. Above all, it is a disappointment. This original premise has been sloppily slapped together and most of its potential was squandered in the process. It didn't show me that superheroes are people too. If anything, it just made me miss the real deal. If the goal was to truly bring the superhero down to earth, then there was still a long, long way to go before this guy would have touched the ground.",Hancock

Wait, they tried that with WALL-E and that movie pretty much failed as well. Hancock is yet another movie in, what I fear, will be a longer and longer line of disappointments. Smith is okay, not one of our greatest actors, but for the most part entertaining in most of what he does. I read that the part was first offered to Chappelle, which probably would not have made this movie any worse, or maybe better, since no one expects much out of him. Audiences do expect more from Smith and when he fails, as they all do, we seem to be more harsh, myself included. Theron, an award winner no less, well, I wonder what she was thinking when she considered this role. What we have is a down-and-out super hero who no one likes since whenever he saves someone he seems to cause more damage than if he did not. He's a depressed and lonely guy, but we only know this because another character tells us so. Otherwise, the audience figures he's just a drunk, but does not know why. In the first scene with Smith and Theron we all figure out that something is going on, and know that she probably has the same powers he does. The scene where they kiss then she slams him out of the house with a fridge made no sense. Of course we do not find out the why to all of this GO AWAY! from Mary until the end of the movie, so you have to sit around until then, or do what a lot of people do lately, and fast forward. But what really ruined this movie, other than a bad script, robotic-like performances with monotone dialogue, and over-done F/X, was the jittery camera work. Talk about needing some Dramamine before watching.",Hancock

It was a good attempt with the story but what started out as promising at the start run out of sugar later on as the story got too far fetched and i just found my enthusiasm for the film ebbing away as later on another storyline emerged of a past romance with his ability as a superhero, the film found it difficult nearer the end to find a balance between the two Will Smith put in a decent performance as he does in most films and he made the audience where I was watching this film laugh in places with some decent action, but even he couldn't save this bore of a film.

Enter Hancock, a breath of fresh cinematic air and the cure for my CGI character blues. I need not rehash in detail all the spot on positive comments. Suffice to say that Smith is awesome in a multi dimensional role, a very 'human' role given his very special sort of humanity. Humor abounds, chemistry is good to great and originality sparkles. ""Do I smell alcohol on your breath?"" a woman asks Hancock. Then and there you know just how original a super hero film this is. It is no more difficult to suspend one's belief system with this story and its conclusion then it is with most highly rated sci-fi/horror films like Underworld. The patch quilt of cinematic elements including drama, pathos, humor, humanity, relationships and frailties work in almost every instance. What a fun, Summer cinematic ride.",Hancock
179,kevin_crighton,"Okay, but a mixed bag.",6,24 July 2008,"John Hancock is not your normal superhero. He's a drunk, hated by everyone for the damage he causes and is being sued. However, when he rescues PR man Ray Embrey, Embrey takes it upon himself to make Hancock popular with the population, despite resistance from Hancock himself, and Ray's wife Mary...Hancock has an interesting idea but the problem with it, is it can't sustain the entire movie. Partly this is also due to the fact that the part of heroes being unpopular with the people, and being sued for the damage, was better used in the Pixar movie, The Incredibles. So the idea doesn't quite carry the movie. As a result, a second plot thread is introduced. I won't reveal it here, but when it happens, you get the feeling the filmmakers needed something to keep the movie moving, but it's too contrived and doesn't really work, and is also never really resolved.Hancock's other main fault is that the so-called villains of the movie, aren't really that threatening. So any dramatic edge is lost in the climax of the movie. What also doesn't help is that it can't decide on what it is. The first half of the movie is pretty funny. The second half more dramatic. It's like they changed their minds about what kind of movie they were making halfway through.But it's not a total loss. Thanks to excellent performances from Will Smith, Jason Bateman and Charlize Theron and helped by an okay script from Vince Gillian and Vincent Ngo it is funny (especially in the first half of the movie). And director Peter Berg does well with the material.The visuals are pretty good, if not spectacular, and the movie runs at a good pace. I just wish they could have decided which way to take it.Is it a comedy? A summer action movie? Superhero spoof? By trying to be all things, it ends up being a bit confused, and it suffers as a result.",Hancock
180,The_Orenda,The second half ruins everything.,3,5 July 2008,"The first half of Hancock was better than what I could have expected. Hancock is a homeless superhero with no respect whatsoever. The opening act has him stop an armed chase with a price tag of $7 million dollars in property damage. He destroys pavement wherever he lands. Everyone, from kids to criminals, call him an a-hole. Then the film gets surprisingly better. He saves the life of Ray, someone skilled but flawed at public relations and convinces Hancock to improve his image, by answering the demands of the public to answer for all his crimes, apologize and turn himself in. From this point, it all goes downhill from here, and it's the second half twist and ending that stinks up the whole movie, to the point where you don't care about how good the first half was anymore. How could they have screwed up such a good premise? Hancock's origin and weakness, though I will not spoil, are the mother of all cop-outs.It's not as if Hancock shows any Achilles heel in Will Smith or Charlize Theron's acting abilities. The second half of the film is that bad if an Academy Award winning actress who worked with Will before cannot pull it through. Throw in a pathetic stinker of a villain, a story of love and tortured relationships and Hancock is crushed by the weight of too many generic superhero clichés.",Hancock
181,BrickNash,"Good, solid and funny film but tries to be too many things at once.",8,7 April 2013,"Hancock is an interesting film, this much has to be said.The concept of taking a Superman style hero, powers and all and making him a low life, bungling alcoholic has to be one of the most original ever to cross a studio executive's desk.The film scores well on so many points but you just feel that something was missed.Hancock drifts between superhero movie, comedy and drama and thus spreads itself a little too thin to be good at any. The comedy is stunted by the all too serious tones and the lack of any real villain is a major downside because what it gets right and what we are treated to most of is the superhero side and no baddie equals why bother?Bad points aside though this is a good film. The special effects are top notch and we are treated to some great flying effects and fight scenes. The humour is snappy and spot on with some great delivery by Smith although it is just a bit too sparce and I feel more could have been put in to the script without the danger of it becoming comedy farce.I can see what the director is trying to do with the drama and it works with the subject matter but to tackle such deep psychological subjects of a superhero you really need something epic and fleshed out and as stated before, it's too much of a lot of things at once and never gets to a climax with any of them.A special mention has to go to the soundtrack. The selection of moody down and out blues mixed with some well placed funk and rap songs at appropriate moments really lifts the character and emphasises the fact that this is a much needed black superhero in a world of lilly white comic book crimefighters.Hancock is worth checking out, indeed if like me you are a fan of such superheros (Personally I like any film where someone has the ability to fly) but the film does seem to blow it's load in the first half an hour and descends into more grim territory later on.It would certainly be worthy of a more fleshed out sequel because when an idea is this good it would be a shame to let it die!",Hancock
182,joestank15,This film gave me a headache.,4,6 January 2009,"Hancock - The streets of New York are simultaneously protected and suffer the excessive collateral damage done by Hancock (Will Smith), a none too nice and largely ineffective superhero. He saves the life of a similarly ineffective (though is not presented as so) personal relations agent named Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman) who is so grateful that he dedicates his career to improving Hancock's image, despite the lack of any real fiscal benefits from doing so. But Embrey is one of those humanitarian P.R. reps you read so much about, whose pitch to the corporations always seems to involve them giving away their products for free. They unsurprisingly decide to do otherwise.The first thirty minutes or so of the film are decent enough. It's mildly amusing to watch a superhero that genuinely doesn't seem to give a crap about anything. Hancock causes a tremendous amount of collateral damage. But if he ultimately doesn't care about people, then why try and help at all? Hancock is supposed to be an ""asshole"", but comes off as just morose. Smith's been playing that a lot lately and judging by the box office receipts, it's what people want. The film could explore why Hancock feels he owes anything at all to these people. It does not. Note to filmmakers: Never make a superhero without motivation.It's when Hancock voluntarily goes to jail that the film slants into place getting ready for a tremendous nose dive. It becomes boring (superhero sits around in jail = fun movie?) and changes from a comedy to a drama, a critical mistake partly because the writing of the second half is seriously lackluster. The other reason is the special effects are just not good enough for a dramatic film. They come off as cartoonish. Things disintegrate on impact far too easily like there was nothing holding them together in the first place. If Hancock has the mass and strength to stop a train without any recoil and makes craters on landings (inconsistently for comic purposes I suppose), then shouldn't the mere act of walking or running around cause mild earthquakes? I mentioned the second half of the film. It absolutely sucks. I was having a migraine trying to figure out what was going on with Charlize Theron's character, and her's and Hancock's back story in general. The whole thing doesn't make a lick of sense. There's just a series of fights for absolutely no reason other that to satisfy action junkies. This is the first and hopefully last time I ever see Jason Bateman take part in an action sequence. Hancock really felt rushed, I assume because the call of the July 4th box office. Money beats art any day of the week. The producers of Hancock know this, and Bateman's character should have known it too.Boring and rushed in appearance and execution, Hancock gets a D+",Hancock
183,vip-danii,Why Did They Have To Ruin Such a Good Idea?,9,23 March 2013,"A very original idea, but... the execution somewhat ruined it.The first part of the movie is actually very good, but it declines steadily as soon as ""the twist"" is introduced. Towards the end, it gets so boring, unconvincing and lame -- it becomes genuinely intolerable and impossible to sit through.I did not like the ""twist""; it was cheesy at best. Really unnecessary; ruined the whole movie. Charlize Theron is SO not convincing as a superwoman. Laughably pathetic. She's normally a half-decent actress, but this time her performance is so awfully bad, it's embarrassing.It's kind of ""cute"" (and actually convincing) that Hancock hates the terms ""a**hole"", but when superwoman starts imitating this, you just cover your face and think: ""Oh, puh-lease!"" It's just too annoying.The movie was also lacking a good antagonist. Was that bank robber supposed to make up for that? If so, it really didn't work.The character of that supposed PR *guru* (Ray) is not at all believable. Throughout the whole movie, he is portrayed more like an amateur -- busting his butt to make it in PR, but getting rejected over and over again... until Hancock comes along.Will Smith, as usual, plays the same character (himself). He does so in EVERY movie, so the public is somewhat used to it, I suppose. They should quit giving him character names, and just let him be Will Smith as Will Smith -- that'll be more convincing and less irritating. It is his charisma that carries him through, not his acting abilities anyway.If you compare will Smith to, say, Cate Blanchett, you will realize that Will Smith is NOT an actual actor. He is comfortable in front of the camera, and he has some charisma, but he can't portray anyone else but Will Smith.I would watch the movie again; it's kind of entertaining -- until Mary reveals her superhuman powers. That's when it becomes lame and unwatchable.It's a shame, though... they could've made the movie a whole lot better by not shoving all that LAME superwoman crap in it.",Hancock

I enjoyed it for what it was which is a fun, mostly fast-paced popcorn flick. The writers of the film also tossed in a nice plot twist that I didn't see coming but it turned out to work just fine. This isn't Shakespeare so I don't demand a lot of deep thought just some escapist fun. Will Smith does an excellent job of playing the disinterested superhero with an existential crisis. It was good to see Jason Bateman again but a bummer as well seeing how he has aged. This means I am not so young myself anymore. Jae Head didn't overact nor did the script writers push the ""cute"" button to the point of being saccharine. It will be interesting to see how this movie performs to see if Smith wants to do a sequel.

With mega strength at his disposal, he can do pretty much what he wants. Will Smith once again is great. He done many summer blockbusters before and his performance and the overall film keeps up the tradition of raking in a lot of cash. The film itself is entertaining. Towards the end , it hard not to become disinterested.With all the Marvel and graphic novels adaptations being shot for the big screen, it was a breath air to be treated to a light hearted superhero flick. The first half contains laughs and you're never quite sure what Hancock's is going to do next to upset the community.But, when we reach the scene when we discover there more than one person who are gifted with unbelievable strength, it becomes tiresome. The whole love story and the tale of Hancock's past seems lazy and tricks you to believing you've somehow inserted a second disk.If i ever watch Hancock again, i will do so but only the first half. I saw myself avoiding the screen in an attempt to block out the awful love story.

187,cosmorados,"Seen it twice, What's the critics problem?",8,31 July 2008,"John Hancock, is a man with superhuman powers, strong, invulnerable, flight, he has the usual bad boy powers. However, unlike other superhero's he really is a bad boy, not caring what he does, who he hurts as long as he gets the job done and winds up threatening more lives than he saves. That is until he saves loser PR man Ray Embrey, who realises that within Hancock, their really is a hero trying to get out. After taking him home to meet his family, he realises that he may be able to help him and turn Hancock into the hero he always could be. After doing exactly what no-one expects to do which is care about his previous actions, he then takes to becoming a true hero, acting against all he instincts he starts to turn into someone that people like and want to be, until his past, quite literally, sends him reeling.This is an Akiva Goldsman production and usually his name on a film is like having Cyanide as an ingredient on a drinks bottle, but, like Hancock himself, he acts against type here but letting someone else pen the work, and as such creates a film that is far better than it could have been. This is a film with some genuine surprising moments and a pretty decent script. When I was watching at first I hated Will Smith's Hancock and thought he was a real *sshole, and was not looking forward to watching his adventure, but this is what we're supposed to feel, Will's performance is spot on and he performs so well against his usual likable persona that it's a real compliment to his skills that he pulls this off so well. Jason Bateman and Charlize Theron are equally great as the blissfully happy couple into whose lives Hancock crash lands.The script is far better than I thought it would be and while some elements are very Hollywood and clichéd (Especially near the end) this is still a very good film that is worth the price of admission and shows another side to both Will Smith's range and also Akiva Goldsman's skills. I can't say why the critics are having a go at this film as I have now seem it twice, not because I'm a big Will Smith fan, simply because it is a good movie. As I sat there the second time I was trying to think what set the film apart from other superhero studies, and, apart from the obvious that this does not come from a comic, the big thing is that, due to Will Smith's performance we get a glimpse of a hero who really feels, not bullets, or the impact of the train but feels for people around him and the makers really focus on this, this is not a film about a Superhero but a film about a super human.As you may have gathered by the rest of this review, the biggest surprise in this film is that while the trailer does feature many of the films interesting moments, there is so much to this film than what we see in the trailer. In fact in terms of the tone of the film it is very different to what we see in the trailer. I could say a lot more but to do so would spoil some of the surprises that you may not know about, and unlike some reviewers I'm not gonna do that.I think for most reviewers the big problem is that it's not Batman, the film they've already decided if the best cause Heath Ledger's dead.

'Hancock' is a crime against art, the human spirit, intelligence, and decency, to name just a few. There is no amusement whatsoever to be gained for anyone from watching this film. The tragedy is compounded in that 2 A-list stars and a cult-comedy icon somehow were compelled to do this film.This is a loud, boring and insipid film that does not know whether it intends to be a comedy, action movie, or action comedy. This is not to say that it is actually funny in any places; it is not, but one can discern that comedy was intended in various places. The script, if it can be called such, plays out as though an 8-year old recycled the worst works of dead scifi writer L. Ron Hubbard after being overdosed on Children's Tylenol. There is no plausibility, and no internal consistency in this fictional world, and there are creepy, gross ideas, suggestive of incest.Perhaps the most odious and disgusting thing about 'Hancock' is its overt racism. Here we have an impossibly strong, invulnerable, flying black man, the most powerful man in the world, who wastes his time drinking on the street and behaving like an idiot, until a white liberal takes an interest in him, shows him how to act polite and dress nice. Guess what: the white liberal's 1st step in showing Our Hero the path or righteousness is to send Our Hero to do a stretch in jail. And better yet: this black superhero happens to loose his powers (temporarily) if he kisses a certain white woman.Here is an example of the kind of gross, cheap, juvenile, racist trash being peddled: Our Hero, being miffed at a couple of the other inmates in the jail, literally shoves one man's head up another man's butt. Yes, this actually happens in the movie, the audience is treated to the sight of one man's head clear up another man's butt. All the while, the theme music from 'Sanford and Son' plays, just to make it perfectly clear that we should be laughing at this funny stuff being done by this whacky black person.Some people might be tempted to see this film because there are few other films about black superheroes, but every other film about black superheroes is much, much better. The 'Blade' films, for instance. Better yet, see the new film with Morgan Freeman playing real-life black superhero Nelson Mandela, that one is very highly recommended.",Hancock
189,Craig_McPherson,A fun ride,8,1 July 2008,"Like death, taxes, and a summer blockbuster season featuring a Will Smith vehicle, some things in life are inevitable. It's 2008, and the year's high water mark for big-budget Hollywood releases, and Hancock is the Fresh Prince's film de jour. Before you start rolling your eyes, however, there's something you must know about this release. it's damn good! In fact, given the story behind the making of this movie, such praise is somewhat surprising.Originally penned by Vincent Ngo back in 1996, the screenplay passed through the hands of various directors, including Tony Scott and Michael Mann (Mann stayed on in the capacity of Producer), and went through a number of cuts to both conform to cinema ratings and tweak the story after test screenings, the latter rarely being a good omen. Which makes it all the more surprising that Hancock out-Supers Superman, out-X's X-Men, out-smarts the Hulk (no great achievement there).I could go on but you get the picture. Hancock is the superhero flick that summer popcorn movies aspire to. And, it does it with attitude and laughs to boot.Smith plays John Hancock, a drunken drifter who possesses many of the same powers as Superman. He can fly, bullets bounce off him, he has super strength, is faster than a speeding bullet, and, oh yeah, he's an asshole (but don't call him that). Basically he's what Superman would be if he was a booze swilling, hungover, homeless person who wouldn't think twice about ramming your head up your arse if you so much as looked at him cock-eyed.His crime fighting antics (when he's up to it) haven't endeared him to Los Angeles authorities either, seeing how he has a penchant for widespread property damage whenever he goes into action. All of which serves as a problem which needs to be fixed, and that's where PR wiz Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman) comes into play, offering to try and rehabilitate Hancock's public image after the hero rescues him from near death.Directed by Peter Berg (The Kingdom), the movie deftly mixes comedic and action moments in a refreshingly even blend, and its story is peppered with enough origin references to lay the groundwork for prequels and sequels, of which you can be sure there will be several. Basically they've created a fully-realized movie franchise without the luxury of a long line of comics or graphic novels to lay the groundwork.If there's one flaw to Hancock (the movie, not the character), it's that it lacks a credible super villain, someone who can really give him a run for his money. Sure it has the cookie-cutter bad guy, but he's really nothing more than a thug with a gun, and no real match for our hero. He's basically a moron's Lex Luthor, without any aces (or anything else) up his sleeve, and an action movie built around a virtually invincible superhero needs a foil of at least credible strength.Nonetheless, the acting, pacing, story and special effects all compensate for this weakness, making Hancock a fun ride. Just don't ever call him an asshole.",Hancock
190,The_Dead_See,I guess some people just can't take a switch in tone.,8,5 July 2008,"I've read a lot of the reviews here complaining about the film flagging in its final act. I respectfully disagree.Hancock is most definitely DIFFERENT in it's last half - it drops off the comedy significantly and introduces some fascinating superhero mythology that is almost like an ancient Greek myth in its context. It also introduces some pretty tense and violent moments that really made me wonder if they should be marketing it as the kid-friendly summer blockbuster that they are. However, both halves have their own merits - the first being the humour, and the second being the (almost tragic) origin mythos. I suspect if you are prepared for the switch in tone, rather than shocked when it arrives, you might enjoy Hancock as much as I did.",Hancock
191,haydenluz,Hancock,4,7 July 2020,"If we're being honest, Hancock didn't pack much weight at all. Will Smith is the reason why this film didn't completely flop.From the start, I caught the notion that everyone behind the camera just didn't really care all that much; They basically let Will Smith, be Will Smith, and just carry the film with his stature. The narrative on it's own was a big issue. It had such a choppy pace and flow, being super fast paced, with little - to - no setup.The script by Vincent Ngo & Vince Gilligan was pretty funny, but lacked wit, and powerful dialogue scenes. If this film was more of Will Smith cracking tongue and cheek jokes, and fighting bad guys, it probably would've been better, being a harmless action/comedy. Jason Bateman & Charlize Theron did their best to compliment Smith, but the character developments they tried to display during the second act, wasn't all that good, or necessary. Theron was just a plot device until the third act, with her character becoming short lived. I was fond of Jae Head's performance, for what little meaning he had. For his first motion picture, he does very well, and seems to be a favorable young actor on the rise.The effects and action sequences were done pretty amateurishly, feeling too cartoonish, and sloppy. The didn't really showcase anything new, or eye catching, being the film's biggest disappointment.",Hancock
192,liberalgems,An Annoying Story Written At The Level of A Ten-Year-Old!,2,10 July 2008,"I expected more from Will Smith. He's a Super Star with a lot of clout! He can pick and choose his projects. He brings in the bucks, which is all Hollywood cares about! Then he has the ability pass up junk, like Hancock! The only reason I did not give this film one-star is that the concept of ""redemption"" is a powerful one. I can even honestly say the first third of Hancock was somewhat entertaining, but it went downhill fast! For lack of a better word, the movie became just plain dull! And it's hard to imagine Will Smith in a boring film! There are so many glaring holes in the story it became distracting! A good story makes sense within the world the writer has created. When there is absolutely no explanation for major events taking place, an intelligent person will get annoyed! In a nutshell, that is the definition of sloppy storytelling! See what happens when Hollywood forces it's writers to go on strike! I bet someone exacted revenge by writing such an erratic and dopey story! Memo to Hollywood: It's not cool to chop-off both of a person's hands in a movie geared for children! Is that supposed to be funny? If you think so, then maybe you need the services of a psychiatrist! And when you do cut off a person's hand and wave it around, it relaxes, it does not remain inflexible.

194,tubby1,Original 'Superhero' poorly conceived.,5,22 September 2009,"'Hancock' begins as a decidedly refreshing take on the 'superhero'. Hancock played by Will Smith is an alcoholic fueled superhero who is lazy, rude and unsympathetic to the public and places at large. Unfortunately, this largely successful beginning is ruined by the annoying main thread of the story that overshadows the brief moments of substance.Hancock starts well and I immediately felt a sense of originality as we are introduced to the character. I liked the idea that Hancock does not hide his identity, that he does not live in a mansion or have close family ties, and is spoken to like an ordinary individual and lives a care-free existence. However, for all its promising beginnings it really does weave off course towards a very so-so finale.The score is implemented into scenes disastrously and is ear-achingly poor. For most parts of Hancock it feels that the plot and music are just not related. This is in large part, I have decided, due to the shaky and indecisive script.The most captivating moments were when Hancock was describing his predicament, his immortality and powers from a very human perspective. I thought we may get a consider and thoughtful piece of film. However, these moments of insight are brief and the feel of the film moves much more to a Disney like laden plot (annoyingly) and we have a mere scattering of substance. I could never distinguish which kind of film I was watching until the poorly advised 'twist'. The 'twist' which one could see from a distance makes a mockery of the potential ability Hancock had. It is saddening that the streaks of promise, which shine ever so lightly in this film is wasted by a bizarre and preposterous chain of events. If one felt the need to explain Hancock's predicament as a lonely 'superhero' on Earth make it more eloquent or thoughtful, or, even if it would frustrate many don't mention it at all.Hancock struggles to create a tone for the film and comes across as a piecemeal and shaky piece of cinema . At the end it becomes much more of a Disney fanfare than a film of style and substance.",Hancock
195,nahumthebest,Will Smith did his thing again; intelligent plot with a smart twist and good ending; good character development of the three main characters; GOOD movie overall,8,12 July 2020,"I liked this very emotional, sad, depressed, hopeless, antisocial, careless, unfriendly, lonely, closed off, and lost character Will Smith portrayed.Plot - I think it was written intelligently with the exception of a couple of special effects ""fight"" scenes. The plot has at its core a very smart and creative piece of writing which was also its greatest twist. The final portion of the film was also written well and the ending was a very pleasing ending.Cast:
Will Smith - I have watched 12 of his movies and I have never been disappointed in his performance. He delivered every single time. And he did really well in this movie too. He portrayed the lonely and lost character he was supposed to portray, and he did it well.Charlize Theron (female lead) - she did pretty good. No complaints from me.Jason Bateman (Marty Byrd from the Ozarks) - he did good; no complaint.My favorite line in this movie: ""call me crazy... one more time.""There were a couple of scenes I completely disliked in this movie despite the cool CGI: that scene where Jason Bateman's front of the house is destroyed at night and also the destruction of part of the city during a fight between the two characters. The writing for these two scenes was just so wrong. Such reckless destruction of property is illogical. Surely these two scenes cost the movie some points.Conclusion: this is a GOOD film. The plot and screenplay were written properly. There is good character development of the three main characters. However, the two biggest special effects scenes were not written intelligently. The plot has a pretty clever and unique twist, and the ending is as good as it could have been for the plot.8/10",Hancock
196,littlemartinarocena,Undercooked,5,7 July 2008,"A very good idea sadly undercooked. Rushed and thoughtless but with hints at what it might have been. All of that makes the experience a rather frustrating one. Will Smith is, without question, one of the best actors around and as Hancock, he uses every tiny opportunity to make the whole ludicrous thing almost palatable. When the camera is on him we feel the potential. There is a human being there in an impossible situation. Peter Berg, the director, lets his eye move around as if under the effect of a very powerful drug. Massive, nervous close ups in a story that tries to be missing the point at almost every corner. The actors are photographed harshly showing every skin imperfection even on the wonderful Charlize Theron. I wonder if that was on purpose. In fact that's what I wonder about the whole enterprise. Was it on purpose? Was the thoughtlessness part of the plan? If so, I don't get it.",Hancock
197,leoxatzian,A huge missed opportunity.,4,17 November 2019,"The initial premise had a lot of potential
for success and with the lovable and charismatic Will Smith in the leading role, it could have led to a truly unique and memorable superhero movie. Unfortunately, while the movie does initially seem to know what it's doing and even offers some solid laughs, it takes a nosedive in quality and completely shifts it's gears in a matter of seconds around the half way point. As a result, what could have been a much simpler but way more impactful story about a reckless hero trying to be a better person for both himself and others, turns into a needlessly convoluted mess that ultimately amounts to nothing.",Hancock
198,AirBourne_Bds,"FUI: Hancock - Flying Under The Influnce, OR; I wish I can recall why I love you?",8,5 August 2008,"Damn, this is a movie you have to watch many times to appreciate in full... At first go, Charlize Theron merely seems like a slut - until you discover her (very lengthy) history later on in the film.She is also literally the perfect woman for Hancock due to his strength and other powers, but rather than see him bashed for appearing like a black man looking for ""Jungle Fever,"" she tried to make a new life for herself hoping he could carry on...From humid Sumer in an age before Christ, to the Civil War, to the roaring 20's - he saves her as she is punished for literally having ""Brother""-ly love. She hopes when she walks away he will get the peace he's never known.In abandoning him she creates the modern-day beneficial monstrosity known as ""Hancock,"" he feels he is a misbegotten creature when no-one looks for him after recovering from the last attack 80 years ago. When Theron's character sees Will Smith (this from a perspective of a 2nd viewing) it is not lust - exactly - more, it is seeing the hero she knew devolved into an alcoholic meta-human and wondering, ""Why""?? There are some benefits to this version of the immortal invulnerable - when he advises Justin Bateman's son how to handle a bully or even deal with the French bully himself! Justin Bateman as the excellent yet underrated PR exec was a subtle ""fifth business"" whose role was key in saving Hancock at the end - but the classic was when he showed Will Smith a YouTube clip of a botched whale rescue and Will's character says he has no recollection, yet Bateman not missing a beat, says ""Greenpeace does""! Of course another highspot is when the convicts mistakenly thought Hancock either refused to use, or even lost, his powers while in jail... But I am trying to understand why they used the theme from ""Sanford & Son"" as the punchline for a threat he always made in the picture, but eventually made it real - although it seemed appropriate.Where I saw the plot have a thin spot is that - why did the inmates break out to SHOOT Hancock if they knew he's bullet-proof? The part when Hancock nearly returned to being an alcoholic featured a useful tip of emergency when the Sikh liquor-seller claimed 2 bottles of whiskey cost $91.10 - and then he used his finger to reveal the real clue...But even though he could not remember Theron, he knew there was a bond and his love for her was strong enough to make him let her go for both of their sakes - even though she is the only person capable of withstanding his perpetual horniness (he would kill a regular woman, think about it)! Can this movie do a prequel or sequel? I doubt, maybe a DVD could hold a Director's Cut and patch any plot gaps...",Hancock
199,robertallenandersonjr,A very good but different superhero movie,9,1 July 2008,"Hancock was a very funny movie with lots of action. The visuals in this movie were very cool. The special effects were very good as expected. I think they were better then in some other superhero movies. It was a very different superhero movie. Hancock was a very different, drunk, mean, smelly superhero. The twists in this movie were very good. They were kind of pretty obvious and others were unexpected. The direction of this movie was great. Will Smith was a good actor as he usually is. He had very good moments in this. He was definitely funnier than you would expect. The best thing about him was he didn't try to be funny he just was. This was probably the best action comedy movie made since Rush Hour. This movie has a very high budget for a very short movie. It was funny how all of the kids loved Hancock, but most parents all hated him. Charlize Therron was very pretty and had some good scenes. Will Smith and her and many funny, action, and dramatic scenes together. I think the movie remained pretty consistent all the way through. If anything it got a little better toward the end of the movie. I also thought the story was really good and didn't give anything away until the end. Just know going into this movie you have to be aware it is very far-fetched and very fake. So don't read the other reviews that say how fake and dumb this movie was. It was very fun and entertaining to watch. I would even go see it again maybe to catch anything I missed. Overall go see this movie it was very fun and surprisingly had a ton of heart.",Hancock
200,simonparker1990,Misunderstood or just Misguided?,6,3 July 2008,"Negative buzz has been surrounding Hancock for quite some time, yet not in my life it hasn't. Ever since I saw the first trailer for the movie I got excited about it, it looked genuinely funny, inventive and it starred Will Smith, a sure fire success then right? Will Smith is a great actor and I love nearly every movie he has ever been in, even I Am Legend had its great moments. Yet there is one Will Smith I cannot stand, that being Wild Wild West, which for the sake of space and time I won't even begin criticising. So does Hancock live up to his greats, or deserves to be dead and buried like Wild Wild West? Well it's a mixture of both to be honest. Obviously I didn't hate it, hence the 6/10 rating, but it was also dull and boring in some sections, only livened by Smith's electric presence. Let me start by saying the start of the movie is priceless, funny and witty as hell. Smith gives his funniest performance in years and the movie is brilliant. Unfortunately once we hit the jail scenes onwards the movie hits a snag, while it does have its dark humour streak but Will Smith's sharp tongue alone cannot gloss over the fact the movie is going absolutely nowhere at an incredibly slow pace. As the movie goes on it just descends into almost madness with loads of waffle about immortals and a twist so obvious that I rolled my eyes when it happened. Still the movie does have its share of action and the comedy is pretty inventive, yet its not the movie it really could have been and is certainly nowhere near Smith's best.So onto the acting. As I've previously said Will Smith is truly brilliant in the role, when we first meet him he's a drunken slob who is hated by everyone. He makes out he doesn't care that he's hated but deep down he really does, still these scenes give Smith the opportunity to come out with some classic lines. The best by far being his response to a fat person, I won't spoil it but it made me cry with laughter. Even as the plot gets more and more silly Smith still does a good performance. Admittedly he does become too nice a superhero towards the end, and you do wish his darker streak would return. Charlize Theron does a good job in a role that starts off unimportant but gradually shows importance later. By the end she delivers a pretty impressive performance, and she also seems to be having some fun. Still her opening scenes are pretty painful and bland to watch. Jason Bateman is pretty good for the first half of the movie, being funny and interesting at the same time. Unfortunately he pretty much becomes pointless near the end, in fact its his absence towards the end that really impacts on the movie. The focus on Hancock's relationship with him at the beginning if the best parts of the movie, take that away and it loses its sheen a bit. And then we go onto the lead villain duties, played by Eddie Marsan. To say the character is garbage is an understatement, I doubt I'd class him as a villain, he's more of an after thought that anything else. Its an average performance for a poor character.So do the successes of Hancock outweigh its mediocrity? Thankfully it just about does. The first third of the movie is a solid 9/10 movie, no question about it. The second third is a 3/10 movie, and the final third just about gets a 6/10, so on average the movie is a 6/10 movie. The script itself is pretty sharp for the most part, only losing its focus near the muddled conclusion. The directing is solid for the most part, although the constant usage of hand-held cameras does start to get annoying in your average talky bit, I just wanted to scream at the director to keep still! The action and special effects are extremely good, the final third takes pride in its big brawls and they do really thrill. The opening bits with Hancock flying are equally impressive. However its the odd indecision of whether the movie is serious or a comedy that really proves the movies down point. Its three movies in one, only one being the movie it really should have been. Still it is a bit of moderate summer fare, and I suspect kids and easily pleased adults will find much to enjoy with Hancock. Its also highly forgettable as well, a shame as with a sharper focus this could have been one of the best movies of the year.Overall Hancock is the big average movie of the summer, while funny and witty, the movie is also dull and sluggish. Will Smith just about rises this above mediocrity, but I'm afraid it's destined to be forgotten pretty quickly.",Hancock
201,Animus,Different but good,8,11 July 2008,"I went to see this with fresh eyes, although I read a lot of comic books in my youth I was always intrigued by the anti-heroes who were reluctant or at least abnormal in their reasons for doing the hero thing. Hancock definitely falls into this category. Hancock is a jerk, plain and simple, he's rude, a drunkard, and selfish, but at the same time he's driven to help people, even though they hate his methods. When we finally learn why he is the way he is, it gives us a fantastic insight into why he's been such insensitive jerk all this time. All in all it's a solid hero flick and worth my ticket money. I hope there will be a sequel at some point, although Hancock might also make a good TV spin off...",Hancock
202,MairegChernet,Doesn't live up to its hype.,6,17 July 2008,"Hancock is a story of a superhero named John Hancock who has a hard time coping with his life and misuses his calling, while he happens to be a superhero who flies and has super-strength, we see him annihilating half LA whenever he does something heroic. Although the idea seemed interesting, we see the writers trapped in their own simplistic story with no where to go. The first half of the film is no where near perfect but is fairly interesting with amazing special effects and funny one-liners. But as the so called plot twist happens, the story diverts into this crazy pile of confusion. In addition to that I had to suffer Peter Berg's wacky way of directing. I am talking about the close-up shots. One or two is okay. But when it is in every other scene and it is so that I can count how many zits are on the characters faces, that becomes unbearable and annoying. I would be telling a lie if I said that Hancock is a wonderful film, it is fairly interesting, though I was expecting better from Will Smith.6.4/10",Hancock

204,C-Younkin,Less than super,6,4 July 2008,"""Hancock"" is the summer's dark horse. Early trailers made it seem like a superhero spoof, then it looked like a dark comedy, then an action extravaganza. It's hard to tell what this movie is and the news of all the directors and studios who left the project, the fact that the subject matter has been called controversial and an extreme contrast to your usual summer movie experience, and that the MPAA has ""R-ed"" this movie twice before the studio finally went back and made major edits to get the PG-13 all come into question as this movie gets the coveted huge July 4 weekend audience all to itself. It's a major gamble, but having Will Smith in your movie is a good card to play.Smith stars as John Hancock, a boozing, vulgar, misunderstood superhero living a life of solitude in Los Angeles. He tries to do the right thing but usually every heroic save also creates some horrible damage that leaves him continually shunned by the public. Not that he cares. A life of being the only one of his kind has given him a tough demeanor and a thick skin, but then he saves the life of a PR man named Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman). Ray is eternally grateful and offers to take up Hancock as his client to the chagrin of Ray's wife (Charlize Theron), who believes Hancock can't be fixed.Every once in a while a movie comes along that I can only describe asnice. I wish it were better but I admired it for trying to do something new and felt there were some good scattered moments in a sadly unpleasing whole. The movie is at its most entertaining when Hancock is being an asshole, flying through the air with a whiskey bottle in hand, toying with a car full of criminals, or throwing a washed up whale back in the ocean or a little kid far into the air. It's funny stuff, as is a prison fight that ends with a guy's head up another guys ass.But the movie is really just a half-formed idea. Hancock's origin story is meager and forgettable and his vulnerabilities are lacking. There's no tension in anything that's happening because everything just seems like a cake walk to Hancock. He easily thwarts bank robberies and saves people in distress but that's really it. You want to see him go up against incredible odds or a super villain but the closest thing to is some one-dimensional thug bent on revenge. The screenplay, by Vincent Ngo and Vince Gilligan, seems so desperate to create real drama that it introduces a superhero wife for Hancock and then manufactures some lame excuse for why she is the worse thing for him. It all leads to an ending that turns depressingly talky, uninteresting, and just leaves a lot of loose ends.The special effects are serviceable. Hancock flies. Hancock throws people and things up in the air. He lands with a ground-breaking thud. Just where is the wow factor? This movie cost over $100 million dollars to make but there is nothing cool that stands out or shows any kind of ingenuity on the part of the filmmakers. I said it earlier but Will Smith is the best thing this movie has. He's a charismatic guy who knows how to make a surly, unlikable character seem like he has a soul under all the glum boozing. His performance reminded me of Robert Downey Jr.'s performance in ""Iron Man,"" though the material was 100 times better with Downey. Bateman isn't given much to do here and even though it's good to see Theron playing sexy again for a change, she spends most of the movie giving off an iciness which is pretty off-putting.There is going to be speculation that all the edits to bring the movie down to a PG-13 is the reason behind ""Hancock's"" flaws. It could very well be the reason why this movie feels more like an idea than an actual fleshed-out screenplay. It's tame when it should be super. And yet the movie sort of works when it's having fun with the character. So I was torn between recommending or not and all I can really say is.. it's nice.",Hancock
205,commandercool88,Surprisingly poignant and human.,7,7 July 2008,"After a terrible marketing campaign, which included less-than-stellar trailers and an awful viral website, I fully expected 'Hancock' to be this summer's colossal trainwreck. I generally like to think I can get a good read from a film before it's released, and the vibes I was getting from 'Hancock' were downright sour. Well, I was wrong. Very wrong. While it's not a great movie by any means, 'Hancock' is a surprisingly potent film with a great, original twist on the superhero brand.Audiences have been given no less than ten superhero blockbusters in only a few short years, each one following a strict playbook. Sometimes it works very well, but we've also had our fair share of stinkers. Perhaps it was only a matter of time before a film explores the other side, and that it may not be greener. Hancock is a loner, an alcoholic, very unpopular, and while he usually nabs the bad guys in the end, he leaves a trail of devastation in his wake. The only one of his kind he tells us, a superhero with a mysterious past.It's this original concept that makes 'Hancock' one of the more refreshing pieces of summer escapism. It's choppy, and at times rather heavy-handed, but it sure is fun and enjoyable. Will Smith takes a character who could have been a one-note bore and does a great job adding a real personal touch that adds a great deal of depth as he battles his inner self. He brings the comedy with him, and it's surprisingly effective. Even the great Jason Bateman finds himself in a great supporting role, and Charlize Theron has her moment to shine as Hancock's dark past is uncovered.'Hancock' takes on the hand-held camera technique, something that I thought would seriously weaken the film. But it actually adds an additional element of reality, a documentary-esquire approach that ends up working in its favor. Peter Berg's personal direction works for a film like this, and he does a decent job splicing 'Hancock' in two. One part comedy, one part action. It leaves a lot to be desired, but a twist that helps us understand Hancock's true nature helps transform this picture into something more poignant and human. I only wish this final cut was longer, allowing 'Hancock' to bring things to a more coherent close.Visually, 'Hancock' is a great achievement. Though there is no clearly defined villain, it could be argued that Hancock is his own worst enemy, the film boils over with an exciting and effects savvy climax that offers one of the better finales of the summer season. It seems to end once it begins to scratch the surface, but for what it is, 'Hancock' is a solid summer blockbuster with more on its mind than your average offering. The humor is there, the story is there, the characters are there, the heart is there, and though it's definitely flawed, 'Hancock' is not bad at all. In fact, it can all be seen as a strange but affectionate look at America's place in the world.More reviews: rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public",Hancock
206,moviemaniac008,I've seen it this summer and I'm shocked by the reviews,10,15 October 2008,"One day this summer (I think it was a week after this movie's release), I went with a friend to see Hancock, and both of us were thrilled. The action scenes, the actors (Will Smith is excellent, by the way) and of course, the humor (the ''Asshole'' gag that returns often always seemed funnier than the previous time we had heard it. But, the day after I saw this movie, I went on the internet (mostly on www.metacritic.com) and saw that reviews for Hancock were mostly mixed, with an average of 40 or 41 out of 100. I read most of the reviews, and then I flash-backed towards the movie. And I had to agree that even though Hancock is very good, it wasn't a perfect movie and, against my will, agree with the other people's criticism on the following points: Lack of story-At first we are introduced to Hancock, not your average superhero, and he does some pretty good stuff, but then even though the story does follow, the whole love affair that Mary (Charlize Theron) has with Hancock doesn't fit in. And that's just one of the unnecessary items.Shaky camera-God, I hate cameras in movies (Think Bourne Ultimatum) where the camera seems to shake all the time. In Hancock, the camera does shake a bit (it is less hyperactive than in Bourne 3) and it does distract the audience.Villain- Who is the villain? There seems to be none except for maybe the Korean men at the beginning, and those crooks who don't have really anything to do with the story. Or Mary and her superpowers. Who is the villain? And that's just a few flaws. My point is correct the flaws and Hancock is a classic. For now, it's a really good movie.",Hancock
207,das417,A troubled hero discovers who he really is,7,5 July 2008,"John Hancock (Will Smith) is not your ordinary superhero. Drunk, angry, and bitter, Hancock's actions are often as destructive as they are helpful. Los Angeles feels that having Hancock is more dangerous and expensive and it is understandable that most, if not the entire city, hates him. Hancock is more than willing to return the feeling even though he still tries to help (and fails badly).Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman) is not a superhero but he is trying to save the world in his own way. A PR man, Ray spends his days trying to convince corporations that helping the world, instead of just trying to make a profit, is the right thing to do. The trouble is that of course no one listens to him and Ray is easily ignored.These two lives were separate and on different paths until one day when Hancock rescues Ray. It is then that Ray, through part gratitude, part opportunity, and part sympathy, decides to make it his mission to reinvent Hancock into a true hero that everyone will love. Of course, Ray's wife Mary Embrey (Charlize Theron) is not to excited about having the drunken Hancock around their house and son Aaron (Jae Head) but Ray has made his mind up regardless of her feelings.Hancock is a unique idea in that a superhero is held responsible for the damage and chaos he causes much as a regular person would be responsible. Hancock himself is hated, sued, and eventually threatened with prison because of the destruction he reaps across the city. Traditional superheros are often given free reign to do what they want to do but Hancock instead lives in a world where no matter what you do, good intentions or not, someone will always complain. Is Hancock a new classic for the superhero genre? I would say no because of a certain plot twist that turns an otherwise good idea in a melodrama that distracts from the good things, such as cynical humor and real character development, that the movie had going for it. The critics have constantly complained about this and they were right to make it an issue. I won't go into too much detail but everyone now knows that Mary herself is a superhero or at least has the same powers that Hancock does. This wasn't really a twist since if you watched the trailers you could guess that she would have something to do with the conflict of the story. The real problem is the strange ""myth"" created to explain the reason why Hancock and Mary exist and how they affect each other. Was this needed? No, and it is tragic that Hancock decided to include it. The entire feel of the movie was changed and not for the better. I can only wonder why the writers and director thought this was necessary as if they didn't have a good thing going already. I suspect it had something to do with having an explanation for Hancock as well as to give the possibility of an enemy who he would have to face. The problem was that Hancock didn't really need any of these because it wasn't a standard superhero movie.Hancock is not a bad movie and there are some good ideas put into it. Jason Bateman is a face we need to see more often in major movies and hopefully Hancock will push his popularity higher. Perhaps him, more than anyone else, will be the one to benefit from the summer popularity of Hancock.7/10",Hancock

He leaves in a dodgy trailer and finds alcohol more exciting than fighting against crime. People hate him and he doesn't make anything to please them. Hancock is crude and tired of doing heroic deeds. Then a unlucky PR-man Ray (Jason Bateman) tries to help Hancock to get back the appreciation of people. Ray's wife (Charize Theron) doesn't like the bad behaving superhero...The director Peter Berg has picked a subject that brings something new to the superhero-genre. The Marvel pictures presents more typical superheroes but Berg thrills to the core of humanity. Every superhero has their human alter egos but Hancock doesn't hide behind some mask and doesn't seal his true persona. Hancock is bored to be the only rescuer of humankind and is lonely. Being different than others can be devastating and everyone needs somebody who understands what it's like to be different.

Once the ""big reveal"" was made, the story line got somewhat thin. Safe to say it got a touch dull towards the end. Does Will Smith look a little fat in this movie?

The message is apparently that there are no real superheroes and companies should give away all their products to make the world a better place. And while it is a comedy with a few funny scenes it takes itself entirely too seriously to escape into an absurdist parody of the pretense.Look at how ridiculous the ending is for example. I won't spoil it, but the movie tries to pretend it is a critical look at the shortcomings of the less than ideal superhero while ending on a note that is so sickeningly saccharine and idealistic that barf bags should be passed out in the theaters.",Hancock
211,kupcr,"Great Movie First Time, Not So Great Second Time Around",5,25 October 2020,"I wondered why I would want to watch this movie after 12 years because at the time, I was dating and both LOVED the film, but then that was in 2008 and we literally watched it the day it came out in the theatre. When she noted that I LOVED this film being a big Will Smith fan, she bought me the DVD after it was at BLOCKBUSTER, but I never bothered re-watching it. It just didn't really do anything for me after we broke up and it was her fil , although I liked Charlize Theron's character Mary Embrey in the film, i guess my feelings for this movie wained and never watched it again. I had a different perspective and it doesn't really excite me as it did 12 years ago. The movie has an interesting premise, though where Smith plays a wino named John Hancock who has superheroic powers, but his drunken attempts at fighting crime have caused huge damage and alienated people. Actor Jason Bateman who wonderfully plays Ray, offers to advise HANCOCK trying to rehabilitate his image. Will Smith's acting career is following a recent run of serious efforts, one of the lightweight, crowd-pleasing action comedies which made his name. As Smith's drunken-idiot superhero blunders through the apprehension of a carload of speeding crooks, this feels like a (better) male-slob answer to My Super Ex-Girlfriend, and one vaguely expects Martin Lawrence to show up as Jimmy Olsen. I think the first time I watched this movie, maybe I would've given it an 8, but now the rating is much lower.",Hancock

That can't be good, and he causes millions of dollars worth of property damage every time he catches criminals. He has wrecked more than enough expensive stuff to put him away behind bars for a lifetime, and if Flying Under the Influence is an actual crime, he could spend an extra 50 lifetimes of his immortality in jail.Read more here:",Hancock

Like, all those buildings that get destroyed when the Megazord and the bad guy of the week duke it out in Angel Grove, who pays for the repairs? No one ever tried to sue the Power Rangers for saving the world! As for the cast, Will Smith plays the drunken ""asshole"" very well, and Jason Bateman does a fantastic job as a mediator. Although,Charlize Theron could have been replaced with any beautiful actress, and no one would've noticed. I know Hancock needed a back-story, but honestly I really loved just watching him trying to fit in to society. I mean, the way people treat him is hilarious when you think, all he has to do is snap one time, and he could kill every living thing on the planet, or declare himself a god and require virgin sacrifices, or anything he wanted, and there wouldn't be a thing anyone could do to stop him!

216,jake-179,A thinly veiled Obama campaign ad,1,2 February 2009,"I boycotted this movie when it first came out, despite the fact that I like Super Hero movies. I have always had this funny feeling about the movie, thinking it looked weak and stupid, and I had this suspicious feeling about it, too. So recently I finally decided to rent it and to my surprise, my suspicions were all confirmed. This movie was nothing but a thinly veiled Barak Obama campaign advertisement.It is about ""Hancock,"" named after one of our founding fathers John Hancock. A MAGIC black man (super hero) who will ""Change everything."" The idea of Change comes up over and over again in the movie....if only ""people can learn to accept him and to like him. The whole world will change!"" Hancock's friend in the movie is the character Ray, who is an image consultant. His day job before he meets Hancock is going around to EVIL CORPORATIONS run by WHITE MEN and trying to convince them to DO WHAT THEY DO, PRODUCE WHAT THEY PRODUCE, BUT GIVE IT ALL AWAY TO THE WORLD FOR FREE. Just like Obama's communist political agenda! I am not exaggerating, that is EXACTLY what he tells the corporations in multiple scenes. Also, get a load of this: the license plate of Ray's car is shown in one scene of the movie...it reads ""GREEN 44."" Any significance? How about the GREEN MOVEMENT and the 44th PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES? Let me tell you, I know movies, and in just about EVERY movie scene where a license plate can be seen, it has some kind of hidden meaning or code put in there by the director. That is one of the oldest and little known tricks in the book of movie making.Also, this movie was released on July 2, 2008 here in the U.S. Just in time to start brainwashing people and warming up their minds for the November Election. Don't forget that stupid staged photo of Obama posing in front of that Superman Statue. That picture was circulated heavily during his campaign, and it was not long after this movie came out. Seems obvious to me they were trying to tie it all together. I guess the people who vote here in the USA really are incredibly stupid. This movie sucked. It had no central villain, and the one armed bad guy they tried to put up against Hancock was weak and under developed. Overall, I rate this movie VERY low. It was a pathetic campaign ad, that's all.

217,Mccadoo,"Hancock proves, yet again, why you should never listen to movies critics",7,21 July 2008,"I've always been suspect of grown men and women who make a living criticizing the creative endeavors of others while having never created anything themselves. I happen to be a pilot and was for a time a flight instructor; to criticize the flying abilities of others one first had to become a pilot themselves. Everyone has a right to their opinion about movies, art, literature of course, but to make a living at it just seems tawdry to me. I mean, how does one become an expert at criticizing the work of others, especially if they themselves have never done that type of work.I usually take the fact that a movie is panned by critics as a sign that I may want to see it. The reverse is sometimes also true, if critics gush over a movie it oft times turns out to be just awful; Hidden Dragon Floating Tiger or whatever the name of that horrid movie was comes to mind, as does The English Patient, and more recently; Lions for Lambs...Anyway, I have to admit that I went in to Hancock wondering if this time the formula wouldn't hold up and the critics would finally be right about a movie because the previews didn't look that good. The movie turned out to be very entertaining and the perfect movie for a hot humid summer weekend, it was funny, entertaining and had some great action sequences. Was it deeply thought provoking, of course not, it wasn't meant to be. It was fun, and that's what we went to see it for, to be entertained. The casting was perfect, Will Smith was, once again, fantastic, ditto for Jason Bateman, possibly one of our most under appreciated actors, and Charlize Theron was funny and believable and, as always, beautiful.The posters on this site who have burned up the message boards talking about this being a racist movie either didn't really pay attention to the story line, or they just need to get a life. I suspect it's probably a little of both. Some people probably went into this movie looking for a racist element and would have found it no matter what.

THIS COMMENT IS IN ORDER, IT DOESN'T HAVE AN ABUSIVE CONTENT, SO PLEASE DO NOT DELETE IT (as it happened to other decent comments of my own). THANK YOU! ""Hancock"" starts on the right track, only to go wayward soon enough. The main problem is that, although the subject is original and clever, the two writers, Ngo and Gilligan, are definitely not by far intelligent enough to articulate it into a fulfilled script. The story-line is messy and linear, and the intended twists, forced and predictable.Maybe the worst mistake is that of approaching AGAIN the old trick of the ""historic perspective"": the super-heroes belong to an immortal and all-powerful race, the so-called ""Gods"" in mythology, bla-bla! We already saw it in so many movies - and, as a rule, totally compromised! (Remember, for instance, only the most recent ""Jumper"" or ""Alien vs. Predator""!) As if this wasn't enough, they add up another time-spoiled motive: ""love with the price of immortality""; incidentally, Eminescu made a better job out of it - and without throwing cars and stranded whales all around the city!). These poor attempts to give ""depth"" to the story simply don't add-up with the starting context, which is very snappy and funny indeed: the ""disabused"" hero, fallen into alcoholism and neglect, and his love-hatred relationship with society. THAT angle should have been developed... and we could have had a really good anti-hero comedy, comparable to ""Wanted"".Missing that point, we just get with a nice summer entertainment, professionally enough directed and shot.

I saw the trailer and I was, it has some funny taglines but it looks too much like your typical Hollywood-spotfest so I didn't know what to think at first. The surprise was absolutely very welcomed ! Will Smith make the movie a real treat, he add the dose of charisma and energy we need in such a big blockbuster ! Charlie Theron & Jason Bateman as supporting actors ! It was a nice addition to see Theron in a role like this, just imagine Aeon Flux but more intense and funny at the same time, she seems to be perfectly fine for the role, as compared as what people said. At first, she seems to have signed for a very ordinary role, and it's not at the end ! She's even more important than the lead actor in this movie. And Jason Bateman, he is the man with the smile, he make us laugh and he want to help the entire world, and he may have find what it takes to help him, an anti-hero that can become big if he listen to someone like him !

221,antonjsw1,"Ludicrous spin on the super hero mythology is saved by winning performances by Smith, Bateman, Theron, and some hilarious LOL moments!",7,3 April 2013,"This film tries to put a new spin on the super hero, creating an anti-super hero, very well played by Will Smith, and his journey to redemption thanks to a down on his luck salesmen, a terrifically sympathetic Jason Bateman. While the concept is clever, even with suspension of disbelief there are still an awful lot of plot holes.However, what saves the film are great performances, and a tongue firmly enough in cheek to make a subtle nod to the audience that the film's knows and embraces its own ludicrousness. It then has the balls not to care because the cast are clearly having a lot of fun and as the story moves along there are some very amusing set pieces and some huge laugh out loud moments, the best being Hancock's first run in with some prisoners when he voluntarily surrenders himself to the authorities for his own past misdeeds. Theron is also good value as Bateman's wife, and reason's for the character's guarded personality will reveal themselves as the story progresses, though this plot development ends up being a huge contrivance to help sustain the film's concept as at about the halfway point it begins to run out of steam. In fact the films story then veers off at a tangent and becomes a very different film as the climax is surprisingly grounded and intimate, and at this point the films suddenly, and somewhat out of the blue hits you with a face-full of pathos. Weirdly enough this actually seems to work dramatically and pulls you along to the end of the film, which then signs off with a few more very funny set pieces.Technical credits are first rate, with some impressive and very funny visual effects, provided by a team of companies led by veteran outfit Sony Pictures Imageworks and veteran Oscar winning Supervisor John Dykstra. Editing and music work well for the film and Peter Berg's direction is self-assured and confident enough to allow the film to zip past fast enough for you to almost overlook the plot contrivances and holes. However, the film's original theatrical cut is the much better version, and the directors extended version is notably inferior, particularly early on when scenes are either unnecessary, overtly gross and evenly shockingly disturbing and I am sure would have meant an R rating for the film had it been released. Had this been the original version of the film, it would have made it much more difficult for the audience to empathise with the lead character as some parts of the story in this cut of the film actually turn you off the character in a very big way.In summary then, a silly plot compensated for by a film that is genuinely exciting, funny and for the most part very entertaining.",Hancock

223,photoe,"Lazy, confounding, irritating, and quite boring",2,28 January 2009,"As others have noted, I knew the basic premise going in, and thought it at least a decent hook, though hardly all that original. Anyone who has read comic books knows that one frequently used plot line involves the superhero losing their powers, or going through dark periods of self-doubt. Batman's entire character is based on dark self-doubt.Regardless, the movie violates a basic film school 101 rule: create an arc that carries the film start to finish. Twisting the plot does not mean throw it against the wall half way through the movie and pick up the pieces. To me, this script screams that somebody knew how to get in, with zero idea how to cogently get out. I'm also convinced that there may have been a different final 40 minutes of the movie, and some executive changed it based on focus groups, but since there is a tie-in to Hancock's mental state, it probably was conceived from the start, unfortunately.The main shift in the plot line, that Hancock would run into his female double (Theron), is highly implausible. Why, of all the people that he ran into, would it be the wife of a man he rescued who pursued him, not vice versa. Jason Bateman becomes the sidekick and almost mentor in the first part of the movie, and then he becomes the vehicle for the (romantic) rise of Theron's character in the second half. This is a very unstable progression in the plot.Out of the millions of people he ran into, I SUPPOSE eventually he would run into her. However, it basically tosses the Bateman/Smith dynamic, and turns into Smith/Theron, with a lot of seriously ridiculous melodrama that completely changes the tone of the movie from comedy to drama. After this jarring derailment, it was impossible for me to care about the characters or the film.Its not like the film was going that well earlier. Smith's character reforming from alcoholism in MANY drawn-out pitifil reform scenes fundamentally betrayed the movie's original light-hearted romp feel. The movie was summer fare, right? We don't need to see 15 minutes of Smith talking in an AA meeting, and then Bateman discussing with him at length Hancock's depressed superhero past. I got it already. This also made the movie feel like it was done on the cheap. The action scenes were well-done, but considering this is a Will Smith tent-pole, they were few, and they had absolutely none of the dramatic tension found in the heavy emotional scenes.I also did not understand the prison scene where the criminals try to block his way, having already been jailed by him. He has superhero powers, remember? It was as if the writer, director and producer got together and thought of the most cliché thing they could in that situation.Later, somebody in the production says to themselves, 'lets make his take-offs and landings break the concrete.' These effects shots were a major part of the movie. It was used over and over and over again, the REAL physics at work, right? Nevermind the cops not all dying on the freeway, or everyone not dying in the train stopped cold, or the whale not being torn apart when it was thrown. Hancock is realistic and human, but nothing he does is. Simply more incongruence in the film.There was nothing in this movie that surprised me, other than Smith's wisecracks, which were about the only thing that were enjoyable. He's a good dramatic and comedy actor, but if his hands were in this script and production, then he really should not stick to producin'.The entire end-plot about Smith and Theron being together for millenia was thoroughly ludicrous, and distaste was slyly evident on Bateman's face, a star of one of the most dryly absurd shows on TV, Arrested Development. It's clear he was working not to smirk, or just getting no direction, but just enjoying the fat check. The legitimacy and straight-man interest he brought to Smith's outrageous character was abandoned, and he just turned into a mannequin. This gave the movie a real odor of being fundamentally changed while shooting, but the deciders won't be telling us.Theron gives a heroic performance, but her dramatic scenes with Smith seemed totally out of place towards the end. Suddenly, a PG comedy went close to a dramatic R. I wouldn't want a kid to see all this violence.Finally, once the superheros are apart, they both revive, but all the others of their kind died because they stayed together? HUH? Only these two gods can figure out the secret trick...don't be in close proximity? So love makes you mortal? OK, NOT an interesting premise, but tenable. At the end I was wondering where did the comedy go? I guess I see how it can all tie together, but there's zero concern for any real emotional integrity. They resist each other, they have their superhero spat in public (that was a major loose end they never addressed - Theron being exposed) yadda yadda yadda. This movie was thrown together, and not taken seriously. I would've felt deeply ripped off had I paid full fare.Talking about all this kind of makes me ill. The money this movie made is sad, but the sequel will be the real abomination and hopefully justice will rain down on this possible 'franchise', although I'm sure someone in the studio will demand a better script...I hope.",Hancock
224,alecwest,Loved two-thirds of it.,7,6 July 2008,"There are some movies I hate at the beginning but warm up to as they progress. There other movies I enjoy at the beginning but hate by the ending. This is one of those strange films where I love the beginning, love the ending, but have issues with the middle.This MAY be a spoiler but I'll try not to make it so. Suffice it to say that somewhere in the movie, Hancock begins to learn a little about his origins. Shortly after that point ... and during the slow-released tale that becomes an ""awakening"" for Hancock ... the movie begins to rub me the wrong way. And, it continues to do so up until the liquor store scene (followed by the hospital scene). Then, it picks up to an exciting and heartfelt climax.Now -- this middle part of the movie was ""acted"" well. I take nothing away from Will Smith or his ""enlightener."" But in my opinion, the writing was insulting. Hancock's interaction with his enlightener did NOT (repeat NOT) have to be handled in such a childish manner. The bickering and fighting added NOTHING to the movie. That whole section of the film could have been written SO much better. The movie was already headed in a serious direction and should have continued along that path. Fortunately, the final scenes of the film redeemed the story that was almost destroyed by the idiocy of the film's middle.Having said all that, however, I want to see a sequel ... several sequels, actually ... IF they are better written throughout the films. With skillful writing, this could end up becoming a franchise for Smith and costars.",Hancock

I think I have seen three different trailers and from those trailers I could have told anyone the whole plot and most of the plot points before the film even started. Even what I am sure most viewers saw as a surprise I could have told you was going to happen just by watching one trailer. I won't give away anything here of course but that anyone who has seen the trailers would be surprised by anything in this movie surprises me. Either I see to many movies or your average movie goers are rather stupid, I'd say a little of both. Also the first half of the movie was almost all in the trailer, nothing fresh or new that I hadn't seen before for at least the first 40 minutes. My point is that making trailers is a lost art, only a very few trailers a year are well made and don't give away the whole film. OK, now back to the movie, the idea for this film is great but this movie doesn't take advantage of that, and there are few things I hate more then bad trailers and wasted ideas. All that said I loved the music and a few scenes were great and could have been amazing if the story around it would have been better. I admit there was maybe three or four funny lines that I hadn't heard before going in, but in a Will Smith comedy only three or four kind of sucks.",Hancock
226,Steven Reynolds,More than a blockbuster,7,5 July 2008,"A drunken-slob superhero with an attitude bordering on nihilist, John Hancock (Will Smith) is despised by the people of Los Angeles. His spectacularly destructive efforts to fight crime usually end up costing the city millions. So when Hancock saves budding PR executive Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman) from certain death at a level crossing, Embrey offers to repay Hancock by helping reinvent his image. Embrey's young son is thrilled to have a superhero hanging around, but Ray's wife, Mary (Charlize Theron), seems to be wrestling with both attraction and alarm... ""Hancock"" is outrageous, funny, smart, knowingly ridiculous and surprisingly moving. Yes, moving. I was expecting ""Bad Boys + super powers"", or at most a spoof on the clichés of the rapidly tiring superhero genre. What we get is something else entirely. The surprising tonal shift of the second half is neither as grating nor as abrupt as preview audiences had us believing. For me, it really worked. So much so that this is one of the few blockbusters I wish had been longer, giving writers Gilligan and Ngo and director Berg more time to explore the backstory and the resonant depths it potentially had. The problem isn't so much that the tone changes, but rather that more isn't made of it. I also wanted to spend more time with these thoroughly likable characters. As it stands, ""Hancock"" is still a winner. The script is sharp, the direction kinetic, the music and lens work appropriately manic, and the performances fine. Most surprising is Smith who manages to keep his shirt on and wring a lot more than laughs out of Hancock. While Smith can stoke a box-office inferno with his name alone, he shows once again that he's also a pretty good actor. He can certainly do vulnerable, even in superhero mode.",Hancock
227,H_Spengler,solid first hour turns into convoluted mess,4,15 February 2009,"I really enjoyed the first hour of this movie. Smith plays an unlikable ""anti"" hero who seems to do more damage than good as he fights crime in Los Angeles. People hate him, and he doesn't seem to care one bit. That is until he saves the life of flaky, but kind hearted Bateman, who becomes his friend and vows to change his image.I thought it kind of dumb that the city of Los Angeles wanted to jail Smith for all the property destruction his hero antics has caused throughout the years, seeing the fact that he's invincible and there's not a jail house that exists that could contain him. I thought: ""You people don't know that?"" I thought likewise about the criminals that he encounters once he voluntarily incarcerates himself. He put a good lot of them away himself, they attempt to antagonize and bully him. If anyone knows what he's capable of it would be them, and they still are going to try to harm him? The whole scene exists so that Smith makes good on a threat about putting someone's head somewhere where the sun don't shine.I thought, ""OK."" It strange, but not enough to throw off the movie. The real trouble starts when it's revealed that Theron is also a superhero, I could actually hear the movie spiraling downhill.Not only was it unnecessary and stupid, it's also convoluted and hokey. It didn't take me long to get angry at the movie for taking such a lame turn. Apparently Smith and Theron are some sort of superhero star crossed lovers who turn mortal and are able to get hurt when near one another. He of course has amnesia, and remembers none of this. Stupid? Yes. Especially considering that for the first hour he was around her plenty and never lost any of his powers. Of course, conveniently this is the point where a couple of jail-house thugs break out and go after him. I'm not sure if they possessed any superpowers themselves, or just knew about the vulnerability of Hancock turning mortal. I wasn't interested enough to pay attention. Anyhow, Smith & Theron are mortally wounded and almost die, but don't, Smith musters up enough power to ""go away"" thus restoring their powers and saving them both. He lives and moves to fight crime another day in New York City or some other unnamed metropolis. The movie would've been great if it kept the straightforward, simple plot established in the first hour. Instead it sinks into an overcomplicated, soggy, ultimately disappointing lazily written, second half. Smith does a good job in the movie, and tries to do the best he can with the sloppy second act. I like Bateman. The movies i've seen him in he's played everything from a straight laced accountant (Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium) to a smarmy jerk (The Ex). He plays his role convincingly & straightforward here, and thankfully doesn't contribute to the over-complication. Theron, unfortunately I cannot vouch for. I've seen her in great roles, and know her flexibility as an actress. Her role in this movie could've easily been played by anyone, not to mention reduced. A script overhaul, especially regarding her character and the plot involved with it would've done this movie a solid. It's not a god awful film, but you'll leave disappointed after experiencing what was a great first hour.",Hancock
228,marimbadaddy,Enjoyable Antisuperhero Movie,6,3 January 2009,"I enjoyed the fact that Hancock is an anti-superhero, with a severe personality disorder, and a drinking problem. I would have liked to have seen Jason Batemen's character have been a bit more outgoing, as he is eventually overshadowed by Smith and Theron. However, the threesome's interaction is pretty good.This movie was far more dramatic than My Super Ex Girlfriend, which has comparable plot elements, but still has some funny moments. The ending of the movie seemed rushed, perhaps because there was not a strong establishment of a villain throughout. In fact, the movie starts out with Hancock being his own worst enemy, but towards the end, his own inner battle is forgotten, overshadowed, or replaced by an outer battle with foes.Ultimately, this is fun for a while, then gets mired down in drama. The ending is somewhat satisfying, and somewhat unsatisfying. Not so disappointing that it is not worth renting.",Hancock
229,alanrayford,"Next time, go all the way with it!",7,7 July 2008,"I saw Hancock at the Pheonix Bellair in Detroit, MI on it's opening day. The movie wasn't bad. However, it wasn't exactly great either. I liked the acting. Will Smith, Charlize Theron, and Jason Bateman all did a good job suspending my disbelief. The story,while not the greatest this summer--by any stretch of the imagination, was good enough to keep me in my seat. The action and special effect were also well done. However, there was still a problem.There was no color to the movie. If you have a character who is super-strong, can fly, and is invincible, you're already out on the ledge--regarding plausibility. That being the case, why not go all the way. Instead of everything being rendered in a kind of drab reality, why not go with bright colors to enforce the more fantastical elements of the story. Seriously, look at it. Spider-Man has red and blue--his movies were all blockbusters. Iron Man has red and gold--his flick kicked ass. Hell, even the Hulk has green and it really helps the character pop.What do we get with the titular character to this film? We get gray, black, and blue. It didn't really stick out that much. When Hancock first showed up to save those hostages, during that bank robbery, he looked more like a early morning jogger than a superhero. Seeing as how, by that point, he was operating as a superhero, would using a little extra color to sell it have really hurt? Instead of looking super, Hancock just looked, in Mike Epps words, like he was dressed in a ""tight ass Wolverine outfit"".Then there's the other problem I had. What exactly could Hancock do? I know he can fly and is strong, but exactly how strong? I know he's fast, but how fast? I know bullets and rockets bounce off his skin, but would a stiff kick to the jewels double him over? Also, when in proximity to his other half, why, in God's name, did they have such a profound effect on the weather? An explanation about this would have been nice. Then again, it's possible I missed it.Lastly, there was the overall lack of balance of the movie. The first half was entertaining. The last half, while still solid, felt like it belonged in another movie altogether. In the space of ten minutes, Charlize Theron's character is shot, in the gut, by a shotgun. Hancock is shot numerous times and bludgeoned too boot. Then we have Jason Bateman, who saves the day by hacking off a baddies hand with an axe, just before burying the blade in the guy's chest. I felt this was all rather unnecessary and kind of defeated the lighter, more enjoyable tone of the first half of the film.At the end of the day, two tickets for Hancock was money well spent. However, shortly after leaving the theater, it's colorless nature was already causing it to loose out, in my memory, against some of the other blockbusters I've already seen. If there's a sequel, slap some more color on the dude. Make him look super. Also, explore the limits of his powers, possibly with a main stay of this kind of character--an arch-villain.All in all, Hancock was a decent enough summer flick--if somewhat forgettable. If you haven't seen it yet and are on the fence, go for it. Like I said before, it's money well spent. As to the crew of this film, kudos for keeping that twist under wraps in the internet age. You must have tighter security than Fort Knox. Next time, though, if there is a next time, go all the way with your concept. It might just help you deliver a more memorable experience.",Hancock
230,shiftyeyeddog,"Great Concept, Flawed Execution",7,5 July 2008,"Hancock is getting a lot of undeserved criticism. Is it a perfect film? No. But is it a mess, or even the massive disappointment it's been made out to be? Not at all.Hancock is a movie that tries to tell too much story, and ends up telling too little. I've heard it said that this film feels like all setup (similar to my comments about Jumper). But I believe differently in this case. I think if it was hoped this character would continue in subsequent films, they should have kept this first film just the introduction of the character, with his down-and-out reluctant-hero attitude, and his transformation to a more positive image and attitude (with a new subplot/villain to make a complete film). The second film could have delved more into his origins and history and his encounters with and relationships to others with his power. Then from there, they could go anywhere they wanted. As it is, though, I hope this remains a stand-alone film with no sequels. It's a great concept (both his early film personality and his origins), I loved the cast, and the film was entertaining; but it has left itself nowhere to go from here without just being the typical superhero movie.The film also feels very incomplete, like there was more to it - and from what I hear that's exactly the case. I'm very curious to see the inevitable (hopefully) director's cut of the film. Reportedly Peter Berg had to cut and alter quite a bit (it now runs barely 90 minutes) to get the desired PG-13 rating and the film the studio wanted - a safe family-friendly Will Smith summer flick. I think there's a good chance that in trying to increase the success of the film by mandating a PG13 film, they actually may have hurt its chances by neutering it.",Hancock
231,gatorgus48,My favorite 'superhero' movie.,9,19 May 2021,"I loved it. Smith was excellent as usual. Theron stunning, likable, yet badass in her own way. Bateman does a great job and his character ties it all together.Well done.",Hancock
232,thomasmitilis1995,NICE START BUT THEN GOES OFF THE RAILS,5,17 April 2020,"PROS:The film manages to depict a different perspective about superheroes and what issues would have if they existed. The first half of the movie attempts effectively to deconstruct the superhero genre. In this case the hero is alcoholic who is hated by everyone. The interaction between Smith and his public representative (Bateman) is the strongest part of the film
CONS:For some reason the ideas of the first half are abandoned for a more convoluted story. The twist of the movie is not fully developed and many questions in the relationship of Hancock and Theron's character are left unanswered (we don't even learn his real name). Also, the ''love is weakness'' cliche is overused. The villains are literally some random guys that actually are never a threat to the protagonist. The humour doesn't always land, the close-ups with the camera offer nothing and the special effects are dated.",Hancock
233,syedsafwaan,Worst movie,2,27 March 2020,I have watched worst movie since ages. no logic movie. i had hopes on will smith movies but this one disappointed me.,Hancock
234,Astralan,Where did this film get derailed???,6,7 July 2008,"When I saw the first previews of this, I truly thought it was going to be the sleeper blockbuster of the summer. It looked slick, salty and witty. Will looked on top of his comic game; the expressions he impaled his drunken character is something every college animal house inhabitant has probably experienced more than one (I know I did). The special effects people didn't make him out to be at home being a super hero. Lift-offs, flight and landings were the kind of crash and burn a kid would feel when first learning to walk. All the editing of the trailers looked just soooo.... so promising! Then my wife and I went to it and my delight turned to concern after the first 30 minutes. Realize, the running length of this is shorter than WALL-E, and if they had someone that could have paced this film better and drive it using the comic abilities of it's primary star, it would have just been a perfect amount of time.However, director, writer, producers left the reservation on this and turned a potential gold mind into a mucky slur of attempted fictional drama adorned with some very clever comic lines. Hancock is about a down and out superhero that just lost his ability to give a crap outside what he is suppose to do. If they had just followed that to where self realization and respect direction could have lead Hancock, it could have been a delightful movie.BUT... NOOOOOOOOOOoooooooooooooooo. They had to throw some totally obnoxious twists into it that almost breaks the sprockets that turn the wheels of this movie. I just CAN'T say much,(SPOILER!!!) but it seems Hancock was left for dead once by a woman that was suppose to be his wife. After that, the muddy soup just gets icky.This said, the laughter in the theater nearly ended after 20 minutes. Leave it to Hollywood to mess up a perfectly promising movie with a perfectly silly plot. Not that it's a drag... you can watch the movie and enjoy it for what it is, its just not something you will commit to memory like Jurassic Park or ET. -BDP",Hancock
235,mozli,A lot of interesting concepts and unanswered questions,7,13 December 2008,"When its a Will Smith movie on the queue I kinda hold my breath. Will is capable of just about anything and everything. He can do art house films and multi-plex packing movies. This one almost seemed to be trying to be both at once. I'll avoid talking about the big high concept idea of Will and Charlize's characters because it opens the door to too many questions. The film wants all our focus on this degenerate superhero, or, more the point how do we common people relate to someone who has extraordinary gifts. Do we kowtow to them? Do we excuse their inexcusable behavior? Is anyone so essential to keeping the peace and order that they are given allowances for shortcomings and deeds that the rest of us would be imprisoned for(i.e. Jack Bauer, Vic Mackey, Dick Cheney). The script isn't going anywhere near answering those questions in a real, cogent way.On a side note, some folks believe this is a racist film. I don't agree with that perspective. I believe if this script were around thirty years ago this would've likely been a Richard Pryor vehicle.",Hancock
236,Gin-ster,Surprisingly good (SPOILER ALERT),8,7 December 2008,"I have read a number of reviews which more or less say that it was a great idea but poorly executed. I don't entirely agree; while I would've liked more clarity at the end as to the origins of Theron's and Smith's characters, I think it was very touching and certainly carried more emotional heft and provoked more curiosity than the average ""superhero"" movie. Critics have commented on the low-quality special effects and it didn't seem that way to me. I appreciated the novelty of a screwed up superhero and an uncynical PR man, and the ""knowing looks"" of Theron's character lent intrigue to the story. The nature of their relationship, though, granted, not clearly explained, hinted at some mythological, tragic scale of brother-sister/twins/soul mates in a ""write your own explanation"" sort of way. While the picture was not flawless (and the ""head up the a--"" threat was carried out far too literally), it lingers on the mind far more than most action movies offered up for entertainment these days.",Hancock
237,user-543-975655,Nothing Short Of Awesome,8,25 January 2014,"This movie gets criticized sometimes because I bet some people didn't watch the whole thing. I've heard people say that the comedy in this movie is unrealistic. I couldn't disagree more. Hobo drinking a lot. Realistic. Hobo smells like liquor and destroys stuff unintentionally. Not realistic, but still funny. Well, you get the point. I have also heard people criticize this movie because a woman is one of the heroes. Are you derogatory much, people? I am not a woman, I am a dude, but I do think every once in a while you should add woman superheroes into movies to keep things mixed up and fresh. But, that is just what I think. Oh, before I start actually reviewing this movie, if you are watching it with a small kid, which, I don't think you should do, turn off the subtitles and you hear probably 10 less cuss words than you would if you had the them on. Anyway, this movie is very, very good. I think that almost everything was spot-on with what you want in an action or superhero movie, meaning that everything a action/superhero fan would like, like the flying, super strength, or super speed. Well, sort of super speed. In this movie, unlike many others, the superhero doesn't picture his self as a hero, famous, and super hot. The hero pictures himself sort of as an average Joe, if you know what I mean. Just goes to regular houses, doesn't have a larger than superhuman persona (heehee, funny), and just looks like a regular guy. He doesn't have huge, gigantic muscles, he just has muscles. And I think that really enriches the story because it gives you a sense of realism. It also makes the story a tiny bit more believable. It's not believable, really, but I'm sure you know what I mean. The special effects of this movie are also very believable, because most of the scenes don't require a huge amount special effects. Some do, though. This means that a lot of times, there is not tons of effort needed for the special effects people, which have a lot of skill in this field. OK, so I guess it's about time I review the three main aspects of the film, as I call them. They are acting, directing, and the dialogue, as well as music. The acting was pretty much great, except for the fact that sometimes the delivery of punchlines aren't delivered very well. There isn't the much desired ""umph"" of good punchlines. I guess that goes along with dialogue, too. Other than that, the acting was displayed very well by Theron and Smith, who actually made a good duo. They made a kind of combination that makes sparks, but not romantically. Meaning that they just fit together without the slightest problem. Ray Embrey, played by Jason Bateman, is also a great addition to the movie. He provides some of the comedy of the movie, but not as much as Smith does. He is the soft character of the movie, and keeps the tone of the film light when it is needed. Jae Head, as usual, is a great acting kid, and did a wonderful job in this movie, as he did in The Blind Side. Good movie, by the way. The directing style of this movie is fairly unique, because instead of still cameras and slow panning to the sides, it is fast- paced, and action-y. It also isn't still, but isn't so shaky that it gives you a headache. It's kind of in the middle, where a lot of people like it, including me. That's really all I can say about the directing. The dialogue, now. The dialogue is really good in this movie, and I'm serious. The movie has a sense of realism, and it is enhanced very much by the masterful writing. There isn't a big line with a dude in tights that is said on top of a mountain, which can only work in a select few superhero movies. The writers did a really good job fitting in some of the back story in the movie, that unfolds gradually and smoothly. Which really isn't found that much anymore. Also, the costume isn't super blingy and in your face. It's just a leather suit with some designs on it. I guess I liked the movie a lot more than I would have if it was a normal superhero flick because it gave you a break from all of that in your face stuff. The writers did throw in a lot of unnecessary cursing in there. Honestly, I don't care, but there were about 20 use of the a word combined with hole, that it added about 15 seconds to the movie. All by saying that word. Just thought that was kind of unneeded. It's one of the reasons I gave this only an 8. The writers also made some good quotes for Hancock, which are all said so that they are funny and comedic, instead of serious and unfunny. Which also made the dialogue better. Now the music. The music really didn't stand out that much but there was one scene that used the theme from Sanford & Son that was really funny. Make sure you at least watch to that part. I do recommend this movie to anyone who likes fresh spins on superhero movies. Hope you liked this review, and please read some of my others. See ya guys!",Hancock
238,ksgillihan,A different take on the superhero genre,7,24 September 2020,"I quite like this movie. It's not perfect by any means but it has a solid message in it. A superhero who doesn't remember his past and who hasn't really had anyone in his life is just kind of drifting along. You don't get the typical ""good guy"" in this superhero though. This one has lots of flaws. I guess this is why it's so relatable to me. Being all-powerful doesn't mean that you don't have a heart also. Hancock himself doesn't know why he's on Earth or what he's supposed to do. He does help people but he doesn't know how to help himself.This ends up making him an outcast and someone who doesn't get along with others. He wants to have meaning but he just can't find it. He instead lets himself slip into bad habits because he has never really had anyone that legitimately cared for him. Until he meets someone one day who actually cares. You see a very broken man who has never had a reason to look inward, start to examine himself for once. The shift that Hancock goes through is realistic and creates a very sympathetic character. This movie offers a lot more than a standard ""hero saves the day"" story and I think it's a worth watching.",Hancock
239,The_Defiant1,This deserves some credit,9,6 July 2008,"Perhaps I'm being generous, but I think this movie deserves some credit. It's a serious take on a dysfunctional superhero that isn't based upon a Marvel Comics or DC Comics character. The special effects aren't as good as a movie like Transformers, but at least you aren't getting an animated CGI character hopping around like you do in Hulk and Spiderman. It appears that several elements of this movie may be inspired by the now defunct Broadway Comics. The classic scene of a car being skewered on a spire was depicted in the ""Powers That Be"" comic and the dysfunctional marriage relationship in the movie is not unlike the ""Shadow State"" comic by Broadway. Perhaps seeing similar depictions hit the big screen made me appreciate the movie more.Will Smith and Charlize Theron do a great job. The hero is flawed, but he's not a wimp. The movie's biggest weakness is the pacing. Some of the special effects go by so fast that you don't get to appreciate them. Some of the drama plays out so slowly that you might be wondering why they don't rush it along. The movie is faithful to the trailer. It's tough writing a spoiler-free review of this since there are some great twists in the plot.",Hancock
240,Strider_1978,"Is it a bird, is it a plane, no it's another bad representation",1,4 April 2009,"This is not a *good* film review, it's my thoughts and it won't get me a job at Empire magazine.There are not too many Black super hero icons out there, unless of course you count Blade.The warning lights came on (as they do with what I consider to be bad films) in the first scene with Will Smith and a boy. Now, I'm not knocking Will Smiths performance, he does a great job in every role he portrays. It's the situation and subsequent events made me shake my head.Hancock is a black man who has super powers. He is a bum with a drinking problem and the first thing we see him do is take off into the air and fly around the city with an open liquor bottle from which he is partaking whilst flying (don't try this at home kids) neat liquor.. The 'special effects' look like- I'm not sure what they look like, only I knew this was surely the point of no return. This is before (oh yes let's not forget the rap music) he catches some bad guys in a vehicle and then picks up their vehicle and throws them around a few city blocks whilst damaging public and private property.So OK, we have a bum black man with an attitude and a habit of keeping city construction workers in business, but it gets better. The script is abominable and this film is not far short of an R with it's in frequent but explicit language.Now I'm insulted in a way, not because I was offended by this. I was bitterly amused for at least half of the movie. I am offended that they had to make a film that would appeal to a given demographic because of its portrayal of how certain classes of people act, and apparently there is comedy in this.""Well you should sue McDonalds because they (cuss word) you up."" I wonder which demographic actually laughed at this? There is a plot in Hancock and in fact a significance. People *can* change it would seem. Hancock saves the life of a public figure who decides to change his image and do give him better appeal where the public (who think he is an asshole) are concerned. Yes of course, we shall use the word asshole because it's perfectly acceptable for kids to use it, as indeed they do. It's OK honey they will hear worse at school. Oh don't give me that look, I'm on this soap box for a reason.Well Hancock agrees to go to jail to clean up his act and turn himself around. During this time he flies out of the compound to grab a basketball and then after some hesitation flies back in. Oh boy do they have him locked up good and proper.I didn't start laughing at this until Nancy Grace appeared on TV. It was only then that I could no longer hold my composure.In truth Hancock does have some redeeming qualities, the credits are fun to watch. Oh seriously? Oh OK. There is a genuine story arc whereby we are introduced to Charleze Theron who is another of 'his' kind. They have some kind of relationship but I wanted the film to be over so I didn't really pay a great deal off attention. OK cynicism aside we do see a very human side to Hancock and an effort to reform. His character is both reprehensible and endearing and he does clean up his heroic act. It's just not strong enough when we consider the full equation. All of this is at the expense of certain factions of people who are trying very hard to prove that they are more than how much of society perceives them.Well, at least now they have a super hero flick to show the world it's simply not true.",Hancock

People dig Will Smith.I'm with you there. Will Smith, flying around, insulting people.. man, this will be great! Right. But we have to go with it somewhere, we can't just let him do superhero stuff while being a jerk, this would get old pretty fast. How about he somehow gets involved with a PR specialist, who will, like, try to improve his public image? Great idea!

242,MidnightWarrior,Entertaining!,7,5 July 2008,"Don't believe these ""reviews"" that dissect the film into ""acts"" and critique and analyze the film. People who do so probably haven't seen the film because what they say isn't relevant to the film.There's really not much to say about the film without giving it away. And I'm sure that there are plenty of other reviews on here that rehash the plot, so I won't.If you're a fan of Will Smith (I am) and his roles in action, sci-fi, comedy or a blend of all three, go see this film. Smith is fantastic in his role of Hancock and I doubt anyone else could have pulled off this role better or more entertaining than he did. And hey, Hancock isn't really your typical Hollywood hero, so cut Smith a break: he performed well! All of the cast and crew had great chemistry together and the film was fun to watch. Charlize looks really good in this film and Bateman was pretty impressive himself. The shaky camera could have been used less, but it's no where near as intrusive as in Cloverfield or Blair Witch Project.Overall, I give the film 7/10 stars. The cast and crew did a fantastic job.",Hancock
243,deanbean317,Ignore the naysayers!,10,10 July 2008,"Obviously, from reading the reviews on this movie, you don't have to have opposable thumbs to write a review...just a computer! So here are my two cents on the movie Hancock.GO SEE IT! The special effects are NOT cheesy (if you want CG cheese, watch any of the blockbuster Spiderman Movies), and the ending DOES NOT spoil the beginning. The flow of events does indeed turn from lighthearted to serious, but that's where the story-line takes us and it does so quite smoothly and logically. All of the characterizations in this movie are spot on and Jason Bateman almost steals the show from Will Smith which is no mean feat since he plays a suit wearing everyday middle of the road nice guy to a booze swilling whale tossing property wrecking Hancock. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie from beginning to end. Hopefully you'll be like me and ignore the naysayers. So shut-up and eat your popcorn!",Hancock
244,k-dhesi,"A mediocre movie, with impressive acting.",6,22 May 2009,"Hancock, boring? No. Entertaining? Yes. A great movie? Not so much. Does that some it up for you? Hancock was far from brilliant, but it's far from rubbish too. That put's it in the mediocre section.Will Smith was again outstanding. He made the movie good with his witty lines and superb acting. He played his roles a little different from his usual films, but that sure didn't stop him from impressing the world again. Far from your typical hero movie so don't even expect something like that, but that doesn't make the film bad at all. The film is different and that's what made the film watchable. The movie offers some laughs and OK action at times, but then some how the film get's draining and a little cheesy. Even though it was no ""real main villain"" when the so called villain was introduced into the film, his vengeance to get back the unusual non popular hero John Hancock seemed quite cheesy and weird at times.I would suggest the movie was pretty enjoyable but not brilliant. The beginning kicked off quite well, but the end was the most disappointing part if you ask me. But Smith's acting was superb.",Hancock
245,orangeisthenewawesome,So low-brow,1,16 December 2008,"This movie had one of the greatest premises and ruined it by going totally Hollywood and dumbing the whole thing down. Will Smith turns in one of the worst performances I've seen by any actor in any movie. Charlize who I think is lovely and talented is a screeching mess here. She and Will Smith have absolutely no chemistry. How is it possible? Their scenes together stink. The CGI ""effects"" look like utter garbage. I would have preferred NO effects to these incredibly fake, pointless ones. There is one saving grace, but even he cannot salvage the disaster that is Hancock. He is Jason Bateman who's talent and heart light up the screen. He connects with everyone in the picture and with the viewer. I would have given this stinker 0 out of 10 if not for him.",Hancock
246,DrewAlexanderR1,Caught at the Warning Track,6,16 August 2015,"Hancock was an attempt at something different in super hero genre. And it deserves applause for this. Instead of focusing on an earth threatening villain the film focuses on the villain within the hero. The superhero by make not by consensus, Hancock (Will Smith), fights bad guys when he feels like it. He does as much damage to the city he's in as to the bad guys he stops. The majority of the civilians of the city view him as a cause of disturbance rather than a preventer. Hancock has accepted this general opinion and does not care to change it until one of the people he saves, Ray (Jason Bateman), wants to help him. The film has a great premise and does well for the majority of the movie in executing it. However, the movie falters when it attempts to tell Hancock's past and bring it to the forefront. The movie had a great thing going but when the ball was almost out of the park, it got snagged on the warning track. Hancock is still a fun movie to watch, but you will most likely be disappointed with where the writers take the story. Will Smith delivers a top notch performance that is vastly under rated. He gives life to the character and made the viewer care about his plight. This film is worth renting or watching on TV, but it's not one for the collectors shelf.",Hancock
247,zevt,"Great first half, ruined by second half",5,22 January 2016,"(Will warn when I get to the spoilers...) The concept is superb: A superhero who acts like a bum and causes just as much damage as he does good, making the whole world hate him, yet he feels compelled to continue saving lives. What's more, Will Smith gives this character depth in a superb acting job, instead of just making him a cartoon character.The first half sets up this character with just the right amount of comedy, and has him meet a PR guy who wants to help him improve his public image and himself as a person, leading to some great comedy.(Major spoilers follow) Then comes the second half that ruins everything. It's not that the second half switches into a different movie. It's that the writers seemed to have been drinking all of the bottles that Hancock left behind, and stopped making any sense whatsoever.First of all, if he was a superhero for 3000 years before they found him in a hospital, then obviously the world knows who he is, so why did no one know him and tell him who he was?! And why would he and his doctors think he became a superhero only after his hospital stay? I don't believe they missed this obvious point. This alone kills the whole setup.Second, if they become mortal every time he gets close to her, why didn't he feel anything during their first long family dinner together? Or worse: When they fought, why didn't they kill each other or cause any damage to each other? According to the ending, all he has to do is put a mere kilometer of distance between them to become immortal again, so obviously it's the distance alone that causes it, contradicting everything that happened before.And what's the deal with the popcorn and tornadoes? Anyone? They get a triple-tornado when they get together and yet they stayed together several times before according to her, and the world didn't notice? And then there's her character. It's like they used a different writer for each segment of the movie. She transitions from normal person to super-bitch, to crazy person who enjoys wrecking the city for no reason, who then claims to be stronger than him just for the feminists in the crowd (and yet the world forgot everything she did for 3000 years?), and finally to a self-sacrificing saint. I kept praying that the movie would switch back to the Hancock character and save itself, but it never did. Huge disappointment. If only they had focused exclusively on his slower transition as a character...",Hancock
248,luke-346,A good idea... poorly executed!,4,5 July 2008,"Hancock began life as a good idea and with a very intriguing premise; it bills itself as the alternative superhero film by aiming to show that the Superhero can be humanized. The film centers on a down and out alcoholic superhero called Hancock, played by the ever impressive Will Smith. He is a superhero that causes destruction and fuels his own public hatred where ever he goes due to his lifestyle and his indolence. It becomes fortunate therefore that one day he should save the life of PR man (Jason Bateman), who is married to the lovely Mary (Charlize Theron) and that in return for saving his life he chooses to help Hancock change his image.The film starts well by introducing us to Hancock asleep, scruffy and unshaven on a public bench but ultimately establishing him as a lousy, grumpy oaf. As the film progresses Hancock evolves into a very endearing character, his apathy and self loathing - exhibited by his alcoholism, are all traits that manage to humanize the myths that surround super human beings. The fact that his physical prowess and lifestyle choice is his undoing is an interesting concept and in some quarters would be regarded as a microcosm of the manner in which gifted, black American men have been marginalized over the years (but this is a short review and I don't want to get that deep... however, examples that come to mind, and help to support this theory, are such great physical talents like Ed Moses, Shaquille O'Neil, Carl Lewis, Jesse Owen etc) some film scholars will no doubt give more precedence to this side of the film.Many critics have labeled the film as being unequal and disjointed and I would have to say that I agree. The first half of the film is amusing, engaging and quite plausible (given its premise) but upon the introduction of a second hero with equal powers the film quickly descends into the farcical. For example, some of the early scenes have Hancock exhibiting his strength in often mundane scenarios from dragging a car up a driveway to dunking a basketball from over 50 meters away but given there placement in the context of the film they are clearly the conceivable actions of a super strong human being. During the latter stages of the film this demonstration of strength becomes inane and coarse, epitomized by a scene in which the two superheroes battle it out the sky, throwing each other across blocks and through buildings, and affecting the weather to such an extent that lightening, twisters and snowfall all takes place. This is ultimately where the film falls down as it resorts to the clichés that are so often witnessed in films of this genre. Ultimately this decline is driven by a foolishly executed back-story that has no place in the film and should have been erased the moment it was conceived. The internal logic of the film is preposterous and nonsensical and would remain so even if it was chief plot device in a Saturday morning kids cartoon.When it comes to the direction it seems surprising to me that Peter Berg should be able to make the leap to making a blockbuster like Hancock, this is because Hancock was always going to be a commercial risk given its target audience and release date and his previous film The Kingdom was not a huge success. In these situations it is normally an established director that is chosen by the studio to carry films of this nature. This is evident from the manner in which the plot, story and narrative transpire to the screen as Berg's direction is gritty, with frantic zooms, sharp fast-pans and steady-cam sequences. His direction does not really complement the film, leading me to believe that in Hancock we have a director that is better than the film he is trying to make, a rarity in film making but it does happen.Finally, Hancock is probably one of the biggest let downs I have had the misfortune to witness this year. The incoherent story has seriously affected the outcome of this film; it has led to it being almost incomprehensible. The futile subplot and unnecessary twist laid the foundations for the films demise. However, despite my immense disappointment I can still sit back and take light in the performances and the direction, but they can do nothing for my overall feelings towards Hancock.",Hancock
249,mr_animal,Really enjoyed this movie,9,2 June 2020,"This movie is everything you expected and more. Great special effects, good humour, very good casting and brilliant plot with a nice twist. The only thing that is missing is a sequel.",Hancock
250,SouthernViews,Imaginative Take on Superheroes,8,9 April 2020,"Hancock is a fun, thrilling, and comedic twist on the usual superhero origin story. The plot has a few twists and surprises. I'm surprised so many other reviewers didn't like how the story got dark toward the climactic final act. I thought it was fantastic. This isn't your typical by-the-book comic book movie.
The effects are great, and the acting is top-notch. The studio could easily have created an entire universe around Hancock and his kind. If you love superhero movies, this one is definitely worth a look.",Hancock
251,Millennialprince,Hancock is a mixed bag with an interesting premise.,7,16 August 2017,"Hancock is a mixed bag with an interesting premise. It was released back in 2008, during the whole superhero resurgence with films such as Iron Man and The Dark Knight that were both well received both commercially and financially. Of course, now in 2017 superhero movies are pretty much a cottage industry, with some feeling there's an over-saturation, but that's neither here or there. Hancock is about an alcoholic superhero with a big PR problem. He's rude, crass, and he's an alcoholic, and it goes without saying the public doesn't like him. Hancock saves Ray, a PR agent and after that, the movie takes off. Ray wants to repackage him as a better superhero and they develop a friendship of sorts as the movie goes along. Hancock's first act is rather brilliant, it plays almost like a David Chappelle skit with Hancock involved in all kinds of crazy shenanigans. Alas, the movie kind of falls apart under the weight of its own mythology in the second act. There are some interesting things at play with the mythology but the tones from the first two acts never feel organic, it almost felt like it was trying to be two different films. The first act felt like a satire on the superhero genre and the second act felt like a darker superhero film. Anyway I digress, the third act is rather underwhelming with a cookie cutter villain who has no presence whatsoever, it almost felt like they needed to throw in a villain just to wrap the film up . However, that's not to say that the film doesn't have any positives. Will Smith is great as Hancock, he gives the character gravitas underneath all his smugness. Hancock starts out as a rather unlikable character but as the story goes on they do a good job of humanizing him. Jason Bateman is great as Ray, and Charlize Theron is great as Ray's wife, Mary. To give anything else away would spoil the film. I guess this movie is worth a rental if you haven't seen it already. By the way, for you Breaking Bad fans out there, the script to Hancock was co-written by Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan. So I guess it's kind of cool to see his earlier work from back in the day. Hancock had its moments, but overall it's a mixed bag both as a comedy and a superhero film.",Hancock
252,blackasp98,Loved it,10,9 July 2008,"This was will smiths better films since i am legend. The remake of i am legend comes from the omega man, and it didn't do will smith justice at all. This did how ever, using a bad mannered super hero who stays drunk most of the time other than trying to have the world made a better place. Realizing he has a past of some kind, stemming possibly more than ten thousand years, where he understands in a small way that he is one among another who is the only deity left in existence. His people were born i guess you could say gods at a time where gods roamed the earth, with far reaching powers we only dream of. But each one has to be paired with another to have them mortal so they can live through the times of ages. But if one becomes separated from the other they succumb to the most awesome powers which keeps them alive for eons. But if they return to one another they are mortal again. This was a rather unique and interesting look into the lives of superheros where they have weaknesses like everyone else. I loved the special effects and how john Hancock's can suddenly feel and know that there are people who keep superheros alive and well in their hearts. I loved the comic aspect and the puns which made it more human than anything else. Hopefully there may be another john Hancock's film in the works.",Hancock
253,CagedinSanity,Um. Hmm.,5,14 December 2008,"Being a 5/10, it wasn't -terrible-. Maybe worth a watch. On Rent. Or discount.It starts as a wonderfully decent idea. The trailers give the cut-scene of Will Smith's character, Hancock going ""Do I look like I care what people think?"" giving the anti-hero premise which isn't original but not overused, either. Hanock is no Punisher. So it's an idea that could have worked.And does, the first part of the film. It gives a somewhat humorous scene where he impales cars, lands in violent ways, and stops a train in an unnecessary manner. The list goes on. Even on the train scene, the writers were clever enough to address in the film what the audience probably would have thought anyway ""Yea, sure... he could have just, y'know, lifted the car instead of.. crashing the train, but I'm alive!"" (Don't quote me on that, it's been a while).The villains do fine in their position in a realistic plan for revenge, except it's hard to say how they knew where Hancock was and how they knew he was vulnerable at that particular time.It had a lot of humorous points but sadly, most of them were shoved into the trailers. The first time he was in a suit and saving cops, his ""you're a very attractive woman"" spiel gave me a good laugh. The other, throwing the kid (almost in space) was a little funny.There are two points where the movie falters.The first, he tried to become acceptable a little too quickly. Sure, we don't know -exactly- how much time the man was giving his ""don't be an a$$hole"" lessons, which is unfair in itself. It seemed, somehow, this one guys words were able to infiltrate Hancocks ""not giving a damn"" mindset and suddenly he wants to help the police and mess. They needed to develop that.Incoming spoiler.Secondly, as many of the reviews that gave it a low rating already stated, the end-ish part. What really angered me was the woman who suddenly went into this emo-goth-mom look that was extremely unbelievable. Seriously, was that eyeshadow really necessary? No, it was not.Other than that, the ""closer you are to me the more vulnerable you are"" weakness and limitation I can see being exploited in a comic book version or sequel to this movie... An interesting weakness I must say.A solid 5/10.",Hancock

This is a hilarious movie and for all Will Smith fans GO WATCH THIS MOVIE. I loved it, intense violence and a little surprise at the end. This is a funny movie, I loved the bit when Hancock is in prison and he sticks a man's head up another man's as*. Proper funny and the suspense between Hancock and the lady who is another one of his kind is great. This movie deserves a good 10/10 for comedy and 10/10 for intense violence.

255,ryshpr,A fun night in.,6,4 March 2010,"Hancock is quite simply Will Smith's best comedy film since 1997's Men In Black (we'll ignore MIB:II). As the title suggests, the film follows Hancock, an alcoholic 'superhero' living in Los Angeles who causes nothing but trouble and unnecessary damage whilst saving lives.Hancock isn't your typical superhero movie and wasn't what I expected in most aspects. Although it's not exactly a huge budget movie based on a Marvel or DC Comics character (Spiderman 3 had a budget $58million more than Hancock) the special effects aren't too bad, with the exception of the computer generated fight, it's just too obviously CGI.At the risk of sounding offensive, Will Smith is brilliant at playing a rude and obnoxious character. He pulls of the 'a**ehole' character pretty well. Writers Vincent Ngo and Vince Gilligan really know how to create a 3D character that the audience genuinely cares about.Although it does start to drag on a little towards the end, it really keeps you interested right up until the end credits start to roll. It's laugh out loud funny at times, the twist is brilliant and there's even a little tribute to Superman in there, if you can spot it.Watch it, it's a fun night in.http://ukmore.tk/",Hancock

But this?! What in the name is this all about?! Why did anyone gave money for this to be made? It is supposed to bring sort of fresh look at superhero movies. Maybe on a paper it all makes sense but choosing Will as main actor, that is where things went wrong. Heck Will acts same in every movie. That separates good actors from bad ones in a first place. If you wish to explore new concept in a movie you have to bring in actor that can carry that concept damn excellent, otherwise it will just ruin it like in this movie.To be fair Will is not only thing wrong here. Jason Bateman is also so irritating beyond description.Only thing fairly good are CGI effects.Rest is utter crap.",Hancock
258,michaellaing71,Hancock is a surprisingly good film,7,11 July 2008,"After seeing the reviews I didn't expect much from the film. But I was pleasantly surprised. The film starts off well with some silly action. I think people wanted to see an out and out comedy which lots of action. But the film tries to be more intelligent than that which some people might feel is boring. I could never see the film doing anything other than ending up as a hero flick and it fill that right to do that to me.Will smith is good as Hancock, with the supporting cast Charlize Theron and Jason Bateman filling there roles admirably. The special effects are a mixed bag with some good stuff, the flying effects when Hancock are drunk do look very computer generated. The editing is OK, pretty standard fair as is the directing.Overall quite a good film which wasn't what I was expecting.",Hancock
259,vhs1999,An average superhero flick,6,4 July 2008,"The last few will smith films have really been flops, his newer films just seem to be no depth and no real story to it. Hancock was just an over the cgi film with nothing that we haven't already seen before, From a shootout in a bank to a crash up of cars on the highway, the jokes are like 20 years old and to see people laughing at the same things as before is just disgusting. This is just another piece of crap that Hollywood have brought out that is a poor excuse for a movie, remember superman iv with Christopher reeves now that was a great movie and they didn't have a big budget and they didn't go over board with the special effects and even batman begins was really good and there again they made the movie right with little cgi effects and more just old fashioned filming. They only thing the movie had going for it was Jason bateman's role, he was the only real character in the film everyone else just seemed like a cardboard cutout. This film seems to be made like most other Hollywood films these days and that its target audience is the younger generation, in which the should make a film that targets all people an not just the young ones.If you were smart you would wait for the DVD or even wait for it to air on television.",Hancock

Please don't covet your friend's wife. I mean Hancock had no idea that Charlize's character was his wife and he was already eyeballing her. I feel that cheapens the character and made him increasingly unlikable and as if it was tested and frowned upon, a rush edit to the plot came up, she was his wife after all so that made everything ok.Plus Will Smith and Charlize Theron ZERO chemistry. Cannot believe for one second that they were immortals in love. Siblings yes that is actually more believable.",Hancock
261,Exeron,Hancock,7,19 July 2008,"It's been a lot of discussion about the movie here on IMDb, but most of it isn't about the movie...it's about Will Smith's personal life. So to all those who cares more about Will Smith's personal life and faith are going to be disappointed because i'm not going to bring that up...Hancock My expectations? Were not high but not that low either, i expected a few laughs but nothing impressing. Turns out that i was wrong, i laughed more than a few times and the movie was in some ways pretty impressing.How? With the fact that they managed to create a perfect mix of three different genre's Comedy,Action And Drama...In the beginning i thought ""Here we go again. Another top box office, lame comedy. But later into the movie it really got more interesting, the jokes were pretty well written, the actings were decent but at least they weren't horrible.Then later on came the part i wasn't to happy about, the drama part...it became too much...in my opinion it didn't fit in there at all. Maybe this is just me, but i think that if the movie would have continued the way it had been until the later part, it definitely would have got higher ratings...Hancock is a film including funny comics and some decent drama parts, i'd never thought this but the original score wasn't pretty bad. So there for, Hancock gets a 7.5/10, it's worth the money...and drop all that scientology crap and give it a shot",Hancock
262,on_the_can,Good Flick...bad marketing.,6,8 April 2009,"Hancock is the product of two very strong ideas that don't quite mesh as well as it's creators likely hoped. The first idea is that of an alcoholic superhero who only saves lives due to some natural compulsion that he can't fight but otherwise cares nothing for anybody. The other idea is a gritty realistic look at what life as a superhero would be like. The emphasis of the story is the latter, while the previews imply the former.The first half of the movie plays out similarly to a super powered bad Santa...making for some very good and unique laughs. As Hancock attempts to clean up his act though things take a much darker turn and we learn that Hancock does in fact have a heart and it's broken.If Super powers really did exist in this extremity Hancock's plot would likely be a pretty good representation of it's pitfalls. The guy's lonely as all hell, he drinks, he costs millions in property damage for every act of heroics. This is something different that we've never seen, Spider-man's not always loved by everyone he saves but at least he was never handed a bill for breaking a window.Despite a good box office return I think feelings of the movie from it's general audience were only Luke warm but I think it will appreciate in value as time goes on. It's a superhero drama with a very interesting and original plot, it's just too bad it was marketed as a superhero action comedy. A stronger villain would've have helped to inject more action into the movie and possibly would have made everybody happy...the movie is a little slow but I've seen it a couple times and it's already grown more on me. I urge everybody to give a chance...even if it's a second one.",Hancock

On the surface, that's what this appears to be, but as the story progresses it becomes apparent that the heroism is secondary to the story and it's actually a love story. I'm not here to spoil the movie for anyone, but many will understand the concept of two people who seem destined for one another, but when together, they're weaker than when they're apart, leaving them one option - show their love by distancing themselves.

Yes, there are plenty of sarcastic one-liners and humorous moments. But Hancock, for all his drunken boorishness, is (shed a tear) lonely.Hancock has super-powers of strength, speed, and resistance to bullets, but he is also a drunken, rude, sweaty mess. And every time he helps someone, he manages to mess things up. Either he costs the citizens thousands in tax dollars for city damages or he insults somebody. And his breath stinks, taboot! Then a soft-hearted guy with a nice suit gets saved by Hancock one day. He witnesses the anger people display afterwords and decides, gee, maybe Hancock needs a face-lift. He's a PR man, and he wants to give Hancock a new image. He brings Hancock home for dinner (it's spaghetti madness night) and exhibits the same attitude towards Hancock as one would a puppy that is destroying your shoes. Can't we keep him, hon? His son loves Hancock immediately, but the wifey seem like she's not impressed. His plan is simple: get Hancock sequestered in prison so that people will miss him.

Decides he owes it to Hancock to change his image and make this town need him and treat him like a real superhero, and what happens is a mix of comedy/action.My Spiel: I am a big fan of Will Smith, I like about everyone of his movies (except Wild Wild West). I really liked Will Smith with his witty acting making this movie have some truly funny parts from the beginning with drunken Hancock trying to do the right thing but screws it up no matter what he does. But then near the end I kind of lost interest and mainly wanted it to go a different route. Granted there were plot twists from a friend from the past revealing Hancock's past. Which was a lot to take in, in such a short notice. Then out of the blue a not so spectacular villain for Hancock to really care or truly worry about, but with the new found weakness of Hancock's which was a little convenient to make the villain able to hurt him and make us feel that Hancock should be in trouble. This all was just a little to coincidental that's all I'm saying!

The whole situation between Smith and Theron would have been okay had it not been so weird. Maybe they could have known each other in the line of duty..i'll buy it..but going back 3000 years?

The acting was standard for this type of film. Even Jason Bateman was pretty good for his role, although a total surprise for casting. Charlize Theron is wonderful for the eyes while she is also a good actress. The ads were funny.Then the dialogue started.Alright, can someone tell me what is so funny about hearing the phrase ""A**H*LE"" all those times in one movie? That doesn't even count all the other offensive and foul language that ran throughout the movie. At least the phrase (Crazy!) that flipped Mary's switch was one you could say in mixed company! They couldn't even show one of the scenes from the movie for their commercials without reediting the dialogue. Remember the spot that has the neighborhood bully calling Hancock a ""jerk""? Hancock gets up close and says ""Call me a jerk just one more time!"", which the child does. Hancock proceeds to throw him high into the air, getting more hang time than Isaiah Ryder ever did. When the boy comes back down, Hancock catches him. Remember that? Guess what! In the movie, it never happened that way. The bully never called Hancock a ""jerk"". He called him the ever-present ""A**H*Le"". They had to reedit the dialogue to make it presentable for TV. In the process, they lied to parents who might have decided not to expose their children to the language HAD THEY KNOWN IT WAS THROUGHOUT THE FILM.Suffice it to say that the film was riddle with this, and even more offensive, language.

The 1st half was very well done, both funny and believable, but once the dramatics started up in the 2nd half, with Hancock's backstory and twist, it became ridiculous. While the backstory was somewhat tolerable, the twist was not very well done. It felt incomplete and rushed like the writers wanted to do something far more with the story but they had ran out of ideas/time and decided to slap something on at the end. Once again, Will Smith is well, Will Smith. While he does a commendable job as always, much like his last venture, I Am Legend, he is once again letdown by an under developed script. Overall, Hancock wasn't a terrible film by any means, but it could have been so much more than what it ended up being, another mediocre superhero film.",Hancock

Wilsson as a superhero that is a complete jackass! Comon! That cant be a turkey right? At least its gotta have some great scenes buried within. Right? Unfurtanatly, not. It certainly has its share of interesting aspects, with the story and premise, and after a start, it neither felt very good, and neither that terribly, and i was just waiting for things to kick up a notch. It just descends. One of the most annoying things about this flick is that i cant quite understand why it doesn't work. Maybe because Wilssons so intentionally outrageous character comes of as flat. Its at most mildly entertaining, mostly just bothersome. I think i start to doubt him as an actor. He tries hard and is mostly i likable fellow, but he seems to have a problem with fleshing his characters out, its all well in flicks like Independence Day but when he is supposed to be Ali ( as in that other film) or Hancock he fails miserably. Or maybe its the director who messed up and couldn't use him rightly. I honestly started to blank out by the end of the film because it all felt like such a unlikeable and boring mess, so its hard to comment on the directing of it, but it was probably both the directing AND the plot that faulted here. Its DOES try to shake up things and bring in a serious tone but like everything here it just felt gimmicky.",Hancock

However half-way through a plot twist comes your way and if you are paying attention, you see it coming. Then before you know it the film ends rather abruptly. Will Smith is gold as usual. He doesn't play his charming all-American good guy. Think more about Dr. House than Superman.I wanted more from the film because I like the initial concept.

Villain :- Self loathing, self doubt, self abuse, lack of respect and understanding of what his heavy handedness was causing etc. and the victory over these villains is that someone believes in the super guy. To all those who made negative comments such as ""Lacks a villain"", you are stuck in a rut, and thinking like yours hobbles Hollywood from being brave to think outside the tiny plastic mold you create.

If you like Will Smith you will like this film period! What I like about Will Smith is that you are never really sure what type of film he is going to come out with. I suppose he has made some turkeys and has tried his hand at some serious stuff e.g. Ali, & The Pursuit of Happiness; but when it comes down to it, his best work is action with a pinch of comedy.This film has two definite sides to it, the second part catches you a little off guard although the clues are there if you watch carefully. The anti superhero with a drinking problem is an angle which is not often explored, Smith gives it his brand of humour and it works well.Act two of this film seems to be getting bashed rather a lot throughout many of the reviews I have read, although I think this is a little unjustified! It seems more plausible to me that if there is one person with superhuman abilities, it stands to reason there would be others with this capability also.Will Smith is big box office, he has charisma in spades and can just about carry any script in front of him at the moment.

275,supramaxx,Hancock Movie Review,7,3 July 2008,"Hancock Movie Review Category: Action/Adventure/Superhero/Parody I was really excited and intrigued after seeing the previews for Hancock, starring Will Smith. It seemed like such an original concept, an antihero who everyone hates trying to redeem himself to the masses by going straight and looking good. But a mysterious menace looms for this superhero, called John Hancock. I admit I thought this move was going to be original, but not so original and weird to the point of excess.The Good: Will Smiths acting is a constant, you know thats going to be good regardless of the film. The special effects were also amazing and really intriguing, it really meshed well with the action sequences. This is also the first movie in which YouTube.com was seen so frequentely which I guess its a good thing. The various spurts of comedy were also really funny and welcomed. But the real good qualities of this movie ends here. Oh yeah and Charlize Theron looks super HOT! The Bad: So Original and Weird to the point of being a turnoff. The Script and Storyline needed some work, I don't know if the screenwriters overcomplicated the movie purposely, but the whole love story behind the movie to me was sort of unnecessary and stupid. There are a lot of questions to Hancocks origin that were not answered. As well as the behavior of the people in this fictitious Los Angeles, which was also sort of strange in a ""Last Action Hero"" sort of way. Jason Batemans character, Ray, had a too large part in this movie as well. It seems like the script was worked and rewritten various times and the end result was far from perfect which detracts lots of the movies enjoyability. The enemies of Hancock were also very spontaneous and were not well explained.The Ugly: Well, when you literally see BIG BOB in prison with a head shoved up his ass. LOL.Conclusion: Hancock is a great movie, to watch at the movies for the fantastic action sequences and special effects, as well as the comical moments of the movie. But the movie itself is too complicated and leaves many questions unanswered. The dialogue is really bad at times and I didn't know whether to take this movie seriously or not. But in the end I enjoyed even with the various downfalls, just because its Will Smith and the action was so good.Is it worth renting or buying or neither? Renting it once a year would be sufficientSupra Score: 6.5/10",Hancock
276,ihatespike,Flawed Hero? Try unlikable walking-disaster.,1,21 December 2011,"I'd like to think that Hollywood's greed is tempered with genuine talent a fair deal of the time, as well as some messages that people were passionate about enough to present to us cinematically.And then there are movies like Hancock, wherein there is no message worth telling, and all the talent involved is beaten into submission by an oppressively useless script and the greedy leeches who produced it.Hancock is about a guy with superpowers (Will Smith) who essentially walks around looking like he's got a mouthful of rat poison and sour patch kids, being so inept at helping people that it feels like a Jerry Lewis movie if Jerry Lewis had superpowers and was utterly unlikable and unsympathetic. Jason Bateman plays Jason Bateman, a man who becomes Hancock's agent of sorts after Hancock manages to save his life in the most destructive way possible (because apparently seeing terroristic levels of destruction perpetrated almost nonstop by Mr. Sourface is uproarious). We also see Charlize Theron as she stands there having no chemistry with her fiancé (Bateman), and even less with Hancock, who she has a past with (and by past I mean a few incoherent sentences of wooden dialogue tossed out with no explanation). Long story short: Hancock manages to reign in his awfulness somewhat with the help of Bateman and his 2-dimensional nice-guy personality. Eddie Marsan stains his otherwise likable filmography by playing a bad guy who is bad (wow, what depth) in this sorry excuse for a film, tasteless attempts at humor are made in the form of bully children being tossed hundreds of feet in the air, a bad guy's hand getting chopped off with a metal disk, buildings getting smashed in half (by the 'good' guys, no less) and countless other wastes of cgi destruction that happen under the pretense of humor.Nothing was proved. Nobody cared.",Hancock
277,willhaskew,"Hancock vs. Inadequacy, drugs, booze and ultimately himself",6,7 August 2015,"This movie could've been better, and with the lack of a strong second act it just ends up being slightly above average. The opening scene with Hancock drunkenly waking up from a bender after a kid informs him of a shootout between cops and Asian gang members during a high speed pursuit sets the tone for the style of crime fighting Hancock undertakes. Before leaving his park bench, he gropes at a random woman and grabs his liquor to go take on the bad guys. He does stop the gang members but not without causing a huge amount of collateral damage to buildings, roads and presumably injuries to people unlucky enough to be caught in his drunken highway showdown. Hancock meets Ray Embry, a corporate image consultant, when he saves Ray from a collision from an oncoming train at a railroad crossing. Hancock tosses Ray's car upside down to get it off the tracks and derails the train as well. Hancock is invited by a grateful Ray back to his house for dinner, where he meets Ray's wife and son. He is slowly convinced by Ray to turn himself into the police to stand trial for the collateral damage caused by his heroics. Hancock goes to a maximum security lockup with the assumption that crime will escalate quickly enough for Los Angeles to want Hancock released. He slowly sobers and is released to help police confront a group of heavily armed bank robbers and rescue a wounded officer. The second act deals with the origin of Hancock's powers and the attempts by one of the former bank robbers and several other inmates placed in jail by Hancock to get revenge. It descends into a maelstrom of CGI-crafted battles and a vague mythological origin to compensate for lack of a decent back story. The idea of a superhero with struggling with alcoholism and rehabilitating his image sounds but this suffers suffers from weak character development and some shoddy acting from Charlize Theron. Will Smith is good as Hancock, but that isn't saying much since he just seems either exhausted/hungover or emotionally distant through most of the movie. Jason Bateman gives a good performance as the nice guy trying to do a friend a favor, and this is considering he's usually the straight guy in these Frat Pack movies lately.",Hancock
278,darlybrito,"Hancock, Bad Guys",8,9 October 2008,"Hancock, Hancock, I wasn't expecting a lot from this movie. In fact, I wasn't even planning to see the movie, but the mall was so boring that I decided to the flick anyways. When I saw the trailer, I thought it looked like a fun summer movie. There was nothing really amazing or intriguing about the movie.Hancock is a superhero, but a very different one. He is always drinking and the public hates him so much. When bad guys are on the loose or people's life is in danger, he gets the job done, but not without leaving a big mess behind. The thing is that Hancock doesn't care what people think about him, the public had have enough of this guy rude behavior. His life suddenly changes when one day he saves the life of Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman), a PR executive. With the help of Embrey, Hancock starts realizing he may have a side he hasn't seen and the side that the public really need.At first, things going smooth in the story, but then there is a twist in the movie that I thought the director could off done better. I thought it took a while to fully explain everything in the movie. I was getting a little confused when they were trying to pick up after the twist, but I understood everything at the end.I really liked Will Smith as Hancock. I loved the character and Will Smith did a great job. It wasn't his best performance, but a great one. Jason Bateman was a good choice to play Ray Embrey. I think he did a fine job acting. There were some scenes that he was trying to be humorous, but it didn't worked that well. And there was Charlize Theron, which I thought was great as Mary Embrey.Hancock has good action scenes and good enough special effects. The movie wasn't really action packed; it was just an average action movie. The special effects were believable, but not realistic. To me, they didn't look as really as other blockbuster films. But that doesn't mean I didn't liked them, I'm so saying they could off been better.Hancock was a good superhero movie. The only problem that I had was the twist. If it wasn't for that, I would off give the movie a better rating. The movie has good humor, action, and special effects. It wasn't the best superhero film, but a good popcorn summer flick.",Hancock
279,carlabrams,Quite a decent movie - and completely lacking Stan Lee,8,9 July 2008,"SPOILERS AHEAD! BE WARNED! Okay, that's out of the way.John Hancock - played quite aptly by Will Smith - is a superhero with a problem. He's anti-social, rather apathetic to how people feel about him, and quite frankly has seen better days. For all that, he's still got the desire to fight crime, criminals, and be the good guy.Ray Embrey - played by Jason Bateman - is an idealistic ad man. He wants to make a difference in the world.Mary Embrey - played wonderfully by Charlize Theron - seems to be the perfect housewife. She's quite happy with her life, her family - and for some reason has real issues with Hancock.Aaron Embrey - Jae Head - is the son of Mary and Ray, and thinks that Hancock is neat.This is not your typical Marvel or DC comic adaptation. It's also not quite the funny comedy that a lot of people apparently thought it was supposed to be. Oh, it starts out quite funny. You've seen part of the opening in trailers - criminals running from the police, shooting at them. A kid wakes up a drunken Hancock, who then 'saves' the day, while in the meantime causing millions of dollars in property damage. (Which is something that was NEVER addressed in Fantastic Four, Superman, Spiderman, or ANY other superhero movie - which is one reason I liked this movie!) Ray has a positive attitude towards life, and believes in the best part of people. While stuck on train tracks in traffic, Hancock saves his life (and causes millions MORE in property damage - nice train wreck). Hancock takes Ray home, and Ray invites him in. Mary is QUITE displeased to see Hancock - yet you can tell that there's something going on with her about him.You find out that Hancock isn't really his name - someone told him to put his John Hancock on a form, and that's what he thought his name was, so he's been going by that ever since. Ray decides, since he's indebted to Hancock and that since advertising is supposed to be his game - he should help Hancock with his image.Of course, going to jail, coming out, becoming a costumed hero and actually getting recognition from the public and police for being the good guy is all well and good. This seems to really be turning Hancock around - and that's when the movie changes from being a comedy about a superhero to being a tragic love story.I'm not going to spoil the ending - but just when you think that the clash between a second super-hero and Hancock is going to be comedy also - you realize that actually, this wasn't really a comedy at all. It's a love story that has, quite literally, spanned thousands of years. One that, for there to be a happy ending, has to remain unrequited - because otherwise all involved will die.Oh, and don't leave right when the credits start - there's an extra scene set in Hancocks new home of New York.",Hancock
280,Grant_Price,Will Smith suddenly hates the public and gives us Hancock.,3,5 July 2008,"It turns out that the new Will Smith Summer extravaganza 'Hancock' is actually two films spliced together with all the finesse and care of Dr Joseph Mengele. Half of the 92 minute runtime is a promisingly original concept concerning an ""only one of his kind"" superhero alienated from the rest of society and existing only as a recluse who occasionally shows up in Los Angeles to save its hapless inhabitants. The problem lies in the fact that Hancock frequently conducts his superhero-ing whilst under the influence of a bottle of Jim Beam or two and thus often causes more havoc than he prevents. One sterling example the movie presents early on is when, upon having his sunglasses destroyed by a car full of criminals, Hancock effortlessly lifts the car up and skewers it like an olive on the spire of a nearby skyscraper. Events like this lead to public outcry and Hancock's semi-voluntary incarceration after striking a deal with public relations man Jason Bateman, who vows to help him change his ways after the Übermensch saves his life. Seemingly, the remainder of the film would therefore consist of Hancock's gradual path to redemption, winning back the admiration of the public and possibly experiencing a climactic 'Boss Battle' where Hancock learns some kind of important moral. Although not a particularly groundbreaking road to take and particularly wasteful of the idea of what it could mean to 'play God,' 'Hancock' would remain an interesting little package. Instead, at around the one hour mark, director Peter Berg inflicts a whiplash-inducing U-turn on the audience and embarks on a totally different story arc. Does this mean that it is less predictable? No. Does it mean that Berg destroys the film in much the same way that Robert Rodriguez did with 'From Dusk Till Dawn?' Yes.It is difficult to analyse anything about 'Hancock' without relating it to the second half of the movie, like Will Smith's performance for example. It isn't possible to abhor Will Smith. He exists in the collective unconscious of the world's population as one of the coolest and most likable actors around. The second half of 'Hancock' tries its hardest to change this preconception. Willard (yeah, Tonight With Jonathan Ross IS informative) must have known that the movie couldn't work when he read the script for it, so why did he agree to do it? Does he hate us? He seems to be sleepwalking through much of the film, the antithesis of his role in 'I Am Legend' earlier this year. Also, something I've noticed more and more in the past couple of year is the use of the ""Will Smith Patented Sad Puppy Eyeballs Look"" for whenever Will has to convey a heartfelt emotion. He does it the most in 'The Pursuit of Happiness' but 'Hancock' receives its fair share too. And why is he pouting so much? Constipation, probably.Jason Bateman and Charlize Theron are pretty much the only other characters in 'Hancock,' unless you want to acknowledge the existence of Eddie Marsan as the thoroughly mismatched antagonist, which I don't. He is about as good at acting as Shane Ryder is at singing. Even if 'Hancock' wasn't a mess already, he would totally ruin it. Luckily for him it sucks, which means he merely makes any scene he is in unwatchable. Bateman on the other hand mellifluously occupies space and does nothing more, although you can't help feeling sorry for him around two-thirds of the way through. Considering Charlize Theron's character is responsible for the abrupt twist (well not really, the writers are), it is difficult not to hate her. So don't even try. Just loathe every moment she spends talking, eating, moving or just breathing. It will make you feel better.Just because 'Hancock' features the irrefutable king of the blockbuster does not mean that it is good. At one point our hero asks ""Do I look like I care what people think?"" Clearly, nobody involved in the making of this fiasco does at all.",Hancock
281,piverba,Hancock symbolism - there is no bad film if you attempt interpret it,5,17 August 2008,"This is a story of a bored demigod (Will Smith) who, for unknown reason, acts as a policeman, sort of. His rescue operations cause as much damage as a potential good. In the process, people get killed and property destroyed on the grand scale. The problem with Hancock is mostly related to his image  he already does good but is under-appreciated because he does not make everyone around him feel good (see the difference between 'do good' and 'feel-good'), rather he ensures that bad guys' butts and heads are connected in a convoluted configurations, a device invented especially for this 'moving pictures'. This is another way to ensure that we get the power of the guy  flying and kicking ass is one thing, but sticking a fellow's head in another fellow's butt is quite another, requiring a certain degree of previously unbeknownst sophistication. Having established the need for improvements in our hero's image, a PR man is introduced. And of course, you guessed it, it happened to be very decent PR man. He wants to shower humanity with goodness also because of some unknown to us reasons  may be it makes him feel good, or maybe he was told by Jesus to do so. Hancock saves the PR man and he, in gratitude, starts working on hero's image. They devise a plan by which Hancock voluntarily removes himself from society by going to jail (yes, this is how one is removed from society). Now, people are made to understand, how it is without our hero. Crime's up 30% and Hancock is recalled to save, now grateful, humanity.It just feels that something is missing  the plot requires more action. It turns out that PR man's wife happens also to be a demigod, who used to be married to our hero, but had to distance herself from him because it was lethal for both of them. You see, they both loose powers in each other presence, they are poison for each other, a mutual kryptonite. You know, this thing happen to some powerful couples, who can not decide who bring home the bacon. So, the she-hero stays with the PR man, while Hancock will continue saving the world. In the mean time, we, in the comfort of our entertainment facilities, experience the sublime, safely and without any danger to our health. Do we get entertained? Do we get our money worth? Does this film relax us? For god's sake, should we see this film or not?Let me answer the big questions in the following way. Suppose we view Hancock as a symbol, for example, as US of A. The US saves the world by acting as world policeman; unilaterally exercising its power, flying hither and dither (think Afghanistan, Iraq). US sticks bad guy's heads into bad guy's butts (think Abu Ghraib). The damage US inflicts onto 'rogue' nations, lost human lives are weighed against the potential good. Meanwhile, we experience the sublime on TV projected by CNN, comfortably resting on sofas and lazy-boy chairs with popcorn and beer. I think, Vincent Ngo and Vince Gilligan could do much better with their plot by simply following major event of the latest US wars, using US = Hancock symbolism. And Will Smith? - yes, camera loves him. But for me, it is a memory of Six Degrees of Separation that beacons me to the movie theater to see his performances. It is regrettable, that after amassing such personal success, wealth and authority, he produces such low grade output. But I keep hoping and he's not the worst that Hollywood can offer. Now, to answer the big question  Do I regret seeing this film? The answer is no; and not because of the film itself, not because its entertainment value, nor because it made me better or relaxed me and helped me to get through the day. Rather because of the polemic energy it gave me to write this note and share it with others. Now I can be, vicariously, a super-hero, better than Hancock, flying high in my imagination, having this discussion with Will Smith himself on the public forum, dispensing him my free advice. This is real power. And as to my vicarious experience and the lack of real super-powers - perhaps this is a good thing.",Hancock
282,asgard-5,I almost felt 90s came back.,7,11 August 2008,"This film starring Will Smith is somewhat a treat for a pair, who find themselves in a movie theater not knowing what movie to see. It's a superhero movie that doesn't treat you like a brainless faceless nobody. It has a classic story with an original touch, it has its twists and all. Better yet, it's very well balanced. The modern age of commercial cinema left it's imprint on the look of ""Hancock"" as well, with the action shot earthquake-shaky, with abundance of CGI, with mild to no character development, although most of it, if not all, works in film's favor. This movie had more soul than most of what I'd seen this year, X-files 2 & Rambo 4 included. But it becomes way too rare that a Hollywood movie can be as entertaining as, say, it'd been ten years ago. I'd say ""Hancock"" is close to a Hollywood's take on Talashi Miike's ""Zebra Man"".

283,SlackerRus2000,Every Hero has their fatal flaw,6,7 July 2008,"Batman is the ""Dark Knight"" because he is what he fears and what he wants his enemies to fear a bat. This unique spin creates a dark superhero rare in comics. Spiderman has the tag line, "" with great power comes great responsibility."" He continually grapples with this throughout the comics, its what makes him likable. My point here is, every superhero has unique emotional attributes that help contribute to their mystique and popularity. Then there's Hancock.Hancock is a great idea, a fowl-mouth, drunk, politically incorrect superhero. And it makes senses, it must be hard to be all alone and really I'm sure collateral damage is sometimes hard to avoid as we've learned from The Incredibles. All in all the premise is great and some-what shocking. The tone was definitely more R than PG in parts, but it was enjoyable none the less.The problem is once Hancock starts getting into the groove of becoming his own brand of superhero like the greats I listed earlier, it starts to veer of into an unexpected and unwelcome twist.The main problem with the twist is it fails to flesh out the basis of Hancock's character and his unique superhero identity, basically him being an asshole. If they had continued to make it more comical than emotional I could have easily enjoyed the twist. Instead it throws on tons of throwaway background dialog and emotional tripe that doesn't belong unless its coupled with Hancocks trademark toilet humor, which it is not.Too many people are being caught up on the twist, but the twist isn't the problem the problem is the emotional weight of the twist is not coupled with the enigmatic humor that precipitated it and made Hancock's initial 45 minutes so enjoyable.I don't hate this movie. Not at all, it is good, but not great. There are definitely better comic movies out this summer. Pretty much all of them, ( Wanted, The Hulk, Iron Man.) But, it isn't a bad movie either and it is enjoyable to watch, it just has me scratching my head. Is Hancock's fatal flaw his toilet-humor attitude, or his lack of storytelling chops.",Hancock

I'm not going to talk about the stars or the effects, this comment is only regarding the story.This might have worked as a TV series, or perhaps it just needed a couple more years in script development to pull it off. The twist mid-way-ish felt like there was a tonne of exposition that had been held back from the audience to catch up on. I normally wouldn't mind that but because the subject matter was fantasy, the explanation felt long, forced and disconnected from the story we had been watching. If it was a TV series then perhaps these plot elements could have been set up long before in earlier episodes. It might have worked as a film if it was an established superhero character. But to just start listing the rules to the universe midway through a film, for a character we are only just beginning to know, just didn't work. Maybe if they had spent the first half setting up Hancock's search for answers it may have worked, but that would have probably made everything too obvious. In fact they probably hurt it by having a plot twist at all. The character Hancock generated enough sympathy that if we'd known the truth we would have kept watching and waiting for him to find out. I'm not really sure what holding back all that information did for the plot (except create the need for a large amount of exposition in the middle of the film).There were probably a few people who felt a little uncomfortable over the romance element. I did too, but I would have forgiven it if there was a point to it, and I believe there was, I just don't think it was expressed well enough to make an impact.Anyway, nice try, and thanks for trying something a little more original. I really appreciate they tried to make something a little different but unfortunately it just didn't work in the end.",Hancock

Even with three strong performances, the film collapses from its' poor start and even worse end finale.Will Smith has the title role of Hancock, a one-of-a-kind superhuman who works with the LAPD to catch criminals. Well, at least he is supposed to but he has become an alcoholic to deal with his constant mood of depression, and his inebriated antics have caused millions of dollars in damages to Los Angeles City. All of which has caused him to fallout out of the public's favor. Enter Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman) a PR consultant who wants to help him repair his image. Before long, well actually almost immediately, Hancock agrees, and the two form an unlikely duo. The finale comes rather abruptly with one of the most surprising, confusing finale that is what ultimately ruins Hancock.All three talented stars (Will Smith, Jason Bateman, and Charlize Theron) play their parts entertainingly well, but the story, script, direction, and camera work are what destroy it. The film clocks in at 92 minutes, leaving no time for character development and all the events happen so quickly and abruptly that it feels like an extended TV episodes with gazillion-dollar effects.Another thing that I found particularly annoying was this constant ""shaky"", close-ups of who ever was in the scene. Almost as if the studio was trying to save money on set design so they kept the camera in really tight.Once again the time and effort was put into wowing the audience with the special effects, which are quite remarkable, rather than entertaining with a strong story and developed characters. I would not even recommend it as brainless entertainment because it was rather boring. I still wonder why someone felt the need to go and create ANOTHER superhero movie.",Hancock

288,jhobdell,Smith is the man!,9,2 July 2008,"I loved this film! As you can see, 9/10 is good and it's not far off a 10. The only let down, for me, was the lack of development. There was lots of potential, but the film was kept short (perhaps rightly so) and some of the ideas just didn't flourish as they might have.That said, Smith's on screen presence is undeniable, and there was some great chemistry between he and Theron. Bateman was clearly the main comic relief and was great with it, but Smith has some brilliant comic lines too, especially early on. I totally didn't see the main plot twist coming, and the detail was covered, if (as I said) not fully developed, perhaps.The action scenes are exciting, there are some real 'laugh out loud' moments, and the conclusion of the film is wonderfully bittersweet. It's especially moving to see the truth of Hancock's character coming out: moving from embittered loner to awkward hero/star and Smith pulls it off marvellously.I have a sneaking suspicion there may be a sequel, but perhaps that's just wishful thinking!",Hancock
289,Searsino,Great Original Superhero Flick (Hidden Gem),8,21 January 2017,"I'm amazed this scored so low! Whether you like Will Smith or not, this has everything you could ask for.Some notes for consideration: This was a movie that faced some serious adversity from the beginning.The script for this was written in 1996 which makes the film all the more intriguing knowing just how many directors were cycled through before it finally went into production (11 years later!). The title alone started out as ""Tonight, He Comes"" followed by ""John Hancock"" and then simply ""Hancock"". Even the desired rating of PG-13 was a struggle to acquire, as the MPAA had twice already dubbed it ""R"".But after all was said and done, Hancock took the #1 spot after opening weekend with mixed reviews (41% Rotten Tomatoes, 49% Metacritic)! With a production budget of $150 million it brought in $185.6 million after the opening weekend (worldwide, 5 day weekend).Now on to the actual content:The script is refreshing. Not only are there twists throughout, but they are highly unpredictable and start to expose themselves within the first 30 minutes.The cast consists of Will Smith, Charlize Theron and Jason Bateman whom all demonstrate outstanding performances (as one would expect from them). The humor is believable and not overdone, the drama is the perfect amount leaving you laughing and feeling sorrow throughout.As mentioned before, even if you are not a huge Will Smith fan this will surely be something anyone can enjoy. I am quite puzzled by the general consensus here on IMDb but assure you that the film is much better than the rating would infer.----- 8/10 STARS -------- Review by Searsino -----",Hancock
290,ivymissing,Weird film,6,6 October 2018,The pacing was really off. Will Smith is a great actor but I feel like he just could not carry this film.,Hancock
291,MrPink08,Makes Wild Wild West look Oscar-Worthy,2,1 July 2008,"Wild Wild West was OK, but still Will Smith's worst film. However, Hancock makes Wild Wild West look like I Am Legend. Will Smith lumbers across the screen as a drunken superhero, not looking like he cares at all about doing this film. As far as superhero films go, this one belong in the trash can along with Batman and Robin, the Eric Bana Hulk, and Superman III and IV.Smith plays the title character, who really dosen't care what Los Angeles thinks of him. Kind of like Spider Man, except Hancock seems so reluctant to protect these people. Plus, in Spider Man, it was the media that hated him and the people who love him. Here, it's all hate for Hancock. Enter Jason Bateman, who was pretty much the one redeeming quality about this film. As a ordinary guy who tries to improve Hancock's image, Bateman shines in a (almost) lead role like this. Charlize Theron is cast as his pretty wife, who is given pretty much nothing to do for the first hour, except sulk and complain.The first half hour of this film was all right. It goes upside down when Hancock has to go to jail. There a disgusting scene I won't mention occurs. Next thing you know, Hancock is a changed man, thanks to Bateman. While it was all right the first time, Smith overplays it, and unfortunately becomes downright annoying. Enter an even stupider subplot with Theron, and the films goes down the drain. It's hard for me, a Will Smith fan, to say this, but this film did the impossible: it made Will Smith extremely annoying.",Hancock
292,restin_him,Fun but lost itself,6,22 December 2008,"Hancock (Will Smith) is a superhero, but not your usual hero. We first meet Hancock passed out on a city bench being prodded by a kid to wake up and help the cops. Hancock wakes up, slaps a passing girl on the rear and grabs a bottle of whiskey before flying off to help the police.This gives us a great introduction to this movie showing us what is in-store for us. Hancocks attempts at helping out the people of LA end up causing major damage due to Hancocks lack of tact and his supposed selfish motivations. As expected Hancock is hated by the city officials and most citizens because of his reckless actions. Eventually Hancock saves the life of Ray Embery (Jason Bateman) a PR man trying to use his skills to change the world and failing at it. Ray sees in Hancock a lonely person desiring to do what he thinks is right but finding hate instead of appreciation for his actions. To help Hancock turn public opinion Ray begins to guide Hancock in how to be a better hero.This is a really creative film. It takes the hero film fad out there shows us what it could really look like in our world. The best part is every character is well done with one exception. Will Smith shows us a hero who is just like you and me hiding his confusion and hurt behind his actions and attitude. Bateman is a fun counter to Smith being honest about the stupidity of Hancock in a real caring way. The only person I felt was weak as a character was Charlize Theron as Mary Embery, Rays wife and a mystery for Hancock. I don't know if Theron can really be blamed for her character seeming off however.In the story we get a great setup for seeing a cool growth in Hancock. Theron's character Mary kind of ruins that for us. We learn of a mystery to Hancocks origin and when all is revealed it cheapens a lot of the creative story telling done so far. Mary just doesn't fit into the story that was being created and it feels forced to create the drama around her, Hancock, and Ray that the movie makers obviously want.While this is a major issue with the film it doesn't totally destroy it. The film is fun, witty, and has good action. Even with a big bump in the story Hancock is still a good film and makes some cool insights into the superhero type story.",Hancock
293,TheFireRisesAfterThePlane,Very enjoyable action comedy,6,5 January 2020,"I liked the soundtrack and VFX effects, both were done well and the writing in this movie. We have development, origin story and good action scenes imo. This could have been better with a super villain but it's a good pop corn flick this way I'll rate a 7.5 at least up to 8/10, pretty quick movie and fast paced especially in the first act.",Hancock
294,brendon-kenny,Is it a bird? Is it a plane? Nope. It's sozzled superhero Hancock,6,11 November 2008,"*** This review is courtesy of Fundulgence.com - the One to watch. It also featured on BBC Radio Sheffield, Leeds and York. ***John Hancock (Will Smith) is not your usual superhero. He's an alcoholic, self centred, socially inept, washed-up wino. His bungled attempts at super-heroics, crater-making landing zones and mass vandalism in the line of duty cause more costly damage than the criminals and natural disasters he's sworn to stop. When Hancock rescues a PR executive (played by Juno's Jason Bateman), from certain death, he's offered the opportunity to redeem himself. In complete contrast to the low-life representation that advertising types generally get in the majority of Hollywood movies, Bateman's Ray Emery is the most morally upright, ethically upstanding and commendable PR man committed to celluloid. He offers to re-brand Hancock, making him the respectable, wholesome hero that he clearly has the potential to be.It's a great premise. Hancock has powers comparable to those of Superman, and in this age of every-other-blockbuster being of comic book origins, it's refreshing to accept that these talents are a given, bypassing the usual far-fetched back story that could encumber the tale of comical super-heroism. The film dives straight into the action and flies along at a blistering pace, a trait now inherent with one-to-watch director Peter Berg, who seems to have perfected his intense hand-held style that served him so well during 'the Kingdom' (2007). Hancock is a funny one. Not just in the humorous sense either. Yes, there are head-up-the-ass gags and plenty of cartoon-esquire visual humour (though the best of this has already been seen in the previews and pre-release hype), but there are large amounts of well executed action and even soap style drama to boot. It's also funny, in that it's odd. It's not easily pigeonholed. Contrary to the hype, this isn't a typical summer blockbuster or spoof superhero fluff. Will Smith plays his part just as seriously as he has in his latest roles, the Oscar nominated 'Pursuit of Happiness' (2006), and 'Ali' (2001), even last year's 'I am Legend'. The film's marketing touts Hancock's comedy values, but in reality the Fresh Prince doesn't crack a smile throughout. The comedy is entirely consequential, going on around the title character but never as a result of a wisecrack or quip that we know the actor can handle so deftly. It's a brave move, and it's to the credit of Smith, Berg, and the film's writers that, for the most part, it's a gamble that pays off.Further praise must go to Director Peter Berg's incredibly confident execution, particularly given his relatively short directorial career. The tight structure, distinctive camera work and sheer pace really show his skill and individuality. If Hancock had stuck with the original premise  the hero's road to redemption - for which there's more than enough material to fill the scant 92 minute running time, then this could have been a real winner. As portrayed so effectively in the recent Iron Man, there's plenty of fun to be had from a hero honing his skills. The scene is set for Hancock to really exploit the comedic potential of this concept as he goes cold turkey and works towards perfecting his powers. Unfortunately, this opportunity is, to a certain extent, squandered as it's over all too soon. The decision to fall back on the familiar 'how it all began' plot line, after spending the first half of the film rendering this device redundant seems more destructive than any of the lead character's actions. Subsequently, the second half of the film is a disappointment with the third act in particular being surprisingly downbeat. The tale of origins is pointless nonsense and completely unnecessary given such a promising premise. Hancock has some laugh out loud moments and action set pieces to rival any of the big name comic blockbusters we've seen so far this year, but like the man himself, it's nowhere near as super as it could be.",Hancock
295,Darth_Guybrush,"Much better than the ""kill time"" before The Dark Knight I was expecting",7,22 July 2008,"I went to see The Dark Knight today and would have had to wait more than 2 hours for the next session - then I spotted ""Hancock"" starting in 15 minutes and would end 10-15 minutes before TDK started. As it was $10 Tuesdays it was an easy decision - see TWO movies instead of one! A mini marathon if you will! Hancock was actually a heck of a lot more entertaining than I expected. It has some moderately to very funny moments, awesome special effects (who wouldn't love to fly even if it is worse than ""The Greatest American Hero"" (William Katt)?) and a plot twist I never expected.As a Will Smith fan I thought it wasn't his best work but still rate his performance as... good. Hot babe Charlize was un-recognisable (ie she still looks gorgeous) and played a great role - just don't get her angry. I haven't seen Jason Bateman for ages but his performance in this film was an impressive re-introduction. Daeg Faerch (young Michael in the Halloween remake) has certainly grown up too - not sure if it his normal accent or he was just awesome in Halloween). And most of the supporting staff are well suited too.Generally production is of a high quality. If you are stuck for a movie after seeing the others doing the rounds you could do a lot worse than Hancock.",Hancock
296,dantheman0056,"Handjob, a review",7,5 July 2008,"I went into this movie without expecting much but was surprised about how funny some parts are. Will Smith is great as the jerk, bum, superhero Hancock. He fits the role perfectly and his exploits that cause the public to at first hate him are funny. But then he goes to jail changes to become who he was meant to be. Charlize Theron is OK but nothing special. The special effects are great for the most part, but there are several scenes that cause plot holes. The final act of the movie is when it disappoints. 6/10Make sure you stick around for the credits there's a hilarious scene just about a minute in.",Hancock
297,jaystreet12,what a film,8,14 May 2009,"this film was a good film that will smith did. i knew that will smith liked playing parts of a superhero because he always does super-well as one. will if your reading this give yourself a Pat on the back. this film was a great superhero film. the action scenes were believable and the action was phenomenal. also when hancock cut off that guys hand it was so gross but at the same time so cool. i also thought that the ending was fairly decent but it left me with questions. how did hancock survive after being shot? where did he go after? who was the bird sitting next to him in new york? i would also like to add that the fight between will and the other lady was awesome. i didn't think a girl could Punch that hard. overall, good job will smith. catch me at my next review.",Hancock
298,ravenwood80,actually liked it,8,15 October 2008,"I was looking forward to seeing this film, then due to bad reviews didn't bother until today. I was surprised. I thought it was actually are very good blockbuster. Will Smith plays a down and out superhero. He lives in a trailer, has a drink and attitude problem but is near invincible. He, after wrecking much of the city whilst stopping crime, gets much bad press and is wanted by the police. After saving Jason Batemans character, he is advised to clean up his act and people will love him. Will plays the title role brilliantly, and the effects were amazing. I wasn't totally hooked on the twist involving Charlize Therons character at first but warmed to it by the closing credits. I advise everyone, to take no notice of the the bad or good reviews and go see it with an open mind, then decide yourselves. Some will love it and some will hate, I fall into the first bracket.",Hancock
299,spk07,One of the most tragic examples of wasted potential,5,20 July 2008,"This should have been a good movie. Indeed, it starts out strong. Will Smith is a hilariously rude and belligerent superhero who realizes that his attitude is alienating him from what he wants the most: companionship. How he can redeem himself in the eyes of the public is the real challenge.And that is where this film goes south about halfway through. Unexpected and totally unexplained plot elements and character motivations, confusing mythology, mediocre action sequences, and an unsatisfying conclusion just killed this movie. Not enough time was spent on Hancock's ""rehabilitation"" and too much on story lines which were not worth the sacrifice.As stated earlier, the first half was a delight to sit through but a more focused and thought out script, better editing, and less frenetic direction could have made this more than twice the film it was. Please pick a better script next time, Mr. Smith. I say this cause I care. That also goes for Jason Bateman and Charlize Theron",Hancock
300,okky-1,left with an empty feeling,4,3 July 2008,"Well I guess I was expecting more from this movie like maybe a decent plot and storyline. The special effects were great despite the fact I was sitting in the front row which I am sure detracted from the overall experience.Still both myself and my partner left the theatre going ""is that it"". There were obvious questions like how did the three bad guys escape from prison? It was almost as if these guys were thrown together in the movie as an after thought like the director went ""we need some bad guys , OK I know lets get the dude from the bank and team him up with the other bad guys from the prison"". There was no real cohesiveness there at all.It just left you wanting more",Hancock
301,MoronUnited,An entertaining summer flick....and nothing more,6,11 November 2008,"I am most definitely a Will Smith fan seeing as the movies he has been in, on average, tend to be of high quality. So when I went to see Hancock, I was hoping for a decent film starring Will Smith. And that is exactly what I got: A somewhat confused film that wasn't great, but not bad at the same time.Hancock starts out with the statement that it is unlike most traditional superhero films out there, and in my opinion, this was a great decision by the filmmakers. Superhero films are all the rage nowadays, but having a film starring a super-powered alcoholic is a comedic twist and makes it somewhat original. The storyline after the first 20 minutes or so becomes incredibly generic and mindless though, which really ruins the movie. Considering the beginning looked incredibly promising due to how it was original, I was disappointed to see the filmmakers take the generic and easy road that as been walked down way too many times in the past. Not to mention how the ending was absolutely terrible, and I almost cried at how shallow and lame it was.The acting was very good though, and Will Smith showed that he is still at the top of his game. I was unaware of Jason Bateman (Arrested Development, Juno) being in the film, so it was a very nice surprise on top of the fact that he did an excellent job in his role.If you have seen a superhero film in the last five years or so, you will be aware that they are computer-generated extravaganzas, and Hancock is no exception. While many scenes look incredibly realistic and authentic, many scenes look absolutely horrible, and Will Smith flying in front of a green screen was not cutting it for me. By now, I am really getting tired of these CGI fests, and while Hancock boils down to just all computers with some acting, it was done decently.The camera-work is another thing in which I am not sure whether or not the film did right. Instead of having professional camera angles and smooth scenes, Hancock goes for the raw approach in which the cameras are incredibly shaky to try and immerse the viewer into the scene. It's really a matter of opinion on which way viewers like best, and although I am not always a fan of this camera style, it got the job done.The main problem with the film is just what the hell the producers wanted it to be. It basically seems like an incoherent mash of comedy, action, romance, fantasy and superhero all mashed into one. It seemed like the filmmakers were trying to appeal to as many audiences as possible, which turned out to be a mistake seeing as they just had too much on their plates. I was happy to see that the film did not rely on its comedy to propel itself, due to how most comedies rely solely on the jokes tend to fall flat on their faces by the end. As for the comedy found within the movie, the jokes were really a mixed bag. Some were hilarious, while the on-going joke of ""Call me an a-hole....."" really wasn't funny after the second time, which was a problem considering it popped up many times throughout the film.Was Hancock an amazing film? Absolutely not. Was Hancock a decent summer flick? Indeed it is. As long as you go into the theater with low expectations, I think it is an entertaining ride throughout. Yes, it does have quite a lot of problems such as genre confusion and some fake-looking CGI, but for someone who just wants a fun movie with no real purpose or meaning, Hancock should be sufficient.",Hancock
302,GrowMagicBeans,"It's crude, hilarious and not very PC! But why the second half?",5,11 August 2008,"If you're a guy, this movie is like that best friend you had during your teen school years; he's crude, hilarious and not very PC. Get yourself a tub of popcorn, turn off your brain and just soak it up. Do yourself a favour though... turn it off when it hits half way! Like a crazy alcohol endued night, this movie builds itself up fast and unrelenting. It has a laugh a minute which may not be the most intellectually challenging, but then again who cares! Then, all of a sudden, a woman comes in between you and your best pal, the movie! Somewhere half way the film flattens out and takes a fast noise dive. The boys in Hollywood always feel compelled to introduce a love element into every story and sometimes it just don't fit. The jokes stop and the sentimental mush begins. Not that I'm anti-romantic or anything... the love story is just that bad! ...and the movie was doing so well. Don't be conned either by the promise of revelations to be revealed (how he got his super powers and immortality, bla, bla, bla...). Its a lose thread, desperately dangling for you to take a grip, designed only to keep you until an unsatisfying end. Indeed you'd be better off not knowing the explanation; the mangled cringe-worthy excuse for a plot. -LEAVE!!!-...leave while you were still enjoying the movie... leave just at the point where the first revelation (you'll know it when it comes) is revealed. Go home with a glowing feeling in your belly from the barrels of laughs, rather then it turning into a desire to barf!",Hancock
303,hollywoodgirl-1,"Good Movie, But. . .",6,26 July 2008,"""Hancock"" elevates itself above the usual summer fare right off the bat with an unusual plot. Imagine a man with superpowers who then decides to become a superhero, but his rotten attitude and penchant for causing more damage to his city than good has the citizens of Los Angeles begging him to go somewhere else. It's an interesting twist on the superhero story. Will Smith plays the titular man as a surly, heavy-drinking, foul-mouthed, unpleasant citizen of L.A. As usual, he is very good, probably the thing I enjoyed most about the movie. He adds several requisite layers to Hancock but manages to make them feel fresh. Coming in a close second to what I enjoyed most was Jason Bateman as a PR exec who wants to make over Hancock's image. Bateman's comedic timing and earnestness compliment's Smith wonderfully. The effects are good and there are several moments that are quite funny. However, the film does have its flaws. The first gripe for me would be that the director, Peter Berg, seems to be an avid fan of the extreme close-up. When two people are talking he often zooms so close in on their faces that you cannot even see their hairline. I found it distracting. I also thought that Charlize Theron was miscast. I like her a lot and I think she's a great actress, but she lacked the comedic timing needed for her part as Jason Bateman's wife who is very skeptical that Hancock can change. She plays one scene in particular, a kitchen confrontation with Hancock, very straight and dour which is a jarring contrast to Smith's light comedy. Next, the story. The premise is unusual and quite good, but it looses steam less than halfway through the movie. The movie is quite short, only an hour and a half, so at least in that respect there isn't much left once the plot starts giving out. It takes an unbelievable turn in the third act that I just didn't buy. I think the screenwriters found it difficult to stretch a simplistic idea to a feature length. Also, the lack of a central villain hurt as well. Pitting Hancock repeatedly against petty criminals just did not work as well as if they had given him a main nemesis.""Hancock"" is good and quite entertaining, there are several reasons to see it. Is it a perfect movie? No, but it has enough redeeming qualities to make it the perfect summer escape.",Hancock
304,googooji,Way much better than it is rated here!,7,5 August 2008,"Maybe this movie is not that unique and different which makes its rating here not that high, but in my eyes, this film is really way much better which should let it get a higher rating. I am not going to talk about the technical part in the film since there is no need to talk about it before we can really tell no difference between the scenes using it and without it. About the performance, I would say both Will Smith and Charlize Theron did a good job. Will is always good at being both funny and serious in different scenes in one same movie, and he did it quite good again this time in ""Hancock"". Charlize was also good in the film, her performance was natural and really no strings attached. That really makes us able to see the power inside her performance. The movie actually is not really the one which is ""totally entertaining"". I said it is because this movie has a part which is a bit heavy. That actually a bit breaks the speed and the rhythm of the movie. But since it is needed for the direction the movie goes, I would not really mind about it. The movie is good, and you will see a funny Will Smith as always, so why not to go to enjoy it?",Hancock
305,acts2120,Loved it!!!!!!!!!!,9,11 July 2008,"The only reason I didn't give this a 10 is because of the language; even though it was consistent w/ the character, it didn't have to be so vulgar.Other than that, I adored this film.Hancock is NOT your typical ""superhero"" film - that is what confuses people. Hancock is not a 'superhero' at all, in the beginning of the film. He has powers - but a hero he ain't. He is pathetic; he is disgusting. He is a shamble. That is what makes his transformation - and the reason behind it - so very engaging.There is no ""super villain"" - at least, not one externally. Hancock is his own worst enemy - he undoes his own efforts - he doesn't need a villain to play off of, cuz he's his own kryptonite.That is the big ""twist"" - who and what you are inside, what drives you. Is it heroic? Is it villainous? Your past determines who you are - but what if you can't remember your past, as Hancock cannot? What about your future - Can you change it, if you don't know your past? You actually have to THINK about this film, in order to FULLY appreciate it. It's not a ""sit back mindlessly and enjoy"" it film - I mean, you can do that, but if you want to really enjoy this film, you need to get involved w/ the characters, invest yourself in what they think and feel.If you fail to involve yourself in the film, you'll miss the best parts of it.Jason Bateman is wonderful - sweet, hopeful, gentle. His comedic timing is fantastic. He plays off Wil Smith wonderfully;there is a delightful chemistry between them.Charlize Theron - wow. Wow. She's amazing. She brings such astonishing depth to this character. Realizing the subtext in her performance, once you know the end of the film, is a treat in and of itself.Wil Smith does some great things with this character - some subtle, some not so subtle -- but that is what makes his performance so very engaging. His character changes dramatically - he reflects the emotions of other characters, and enlarges them. But this is done subtlety, reflectively - so that, as the viewer, you have time to anticipate his changes, and take that moment of ""joy"" in knowing that he, finally, understands what it means to be a 'superhero'.The special effects were, overall, excellent. Storyline - awesome. Character development - excellent. I LOVED this film.",Hancock
306,tone_e2000,"A waste of talent, and ultimately a waste of time",4,14 August 2008,"After watching Hancock, I can't help thinking the producers must have commissioned a hundred different versions of the script and picked one out of a hat. It's a great concept, but is let down by a poor screenplay.In all fairness, it starts off great, with well-paced and executed action and comedy. Will Smith is predictably brilliant in his role as the eponymous drunk super hero, while Jason Bateman provides capable support.When the movie takes a more sombre turn, and we begin to look into the reasons for Hancock's alcoholism, things are still going strong. It's a change of pace, sure, but it's well acted and adds depth to the character.Where things start to go drastically wrong can be pinpointed to one exact moment: when Charlize Theron throws Smith through a wall. How the script writers, producers and the director thought this would be good place to take the movie is a complete mystery. Hancock could have been brilliant if it weren't for the decision to grant this character with super powers, and the extremely weak explanation of them that follows. As for the so-called 'happy ending' it doesn't seem to take into account that the wife is immortal. What's going to happen in 20 years? Is she going to start knocking off the son? When the film starts, it's a nine out of ten, then it drops to a six. By the time it gets to the final act, it's barely scraping a two. This is probably the biggest missed opportunity of recent cinematic history, and I feel sorry for the cast and the director, who do their best to make Hancock into something worthwhile. However, in the end, you really can't polish a pooh.",Hancock
307,AhmedElzubi,Kind of a Sequel ?,5,24 February 2020,"Have you ever watched a movie that was a sequel before watching the prequel? Well, this is exactly how I felt about Hancock. It starts with a scene where it shows you scenes for the first time without putting some history on it. Not a very interested movie. If you want to waste some time, watch it. If you didn't watch it, you didn't lose anything.",Hancock
308,kezopster,A GREAT movie poorly reviewed,9,7 August 2008,"At first, I thought this movie was going to be a comedy, it's not. It has lots of very funny moments, but they are the result of a very lonely superhero. I love comedies. To me, funny and revealing of the character, is much better humor than just funny to be amusing.The plot twist everyone talks about is revealed relatively early, about midway through, and the rest of the story hinges on it. It's nicely foreshadowed and stunning when ""the truth comes out."" The truth is a doozy and puts everything prior to it into a brand new perspective. The last time I saw movie that did as good of a job at a plot point as this movie was ""L.A. Confidential,"" an admittedly different kind of film.Would the movie suffer if its producers choose to reveal the plot twist? Actually, I think not. I think the entire marketing campaign should have been based on that revelation. It would have put the movie in a different perspective and rather than critics panning it, they would have embraced it and loved it.It's truly too bad, because this is a gem of a film. Read the reviews for it carefully... pro and con... think about who the reviewer is and how credible their opinion is to you. Yes, this is a ""superhero"" movie, but it's more in the vein of the Spiderman movies than it is X-Men. I truly liked this movie and cannot wait for it to come out on DVD so I can enjoy it with family and friends and get their take on it, too.",Hancock

Overall, had a good, popcorn blast-o-fun with this ""action-comedy-fantasy-drama"" movie.Hancock was gripping, heartfelt, and totally unexpected! you have to go to see ""Hancock"" even if you don't expect a lot from this cause believe me this is movie is a hit !. You would have been surprised if it was Will Smith's first major disappointing film since ""Wild Wild West"". Since there was such high publicity I figured it would fall way short. However, to me I was surprised !! I ended up cheering once the credits rolled. It truly was a captivating story.

312,eagleroost,Plot twist ruined by DVD cover,7,13 December 2008,"Spoiler alert- don't read the back cover of the DVD! It says ""until he meets a woman(...Charlize Theron ...) with similar powers to his..."" Considering this was the major plot twist to the movie- what were they thinking?!? By using my very limited zen powers to put aside my irritation at already knowing this major twist, I was able to enjoy this fun romp through the world of a superhero with serious personal issues. Will Smith manages to make you like Hancock, even when he is being a jerk. Without saying anything about it, you just know if Will Smith is being a jerk, it is for a good reason. Jason Bateman was adorable as Ray, who becomes Hancock's only friend. He exuded such an innocent boyscout goodness that I just wanted to gobble him up. Goodness seems to be so out of fashion that it was refreshing to see a male character portrayed this way. Of course Charlize Theron was hot- as the housewife and the superhero. She also brought depth and caring to her more intimate scenes with Will Smith. I agree with most that the humor was spot-on and really kept the movie moving. More character development of any of the main or side characters would have enriched the movie and added more plot for those like me who had the major twist spoiled by brain-dead marketing. The problem with the ending is not that it was too deep, but that it is just unsatisfying to Hollywood audiences. Life in the movies is not supposed to end with hard choices and compromise, but with a clever twist that ties up all the loose ends. I am sure my 11 year old is going to see this with his dad as it is funny and the level of violence is pretty typical for movies today. However, we will need to make it very clear that children do not use the word ""a**hole"" to adults or other children and if I hear the B word come out of his mouth- he will not soon forget my wrath.",Hancock

In fact, the whole cast and the viewers deserved something better.This is one of the worst movies that I've ever saw, along with ""Alone in the Dark"" and ""The Game Plan"". It was directed by Peter Berg (The director of ""Friday Night Lights"") and this is, by far, his worst movie. It was horrible, completely unwatchable.Like I said before, I hate this film. With passion. I know it is strange, but this could be easily the worst movie ever made: The plot was lame, the characters were annoying and irritating, the especial effects were poor...Everything about this film was terrible. ""Hancock"" sucked and it was a complete waste of time. It proofs how bad could be a superhero movie.",Hancock
314,Benderbeast,A very enjoyable summer action flick,8,12 July 2008,"Hancock centers around John Hancock, an alcoholic superhero who is widely disliked by the public. After being sent to jail for wrecking the city numerous times, he teams up with a public relations spokesperson in order to fix his shattered image.I went into Hancock not expecting much. I was not to impressed with Will Smith's previous movie I Am Legend. However this movie exceeded my expectations by far. One of the things I enjoyed most about this movie is how it avoided many of the superhero movie clichés and set up its own unique style and tone. It did a great job mixing comedy with action. However I fell like it faltered a little bit near the end as it took on a much more serious tone which I feel was out of place. Other than that I have no real complaints. The action scenes and special effects were top notch, and the acting was very good.Overall I think that Hancock, despite a few minor flaws, was a great summer action flick and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to have a good time at the movies.",Hancock
315,absforachilles,Not A Typical Homeless,6,12 July 2008,"With mild drama and twist turning action I suspected this movie to be something special. Having everyone hate you is just the forte of being Hancock (Will Smith). While most of society may not like him, he coasts through an existence as an unemployed, homeless man with superhuman capabilities. Unlike conventional movies, Hancock is a hero with an attitude. He may not act with justice at times, but it does not take away the heart that rests inside. Why then would I give this a five then? Well mainly, because of the twist. At first the story line appeared to be heading in a nice and pleasant direction, but the fatal twist halfway made me think differently. I suspect that the writers wrote it to provide complexity, but I just felt it was unnecessary. Overall though, it had a unique storyline and was truly one of a kind. Even though I did not find the twist satisfying, I believe that it is still worth the watch for most of it. With or without doubts I say go out and watch it and be the judge of what you see.",Hancock
316,MoveyGurl,Hancock  It's better than you think!,6,28 November 2008,"Hancock  It's better than you think! I had my concerns about this movie before grabbing a copy at my local Blockbuster. Friends and critics alike told me to steer clear. But like a moth to a flame, being warned about it just makes me want to see it even more! Having heard that the film had been pared down to fit the ratings for PG-13, I kept feeling that Will Smith and crew should have gone for the R rating anyways. Most of the people going to see it probably feel that way. Will Smith was looking fabu in his hero suit and Charize Therron always keeps me entertained. I enjoyed some of the scenes with Will Smith (Hancock) and some neighborhood kids - that made me chuckle. Goodness knows, I've wasted more time on theatrical duds in my lifetime. Anywho, the plot could have been developed a great deal more but it was an entertaining 2 hours of cinema.",Hancock
317,joe-cope-74-826665,Could have been so much better,7,5 March 2019,"Very enjoyable and in places really funny. I however get the feeling if they took the age restriction off, this movie could have been really good. Dont be disheartened by this though I appreciate it for what it is and is a good family movie. Not too much cgi, which I hate, although a lot of action shots, which are unexpected... Also Jason Bateman and Will Smith have some great dialogue together.",Hancock
318,Dubh,Screenplay almost wastes good ideas,7,12 October 2008,"Pros: very good acting, interesting ideas Cons: screenplay does not bring ideas together""Hancock"" has different interesting ideas: no superpowers can teach you how to interact with humans (the difficult life of the superhero, well explored in Marvel stories); a good PR has almost superhuman powers; superheros are in some way needed, just as angels, but have weak spots.Still these ideas are split between the first and the second half, without really going deep. The last 20 minutes is really an action movie (rather good at that), but one has to wonder whether some more footage would have helped.",Hancock
319,clay_thompson,Better than the current IMDb rating - 5.6,8,2 July 2008,"The movie was clever, original, and outrageous. Growing up on comics and comic book characters during the years of the Comics Authority Code, the approval group stating what could and must not be in a comic book, there was often a ""what if"" quality to the comics of my youth. What if you had a ""superhero"" with an alcohol problem? That is not a spoiler... it's in the advertisements. Yeah, I know, Tony Stark/Iron Man had a booze problem, but nothing quite like this. ""What if"" you had a superhero with no impulse control and was a drunk? What if you had a superhero with no impulse control, was a drunk and had no social skills whatsoever? It is an interesting place to start, and that is where ""Hancock"" starts, and in places it is hilarious.Will Smith plays what may be the ultimate outsider, and as he usually is in his annual summer film, he is brilliant at it. Charlize Theron has always been attractive (well except for 'Monster'), but somehow I had not focused that she was in this movie, and in it she is just gorgeous. All through the movie I had asked ""Who is this? She's beautiful."" My biggest complaint probably came from the direction of Peter Berg. Berg is a serviceable director who finds things in stories that other directors likely will not. He seems to have a passion of documentary film making, because like in ""Friday Night Lights"" he uses an awful lot of hand held camera work -- so much so that it became an annoyance. I hope he ditches the hand held when he directs ""Dune."" When I watched the ending credits, I thought, ""My goodness, what a pedigree,"" and it may be that there were too many cooks making this soup - each having their favorite spice to add without regard to the overall soup.It is worth seeing, and if you like action movies and comic book superheroes, you should like it. If you do see it, see it on the big screen.",Hancock
320,ardasanimations,"Not just a ""superhero film""",7,23 January 2021,I think where this movie suffers the most at is when he finds out that ray's wife also has superpowers. They should've thought the idea out more cleary and maybe maybe that into a part 2. Over all good movie with a pretty crazy twist,Hancock
321,digitalmaleficus,Everything Okay EXCEPT Charlize Theron Role,6,4 July 2008,"Short and sweet.Movie starts off pretty funny, when you'll finding yourself laughing a lot by the unique humor and original jokes. The plot is descent if you're going in open minded and not expecting a comic book style adventure where some ultimate bad guy has some super doom in mind for all humanity until said super hero defeats before said villain or nefarious event.However, yopu'll immediately discover a sour taste in your mouth whenever a scene involving Charlize Theron comes into play. Her acting is so extremely artificial it almost is like watching a 3rd grade play. Aeon Flux was a perfect demonstration of this, but worked out better because well the character she was playing as was in general monotone anyways. However that sever acting flaw shines brightly in a movie thats more domestic than 'cold killer'. This gets even more highlighted when her role becomes more involved later in the movie.Over all I was generally pleased by the movie until the deeper plot comes out which kinda makes it feel like the writers were runnign shallow on the idea and just making it up as they went along.Over all its a good watch, can be easily waited for to be released to home theater but due to its action scenes and descent screen play by most of the people involved (minus Charlize Theron) you should be able to walk away with a new experience on your hands.",Hancock
322,dinaia,Pleasantly surprised,8,18 October 2009,"I waited that long to see this movie because of the bad reviews I read. However, I thought I'd check out some other titles with Charlize Theron so decided to watch this.I had no idea it would be so funny (the fallen out of grace superhero), so original (the focus is not on the dynamics of the good and evil,-there's no comic-book type villain- but on coming to terms with who you are) and even philosophical (free will is stronger than fate and determinism for both human and superhuman beings).The leading trio has great chemistry and they work with a pretty good script. It might have been a bit better without some of the repetitive dialog, but I don't want to nitpick.All in all, a good surprise.",Hancock

But there's something about it that makes me keep coming back.Just watched it again and it still stands up. It's running time is refreshing, it's a stand alone that doesn't need expanding or a sequel. It's explained as much as it needs to and you fill in the gaps.The performances are great and after just watching Jupiter's Legacy they aren't bad for the time.What I'm trying to say is that Hancock is a grower that maybe didn't have the impact it should have done but helped tickle our taste buds for the MCU & DCU.Could the last act have been improved... definitely but I personally love the switch in tone.",Hancock

The reciting of the impressions by Mary Embrey of Queen Elizabeth I, the Huns or JFK, or even the 80-year-old cinema tickets of Frankenstein and chewing gums, looked simply pointless.The whole story was simply a brainless movie. I gave it 6 points because of the special effects used for the massive destruction, it wasn't good, but at least it gave the audience the only reason to enjoy this movie.",Hancock
326,Poopdeck90210,First Half of Movie Rocks!,5,10 July 2008,"This COULD have been a GREAT film. Instead, it is a memorable film for the first hour, and then it becomes a hodge-podge of the following films that we have already seen: My Super-Ex Girlfriend, Highlander and Eon Flux.The story for this film was written by two Vinces - Ngo & Gilligan. I will bet any sum of money that one of the Vince's crafted the first half of this story (which is Academy Award worthy), and the other Vince is guilty of ripping and slapping together the 2nd half of this film from the aforementioned movie story lines.Here's how I would have handled the 2nd half of the film. I would take more time in Act II to examine the redemption of Hancock. At the same time, as Hancock began to redeem himself, I would have had Ray's character start a spiral downward with regard to his marriage with Mary and his career - caught up in the fame and fortune his assistance to Hancock brought. I would then have had Hancock and Mary flirt with having an affair or an indiscretion of some kind starting in Act III. But I would have Hancock stand tall and do the right thing and offer Ray the same assistance with redemption; he would help Ray get back on track and become ""real"" once again. I would then end the story the same way the movie ended with Hancock helping Ray secure his symbol on the moon.Oh well, this is an okay movie; it just slays me when I think about what it COULD have been. Regarding the ""Vince"" who is responsible for Act I and the first half of Act II - I look forward to even more engaging stories to come from them in the near future! And the other Vince - PLEASE go back to your day job... I BEG you! Do it in the name of decency and humanity!",Hancock
327,Pretender-5,Much less than I had expected. Disappointed.,4,4 July 2008,"People,Even though that I won't go into such drastic comments as some people suggest that this movie is crap etc, I would say that this movie (which started off in Latvia 2 days ago) is MUCH WORSE than I had expected from film and from Will Smith personally.If I compare with the current box office hit WANTED I would rather go 3rd time to see WANTED than any more on HANCOCK.Simple argumentation - while WANTED delivers much more than it's trailer (regardless of the script quality speculations which appear here on IMDb). The HANCOCK actually delivers much less than it's trailer, or better say - it almost has no more anything interesting inside.Basically what you see in the HANCOCK trailer is 90% of the coolness you see in that film. And if you are serious action/comedy fan in the term of the films like ""MEN IN BLACK 1/2"" - this film is clearly a weak weak underperformer of such genre.Most of the film deals with HANCOCK being lonely, how he is unhappy and how a PR manager tries to get his life back. The film starts to teach us from the face of Hancock how we should care about the people, and how bad is drinking etc. While in general may be it's not such a bad thing. There is not much more of an action, than in the trailer. It's clearly NOT enough for this film to be a strong ACTION/FX/COMEDY contender.I wouldn't say if you SHOULD or SHOULDN'T GO to cinema. If you are a fan of Will Smith - then you could probably still see it, but I tell you very honestly (being a fan of a genre and Smith myself) - this film is a serious underperformer! I will not go to see it again or buy on DVD (which I definitely do with IRON MAN and WANTED).",Hancock
328,Adrian232,Not what I expected,7,10 September 2008,"This movie was not quite what I was expecting at all. But that isn't necessarily a bad thing.I was expecting more of a generic superhero movie, but what I got was more of a character study than anything else. Hancock isn't so much a superhero as he is an indestructible force, a god if you will, who has just sort of lost the will to care about collateral damage or public image... and on top of that an anger problem to boot. A plot twist is thrown in there to explain his past and moves the plot in quite a different direction than what would be expected, eventually leading up to the inevitable happy ending.I would consider Hancock something like a mix between Spider-Man and The Incredibles, then garnish with a little Will Smith and it makes for a fairly entertaining movie.",Hancock
329,roboperson,It was good but not what i expected....,7,4 July 2008,"Hancock is still one of the best movies of '08 of my opinion.The good thing about this movie is that has awesome action & destruction, funny sayings & funny times, the story was interesting, a good choice for any superhero fan and it was a well-done.But only problems is: The times of the movie had gone way to far and made it lose of what it had, the ending was kinda weird too, i thought it would be what expected to have but in its movie trailer, but it didn't have some promises on the way.The movie itself, very good summer movie but its repetitive. Overall i give it a 7.2/10.",Hancock
330,J_M_Kiff,"Good, but not great. *** Spoilers ***",6,30 June 2008,"If you're going in expecting a life-changing, perspective-altering film, this is not it. However, it is a great way to kill time, get a few really good laughs, and down some popcorn. That's all the film is intended to be, and it holds up OK. The a-hole anti-superhero is a nice twist on the recent rash of ""take-me-seriously-darnit"" superhero movies. I never got the impression that this movie was intended to be anything more than it is. It's goofy-funny at times, a little vulgar at times, and I knew there was something going on between Hancock and Therron's character, but I was honestly surprised when I found out what that connection was. Granted, it could've used a few more scenes to add more depth, like when she's reminding Hancock of their long-past adventures they should've had her narration run over some foggy-memory type of scenes playing out their troubles in Sumer, and Greece, and Brooklyn, and Miami, etc. But overall I enjoyed it. And let's face it, who among us wouldn't like to have that kind of power? Honestly?",Hancock
331,adamoconnell,top notch superhero film with a twist,9,31 January 2010,"Hancock is an enjoyable superhero film with a twist, as the superhero is often drunk, sleeping on the streets or is causing more damage to the city than the criminals that he is chasing.it is a humorous twist that director Peter Berg plays around with, but does not suck it for all it is worthit has a subtle sense of dark humor, and Will Smith gives everything to his role as the sympathetic bum, and it pays off, as well as the supporting castin the end, this superhero film is a funny look at superheroes and the way we look at them",Hancock
332,nolarobert,Will Smith Delivers another Summertime Movie Treat,8,30 June 2008,"I caught a preview showing of Hancock tonight. I enjoyed it for what it was which is a fun, mostly fast-paced popcorn flick. The writers of the film also tossed in a nice plot twist that I didn't see coming but it turned out to work just fine. This isn't Shakespeare so I don't demand a lot of deep thought just some escapist fun. Will Smith does an excellent job of playing the disinterested superhero with an existential crisis. It was good to see Jason Bateman again but a bummer as well seeing how he has aged. This means I am not so young myself anymore. Jae Head didn't overact nor did the script writers push the ""cute"" button to the point of being saccharine. It will be interesting to see how this movie performs to see if Smith wants to do a sequel. So I am more than happy to recommend Hancock to fans of the ""Summer Blockbuster"" and those who enjoy Will Smith.",Hancock
333,DaytonMetroSoccer,"Pretty Good, Not the Best",8,2 January 2009,"I saw Hancock over the summer and was on the edge of my seat throughout almost the whole movie. It was moving along really well, and then we got to the part where Hancock figures out that Ray's wife is another ""angel"" like Hancock. The movie went down the good roller-coaster just a bit right from that point, but it ended well and hinted a good sequel! It was kinda cheesy when Hancock and Mary have a little fidgit, not going to say anymore, but hey the whole idea behind the movie is about superheros/and or having superpowers. The end might jerk some tears but not for me, and Will Smith's acting was overall A-ish. The directing from Peter Berg could have been better, but it was good. Overall the movie gets an 8/10 stars from me! I do recommend it.",Hancock
334,polinka,took me by surprise,8,11 September 2008,"I was ready for silly jokes and bad CGI; I was sure that (according to the critics)it will be a waste of about 2 hours...BUT IT WAS FUN! First of all, don't take the movie seriously (you were supposed to take seriously ""I am legend"" and it was a disappointment for me). I liked the fact that there is no big villain character in the movie and no epic battle between the good and the bad (thank you, writer/director/producer!,that's what ruined it for me in ""Iron Man""). It was funny and kind of realistic where it concerned media and public reaction. I liked Charlize Theron character, and the scenes between them were good. I found the explanation about their destiny/love story, whatever you call it, stretched,- but at least trying to be different.I found it charming that they are attracted to each other again and again, but when they are together it neutralizes their powers. Maybe we enjoyed it because we did not expect much and were entertained, it was a more fun super hero (charming Will Smith), and aside from the last scenes in the hospital, kept the good spirit including the final Moon Ad. It made us feel good (my family of adults), instead of the uneasy feeling we have after watching all the other super hero's, including good movies like ""the dark night"" and ""iron man"" and the last ""hulk"". The uneasy feeling is because this comic characters are taken too seriously - more and more so- and people relate to them in a real way. I thought it is a good thing to put it back into purely imaginary product, showing the flows of such imaginary hero and the possible outcome of his imaginary deeds.",Hancock

Why did Charlize take this screenplay, with this amount of hate in it? Charlize, why? This screenplay is SO anti-gay, it's horrible! I think you should give your Oscar back - because it's not right to do that to your gay fans, to support these phrases in a screenplay, you are not Merryl, Barbara, Cher or who ever.

336,sammyocarr,Deceiving,4,27 August 2008,"The Trailer for this film contained action, cheek, and amazing visual effects. These scenes featured within the first thirty mins of the film.However i wouldn't say thats a negative, as the film was good from the off, and had some mind blowing stunts. Yet i'm still not raving about it, this is because what i expected to be a new breed of super-hero action series, such as Spiderman or Superman, turned out to be a romantic comedy.Admitedly the plot had a slight twist, which kept me interested even as the mood changed from bad ass killer to love lorn loser. The comedy was subtle, the plot was original, and the effects were brilliant.This film tricked me into believing it was a action type with uber-villains, major fight scenes and a typical happy ending. But it wasn't it was a romantic fantasy type. Still i thought, its good, ya know has everything i'd want in a film.And then it happened, what pushed me over the edge, what made me write this review. The love heart on the MOON!, what is going on there? that is typical American indulgence. i'm sorry but its the type of thing i've expect in a Hugh grant film not a will smith movie!

337,stuartdr,Sub-Par Superhero,5,5 July 2008,"I must admit, when I first saw the trailer I did not have much of an expectation for this film. My view did not change when I walked in to see this film. However since the film was dubbed as a ""comedy superhero film"" I thought I was at least going to be entertained. Despite the good strong start on this year's summer blockbuster films, Hancock is one of the most mediocre and least entertaining of all.The plot follows an unconventional superhero by the name of Hancock. Despite his heroics, he often lays a wave of property destruction during his act. One day, he rescues a doomed PR from being hit by a train. This begin a change to Hancock's life as Ray (The PR) attempts to change the public's view on Hancock.The film's structure is somewhat similar to the Adam Sandler's film Clicks. The first half is mainly comedy and the second part is mainly drama. I personally enjoyed this system because it prevented the film from being dragging on and kept things pretty interesting.One of the key highlights of this film is Jason Bateman. He is one of the few actor in this film that provides a good and solid performances. Similarly, he is also one of the few likable characters in the film. This leads to the negatives of Hancock...One of the obvious problems with this film is the special effects. Not one of the scenes where special effects are used look convincing in anyway. After Iron Man and other films that were able to present excellent and believable special effects, it is very disappointing. Secondly, the humor isn't so great. A lot of the jokes are present in the trailer and the running gags throughout the film isn't all that funny. Considering that I didn't find this movie that funny made the much more serious second part to be a lot more enjoyable.Finally, the plot is full of plot holes and paper thin. Many things are left unexplained and the film's attempts to create multiple story lines does not work in the slightest.Overall Hancock is definitely not worth the 10 dollars price of admission. It is very forgettable and doesn't impress much. Save your money for The Dark Knight.",Hancock

Looking back on this after 10 years, I think it is underrated. This may be a typical action/comedy/sci-fi Wil Smith fare but charming in many ways. Jason Bateman is really the heart of this film. His sincerity as a PR guy who wants the change the world and Hancock's image is pretty lovely. His coaching sessions are terrific. . The story arc is a bit predictable but fun. Charlize Theron is less entertaining but as bankable as ever. Effects hold up well, even today. Much of what is suggested off camera, instead of on, really adds to this FX longevity.

339,Rurextrexx34,So much wasted potential,4,23 May 2020,"OK seeing Will Smith movie ""Hancock"" my expectations were quite high having heard great things over the last few years about this being an under appreciated ""gem"" of a film....The premise behind the film certainly had enough promise and potential. It had a ""something new"" and fresh appeal to it. We also had arguable the biggest box office star going attached to the films title character, so it surely going to be an awesome spectacle and the hit of the summer.Well I can't quite comment wither or not the film will be the box office smash of the year, but I certainly can state in my opinion that it AIN'T the ""awesome spectacle"" I initially thought it could be. So what went wrong?The film has no soul, from the very start to the ending credits the film feels empty. No emotion attached to the project, no feeling of awe. Can't quite put my finger on the spot but something major was lacking in the movie experience for the viewer regarding the overall feel of the flick.No character arc's worth mentioning, I know we are supposed to not be that keen on the Hancock character, but there must be something in the character that we will grow to love. There ain't, Hancock has an effect flat-line arc. This is exactly the same with the other major players in the movie. Nobody gets developed fully or even slightly throughout the rather short 90 minutes or so running time.The score was also terrible, from start to end.The Superhero back story again was extremely weak.Villains were so weak, we didn't really need anybody with super-powers to deal with them.The first half or so of the movie was at least enjoyable popcorn fun, but the latter half was particularly weak. When the film became ""serious"" when the drama kicked off the film just became severely lost. It lost structure, it didn't know what genre it wanted to be, action, drama, continued comedy or suspense. Unfortunately for the viewer it was none of them so just became pointless and irritating. They really should have padded out the idea of the first 45 minutes with some more evolved ideas from the part of the story and we might well have had a good movie. Unfortunately they didn't and they padded the film out with a tangent story-line that made no coherence or sense.There are positives, Will Smith for what he had to play with was as usual entertaining to watch. The Jason Bateman character was likable and also enjoyable to watch, well up until the third act when he frittered away to a cardboard cutout. Special effects were more than adequate, and at times quite spectacular. There was also a few laugh out loud moments, particularly the Youtube scenes.Overall this film had so much potential, this movie could have and should have been great, but unfortunately it was very poorly handled and executed. The blame must fall down to the direction, and script.",Hancock
340,lisacamillek-1,Hancock - Change of lifestyle,9,30 July 2008,"I was dying to see this movie and when I did, I was once again seduced by Will's power and magnitude to his role as Hancock. It's true, John Hancock is not your average superhero: He drinks, he curses, he chases off everybody who wants to help him and he basically doesn't care. He's an ass****. But he manages to repair his image with the help of Ray Embrey, a public relations executive, and his wife Mary (played by Charlize Theron). There were a few surprises that I did not expect concerning Mary. I won't spoil them, but they were good. Normally surprises turn to the worst in movies, but in this one, they turned out not to be a disappointment, to me, at least, I don't know about the rest of you. Definitely well worth your money to go and see this summer hit wonder!",Hancock
341,hardrock666,'Hancock' - just for action movie fans,7,3 August 2008,"The glut of super-hero summer movies coughed up by Hollywood continues with ""Hancock"". Comparisons with the likes of the already released ""Iron Man"" and ""The Incredible Hulk"" and the yet to be released ""The Dark Knight"" and ""Hellboy"" are unavoidable; though it is clear that ""Hancock"" falls short of all these movies.The movie is a wasted opportunity. Will Smith, the most dependable Hollywood actor right now, with his last nine movies topping the box office, plays an unlovable superhero who goes through a transformation.It is a very promising premise, but the writers Vincent Ngo and Vince Gilligan along with director Peter Berg seem to lose their bearings half way and allow the movie to take one of the most bizarre and wholly boring twists in any Hollywood movie this year.Not even the talented Oscar winning actress Charlize Theron and the dependable Jason Bateman can rescue or clarify this muddle of a movie.Smith is Hancock, the superhero with good intentions but bad PR skills and even poorer hygiene. He cannot resist helping anyone in need, but much to the annoyance of the residents of Los Angeles, he does more harm than good. His rescues end up costing the city millions of dollars in damages.One day Hancock rescues an altruistic but failed PR man Ray who offers to refine him and make him presentable as a superhero. This takes up the first 20 minutes or so of the movie and is actually pretty entertaining. The wheels start coming off when Hancock starts taking an interest in Ray's wife and the movie proceeds to explain this attraction.Since it is a blockbuster, the movie has the luxury of money and does a good job with the action sequences and special effects. But the true thrills in the movie are the scenes where Hancock is making efforts to be nicer and presentable.Smith, with his wholesome reputation, asks the audience to stretch their imagination in having to believe his crass attitude early in the movie. Fortunately, those scenes are few and brief and it is not long before he goes about smashing things.Smith cements his reputation as the most dependable action if not superstar in Hollywood right now. This movie will not have quite the shine as ""Independence Day"" or ""I, Robot"" and he displays much better acting skills in ""The Pursuit of Happiness"" and ""I am Legend"". He was able to surprise us with his acting range.""Hancock"" sadly doesn't even put up any acting challenge before him and that is another reason the movie is a wasted opportunity.""Hancock"" never forgets that it is a summer blockbuster action movie, and in many ways it delivers in the way action movie fans would expect. They will not be disappointed. For those who can put up with a digressing plot line but not at the cost of some action and special effects, ""Hancock"" delivers.",Hancock
342,YouSeenThat,"Do I have permission to touch your body, Charlize?",4,26 December 2008,"Cards on the table time - I find it really difficult to get excited about Will Smith films. Nothing against the Fresh Prince personally, but let's be honest, the majority of his films are little more than pointless big-budget popcorn-fests. Yeah, so I wasn't the only one who spotted that trend either? There's actually a good reason for the types of projects that Will Smith takes on. Apparently when he first made his way to Hollywood, he sat down with his agent/manager and examined the top ten grossing films of all time to find out what was going to make the phat cash. Guess what? They realized that almost every film in the top ten was a pointless big-budget popcorn-fest. While I applaud Will Smith's commitment to mediocrity, when is this guy going to take on some more meaningful roles - I actually thought he did a great job in The Pursuit of Happiness. Leave the blockbusters to the chumps, Will. Come on, surely you must be sick of buying ivory backscratchers and banging your wife on piles of hundred dollar bills? I sure as hell know that I am.Poor attempts at humor aside, Will Smith's latest offering is the action/comedy Hancock. Before you start sniggering into the back of your hand like an imbecile, Hancock tells the story of an out of favor superhero that enters into an arrangement with a public relations officer intent on improving his image with the public, only to find himself in a questionable relationship with the mans wife.The concept of the down-on-his-luck superhero trying to regain a little acceptance appealed to me  the alcoholic, foul-mouthed superhero John Hancock (Will Smith) fumbling and stumbling through life and causing general chaos was pretty entertaining for the first twenty or thirty minutes. You and I live in a world where superheroes are completely fictitious, but imagine if a superhero did exist, a superhero that was so obnoxious and reckless that you couldn't stand the sight of the guy? This is the world we are introduced to, evident by the opening scenes where Hancock practically destroys half the city in order to apprehend a group of robbers. Rather than applause and appreciation, our hero gets nothing but abuse and the threat of legal action.I was kind of digging Hancock at this point  but then I started to wonder how they were going to drag this out for ninety minutes.This was about the time we were introduced to Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman), an equally down-on-his-luck public relations guy who finds himself being rescued by the aforementioned John Hancock. In debt to Hancock, Ray brings his saviour home and offers to use his PR skills to rebuild the superheros public image. Okay, this could certainly be interesting, at least that's what I thought until we were introduced to Ray's wife, Mary (Charlize Theron). This was pretty much the point in the film where it went straight down the toilet.Without giving away too much more of the story, even Blind Freddy could have seen that there was some sort of strange connection between Hancock and Ray's wife  we did't know exactly what it was at the time, but the countless uncomfortable glances and odd looks from the beautiful Miss Theron were about as subtle as a sledgehammer to the family jewels. I know that was the whole point, but come on, it was bloody painful to watch.Cue the 'twist', for a lack of a better word, and cue the flushing of a toilet. As far as I was concerned, at this point any semblance of interest in the original setup had pretty much been taken out into the Pine Barrens and shot in the back of the cranium. *Boom headshot!* Man, what a waste - it was a complete mess. I'd really love to extrapolate on what I'm trying to dance around, but I don't want to ruin the film for anyone who genuinely wants to watch it.Ridiculous plot twists aside, the overall acting and performance from the cast was pretty decent. We all know that Will Smith can hold his own on the screen; he's a bona fide veteran of the blockbuster, and his vulnerable John Hancock is a definite crowd pleaser. Charlize takes somewhat of a backseat to Smith, once again proving that she is not only a quality piece of ass, but a chick that can mix-up the role of a love interest and action goddess. However, of all the leads, I must say that I enjoyed seeing Jason Bateman on the big screen  I absolutely loved him in Arrested Development, so to see him in this film was a definite bonus.Overall, Hancock had a lot of potential: an interesting premise, a good cast, humor, but a sloppy, a poor story arc/plot twist that completely and utterly ruined the film. Apparently the original screenplay for Hancock, known as 'Tonight, He Comes' has been floating around Hollywood for a good ten years or more, and the word on the street is that it is actually a hell of a lot better than this reworked piece of junk. It's a shame really, Hancock could have been pretty good.Edited excerpt from: www.youseenthat.com",Hancock
343,ChristianTylerHannah,Not Loved Enough,9,25 September 2017,"Hancock I feel was unjustly criticized because the trailers marketed it as a goofy superhero comedy when in reality, it takes dramatic turns to show the dark side of being the only being with superpowers. However, I feel like it balances tones very evenly. The dramatic parts are very well done, and the comedic parts are hilarious. Hancock is a prime example of why you shouldn't judge a movie based on the marketing.9/10",Hancock

How many other heroes do you know that get sued and arrested for all the damage they caused by fighting crime? Hancock does do a lot of damage, sometimes just for the fun. But the biggest difference is that Hancock has a background that is both unique and touching at the same time. Hancock is the superhero, but his friend Ray is heroic in his own way and that adds a style not usually found in movies of this type.This is a very good movie, but very underrated by people. If you want a superhero movie that is not the normal type, you really should see this one. Trust me, you'll love it.",Hancock
345,rocketdive2001,Was there really a point to make with this movie???,2,5 July 2008,"There are superhero comics ... superhero movies ... and then there's Hancock. Anti-hero by nature, blessed with strange powers but he's a bum in reality. Quite honestly, the first few minutes of the movie makes sense, but as soon as you start to see if the movie picks up in it's plot, a strange twist just drives the movie downhill (at least for me).I'm quite okay with superhero movies, to me, even an anti-hero is a hero at the end of the day with the right story and motivation. Sadly Hancock's story and plot doesn't seem to be driving to anywhere. I'll say that if the story had a better 2nd half of the movie, i'll gladly accept the story for a superhero flick. However, right now, i'll just hint that it's an aimless movie after one point.You might say that i'm not looking with a broader perspective of the movie but really, the plot doesn't seem to be driving to a conclusion. Some movies drive it to a sequel, some drive to a prequel ... but sadly, Hancock drives the viewers away more than anything else. Quite honestly, even the decent CG for some of the scenes can't even save this movie from being labeled a ""what exactly is the story about?"" type of movie.Sadly, Will Smith did not quite pick the right movie to act in this time. If you thought ""I AM LEGEND"" was a bad movie (it's a decent but not the best around), you'll change your mind about it after you are done Hancock-ing in the cinema. I'll leave you to your opinion, but i'll share mine in case you come out of the cinema asking yourself, what were you watching for the past hour or so? Decent concept but bad execution. Will Smith did not strike gold with this one sadly!",Hancock

After watching this, I really can't tell what it was supposed to be.A comedy ? A superhero movie ? A drama ? It left with the feeling that it might initially by filmed and cut in a way which the studio didn't approve of and therefor was re-cut. I might be wrong off course, it all might be intentional.For me, nice actors, nice effects, sure, but it's not very much of a movie. A movie doesn't have to be important or deep. Some of the simple action-stuff can be really entertaining. Sorry to say, for me, this isn't.",Hancock
347,hudiefanny,A sad story about superheroes,5,16 July 2008,"Many people have said it's not a good movie. I agree. It's not. Not even close. However, they've taken it as a comedy. I'm afraid I have to reserve my opinion on that.It was funny at the beginning but turned out to be a sad love story when Mary revealed the truth. Superheroes are created in pairs but doomed to be separated since they would lose their power if they got too close to each other. History has proved that all of the superheroes were killed except them two.Mary said ""we're brother and sister"". She said ""technically he's my husband"". She didn't lie. They are immortal. Through all the centuries, the connections between them are more than those of siblings and couples. They are the only two of their kind in this world but they have to run away from each other to guarantee the safety of their lives. Is there anything else more pathetic? It's such a just-so-so movie that I hardly laughed or be impressed throughout the whole 97 minutes. But I felt a little bit touched about two scenes. One is when Ray said to Hancock ""people don't like you"", his son Aaron shouted ""I do"". The other is bearing all the sores and wounds physically and mentally, Hancock hobbled his way to far far away to save Mary.Heroes are doomed to be alone but they'll never be lonely. They have someone very special to care about and be cared back. Hancock is not able to be with Ray, Mary and Aaron but he watches them and guard them from far far away. He tells his love by that red heart on the moon.",Hancock
348,robinhoodfilms,A good premise ruined by bad direction.,1,18 July 2008,"How do weak directors land $100+ budgets? The audiences are too stupid to know what weak film-making is. Berg's shaky, hand-held (and shifting focus) style is emblematic of a director walking on to the set with no idea what he's going to shoot. Just keep the cameras moving and try to pass it off as a ""style"". This technique is (over)used in the last few years, especially in action scenes to the point where now, it doesn't seem to matter if you can tell what's happening in a scene as long as you know a lot of 'stuff' is going on. To use this same technique in a boardroom where people are sitting around talking, just pulls you out of the films and asking yourself ""what the hell is THAT about?"" The same lazy, sloppy style was used in ""Constand Gardner"", another film that suffered from for the ignornance of not realizing that this technique can sometimes work in scenes of intense energy, angst or action...but doesn't play in others. If you're thinking about the direction, the director has failed...and Berg failed through most of the movie on this one.",Hancock

350,joecunningham14,Hancock review from http://deusexmachinafilm.blogspot.com,8,3 July 2008,"FOR MORE REVIEWS VISIT http://deusexmachinafilm.blogspot.com Albeit rather clichéd and horribly over-pitched in it's marketing campaign, 'Hancock' is not your average superhero movie. It has its darker elements, it has its more comedic moments, it focuses on character far more than most and forgoes the lengthy final fight sequence that ordinarily typifies the genre. Will Smith is John Hancock, a down-and-out drunk with anger management problems and super-human powers, however he has no idea where he got them from or any idea how to use them responsibly. It is only when he meets PR consultant Ray (Jason Bateman) and his wife Mary (Charlize Theron) that he begins to realise that it might be time to improve his image and turn his life around.Will Smith is a very rare entity, an actor who almost guarantees box-office success yet also providing performances that make the Academy sit up and take notice. At first glance, Hancock may not have seemed one of the most enticing of Hollywood's outputs this summer, but when one realises that it is Smith at the helm then all that changes - such is the likability and staunch proficiency that he yields. It is tough to imagine anyone else playing John Hancock once you have seen Smith's portrayal, and nigh on impossible to imagine anyone playing him any better. He finely balances the drunken, bitter and sarcastic Hancock with the more dependable hero he will inevitably become, whilst hints of the earlier (arguably more interesting) side of Hancock's personality remain throughout.Wry humour perpetually crackles through Hancock's crude dialogue; whether it be his interaction with children, criminals, cops or his supporting cast - Theron and Bateman. Scenes between Bateman and Smith particularly sparkle, their mismatch relationship is established early and works an absolute treat. Bateman's role is reminiscent of his character in Arrested Development, Michael Bluth, imbued with an awkward naivety and will to do good, so hats off to the casting director for their choice here. Theron is initially slightly less convincing as Bateman's wife who is less than thrilled to meet Hancock, but as the story unwinds she improves vastly as the script and plot gives her potential to do so (answering any questions as to her earlier performance along the way).'Hancock' is thoroughly grounded in the real world, far more than any other superhero movie to date, and the only point when this aspect actually lets the film down is in the villain department. There is no Green Goblin here, no Joker, Magneto or even a Lex Luther...all we are given is a few thugs and a bank robber with ideas above his station. For some, this may ruin the film as there is no obligatory half-hour, city-destroying, climactic sequence between the hero and his nemesis, for others (myself included) this may be a welcome change. Instead we have a carefully structured plot, slowly revealing the truth behind who Hancock is what he must do to make the transition to archetypal hero. The back-story to Hancock is fascinating and the twist in the tale propels the story into its final act just as you may be beginning to wonder whether it has run out of steam.What could have been a parody/farce similar to 'My Super Ex-Girlfriend' has been transformed into a thoroughly entertaining watch via a script with fresh ideas and top-notch performances. Where some will criticise it for fraying the edges between being a lightweight action-comedy and a more orthodox superhero flick, I would praise it for blending these two facets superbly and maintaining its edge of originality. The closing sequences may be a bit of an anti-climax, but this, thankfully, is not enough to knock Hancock off his stride.Verdict: Possibly mis-marketed and as a result of which Hancock will surprise you - in a good way. Will Smith, yet again, does not disappoint. FOUR STARS OUT OF FIVE",Hancock
351,aka-valkra,It was great.. and then it wasn't,6,17 August 2014,"The movie was great and entertaining in the beginning because it mixed super powers with the real world. It showed what someone with super powers might actually be like in real life. The ""hero"" had good in intentions but he was clumsy, reckless, an asshole. There were no super villains or mad scientists bent on world domination, just bad guys with guns which was refreshing to see. In real life, there is no Superman, someone who's 100% good. People aren't perfect and having superpowers doesn't change that. That was the good part. The movie took a turn for the worse when they introduced the superwoman. The writers felt that they had to give Hancock a weakness which was a mistake. The movie went downhill from there with its cheesiness and crappy plot. The only good part was the beginning when Hancock was trying to win the city over. If they had just stuck with that for the entire movie, it would've been fantastic. It would have shown a journey, from loser to hero; something everyone loves to see. This movie had potential but the writers screwed it.",Hancock
352,vze2363v,LOVED IT! Super-heroes and Depth - Something for Everyone,9,2 August 2008,"If you are someone who prefers their entertainment say something beyond see Spot, see Spot run, you'll most likely enjoy this movie. For the men, it has great action. There's plenty of destruction of things and lots of bullets flying. Instead of being Batman, cookie-cutter good and evil though, this film takes a look at who we are as a society and how we (super-hero or not) can get the way men sometimes do - less than perfect.Will Smith portrays a dis-illusioned super-hero who is all alone. Like many in society have chosen to, he tries to sweep away the loneliness with alcohol until one day his path crosses a down and out PR guy who tries to help him. Having someone who actually cares about him, Hancock tries to make amends to his drunken past and in the process a twist you don't see coming is revealed.The story is sprinkled lightly with some history and in the end we learn that coping can sometimes merely be a matter of understanding the world you live in and and why each of us are here.I loved the whole super-hero thing. Let's face it - as a man, Will Smith is hot! What makes him even hotter in this movie is the fact that the dream of super-hero powers is blended with the responsibilities we all have to face, co-existing as we were meant to and how that sometimes goes very wrong.If you like your entertainment to be bolstered by giving you something to think about, this movie's the one for you.

355,maj-solo,"A comic book superhero type who's an alcoholic, not easy to do your job with a hangover.",8,18 October 2008,"This movie takes off like a rocket just like our superhero. The first 15 minutes or so is full of action and fun. Then the movie simmers down but the comedy/humor/irony gets even better. The movie doesn't spend any time explaining who the villains are they just are, and that is just how Hancock himself sees it, he does not care. But being an alcoholic, why does he care, there is no explanation, he is a superman type and so he just do what he does, only, with a hangover the job is not done with razor sharp precision so you sit there and go ""ooops"" ""ouch"" ""not good"" as you follow his erratic or seemingly not so controlled course through the city while showing bad judgment in the eyes of the citizens.Later on the movie changes mood to a bit more serious but there still is a humoristic overtone. Followed by a couple of sudden surprises that explain who Hancock really is, both to Hancock himself and the audience.To me the movie is intense in various ways so it really pulled me into it and it have action in the beginning and end and nothing whatsoever that irritated me I just sucked the whole thing in and it was a great movie.To me it was stronger and more inventive than other superhero movies so I give it higher mark, I have to give it an 8.

356,jlamarca,All new low for superhero status!,1,27 November 2008,"I know what some readers may be thinking... ""Well, of course it's an All new low for superhero status!"""" That's the premise of the movie! I'm not talking about his general (lowly) state of affairs & subsequent rise to (general) wellness. I'm talking about the standards that Hollywood is exuding to the world's youth! Within 5 minutes of opening, a little kid utters ""asshole"" from his mouth! Don't tell me that at least a few thousand youngsters, who've seen this garbage, aren't thinking that's funny AND emulating that kid! Secondly, what a travesty to the institution of marriage! I mean, a Charlize Theron is apparently HAPPILY married & then along comes Will... She allows her husband AND kid to witness remnants of her past that SHE chose to leave behind. Then next thing you know, she's back with her husband... as though nothing happened! Finally, it's also that Hollywood has an agenda with many of their films, of late, showcasing their interracial relationships. I'm NOT a racist, but AM against interracial relationships... & for anyone who's poised to attack this last gripe, with the movie, your great grandkids will be cursing you for not taking a stand to preserve racial integrity when the entire world is the colour of mud, with no cultural diversity, national pride, etc!!!",Hancock
357,himaank,Here comes the Hancock!,9,5 August 2008,"He is alcoholic, least bothered about your concerns and doesn't even give a damn about huge property loses the city faces with his heroic stunts. Thats Hancock for all of you!. This is a brand new super hero with a twisted mind and weird lifestyle. Its really good to see some one not coming out of a comic book as an adaptation. So, all you other super heroes get aside...here comes the Hancock.What is interesting about this movie is that none of the promotions were focused on highlighting any of his heroic side. A hero is some one who fights for justice and his people but here, nothing like that. That triggered lot of excitement and a new set of fan-following for this super hero. Well, I'm also one of them! I admit I am a big fan of Will Smith as an actor and as a person but this is primarily because he is a real hard working, dedicated and confident individual. A hero in reality. The best part about Willie is that you really see and feel the efforts he is putting into his work.Like any other super hero movie, this is not about fighting with a super villain and his mission to conquer the world but self exploring of an individual with extra powers. And thats why I like this movie. Something different. The director and script writer has done a good job narrating it. Movie is technically very advanced with some amazing special effects like Willie throwing the whale back in to the water, catching some junkies who have stolen money from a bank, all his flying scenes, stopping the train and fighting with Charlize Theron.The story starts with scenes about how Willie's boozing all day, catching some freaks, and how people of the city hate him. He is least bothered about any one, not even him self. Story takes a twist when he saved life of a PR guy. This PR guy has nothing exciting in his professional life and trying hard to make a good life with his wife (Charlize Theron) and son. This whole incident of Hancock saving his life hits him with an idea to do a makeover of Hancock. From bad to good, from stubborn to be humble and kind to others, from 'who cares' to 'I care'. Watching this whole shift is the most interesting part of the movie. How he convinces Willie to go for a surrender to police and Willie's inner fight to stay in the custody with out using his powers and how he eventually takes on the role of Hancock- the savior. It's sheer fun watching it all that happening in front of you.Well, there are some instances where I feel Hancock, as a movie, lacks that 100% punch. You think of Superman, Spiderman, Batman or any other super hero and what comes first to your mind is the image of that hero with a unique background score. In case of Hancock, there is no such theme song and that's something the producers could've have done it. Hancock is a new super hero, never thought of, never ever imagined. He has a different style with unexpected attitude and a theme song or a special background music would have helped in establishing a strong image of Hancock in to audiences mind. As I said earlier, its not about fighting with a super villain but still I wanted to see more actions and stunts. Sorry, I can't help it! But its a super hero anyways and everybody likes to see his or her super hero doing loads of action scenes. The movie is brilliantly executed till the climax comes. The reason and explanation of who is Hancock and what relates him with Charlize Theron is just too fast for the audience. Director could have taken little more time in explaining all this by providing more meat and content. Especially when you know that its all about exploring the inner you and what are you made of. This thing is very tricky and how you handle it and explain all this to audience is a real challenge. The name-Hancock, is also bit strange and totally unwanted. I couldn't believe it when I heard this name for the first time! Why Hancock? try something more edgy with more substance loaded with some punch.It's a sheer excitement watching Willie as a super hero and joining the league of Batman and Superman. You will always get appreciation on doing new things with lot of hard work and ideas put into your work. Same with Hancock. Audience have liked Hancock and his fan-following will grow day by day to give much needed hype for his second stint on 70mm silver screen. Just to add, Willie almost looks like Paresh Rawal (One of India's greatest character artists) in the poster where they are showing a close-up of Hancock's face wearing dark sun-glasses. Its like Babu Bhai of Hera-Pheri wearing shades instead of his typical glasses!! For those who do not know who is Babu Bhai, suggest you should watch a movie called 'Hera-Pheri' with subtitles. In the end, here's a big round of applause on behalf of all Willie fans waiting arms wide open to give him one tight hug! Welcome on board Hancock.",Hancock
358,TruthIsOutThere,Not That Bad,8,7 July 2008,"First off this is NOT your typical superhero movie, if anything it's an anti-hero movie. It starts off showing a typical day in the life of Hancock and all the people who hate him. He tries to help, but the people don't care for a drunk bum with an attitude who nearly destroys the city. Throughout the movie you see Hancock trying to get better for the good with the help of a publicity representative, who Hancock saved earlier. This movie has a feel good tone for it, since you are rooting for Hancock to get better and it shows that he can turn his life around. So if you go in thinking you are going to see a typical superhero movie, don't bother, since you'll be disappointed, but if you want to see a feel good movie with a superhero twist, you won't be disappointed.",Hancock
359,GeoffreyR,What a waste!,4,1 February 2009,"If you have a movie that stars both Will Smith and Charlize Theron, you really can't go wrong, can you? Well... you can, obviously, and this movie proves it. The only criteria for a blockbuster movie is that it needs to be entertaining. And you know what, for 45 minutes or so, it is. Will Smith is playing his role on auto-pilot but the effects are good and the story about Hancock's change of image is amusing enough. If only the movie would have been this long, I could have give it a 6 or 7.But in the second half, when they try to give Charlize Theron's character some romantic depth, the movie sinks faster than the Titanic. That woman won her Oscar by playing a psychopathic monster, what do you expect?! And on top of that, the story completely derails as twist after twist unfolds. The ending leaves you with a bitter taste in your mouth. My god, if you have a superhero movie, have the decency to put at least ONE epic fight in it! This movie sucks, it's such a waste of time and the actors' talent! My advice: rent it, watch the first 45 minutes for a few giggles and then shut it off!",Hancock
360,Deschenes,"Half Good, Half Bad",6,2 August 2008,"Hancock looked like another cheesy Will Smith movie in the commercials and it somewhat was... in the last half of the movie. At the beginning, where Will Smith was a lonely and drunk superhuman, was priceless. He was hilarious, swearing, drinking, and hurting people all in a funny way. So, not for kids under 13. But funny for the older. Smith meets a saves businessman, who is trying to make a logo to change the world, when he is almost hit by a train. And so the movie starts. It was great, until a huge secret is revealed. Then, the movie lost all it had worked for. So, for my final paragraph, I will say that Hancock is a movie to go see with a bunch of friends for laughs and dinner after, considering the shortness of the movie. I would also just go out and rent the DVD when it comes out, as a ""sleepover movie."" Anyway, this movie is NOT a Will Smith classic, only a one where too much was expected of him. If Smith wasn't the actor, no one would have liked Hancock. I give it 6 out of 10 because of the great first half and okay acting of Smith.",Hancock
361,swisswuff,Clearly discriminating and disdainful,1,28 July 2008,"I watched this movie in a rather well filled cinema.When we left, people really stared at me. And their stares were not friendly.This movie makes fun of the violent loss of first one, then the other hand, of a villain. And the villain then gets to wear a hook prosthesis.Guess what. I went to that movie wearing a hook prosthesis myself.The appearance of the villain is sneering and cynical. However, the humor is cheap and foreseeable and that is why I wonder why they could not have left such tasteless discrimination out? I did not like this situation at all.",Hancock
362,apetitefor,Could have been better,8,7 July 2008,"Hancock is a really interesting movie.It presents your ordinary superhero with his amazing abilities to fly, kick and fight with the bad guys, but in a different kind of view. The main idea of it is to show you that even the one that are chosen to be great, to be amazing, to protect us, can still have problems, which are by the way human like - drinking, failed marriages etc.Most of the time you will enjoy the jokes Hancock is dropping, because they are just the old fashioned way. It seem to me that the producer didn't want to risk with something really extravagant, because the script was already jumping on the line of fondness and dislike. And maybe this is one of the main drawbacks, because there is no bad guy, that has a beef with Hancock, actually there is no motive at all, there is no movement that can give you the idea that our problematic superhero has an opponent. Although Theron seems to show in really pragmatic way that she is the bad guy, her role has been chosen as a more of pole guide that tries to give a hint what is this story about. In other words: you have a picture, but without frame, and we know that without some of the basic components, you can't have a full masterpiece. As final words, Hancock had a great potential to develop as a blockbuster, but its poor execution forced him back, and it ended as a production you will not enjoy seeing again.",Hancock
363,NelioCuomo,Will Smith.... Give me a freaking break...,4,14 September 2008,"This movie took a fantastic concept and fell into the trap of many large Hollywood blockbusters.I was excited initially, as the story of a superhero who doesn't want to be one strikes me as something of a truer telling of superhero lore. Of course, throw Will Smith into the role and it turns into a sappy feel-good crapper.This would have been the role Tom Cruise should of played. Anyway, Jason Bateman was okay, but I don't understand why he has to play the pitied father with a dead wife who really loves his son. The whole time I was wishing I was watching ""Arrested Development."" Anyway, Charlize Theron is always hot but her role didn't make too much sense. Neither did the big ""twist"" at the end.I guess if you're bored and you feel you need to watch every single summer blockbuster to stay involved with pop culture. Hancock isn't too much of a waste of two hours or so.",Hancock

It definitely wasn't your typical superhero movie; and it wasn't originally a DC or Marvel comic. It's more about what would happen if someone with superheroes was around in modern times, and that is what makes it interesting. If there's some property damage done while catching criminals, people will be angry; if a vigilante has a bad attitude, people will be angry. I suppose Batman explores some of that not being liked by the public, as well as the bad attitude and personal trauma of the hero, but I found Hancock to be quite original in its handling of these issues. I liked the media attention and the use of sunglasses as a ""mask"" of sorts. I really liked how Hancock progresses as a character, and I liked the other characters as well. Usually little kids in movies annoy me, but the son of the supporting character was pretty cute and endearing. This isn't really a hero movie where there is a superhero and a super villain; I think it's more about what it means to be a human and relate to other people, to do good things and the desire to be accepted. I think the best part of Hancock is that it's about a superhuman who is just very human. It was a lot of fun.",Hancock
365,mag2b,Hancock ... a good movie if you can stop comparing it to every other superhero flick!,7,6 January 2009,Hancock is a good movie for teens and adults as younger viewers may not be able to take in the whole scope of the movie or appreciate some of the more adult humor.The version I watched is unrated but I'd give it a PG-13.There are periods of profanity and violence so if you are squeamish about watching or are squeamish about your children watching then I would not recommend this movie for you.Other reviewers may have stated that Hancock was no Superman or Batman and that is true in the same way that Alien is no Jaws or vice versa even though they are both monster-type movies. I don't think Hancock was trying to be Superman ... it is what it is and it should be taken as such.If you watch Hancock and DON'T compare it to another superhero flick or pick apart every little camera angle I think you will enjoy it as it is funny and the ending is touching! Just try it! Don't listen to everyone else says and miss out on a movie that you may REALLY like! If you don't want to spend the money buying it just yet then rent it or borrow it from a friend but at least give it a spin!,Hancock
366,deanperkins,"Good Comedy, Bad Drama.",6,18 July 2008,"Hancock Is the story of a particularly useless superhero, who while hated by the general public, manages to befriend a floundering PR agent. This may sound drab, but to my surprise it was actually good fun and induced a few chuckles along the way. Hancock then gets slightly too close to his only friends wife, and things get....strange to say the least.After a good run, Hancock then gives up its comedy elements, and turns into some kind of melodrama. This then unfunny comedy drags on for the final half hour until its perplexing end that then concludes the rotting narrative concocted by its director.The gags in the first half of the film are priceless and had me writhing blissfully in my cinema chair. The clever jokes then turn into Farcicle crash bang wallop sequences, probably thrown in to amuse the ice cream clad screaming children, armed with snot and tears dragged into the screen by their parents.Will Smith as usual is brilliant and continues to shine with his humour. Charlize Theron looks stunning and her acting isn't that bad. The rest of the cast are forgettable unfortunately and didn't stand out or increase the narrative in any way.This film would have scored more highly if it had stuck to its guns and stayed with comedy, rather then trying to craftily swap genre and standing out like an amateur transvestite at a beauty pageant.Still worth a viewing, but prepare for bitter disappointment as this floundering comedrama simply runs out of funny juice after 45 minutes.",Hancock
367,silkshadow,"Story=Simple; Exciting=No; Smith=Still Good;Enternatining=Kind of, yes;",6,15 July 2008,"I like to go through a simple checklist of a few simple questions when reviewing movies. The first question being: did it waste my time? For Hancock, the answer is no it did not.The story of Hancock is very simple overall, though the concept is interesting and there is a small twist which keeps the 2nd half of the movie from dragging and makes the overall movie more interesting. But I must emphasize that the story is extremely simple. The trailer gives it all except for the twist, which I won't post about as that would be a spoiler. Super-powered individual, is a drunk and not very good at it. Along comes PR man who helps him. The twist doesn't make the story any more complicated but it helps fill the hour and a half.The second question is: did it waste my money? For me, the answer is no. For you, depends... A lot of you pay an arm and a leg to see a movie. I don't understand why you put up with it, but that's another topic. I do not pay much for movies and I get digital projection, digital knock-your-socks-off surround sound and reserved seating in seats with leg room, ample padding and that recline. In that context this movie did not waste my money.This movie is entertaining in that sit back, turn your mind off and watch a movie way. It had laughs, limited but nice effects, eye candy and a simple but engaging enough story that I didn't check my watch once. There was no excitement, though, and nothing to set your pulse racing. Some people commented that this movie was lacking a villain. That is a valid point but I am not sure if a villain wouldn't have made it much worse. The charm of this movie was in its well done simplicity and a super bad guy might have tipped it into the bad, run-of-the-mill superhero movie category.A big part of what makes this movie entertaining is Will Smith. I almost hate to say it, as that guy has grown so arrogant that its a big turn off. However, he does have a way with the comedy and a charm that pulls you into a character. Both of which were key to making this movie entertaining, and he delivered.The last question is: should you see it? I would say it depends on if you are in the mood to be lightly entertained and you like Will Smith. If you're looking for a great movie experience, this is not it. If you're looking for a roller coaster ride, this is not it. If you hate Will Smith, you're going to hate this movie. If you've got time/money to kill or going to see this movie drunk or in an altered state, yeah go see it. Otherwise, you will probably enjoy it more at home for the price of a rental or the bandwidth time of your broadband.",Hancock
368,juarez-8,"Good trailer, poor film",6,17 September 2008,"I'm going to keep this review to the point. Hancock looked great in the trailer that I watched but the film itself has little to make you like it. For starters there are no proper action scenes. This is a list of the so called action scenes and rate them...Hancock stops a police chase by lifting the car up. 4/5 Hancock getshit by a train. 2/5 Hancock stops a bankrobbery by flying into the windows and taking away the robbers. 1/5Hancock fights his friends super wife in a tornado. 3/5 Hancock and his friend kill off criminals in a hospital. 2/5There is very little tension in any of them and the lack of a strong, central villain doesn't help things. The CGI is passable but to be honest your much better off watching The Dark Knight or Iron Man which know how to entertain and are both really good films. This however feels like a half hearted attempt at a super hero film sadly.",Hancock

I enjoyed the film so much that I wanted it to be longer. Charlize Theron was amazing although at first I didn't recognize her (woops!) and Will Smtih was SENSATIONAL!

I think most of them , they treat ""Hancock"" in superhero approach.But in my opinion, this is a romantic story alike.the impressive scene for me is not when superheroes fighting with each other, or stop crimes, but when Hancock leave his lover , cause he knows the only way could keep her alive is leaving. That makes me mentally cry. But, by the way I don't really like the ending. cause it makes me feel lost, if I am the director, I would make the story in the happy ending, not this kind ,I would make Hancock and Mary together, whatever ,maybe they both dead, but doesn't matter, they should be "" live together, and die "" TOGETHER"". that makes film more meaningful in my view. Anyway I still like it,it still a good film to entertain people, and nice one makes me mentally crying.",Hancock

372,soldier9428,"Very unique superhero movie, wish more were like it",8,9 March 2014,"Hancock is the story of a man who is a superhero physically but human mentally. This isn't like most superhero movies, there isn't a ton of action, there is no supervillain, and the the protagonist isn't perfect. The protagonist deals with alcoholism, clumsiness, is disrespectful, and has anger management issues for most of this film. The film centers around Hancock's public image. The city residents of LA hate Hancock for the damage caused by his actions even though he saves many people. The difficulties faced by the protagonist are what many could imagine would be the difficulties of a real life superhero rather than a comic book hero. Because of this, despite the story being about a man with super-powers. The story still feels very realistic and relatable to the audience. Many have complained about the plot twist (no spoilers) and said that it disrupted the plot too much. I don't really agree with that though as I found the plot twist to still be remaining in the context. It certainly changes some things but I didn't get the feeling that the movie was ruined because of it. If however, you don't like a movie with a lot of grey morality characters, this movie is not for you since that's basically what the whole plot line is about. If you do however, then this movie is perfect and you will love it. I would definitely recommend this movie to anybody who asked me.",Hancock

And for those who are paying attention, it has some interesting history lessons as well.I had been a little skeptical about ""Hancock"", from looking at the odd trailers for it. But because of the nature of it, they really couldn't give a whole lot away. After having seen it, I find it very odd that the critics have been cheering about this film.

377,tony-349,Handcock not your typical hero movie.,9,7 July 2008,"With movie tickets being so high these days, I like to pick a movie to take the family to see that is ""worth"" it. So far we have seen Ironman, Indiana Jones, WALL-E, and Handcock.We started not to see this movie based on the bad press that people and critics have been giving it. From my perspective, they are full of crap. This was a really good movie.The movie Handcock seemed to fly by and it was over too soon. This, to me, is a mark of a good movie. It was funny, and not your typical hero story. I am hoping that Will Smith will agree to do a sequel, as I think we have more to find out about Will Smith's character, Handcock.Bateman did a very good job, and keeps his Lilly white type character (Juno), with a bit of an edge (a.k.a. Axe man).The symbol on the moon was a nice touch by the film makers, Handcock is far too homophobic to give Ray a hug and a thank you for saving his life.I hope we will see more of Handcock and Embrey characters interact in a future movie.As for the list of movies we've seen, Handcock was easily as good as Ironman, perhaps better because the story was less predictable. Certainly better than the rest in my list.",Hancock
378,trochesset,"In a slow Summer of movies, its worth a viewing.",3,4 July 2008,"I rate Hancock 2.5 out of 5 stars, or 5 out of 10 for IMDb.May contain some minor SPOILERS.Not a completely horrible film, though just above what I would normally recommend people avoid all together, the flaws in Hancock show us why films like Transformers are good. The film begins with a lot of poor attempts at humor that just aren't delivered correctly, its missing the proper timing that make jokes work, and this is in tandem with rushed kind of pacing and editing that limit the possibilities of most scenes. It seems to me that if they let each scene run just 20 seconds longer that it would take much better for the viewer, and only add 5 or at most 10 minutes to the running time, which shouldn't eliminate a showing on the schedule.Most of the films action moments are fairly ridiculous, not just in the way they portray Hancock, because I can understand that he may not know any better, but in the way that they show police handling certain situations are so lacking in their portrayal that it makes you roll your eyes.The film starts off pretty poorly, and as opposed to what a previous poster has said, I felt that Will Smith's presence was not very electric, and that the film did not actually take off until the prison sequence.There is a very nice twist and around the 3/5 mark in which we see some real story development, but its all too rushed to achieve what it really could have. The film ended on a fairly satisfying note, and with the possibility that there may be a sequel, which I wouldn't mind at all, and there is much room to expound on who Hancock really is and there are really limitless directions that they could go with it, and be successful.So on a final note, I won't try to stop anyone from seeing Hancock, but I do wish that the film had a better director and that the studio wouldn't have made it so short in an attempt to recoup all of their money on opening weekend. I would say wait for the director's cut, but its not that serious or important.",Hancock

382,Jenova_Project,A Good Superhero and A Very Bad Superhero,4,27 June 2008,"I just saw an early screening of Hancock last night, so it's safe to  assume the version I saw will be the closest to what will actually be  on film.  ""Hancock"" promotes itself to be a different type of superhero film, but  by the end of the film, and especially by the last 30 minutes, it  degrades into nothing more than a typical summer blockbuster cliché.  The script does so many contrived turns that it becomes a little hard  to believe, even for a summer superhero film.  Here's the lowdown of what I think:  The Good: - Will Smith is always golden as an actor. It really does  become impossible to hate Hancock because Smith injects him with a  certain level of charm; additionally, Charlize Theron at least adds a  little bit of marginal tension; she's pretty easy on the eyes in all  her movies, and this is no exception  - The beginning action scene and another one in the middle of the film;  since the film really doesn't have that great of a CGI job, the action  scene really have to play up for humor; most of them are flat, but the  beginning one where he chases a car on the freeway, and another one in  the middle where he is engaged in a tug-of-war with another character  (I won't say who) is pretty funny and engaging  -AWESOME score. At times, the melodramatic nature of the film is saved  by the fact that the score is really epic and sweeping; it's pretty  easy to get lost in the film  -A really funny scene in the film where a national pundit chews Hancock  out; I'll let you see it to get the full laugh  -A cool twist that happens 45 minutes into the movie that actually adds  about 20 minutes of intrigue  The Bad: - A load of contrivances that are really convenient. Like  the Superman films, Hancock needs to make a lot of hard-to-believe  turns. Hancock really does not pull it off well enough.  - Bad CGI. Despite the $150 million price tag, the version I saw had a  lot of unfinished or really bad-looking CGI  - The cool twist. As good as it is, it takes a load of time to get  to it, and whatever happens before it just feels like its treading a  lot of water  - A horrible third act. Don't be fooled by the trailers. It's a summer  film; not a P.T. Anderson film. Of course it's going to  end with a nice little bow on top.  - Although Justin Bateman was a pretty fun character in Peter Berg's  previous film ""The Kingdom,"" he's pretty much dead weigh here. Don't  get me wrong. I love him, but he feels necessitated by the plot and his  character is really one-dimensional next to everyone else.  - Dumber than dumb villains. Instead of giving Hancock a strong  antagonist, they rely on a couple of prison hoodlums and common crooks  to fight Hancock. Without a really good central villain, there is never  much worry that Hancock will be challenged against these guys.  - Cheesier than Cheddar ending. The ending is so vomitingly saccharine  (with horrible CGI) that I really have to call the filmmakers out on  this.  So, by the end of the film, I just thought ""Hancock"" was superficially  entertaining with only a few moments of truly redeemable good times.  Like most of Will Smith's films, it's a great idea. It just wasn't  executed very well.",Hancock
383,fistjedi,Could have been so much more...,6,14 July 2008,"Will Smith as a superhero. That alone made me plunk down 9 bucks. He's practically homeless and hits the bottle pretty hard. Then when he tries to save the day he winds up messing up the city even worse. Everyone hates his guts. Then he runs into Bateman, a publicist who fixes images. Bateman and Smith butt heads for a while, and Bateman's wife (Theron) swears that Hancock can't change.First of all, I didn't really go off of the critics for this one. Usually superheros are supposed to be so good and noble, a sterling example of what we should be like. Thankfully, the superhero movies in the last few years (Spiderman trilogy, Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, The Incredibles, Batman Begins) have been exploring the inner turmoil of superheros. Hancock seems to break the mold. Will Smith's character is a mess. He doesn't even try to pretend otherwise. This is a role that you don't usually see in superheros.Second, he's a black superhero. But people don't have issues with him being black, they have issues with Hancock being such a jerk. So it started off good, and touched on some important superhero questions that are rarely dealt with: 1. Who do superheros go to when they have mental issues and drug addictions? 2. Who can really punish and arrest a superhero if he/she breaks the law, especially if there's only one superhero in town? Second, how could you keep a superhero locked up? Could you really count on his/her word that they will stay in prison? What jurisdiction do superheros fall under in a city? Are they like private investigators, reserve police officers, citizens or just outlaws? Then it all went backwards. Hancock is all of a sudden nigh immortal and can't remember squat before 80 years ago. Amnesia rarely works as a worthwhile plot device in movies, people. Remember that. Also immortality kind of places Hancock even further out of touch with the people. Then you have Theron displaying superpowers. Say what? That makes no sense. And the explanation that Theron and Smith get weaker when they are close to each other seemed kind of disjointed. First, the immortality and amnesia hadn't been worked through, and now you throw in a half baked explanation of how all the other heros died off due to wanting true love? Say what? Too many ideas and too little time to flesh them out.Second, there was no main super villain. How are you going to not have a super villain? Or at least the opportunity for a super villain...like have Theron say that there are more people like them in hibernation or in hiding or something like that...Or make Theron out to be the true arch nemesis that wants to move Hancock away because she's wanting to do something diabolical, they fight, Theron loses but vanishes for the time being. That's your second lesson, people. Always leave some room in your film for a sequel.Thirdly, why did Hancock have such average powers? Flight, super strength and invincibility. Hancock had the seeds to be so much more, but bad writing damaged it. Maybe if they do a sequel they can retcon a lot of this nonsense. Or do a reboot like Batman begins or The Incredible Hulk.",Hancock
384,BlackHawk847,Solid popcorn flick,9,8 April 2008,"I saw the movie tonight and enjoyed it a lot so here's my take: Pro's:Good special effects (even though there not all done) Excellent hour and fifteen minutes (the movie is probably 100 minutes in length if I had to estimate the pacing in that time period was spot on) Good combination of humor and action (I'd say more humor though say in the vein of Beverely Hills Cop, which had a good mix of humor and action) Will Smith nails the character (even if the character goes through a number of sudden changes out of nowhere) Even though there weren't as many action sequences as expected they all were pretty memorable especially a fight between Hancock and another superhero (I won't spoil it)A really good twist that I didn't see coming at all (when you see it you'll understand) Cons: The villain wasn't fleshed out at all in any way (they really didn't need to have one in the first place and could have changed a few of the last scenes)The last 25 minutes shifted more into a drama and didn't totally fit the character of Hacock of the first hour of the movie Charleze Theron didn't have much to work on for the first forty-five minutes besides not liking Hancock The relationship of Jason Bateman's character, Ray and his wife Mary isn't fully fleshed out and the chemistry isn't all there (towards the end Will Smith has better chemistry with her and there scenes together are juicy and easily the best parts of the last twenty five minutes) Overall I'd give the film an 8.5/10 because it was an innovative look at a superhero other then all the Batman's and Supermen we're given a truly conflicted character who isn't fully invincible. There are many quotable scenes, funny moments, and good special effects that you haven't seen in other movies before. I expect this film to make a lot of money at the box office this summer and please many Will Smith fans along with action fans or people who are looking for a solid popcorn flick.",Hancock

Hancock was a very interesting and different take on the superhero genre and i give the director and writer credit. Like the title of my comment says, it's for the older crowd. The ""profanity"" isn't that bad; a little bit of language and some scenes with Will Smith drinking fairly heavily (if you really want to count that). The action scenes were well done and the effects were fairly polished. The acting performances were decent and the script was pretty well written.HOWEVER The last half hour or so is completely different from the rest of the movie. It shifts from a light, action/comedy to an intense drama. A villain is thrown in just for good measure, but fails due to lack of time to develop.

386,drkallianc1,Will Smith Barely Keeps This One From Being Complete Trash,5,1 September 2008,"I was really pumped for Hancock when I first saw the commercials for it. Will Smith playing a disgruntled superhero whom starts to try to be a good hero, what could go wrong? Well... where should I start? First of all, I was expecting and funny comedy, but got an attempt at being a serious superhero film not based on a comic book, but fell flat. The concept itself was good, but the execution was just plan poorly done. I genuinely enjoyed the film in the beginning, Will Smith was witty and funny, but then it fell into the same old rut with an stupid story that almost anyone you pull off the street could have written. It would have been better if they had just stuck with the whole ""superhero trying to do the right thing but messing up"" idea instead of dragging it out into some bull crap story that failed to be even relatively plausible in any sense. I was so disappointed with everything that followed a certain point when they needed Hancock once again. Also, it took the movie so long to get into the real plot that it had me thinking that we were already in the main part of the story, then it just switched up on me, leaving me confused and annoyed.The movie's saving grace, the beginning. Right from when a kid wakes up Hancock to have him stop some robbers and Hancock completely tells him off, it's funny and enjoyable. Will Smith plays his role well, just like he always does and the rest of the cast does an okay job at going about their roles, none of which are academy award winners, but still good enough.In the end, a dirt poor story that hardly makes any logical sense kills and buries this movie. However, for some reason, just because the movie has Will Smith, it is almost impossible to not at least partially enjoy the film... so let's go with a 5 out of 10, with out Will Smith, it would've definitely been a 2 or 3.",Hancock

389,MadMonkInBlack,Spoiler Alert -- IMDb's lackluster tagline gives away movie.,7,13 October 2010,"Best movie in the last decade? Nah. Best Will Smith movie? Nah. However, it is a good, solid film with a bit of a different look at the superhero genre. I find it very interesting that it is so obvious that the gathered masses cannot simply enjoy that. Hell, it was hugely more enjoyable than Watchmen, which I gave away after one viewing.Frankly, I think that IMDb falls flat reviewing this film. Their outlook is pretty unoriginal. Their storyline is badly written at best as well. Also, how they could not add ""comedy"" as a genre keyword for this film mystifies me. I could go on for quite a while, but I want to concentrate on one part for a moment: But what interests me most is that IMDb threatens users with being permanently blacklisted {""If you write a spoiler without warning readers, your name will be added to a blacklist and all your future reviews will be discarded automatically and unread.""}. Why, then, have they dropped a spoiler as the tagline? I tried out this movie on the recommendation of a friend, not knowing much more than that this fellow sounded like a nasty, alcoholic ""Greatest American Hero"" who happened to be black. I was happy enough to sit down and chuckle through that.Then I checked the page for a piece of trivia, and saw that tagline and crappy storyline. IMDb had me shaking my head every five minutes going ""Ah, crap, when is going to have an affair with the guy's wife -- he would be such an ass, and the husband really loves his wife..."" Give this film a chance, boys and girls. There's a bit more out there than what you've been led to believe, spoilers and all.",Hancock
390,freakinflax,Hancock > The Hulk,9,2 July 2008,"Hancock is better than The Hulk and is as good as Iron Man, and here's why.Some reviews I've read on this board seem malignant as they continually rain on good movies parades. They actually see movies with the feeling that they WANT the film to fail. Why, so you can talk trash about it on a message board? I will start this review off by saying there's not a single thing wrong with this movie. Sure, some people feel as if they would have made it differently, but that's not them. They're not the ones behind the scripts or the cameras. Behind them is a team devoted to bringing us what we love about a summer movie: great action sequences, cool characters, and a decent story with good looking people. That's the definition of a summer movie people. Now, moving on...I thought I had seen all the best moments the movie had to offer in the previews, but low and behold I was wrong. The scenes in the trailer take place within the first 30 minutes, while the next hour is a well developed story involving superhero origins, complicated relationships and some intense action.You can pretty much guess the story from the trailer, however the movie is far from predictable; a man with super powers who is depressed wants to help the world while society shuns him. Feeling he can help, Jason Bateman's character Ray decided to invest in Hancock and make him personable again. You know he spends time in jail, hates it, then gets called to help out the city when it's in trouble. That's the story right there. Granted there are more twists and turns involving our hero but it is not, repeat NOT what you expect. Will Smith is also very funny in this movie, cursing at neighbors and children while maintaining his A-Hole approach to a hero.The story is ORIGINAL, something hardly any movie nowadays can claim, especially movies in the superhero genre. The background of the hero, as well was his powers' weakness is something I've never seen done before. And guess what? The bad guys are the bad guys! The bank robbers, purse snatchers, rapists and crooks are the people Hancock is battling against, something that all heroes should be fighting, not some made up villain that can easily match the good guy. This is why the story as well as the movie are fantastic.",Hancock
391,woodyteegra-1,Will Smith saves Los Angeles (is he downsizing?),6,12 July 2008,"Will Smith as the Superhero who needs a makeover. Its entertaining and has a slight twist half way through. Definitely worth watching but don't expect too much.Hancock despite regularly saving people is hated by the public and the police. The police are actively asking him to butt out of rescues as he ends up damaging property when he does any rescues. Oh and he hates being called an ""asshole"" (a bit like Mcfly from back to the future). One almost wonders why he bothers and from the opening scenes it appears that he doesn't always bother. But as its Will playing the role somehow through it all you see his humanity and know reformation is just around the corner...",Hancock

In all aspects..a total summer delight..has a bit of everything! True,it's not your typical superhero movie,but what the heck,i don't need a green goblin as a bad guy to be convinced..i just need to be entertained..and that's what i got when i decided to check this flick out.

393,alanjones792,"Everything right, except the most important thing - the script",5,2 July 2008,"Alfred Hitchcock, one of the greatest directors of them all, famously answered the question 'What makes a great movie?' with the phrase. 'The script, the script, the script.' Hancock is proof that The Master was 100% correct.Everything about Hancock apart from the script is in place to make a good blockbuster picture - Will Smith is possibly the best A-List actor going at the moment, Jason Bateman is a fine comic actor, Charlize Theron offers sterling support, the special effects are good, it zips along at a fine pace, Peter Berg's direction is good... everything but the script works. But the script is terrible.Hancock is a film about the rehabilitation of a drunken, foul mouthed, unloved superhero with no memory of his past (played by Smith) by a PR who's life he saves (Bateman). And the rehabilitation process is fun, witty and well-made and ends with Hancock foiling a bank robbery and becoming the hero he should be. However, this natural conclusion comes at around 45 minutes into the film. Realising that films tend to be longer than the duration of a TV Show something has to be added and it comes in the form of a truly dreadful second half in which it turns out the PR wife (Theron) is Hancock's wife and also a superhero and that, if they are too close a proximity to each other they will lose their powers. Although, in fairness, this twist is hinted at through the first half of the film it still feels like an unnatural attempt to artificially lengthen the movie and spoils much of the goodwill built up in the first half, becoming a generic, uninvolving superhero flick without a proper villain for our hero to contend with.It's a shame that with superhero films the current rage, and with the talent of those involved, that this film couldn't be a successful parody of the genre's conventions. Hancock has existed, in one form or another, script wise for 12 years. It's been rewritten several times and that probably explains why it's script is such a mess. I love Will Smith. the guy could open a remake of Ishtar at Number 1, and I could watch the guy in pretty much anything, but this is the worst film he has made (through no fault of his own) since Wild Wild West. The first half would get a 7/8 and the second a 2/3 so I'll average the two out to give the film a 5.",Hancock
394,bluesinab,You need to watch this right now,8,9 June 2021,"This is a GREAT ""Super Hero "" movie. Better than most being served up to us as of late (2021).I watched this film when it was first released and thought it was pretty good.Watching again all these years later with the worlds harshest super hero film critic, my 9 year old grandson, I now see that this film is better than most think.Love, family, Super Hero, yes some violence, but also comedy.And for me, one of the best plot twists ever. No spoiler here. You have to watch it!",Hancock
395,gograyfirego,"Hey, 'Hancock' is a great movie!",8,6 July 2008,"I don't know what some people expect of this movie but I think it was terrific! No matter what he does, Will Smith just doesn't disappoint and 'Hancock' is certainly no exception. Is it because there is a great story but it's not necessarily a non-stop action flick? This movie delivers on so many fun levels and I think it is really balanced well. It's not perfect but perfection is quite rare. Regardless, this movie is fun entertainment. Jason Bateman, Charlize Theron (dang, she looks so great) and the rest of the cast are just as wonderful as Mr. Smith. However, nothing or no one stands above Smith's incredible talent of delivering dead-pan sarcasm! I might actually go see it again just to hear some of those lines, again. And I will most likely own the DVD.",Hancock
396,yellocar,Surprisingly Good,8,1 July 2008,"The latest Will Smith effort is much different from the average big budget flashy superhero movies that have dominated the box office the last few years. Don't go to Hancock thinking you are seeing another Superman, Fantastic 4, Ironman or Hulk. The superhero angle is treated much differently here. I think part of the perception problem with this film is from the silly trailers we have seen for the last 6 months. Those trailers represent a small part a movie that is so much more to than a drunken superhero throwing a whale at a boat, swearing at a kid or wrecking the city. Sure, there are laughs in this movie, but it's Will Smith! He's FUNNY! Go see Hancock because it's DIFFERENT from the mega-budget movies that come straight from the comic book pages complete with a witty Stan Lee cameo. Don't get me wrong, I loved Ironman and The Hulk. But Hancock is not a movie that will have comic book geeks arguing on message boards about how the movie left so much out and the character was nothing like the comic. It is a film with a story that happens to be about a guy with super powers. Besides, it's got Will Smith and Charlize Theron in it! How can you go wrong?",Hancock
397,doralover,Could have been a great film,5,18 July 2008,"I like Will Smith's films. They are not great, but they entertaining. They are a good way to spend 2 hours if you have nothing better to do. This movie is not. The main problem with this picture is the change of tone. The movie started out with potential, a flawed character with superpower who needs to change his ways to accept his true calling. I am not going to spoil anything, but you will notice, there is one scene by the middle of the film when the tone changes dramatically. It becomes from a light comedy with action to a sort of melodramatic Greek tragedy. By the third act I had no idea what was going on. I mean, they tried to put so much in the last half of the film that the film falls apart. The ""villain"" is terrible. He is poorly acted and he has no motives. The climax of the film is just a train wreck. I think this film could have been 500 times better if they would have added 20 minutes of explanation and more character development. The last half of the film just did not work because there were too many things happening at once. I have a friend that liked it because he compared to Greek tragedy and mythology, and then I compared it to Superman meets a romantic soap opera and starts crying because he just does not belong there. It had a lot of potential, but it just needed to be explained more thoroughly. Charlize Theron is really hot in this film though, and Jason Bateman plays on his Arrested Development character and makes him more complex and idealistic. The special effects are great of course, but that goes without saying in a big budget Will Smith movie. Something interesting that few people have commented about is the soundtrack. It was very explicit on what it was trying to convey in some scenes, it did not sublimate with the scene, it became a part of it because of its loudness. I liked it at first, normally superhero movies have the music in the background as to build for the climax of the scene, this one didn't. It was an interesting idea, was not great because sometimes it interrupted the scene, but it was OK. In the end, this film is not worth watching. If you want to watch Will Smith watch ""I am Legend"" with the alternate ending, or even ""I am Robot"". Those films are blockbusters that want to make you watch more of it. And if you are looking for a superhero movie in which the main character is an alcoholic, then go watch ""Iron Man"". I gave it a 5/10 because I was generous. The first half of the film deserves a 7 and the second a 4 or even 3. In the end, it was just a movie with potential that crashed by the end. Nothing more.",Hancock
398,Calvinsemail,Call me an asshole one more time.....,7,5 July 2008,"Okay, now I've seen a lot of superhero movies but Hancock is by far the most unique. Hancock is like a superhero who just got his powers. While he tries to save people, he ends up hurting people more than helping them and causes tons of damage. The difference is, he never learns from his mistakes and people hate him for it. Than, one day, he saves a man's life from a train accident. This man tries to bring the world together, but is always unsuccessful. So naturally, he tries to help Hancock, and the rest is history. Hancock is an exceptionally good film and I encourage people to see it. Will Smith, as always, does an outstanding job as Hancock and the special effects were pretty good too. The plot was a little thin, and the last 10 minutes of it were kinda weird. All in all, not one of the greatest superhero movies I've seen, but it was pretty cool just the same.",Hancock

400,piccologenkidama,Halfway Decent (Literally),5,22 January 2009,"Hancock has everything going for it. It's a unique play on the superhero movie starring an excellent actor in Will Smith. And it starts very well. Hancock (Smith) is an alcoholic, miserable, lonely superhero who causes damage and insults those he saves. He's hated by the people and the press. Then unlikely savior Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman) comes to the rescue. After being pulled clear of a train by Hancock in the best moment of the movie, he decides to return the favor. Ray convinces Hancock change his image as a hero and finally rise above his very human problems, with Ray's help. It's a very entertaining start. It's not hard to imagine superheros being sued or needing publicists in the real world and the first half of the film explores those issues.Then the twist was introduced changing the movie into something completely different from what I just described. I'm not going to mention it in case any who read this plan to watch the movie. But in a movie that was already unique, this almost ruins the film. A simple story of Bateman's character healing a troubled superhero and healing his own problems in the process would have been much more compelling than a misguided origin story.There are other minor issues. Ray's wife Mary Embrey (Charlize Theron) is a poor character. I admit, I've never cared much for Theron. But I don't think anyone could have made her character interesting. She fills a purpose in the movie, but her character has little personality. The fact that she's central to the unnecessary twist only makes it worse. Then there's a gag scene involving the difficulties of Hancock having sex which isn't as funny as I'm sure the filmmakers intended.But those problems could easily have been ignored were it not for the frustrating direction an otherwise interesting movie took. I haven't said anything different than what most people who watch this movie say. So trust me, watch the first half of Hancock, then shut it off.",Hancock
401,http_nickysworld_net,Superhero sleeping on a bench... sounds painfully familiar!,7,7 July 2008,"The initial premise was very captivating and I felt that they could have done a lot more with it. A lot of the humor was rather generic and could have used some help. But what I found most disappointing was the way in which movie devolved into some kind of attempt at epic and biblical themes of angles, love, and our purpose in life; more than anything because unfortunately, this, too, was very generic in it's scripting and execution. I would have much rather preferred that the movie continue to play to our fascination and inspiration towards superheros, while playing off the interesting contrast that the misfit and antisocial behavior of the protagonist offered. Even movies with the generic angel / biblical mold such as Constantine and that Christopher Walken movie have been more exciting, with superhuman characters clashing for supremacy.The public relations bit was cool; the love triangle was not.http://nickysworld.net",Hancock
402,filipekholm,What happened?,5,4 August 2008,"I have a totally different opinion about this movie. I instead think that the first half of the movie was the better half. Simply because it had a lot more humor and better storytelling.What didnÂ't I like about this movie? well, first of I didnÂ't like the directing, it was way to shaky and confusing for this kind of movie. I allso felt that the script was very empty, they could have builded more on the character of Hancock instead of showing of effects that doesn't even look good IMO. The dialogue was flat as well and the plot was so short it felt that it was over too fast.As I said the second half of the movie takes a totally new direction and its over before you have anytime to get it in. Will Smith is a good actor, he plays the role relatively well, although its probably not a very hard role to play (Im not saying anything).To sum it all up Hancock is another of the movies that will entertain you. But certainly nothing youÂ'll remember in 10 years. it, like all movies released right now, falls into the shadow of The Dark Knight (ThatÂ's a nice line) and don't leave me touched at all. Sorry Smith, but youÂ've done better.",Hancock
403,slideon,Not bad...for a unique film,8,10 August 2008,"These days everything in the 'superhero' genre of movies is based on Dark Horse graphic novels, or Marvel and DC characters. Here comes a unique superhero movie; Hancock.The beginning is excellent. Instead of starting out with Hancock's origin, the film starts with a car chase scene. Also, like most superhero movies, Hancock is irresponisbile and makes horrible decisions. Sorry for the spoiler, but Hancock is an angel. He didn't get created in a radiation spill, or get bitten by an insect.My only negative point about this movie is that they talk about Hancock so much, they hardly discuss the villain.Still not bad, if Pineapple Express or Step Brothers are sold out, go see this movie.",Hancock
404,nehesi,"I loved the first half, before they insulted my intelligence *and* ethnicity",5,19 February 2009,"Man was this movie disappointing. I was Sooooo excited before I saw it.A Black Superhero (Finally!) Will Smith! (Yippee!) A Black Superhero who is not the sidekick for another White Superhero! (Finally). Short of a live-action Static Shock or Icon, I thought it was likely to be the best depiction of a Black Superhero since Meteor Man and unlike Meteor Man, I thought people would actually watch the movie in droves, giving lie to the belief that a Superhero movie starring a Black man couldn't do well (people seem to forget about Blade - or at least the first one). And then I watched it.It was great until about halfway through when they insulted my intelligence *and* my Blackness.Normally, I'm able to overlook *some* racial subtext in a movie unless its a movie like ""Plesantville"" - whose central message is ""color brings life"" but somehow doesn't manage put a single Black person in the movie - not even in the beginning stages set in the ""real"" world! Even though I knew going in that the movie was a ""Whitey saves the Negroes"" premise I was willing to overlook that to see an intriguing treatise on what might happen if a superhero was, as (far too) often stated in the movie, an a**hole"". They pretty much had me from Hello. . . .until Hancock tells Ray about waking up alone in a hospital and not knowing who he was 80 years ago.That's where the movie went off the rails and where I was unable to maintain my suspension of belief. I was with them to that point, glossing over the movie's physics (the ground gets ripped up when he lands, yet his shoes are fine, the throwing and catching of the French boy doesn't liquefy the boy's innards nor cause him to blackout - no pun intended, etc.) and its seemingly purposefully color-blind society (White folks in this world don't have a problem with a super-powered N****** with all the inherent threat that entails - but its only a problem that he's a mean drunk and curses a little), the criminals talking mess to Hancock, EVEN AFTER SOME OF THEM HAD FIRST HAND KNOWLEDGE OF HIS ABILITIES, etc. But him being 80 years old was too much.You're telling me that an 80 year old Black American Man, WHO HAS LIVED THROUGH THE CIVIL RIGHTS STRUGGLE, who has lived through the 60s and the 70s and the 80s is going to dress, speak and act like a 30 year old Black Man? You're telling me that this selfsame 80 year old Black Man needs little White kids to tell him its time to be a superhero? He needs a Great White Saviour to tell him not only when its time, but how to become respectable and even how to talk (""Good Job"") to people? In 80 years Hancock didn't figure any of that for himself? On top of this, compare Hancock to other recent superhero movies: Iron Man (White!) gets to be a wealthy, super-genius. His alcoholism is only alluded to in the movie (even though its a central part of his character in the comic books). Batman (White!) gets to be a wealthy, super-genius. Superman and Spider-Man both get to be productive members of society. The Hulk, when he isn't hulked out is a scientist! Make the superhero Black and all of a sudden he's a bum, unable to succeed in the world until the Great White Saviour comes in and teaches the savage, but powerful Black Man how to behave and speak. In addition, if you were to change the ethnicity of Batman, Spider-Man, Superman or Iron Man, there's no need to change the movie. Hancock being Black in our world changes this movie (or would have if the writing was better). Case in point, the infamous kiss (some people say they saw it - the version I saw didn't have the kiss in it).When Hancock goes in for the kiss, she doesn't say no, this isn't right cuz I'm married, she doesn't gently push him away, SHE THROWS HIM THROUGH A WALL. Not only does she repudiate him strongly, they lose their abilities when in proximity to each other. In effect the film is saying ""Stay away from the White Woman, Black Man, cuz if you don't you will lose your power"". The film is saying the Black Man can't be a productive member of society until a kindly White savior comes along and teaches him how to be (and speak), despite the physical power of the Black Man. The film is saying that Black Men will be unhappy as long as they go after the White Woman, who gets to be happy and raise a family. All of this subtext gets added when you have Will Smith as the leading man and to have all of it ignored on top of the other issues with the movie was a slap in the face to Black folk.If the movie had remained a comedy, with the initial tone intact, it would have been kewl. If it had stayed on the ""drunken, sullen superhero""premise, it would have been kewl. If they had even stuck with the love story angle and not tried so hard to inject comedy and so hard to setup a superhero fight, it would have been kewl. As it was, it was a mish-mash of cool ideas and murky CGI stuff. . . I logged into IMDb to see if David Goyer had written the script cuz Hancock reminded me of Blade III, when Goyer didn't have a good director reigning him in and got to vomit *all* of his ideas onto the screen.",Hancock
405,AngelDel,An oddly enough ride.,6,14 May 2010,"Hancock is enjoyable, but has three little drawbacks: Will Smith, the clumsy usage of visual effects and (how not so?) the script .Although Will Smith has proved that he can act like an actual actor (see the heart-warming The Pursuit of Happiness), most of the films he gets involved in are just commercial blockbusters, with all their negative connotations (his first actual big-screen hit, Independence Day, may have set the tone...). And if he can get involved in the production (and he does again in Hancock) and show off a bit, better still. Show off chest muscles, or backside, or simply poses... You can tell he likes that. He shows off less minutes than in previous films, but he shows off. Just like in I, robot, or I am legend. Still, there's something about Will Smith's presence that stops you from hating him so much despite all this. Odd. Whether this is charisma or not, or whether this film should have been called ""I am Hancock"" is obviously not the purpose of these lines.All the visual effects from the trailer and used as bait seem to happen rather soon in the film. Which is good, since they aren't anything special or unseen before. After that, for a moment, it seems the story will acquire deeply human overtones and leave effect in the background... but then the film takes an unfortunate and inexplicable path and we come back to visual effects ad infinitum. No surprises here.But we also come back to a much darker atmosphere that changes the style of the film and that (again) seems to be uncalled for. There is a similar confusion with the genre itself: comedy, more dramatic at times, ""adventure"" parts, ... The surprising and unconventional approach probably comes from the intention of making a different superhero film. In practice, however, the producers truly seem indecisive about this, and so ended up creating a strange hybrid creature.All the above, plus the fact that the relationship between characters is awkward and twisted results in, yes, an entertaining film, but one that doesn't make the most of itself or even reach the end of the story looking like it's the end of the story. If you are reading this in disbelief, go and watch it: the cleaners may have to kick you out, because you won't believe the film is over. As spectators, we are entitled to a fulfilling experience. And if a script doesn't give us this ultimate experience, then we feel emptiness in our film goer hearts. Subconsciously, we ask for more and we can't help cursing the experience.",Hancock
406,efrain911,Hancock a fun and thoughtful action-comedy with Arrested Development references(?),7,27 June 2008,"i saw a press screening of HANCOCK this week and I enjoyed it. At first it starts out with some typical hokey action-comedy, but then it starts getting 'serious'. I agree that there might be some imbalance of tone on occasion, but i liked the seriousness combined with big action, humor and a great message.Some of the cgi work looks a bit too cartoonish and the movie could probably benefit from less of the typical 'comic hero' elements in regards to costuming and certain plot elements, but overall it's a cool movie.If anyone is an Arrested Development fan, you might notice some odd visual references in Hancock (other than the fact that Bateman and Theron are in this movie). I wonder if any of the filmmakers are somehow connected to the show.",Hancock
407,tomok97,A lackluster blockbuster,4,2 July 2008,"Hancock is like communism: a great idea on paper but it in the end, it's just doesn't work.Hancock (played by Will Smith) is a ne'er-do-well superhero. Sure, he'll save the day but he'll most likely do millions of dollars worth of damage in the process. He's drunk, sloppy and surly (my three favorite dwarfs). When Hancock happens to rescue P.R. man Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman) from an oncoming train, Embrey decides to repay him by focusing his marketing skills on Hancock.In a running gag, Hancock has an aversion to being called a certain insulting term (Hint: it ends with ""hole""). Every time he hears it, he feels compelled to react to the person using the word. What's that you say? As a matter of fact, it is just like Marty McFly in Back To The Future II & III. It was a silly plot device then and it's a silly plot device now.This movie feels like three different films cobbled together. There's the ""funny"" Hancock, there's the ""grim and gritty"" Hancock and there's the ""action/adventure"" Hancock. Any of them could have workednone of them did.Movies of this sort often create their own rules when it comes to the physical laws of nature. But if a film is going to do that, those rules need to remain consistent. At one point Hancock begins to lose his powers. But while this makes him no longer invulnerable he still posses his super strength. At another point, Hancock throws a child what must have been at least a mile in the air (and this is the ""funny"" Hancock, by the way) and catches him while standing still. In the real world, even if Hancock would have caught him he would have, at best, broken the kid's back. In a movie with a lighter tone, perhaps a Spiderman movie, this wouldn't be too much of a problem. But Hancock wants to be somewhat grounded in reality. Hancock is facing multiple lawsuits, he's wanted by the police but they have no real way to apprehend him because of his superpowers, when he lands at full speed he destroys the pavement. So when they completely break with reality for a cheap joke, it rings hollow.What little positive there is in this film comes from Will Smith and Jason Bateman. Smith and Bateman have real chemistry and it's a shame they weren't given something better to work with. While Bateman isn't really a big enough star to haggle over the screenplay quality of a summer tent pole picture, Will Smith most certainly is.For a screenplay that's supposedly been floating around Hollywood for over a decade, this movie seems hastily made. If you've ever wanted to see a superhero film without a super-villain, here's your chance. (And you might want to hurry because judging by the quality of this movie, I'm guessing it's your last chance.) I'm not really sure who this movie is for. It's too dark for younger kids and too juvenile for adults.The special effects are overly cartoonish. On more than one occasion, the director tries to hide substandard effects by having the camera move in a shaky, jerky fashion.Hancock is a mess.On a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being Men In Black and 1 being Wild, Wild West, Hancock gets a 4.",Hancock

409,Matttttttttttt,How Did This Get Messed Up So Badly?,5,4 July 2008,"How can a movie with this much potential turn out the way it did? You're given a large budget with actors like Charlize Theron and Jason Bateman. Then, you add Will Smith, the biggest box-office draw on the market. It must take an absolute mess of a director to ruin a film with this much potential.The movie rides on special effects. For the most part, they're well done, however, some scenes prove otherwise. For instance, when Will Smith is flying on the freeway, it is extremely obvious that it was all done on a green screen. In fact, many of the special effects look as though they weren't completely finished.As for the performances, they're the best part of the movie. Will Smith will keep you laughing as always. Jason Bateman continues to prove that he deserves great roles. All-in-all, this is the best aspect of the movie.The story, however, is the downfall of this film. There is a twist halfway through the film that will make you cringe with disgust. And the explanation for it all is even worse. Sure, it all makes sense, but it is incredibly stupid. The humor is often misplaced in the film and the director must have had an identity crisis in regards to the film's genre. It goes from G-rated family comedy dialogue (not in a good way) to drama to comedy to action and all the way back again in a matter of several minutes. Now, I don't mind when a movie crosses genres, but this movie does it poorly.It's sorely disappointing that a movie with so much potential turned out as poorly as it did. It will make money nonetheless, but the fans deserve better than this predictable, mediocre film. Will Smith will give you enough entertainment, but even he can't save the movie.

The beginning of the movie isn't bad. It's actually kind of funny, but once Hancock turns into a good guy the funny kind of fades away. Also I thought Jason Bateman did a great job in his role. A little out there but i think he held his own with his presence on in the film standing toe to toe with Will Smith. And now on to things that could have been worked on: The movie's pretty predictable, which will be obvious to you after you see it. You can kind of guess where it's heading between Will Smith's Character and Charlize Theron. My biggest issue with the movie is all the holes. Who is are They (the people apparently after Will and Charlize)? Why were they created genetically linked to the one person who makes them mortal? The whole idea makes the superheros, gods, angels, whatever seem selfish. They all died off to because they had to be together with their pair and be mortal instead of using their powers to help the earth? Seems kinda anti-good guy right? Also we never really learn the true identity of John Hancock except how he got the name Hancock. I think it would have been cooler to look more into his past and how they came to be and ""past lives"" and stuff. I dunno. It's up to you. I think it's worth seeing and it's decent but not even close to the best movie out in theaters. If your debating between seeing this or Wall-E or even Wanted you may wanna choose the latter 2.",Hancock

412,Chrispatschack,Hancock: A real let-down to the slot of summer films,5,30 July 2008,"The idea seemed interesting at first, a drunk superhero. In the end came a movie that didn't turn out so great. I was expecting another fun Will Smith Comedy. What I got was something that turned out to be utterly...what's the word? lame. basically from beginning to end it was nothing but Will Smith drunk, flying around and breaking things. So there was nothing else that contributed it. Only one good one-liner came out of his mouth. It also proved that Charlize Theron can not pull off a comic movie, no offense I think she's beautiful and was fantastic in MONSTER'S BALL. Overall I was completely disappointed with this movie. But mainly, I'm disappointed in Will Smith generally. I started not to like him the moment he began to study scientology and began to befriend Tom Cruise.",Hancock
413,Biofriend,The other side of super hero,9,18 August 2013,"I was amazed by the reviews in meta critic and low score. Not that I don't rely on these score to choose what movie to watch and what to skip but Hancock is a real exception.The movie rather than showing the all powerful side of the superheroes and the wonder of being immortal; the movie the showcased how lonely can a superhero be, if he is living an immortal life. The romance between the immortal pair who becomes mortal and victim of attacks was so beautifully shown that I watched the movie more than a dozen time.Will smith is so much believable as the lonely superhero. Neither the super powers of Hancock nor the action scenes makes these movie a wonder for me but it is the vulnerability and the undying love.I will simply recommend you to watch the movie without the superhero angle, it is only an added plus.Believe me giving a 9 to this movie is totally justified.",Hancock
414,Ken123456789,Review: Hancock (2007),4,27 September 2008,"Hancock Will Smith is the king of the fourth of July weekend, which has led to him receiving the nickname Mr. July. Will Smith's first fourth of July weekend movie was Independence Day. After its success other movies like Men In Black 1 and 2 and Wild Wild West were also released on July 4th. So, is Hancock a worthy addition to Smith's Fourth of July movies, or is it another July 4th failure like Transformers?Hancock(Smith) is one of only two superheroes left in the world. He is hated by the public because he leaves millions of dollars in damage after stopping a crime. After he saves the life of Ray Embrey(Bateman), they enter a partnership to help fix Hancock's image with the public. They send Hancock to prison so the public can miss him. After the crime rate soars, Hancock leaves prison a changed man. He cleans up the crime, but starts to enter a risky relationship with Mary Embrey(Theron). He will then learn about his past and his possibilities for the future. Hancock's characters start off promising, but don't go anywhere after the first act. Hancock is a very unique led obviously, as the movie bears his name. After the first act though, he's done changing and becomes Mr.Perfect. Ray Embrey is a man trying to change the world, but is currently failing. I think a lot of us can sympathize with the guy. Mary Embrey is the one of the worst developed characters and she hurt the movie the most. Her character doesn't go anywhere and there is nothing special about her. The same goes for her child. Hancock has terrible, last second villains. They barely ever speak, and worst of all, they're just regular people with guns. Hancock's plot had promise, but the execution was terrible. The structure is the worst that I've seen in a long time. The first act tries to do too much, while the second and third act is stretched to make the movie long enough. The movie also switches genres from a light hearted action/comedy to a serious drama. The first act, the action/comedy, was fun to watch and made it look as though this was going to be one of the best movies of the summer. The second act came though, and it switched to being a drama. There is a nice twist, but it isn't well made enough to be called good drama, and wasn't very entertaining. Hancock has a terrible ending. The climax is an easily won battle in a hospital, but that isn't the worst. The resonance at the end was stupid and one of the most illogical things ever seen on film. Hancock puts a heart on the moon for Ray and Mary. Did he use the blood of humans to paint it, since buying paint would cost at least two billion dollars? Did he enslave NASA workers to paint it, since if only he did it, it would take at least five years? Are Ray and Mary really that stupid they need someone to tell them there's a big heart on the moon?Hancock has a very bland setting. The city apparently has a very high crime rate, but it seems as though everything is going just dandy. Batman has Gotham City. Spider-Man has New York City. Hancock has just another run of your mill city. The prison was a very boring place and it wasn't even a very scary one. The hospital was a terrible setting for the ending. Hancock has bad directing, mainly because of the action scenes. They are filmed very poorly because the director moves the camera around very fast to try and create an atmosphere, but it does the exact opposite. He never creates an effective atmosphere, and never uses the right shots to maximize the setting's potential, if there's any. Hancock has OK cinematography. It doesn't take away from the film, but not as good as Iron Man or The Dark Knight(basing it off the trailer). Hancock has bad music. The action music barely adds anything to the movie, and the dramatic music is overdone and takes you out of the story. Hancock actually has good acting. Will Smith is always a good lead, and he doesn't mess up. He has good chemistry with the other actors and always brings his own style to the role. Will Smith is also great with body language, which is he has shown in Pursuit of Happiness, I Am Legend, and Hancock. Jason Bateman does a good job with his role and was the perfect person to play the part. Charlize Theron is the weakest of the three actors, but she's still OK. So, Hancock isn't as good as Men in Black or Independence Day, but it's better than Wild Wild West.BAKED FRESH FILM BOTTOM LINE 4/10Pros: Acting First Act Nice TwistCons: Character Development Structure Switches genres Action scenes filmed poorly/ rest of directing Music SettingRating Information PG-13 1.

415,terrencecmay,TOO much hand-held camera work,4,26 November 2008,"Way too much hand-held camera work!!! Why does Hollywood think shooting a undramatic conversation or a still shot looks better with the camera bouncing all over the place. Directors must be playing to the MTV generation or attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder patients. I did really like the movie but it would have been much better if it were not a blur most of the time. With good camera work this could have been a great one, instead it comes up just another Hollywood money grabber and who cares if it makes you sick....I'm Sick of the Bourne Ultimatum, MI3 hand cam stile, use a tripod!TerryBut, after watching it again, I'll give it a 4. Despite the camera work...",Hancock
416,Archblood,Near Cocked Up,5,4 July 2008,"Will Smith's latest blockbuster sees him as the title character, John Hancock, an alcoholic superhero who has become public enemy of the residents of LA for causing more collateral damage in the city than the criminals he's 'helping' to apprehend. After a dramatic rescue in which he saved the life of public relations spokesperson, Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman) but not without attracting further anger over the way he handled the situation, the grateful Embrey began his best efforts to savage Hancock's reputation and make him a more likable figure to the already outraged public.The movie opens with a typical gun battle / car chase scene in which Hancock managed to capture the gunmen but ended up impaling their vehicle through a needle-like structure of a building, thus receiving even more furore. All these led to Hancock's imprisonment, only possible after Embrey convinced him that a jail term will confine him from the city, causing crime rates to shoot up without his presence, in turn leaving the authorities and people with no choice but to call him back. When Embrey's plan works after Hancock's well praised efforts in rescuing hostages during a bank heist, Hancock immediately became popular overnight. He was also a regular guest at Embrey's household that he began to attract the attention of his wife, Mary (Chalize Theron).The story of Hancock plays on the regular theme of redemption and purpose. There's nothing fresh in direction and plot, just your usual dose of action and superhero dilemma. Smith, however, has proved that he's not just a charismatic celebrity who brings in massive earnings at the box office but also a seasoned and skillful thespian who had demonstrate his qualities in movies like Ali and The Pursuit Of Happiness. This is without exception for Hancock, a character he managed to play with much heart and successfully portrayed the weary and troubled personality of the rejected superhero. Bateman and Theron did considerably fine in their supporting roles and for a while as the movie progresses, there seem to be promising signs of a good action film in the coming.This was not to be. The surprising plot twist in the middle of the story began to flung the plot into a literal storm of strange revelations, an even stranger account of Hancock's origin, the sudden and uncomfortable development between Hancock and Mary that's not getting the chemistry working and more emotional drama, splitting the later half of the film into a mood not quite like the earlier part that comprised of comedy and some light drama.Granted, while the cast had done their best, director Peter Berg just leave us wondering. If you are in for watching Hancock because of the action, you probably won't be disappointed much though one particular scene is kinda overdone. But take in mind: this might be one of Smith's best performance, still it does not automatically qualify Hancock as one of his best films.",Hancock
417,unrealban,Hancock .. more like Handjob,3,31 August 2008,"For what was supposed to be a mega blockbuster hit turned out to be a poorly written script with an A-list cast frivolously attempting to bolster the film. Another example that you can put the biggest names on the screen but with no script it fails.I will say that Will Smith dishes out a brilliant performance as the neglected superhero who distastefully annoys the American public with his reckless acts of drunken destruction. He does a great job of making you care for his character but the plot is so aimless there is almost no suspense involved therefore rendering all of the characters useless. It's as if the writers had to cough up an idiotic draft for the studio and the producers we're just as moronic to accept it. Honestly who would've approved of that mindless twist that they throw at the audience as if we're supposed to go along with it? At this point I was about to yack on my friend sitting next to me.This movie is a prime exemplification of an egotistical Hollywood holstering too much money and power with little talent to deliver the goods. I walked into Hancock expecting an epic adventure that would satiate my entertainment needs, but I ended up strolling home wishing I had given myself a Handjob instead.If you enjoy flying humans bashing through skyscrapers with unlimited force then this might be for you. However if you teeth for plot and cling to suspense, then you may consider passing on this one.",Hancock
418,thewarriorsfan666,Half-cocked Hancock.,2,5 July 2008,"On paper, Hancock has promise: a drunken superhero who halfheartedly saves the day with a devil-may-care attitude, could provide a nice counterbalance to the secret life of a superhero. But about halfway through, the film gets rid of its interesting premise and settles for a origin tale that is baffling at best, and stupid at worst. The narrative clogs frequently and simply is very odd, as for a superhero pic there isn't much action to behold and the script basically gives no one anything to work with. That's a problem when your main character is basically a lush version of Superman, as it could've provided a nice satirical tone on the perception of superheroes, or least have some fun with it.Unfortunately, with the premise thats supposed to draw audiences in gone and basically very few action scenes to hold much interest, Hancock can't seem to stay together without characters to care about and actors who can't quite pull it together. Whats more disappointing is that Peter Berg is apart of this mess. He directed the very good Friday Night Lights and the Rundown. Whatever good will he garnered with those flicks is almost erased by his script, which is not only dumb by itself but the doctoring by no less than 4 other writers makes it worse. making the film not only undercooked but overdone.The acting is a bit of a mixed bag. Will Smith struggles from time to time, obviously an effect from a tone-deaf script, but is his usual engaging self. Charlize Theron is worst of the bunch, however, as her character who is quite simply terribly conceived. Her role goes from annoying to simply implausible by the time the plot twist kicks in. Jason Bateman turns out to be a bit of a saving grace, at least in the first half, but is pushed out of the way during the second half, with the script ignoring him constantly.Overall, despite Bateman's valiant attempts to save this turd, Hancock is half-cocked with with too many vague, uninteresting ideas, uneven acting, boring action scenes, and quite simply the worst origins for any superhero. Avoid at all costs.",Hancock
419,mr-payton,"Gets off to a good start, then gets tripped up",6,1 September 2008,"I think lots of folks have said the same thing: Hancock is two movies in one.You got the first half. Enjoyable stuff. Will Smith does a good job keeping his acting subtle. He wasn't the best choice for the role as some people say--but he plays Hancock convincingly as a guy who just doesn't care and wants to be left alone. Jason Bateman's everyman character plays off of Hancock pretty well, especially considering he wasn't developed too far.The script is pretty shaky though, especially when it comes to Charlize Theron's character. The repeated piercing stares from her at Hancock were so goofy and obvious, it killed the foreshadowing to the big twist. I know you have to add some kind of suspense, but make it a little subtle, man.Good sell scenes like the little French kid getting tossed into space made the first half worth watching. This, combined with Will's charisma and Bateman's straight man status, gave us a decent superhero buddy flick.Now, the second half of it was all over the place, and hard to swallow. The plot twist where we find out Hancock and Mary were...well, whatever they were supposed to be (the dialog never really went into detail beyond them being designated protectors of the earth) was really rushed, and the whole movie went down because of it.Will had to drop his cool indifference and look to let himself fall into a hackneyed love story with no real build up. Bateman's character was made irrelevant. The villains were lame, also because of the lack of build to the climax. Worst of all, the concept of the rejected superhero was completely let go, which is a powerful irony when you think about it.So...what we have here is a comedy popcorn flick that turned into a boring drama just as it was getting interesting.",Hancock

Will Smith is awesome in this film! His first superhero movie, wow! Including Charlize Theron's as well. As a superhero, Hancock has done a lot of destruction in Los Angeles, which is why he is not called your typical superhero. Both Hancock and that woman are sensitive people when someone insults them. It may need to be previewed by parents before any child under 13 can see this film. It may be a little offensive for them to watch. There is language in this film. Sometimes, there is action and could've had more action into it, which would have made it much greater film to watch.Watch this film, it was funny!!!!!!!!!!!!!",Hancock
421,link_nich,It's not bad but not good,6,4 August 2008,"John Hancock, the amnesiac super hero people love to hate, good concept, but it was a bit on the ""so what"" side. The first half hour or so, I found myself to be quite entertained...but come 45 minute mark my mind slowly melted into a fine goop used for cleaning floors with.It was a funny film I'll give you that, which meant it completed what it was set out to do. Will Smith and Jason Bateman gave good performances... but it was Charlize Theron that made my inside curl, her ""Hancock shouldn't be here"" looks were cringe-worthy... not to mention the very elaborate background story between Hancock and her character.One other thing I'd like to point out, is that just after saving one person, everyone who hated him before suddenly forgot all his previous mishaps and a certain $9 million bill of destruction. Either way, it is an enjoyable film, just don't expect to laugh out loud and split your sides....It isn't your average Will Smith film.",Hancock

The first half hour is cool, we have a lot of action and we meet Hancock. But later the movie turns a boring and senseless drama, which is not good.Will Smith is a great actor, but unfortunately he can't save the movie. Jason Bateman is really a cool guy, but he also can't save the movie. Charlize Theron is really beautiful, but your role is annoying.And one of the big problems of ""Hancock"" is that the director and the writers don't know if is a action, a drama, or a comedy movie.""Hancock"" is entertaining, but could be much more.

The city has a love hate relationship with Hancock, because he stops crime, but only because he's bored and likes to cause unnecessary damage. Enter Jason Bateman, a PR manager who tries to turn Hancock's life around by inspiring him to become a hero everyone loves.That's where the movie stops being fun and the scripts just shoves plot twists at you to keep you interested. The angle about ""human"" follies of superheroes is completely wasted by an overly simplistic script.What really is a let down are the performances. Smith is above average, as usual but nothing great. The rest of the cast just moseys along as if being forced to work on this project.It's still a great watch on a lazy afternoon but it could have been a whole lot more",Hancock

I'm a fan of Spiderman but I gotta say Hancock pretty much beats it for me. First kudos to whoever came up with this story for going away from stereotype everybody-loves-the-superhero.Hancock has it all. Recently we have seen flicks like Spiderman-3 losing itself in everything else by going to make it big in special-effects. Although I will never ever understand how The Dark Knight got to be such a hit, it didn't have a plausible plot(although many claim that the story was the strongest aspect of the movie) or the big-budget special effects.But Hancock delivers it all. I cannot understand why it did not make it big like Spiderman or Dark Knight or Iron Man. Because this movie is right up there with the others, if not above.Hancock has everything in it. Nice story with good special effects and humor. And its Will Smith! He delivers all the time! This is a must-see movie! for everybody!",Hancock
425,greamamerican,a OK movie who isn't about a superhero,7,28 July 2008,"i saw that in theater the day it came out and It was OK for this action comedy film. Will smith stars as Hancock, an down and out alcoholic superhero living in Los Angeles who fight off crime for prove of justice but unfortunately caused millions of dollars of damage and people wanted him to stay away of L.A as possible. In addition, Hancock foul mouth language and Drinking problems causes the public to despise him. Until one day he saves a man named Ray(Jason Bateman)who was stuck in the railroad and a train nearly derailed him. Ray proves that he will make Hancock a better image for the public so he would be popular again. Though this is a OK pointing start of the story, i have to say thee are mistakes for the film. Though budget for the film is $150 million dollars, i would have to say it looks they have a unfinished CGI or just plain old 70's effect. It also lacks central villains which hurts the movie potential a lot. It also too short too which runs for about 90 minute. They should have add 10 minutes longer to it. Overall this film isn't about a superhero it about a movie about a superhero who is just plain human. It also about a superhero what happened around modern times instead setting the imaginary Utopian future. Anyways I would say this is a worth summer seeing and when they do make a sequel, they should fix the mistakes of what they should do.",Hancock

There are people dying in Africa and people are spending millions on this,lol, to a lesser extent promising film directors and writers are being over looked and stuff like this is being made... Sorry cannot contain rage. The movie actually starts off really well, but about 40 mins into the film it literally loses the plot, it just spirals out of control. Like a couple of stoners found half an excellent screenplay, skimmed the pages and then wrote the second half completely baked making it up as they went along, then made the film and then have it released without anyone actually seeing it.

427,Shrdlu123,Missing the point for the film's Conflict,10,6 January 2009,"This, I believe, is my first comment; so be kind.Yes, you're all correct. There is not a ""strong central villain"" in this film. But you're missing the point. The conflict is Hancock Vs. Himself. His choice at the end of the film is what drives it to be a far better movie than most Super-Hero films (that and it's setting in mostly real life).Think of it as ""Bad Santa"" for the Super-Hero genre, but more agreeable to a larger audience (nothing against Terry Zwigoff at all).Anyhow, I'm not a big fan of ""genre"" categories anyhow. Take each film on its own.",Hancock
428,KateB819,One of the best and most surprising movies I have seen in a while,9,10 July 2008,"Hancock is a movie about how an arrogant, selfish man with no past slowly becomes a better man and more of an altruistic superhero that learns of his past. He does this with the help of a public-relations spokesperson, Ray Embrey. Fortunately, the movie has more than a ""growth of character"" story  it includes the prison break of some prisoners Hancock put away or humiliated that aren't too happy with him, who wind up as the main villains of the film. As a plus, Mary Embry, Ray's wife, has a secret up her sleeve, which the audience doesn't learn about until about halfway through the movieIt all started out with my best friend having a crush on Will Smith. She asked a group of my friends to go see this new movie called *Hancock*, which I had seen the trailer for. And I figured that the incredibly sexy Charlize Theron was in it, so the only downside was that  from what I had seen  the movie didn't seem to have much of a plot.After sitting through ninety-three glorious minutes, I am proud to say I was wrong in my assumption that the movie wouldn't have a plot, and that I am glad I saw this movie. This movie is easily one of the best movies I have seen in a while.Okay, let's take it from the top. I'll admit, I wasn't too much of a Will Smith fan. I didn't dislike him  and I have seen I, Robot; the Men in Black movies; Wild, Wild West; I Am Legend; and Hitch. I'd say it was more of a neutral feeling towards him, one of those actors you don't mind watching but won't go out of the way to see. Will Smith in this movie completely surprised me by being able to play not only the sarcastic, self-centered a-hole he was supposed to portray, but being able to shift with ease into a likable and admirable superhero in the short span of an hour and thirty-three minutes. The audience learns to hate Hancock in the beginning, but quickly falls in love with the character, which goes through such a drastic change in just one movie.The highlight for me was Charlize Theron, who looks so gorgeous and stunning in the movie that I can't quite put it into words. Being a large Kate Beckinsale fan, I find it hard to concede when I see another wonderful actress on screen that isn't Kate. I was a fan of Theron from Aeon Flux and a few other films, and was already aware of her beauty, complete with her incredible ability to act, as well. This film, however, bumped her up my list of favorite actresses to the second slot. Like Will Smith, she was able to pull of the role without much of an effort. She handled the physical part and delivering her lines of her character incredibly well. She was very capable of selling herself as Mary Embrey. Theron and Smith had an amazing and rare chemistry.In fact, all the characters had good chemistry. The partnership of Hancock and Ray Embrey (played fantastically by Jason Bateman) was another a very believable pair. The pairing of Ray and Mary also created a decent couple. All the reactions and actions of the characters were understandable and realistic (as realistic as they could be).Another great aspect of the movie is the plot twist. (**Spoiler coming up, people!**) In the beginning of the movie, Mary (Charlize Theron's character) gives off a vibe that she knows Hancock somehow, especially from the negative comments she continuously makes about Hancock and his actions. With roughly 40 minutes left in the movie, it is revealed that she is actually Hancock's soul mate and that they are ""gods"" (or ""angels"") created about 3000 years ago. (**End of spoilers**)The rest of the movie is filled with nicely done action scenes, some heart-felt dialogue, and a terrific conclusion. Unlike a lot of movies that leave something to be desired, or wrap everything up in a rushed manner, Hancock concludes in a way that leaves you satisfied that you saw the movie and happy for all the main characters. (Yes, unlike I Am Legend, this movie has a happy ending)The only complaint I heard from this movie out of all my friends (there were six of us) was that they don't explain everything at the beginning. I don't see the problem, since the writers explain everything later in the film without ruining the action flow and without leaving plot holes (none that I can find at the moment, anyway). They do this (and do it very well) in order to keep the audience interested in Hancock and Mary's backgrounds. As I said before, the plot and action do not interfere with one another at all, so the only thing I can say in reference to the complaint about an explanation too late in the movie is to chalk it up to my friend's small attention span.So, for those of you that either believe the critics or were ready to pass this movie off as another mindless, action-packed film, DON'T. The movie has a perfect mixture of plot, character development, and action stuffed into a ninety-three minute movie. I'm giving it a 9/10, only because this movie was too short. :)",Hancock
429,cmcmanus60,Fix the final Act PLEASE!!!,6,8 June 2008,"I also was at the test screening in Peoria AZ. The film was spot on for the first hour. Jokes were hitting left and right, Smith and Bateman displayed good chemistry, and the special effects, though not always finished, were eye popping nonetheless.Without giving it away, the final half hour was flat, straying from the comical nature that had preceded it and instead tried to get philosophical and introduce a week paint'by'numbers villain. I spoke with director Peter Berg after the film and he seemed fully aware of the issues relating to the final act. Hopefully the recent ""re shoot"" will polish up that last act, making Hancock one of the must see blockbusters of the summer. In the form I saw it; it still has a ways to go.",Hancock
430,Sirus_51,"Falling down, getting up and old loves and heroes.",10,2 July 2008,"SPOILERS - YOU ARE WARNED Hancock is an interesting mix, we start off simple enough. Hancock ( Smith) is your everday Superman who drinks, flies and does massive property damage. He doesn't seem to care and the public don't care much for him either.Enter Ray Embrey an idealist who sees more in Hancock and decides to help Hancock earn the public Trust, also enters Rays wife Mary...Hancock has a lot of ohhhh and awwww moments. But it also has a lot of going for it besides. Another moment is the Bank Scence when Hancock shows up and tries to connect with the officers and keeps handing out 'Good Job' you see that he is being sincere and he is trying to reach out.Afterwards their gratitude you actually feel their acceptance.Another is the interesting reveal of both he and Mary's origin. Ancient lovers bound and divided by what they are. As a side note the shenigans in Rays kitchen when both Ray and Mary comically argue about the reveal is hilarious.However this shifts to the ' old married couple' phase where Mary goes off on him, you actually could see these two as a husband and wife. Renforced later in the Hospital where Mary explains Hancocks scars.To sum it up its more then you think, unexpected pleasure with a resolution where a goddes gets her normal life and a God gets to be the hero he has to be.Humour, action, great actor chemistry and a touch of Pathos.Highly Recommended.",Hancock

None of the superhero movies, save Spiderman have really impressed me lately.This movie takes you for a wild ride, there are several twists and turns that even I did not anticipate. There are also a few good laughs in this film, and Will Smith really does deliver.The only thing that I can find wrong with this film, is it felt too short. When the credits rolled, I was like ""Huh? thats it?"". This is one of those 1 1/2 hour movies that could have went a bit longer in my opinion :)",Hancock
432,Masquerade_Ball,A different kind of Superhero movie,6,6 July 2008,"Hancock may appear at first to be typical superhero movie like Spiderman, Hulk, Ironman etc... however the intent with this movie was to be outside the typical superhero movie genre - IE: don't expect super villain(s) and a back-story about Hancock's origins (although some of this is revealed in the movie, the origins aren't covered in much depth).Jason Bateman shines in this movie as a struggling Public Relations consultant who takes up the challenging role of Hancock's PR representative. Bateman's character is endearing to the viewer as we see his endless optimism for Hancock's potential, which results in some comical scenes between Bateman and Smith eg: ""Say 'Good Job Officer', 'goooooood jooooob'"" :).I was actually slightly disappointed by Charlize Theron's performance which has been criticized by others, but that is open to interpretation - let's just say she doesn't have a good poker face. However this doesn't detract from the overall enjoyment of the movie.As many of you will have already seen the trailers you may notice that this isn't really about any major conflict or world saving mission like all the other superhero movies. This was never the intention of Hancock. Put simply, it is the story of Hancock coming to terms with who he is and realizing his true potential - to be a great hero (rather than a bad hero).The special effects are good, the story is more humor than action, but it's a good enough mix to keep you entertained from start to finish. Hancock is an enjoyable, fun movie with a good storyline (for a comedy/action flick) that should satisfy all but the most demanding of viewers.7.5/10 (rounded-up to 8/10)",Hancock
433,campbell_bulletproof,Great acting Bad filming,6,22 June 2019,"The story of Hancock is great and heartfelt, the actors are top notch and play there roles very well but why is there so many zoomed in shots whoever filmed this had too many close ups.",Hancock
434,Hockeyo92,"Great, until it took itself too seriously.",4,5 August 2008,"I walked into the cinema with high hopes, after countless times of watching the trailer. And for the first 40 minutes or so, I was pleased. very. The movie was funny, easy to watch, and very easy to enjoy, seeing as it new people didn't watch it with the same perspective as they would when watching, say, The Dark Knight. Hancock was the light-version. The unserious one. THe so-far very funny one. Then it seems, the script-writers ran out of ideas and realized their script was too short, and took the film into another, and much worse, direction. They tried to make it into a serious super-hero film. after watching the trailer, here's what I thought the plot was: ""Will Smith plays an alcoholic super-hero who struggles with everyday problems"". After watching the movie: ""Will Smith plays a superhero who flies around trying to deal with his memory-loss and fighting the one person who can tell him"" Which one sounds like the best action-comedy flick to you? SERIOUSLY WHY on EARTH didn't they come up with something better than letting his PR agents wife, ACTUALLY be his immortal super-hero soul-mate , who adds nothing positive to the movie WHAT-SO-EVER? Ugh. They should have left it off when he first saves the day. Or just discarded the whole idea. The ending is just pure garbage. RATING: first 40 min: 8/10 - funny super-hero parody. last effin bit: 2/10 - WAY to serious, disappointing, batman wannabe. Total impression : 4/10. And I'm being kind.",Hancock

436,lm41583,"I liked it, others didn't.",8,13 July 2008,"There has been a lot of negativity towards this film and i feel stems from this not being a super hero movie per say, I think thats the problem with people not enjoying it as much as they should. I for one liked this film, it was more of a character study of what it might be like if the real world had a real person with super abilities. Those going in expecting to see a comic book on screen will be highly disappointed. I thought Will Smith was great as usual, the story was an original take on an old theme, Jason Bateman added to the mix. It was directed pretty well too, however the third act could have gone a little differently but over all id give it a 7.5 out of 10, but hey thats just my opinion",Hancock
437,iamsultana,What's happening?,8,3 July 2008,"I may expect from movies too much, but most of all have lately been disappointing.I love Will Smith. He is a marvellous, talented actor and he can make any crap a good comedy. I love Charlize Theron. She's a real actress - she can make believe her every time she acts.This movie has something; something that catches and doesn't let you go out of cinema. Most of all jokes are incredibly good - that's because they're new and unheard.So what sucks this film? Script! What the hell were they thinking? Such a good idea: a superhero, who's an asshole. But the plot was so boring... Every new event seemed to be perspective, but no one was developed. Being an asshole --> going to prison --> being a nice guy.. And then it was. The best part of movie. Charlize's character was a superhero too. Oh my dear god! That was awesome! I enjoyed every moment between Will and Charlize. In fact, the scene of their fight was too expressive, but dialogues and phrases were great. This turning - what was important - was very impressive. But a few minutes later, this good was taken from me too.Mary (Charlize) and her boyfriend human-being stayed together, although he would be a grandpa thirty years later, what we couldn't say about Mary ('cause she was not getting old). And Hancock became a nice superhero, who couldn't have normal relationship, so he seemed as a miserable loner in the end.Again, what were they thinking??",Hancock
438,kyle-loves-brooke,Enjoyable for the First 45 Minutes but Loses All Entertainment Value After That,7,27 June 2008,"I recently attended the Toronto premier of Hancock and I have to say I was disappointed. When I saw that both Will Smith and Charlize Theron were in a film with a very entertaining plot I have to admit my hope were high. The film starts off very strong with Smith playing the comedicly lazy and un-phased, Hancock who is seldom seen without a bottle of alcohol in hand. Hancock's careless attempts at rescuing people in need have created a cornucopia of property damage, damage that the government is forced to pay for causing the public to unanimously hate him. When public relations rep, Ray (Jason Bateman) is saved from on on-coming train by the unconventional superhero, he makes it his mission to clear up the less then appealing reputation of Hancock despite pleas not to by his CNN addicted wife, Mary (Charlize Theron) who has a deep rooted hatred for the hero. It looks like Ray has his work cut out for him until he hatches up a plan for Hancock to go to jail and give the city of Los Angeles a chance to realize how much they need Hancock to save the day. This begins 20 minutes of Hancock being taught single handedly by Ray on how to be a respectful, presentable superhero, including putting on an X-Men inspired leather jumpsuit. When the Los Angeles Police Department finally realize they need the superhero, Hancock responds showing he can be a superhero LA can be proud of as he properly rescues a group of people strapped to explosives from a bank robber. And here we come to where the film goes up in flames as everything up to this point has been thoroughly enjoyable, because now we find out Ray's wife Mary also has powers and that Hancock isn't the only superhero on the planet. But it doesn't stop there. According to this film, superheros are created in pairs as Hancock and Mary are actually husband and wife. However thats not the craziest part. As it turns out whenever Mary and Hancock are together for an extended period of time (I guess a decade in the same city doesn't count) they begin to lose their powers and become mortal. This leads to many strange action sequences with natural disasters. With Hancock vulnerable, his enemies attempt to kill him as well as Mary, almost succeeding but lest we forget, this is a Superhero movie. With a little help from Ray, Hancock is able to fend off his attackers before leaving LA for good and relocating to New York. In conclusion, if you are looking for a funny enjoyable film, leave an hour into it. But if you are looking for a film more obsessed with explaining the origin of Superheros, stick around and watch a perfectly good film turn into a train wreck.",Hancock
439,ajopaul01,This is a must watch ..,9,11 July 2008,"I was surprised, yes true, if you have mamoth expectations don't expect. But the surprise factors are what touched me. Back in India it released today, got a chance to catch the preview show last night, it was fun.For starters, It takes a whole new take on superheroes and how screwed or messed their life can be, inspite of having all the powers of the world. I must agree to many comments summarizing it as Superhero yet Human. Charlez Theron looks hot in her sequences, perhaps could have opened her character at least a little in initial reels.The pace and the humor on the proceedings are spot on, arguably there are very few talented stars with the impeccable comic timing, as Will Smith, portrays on screen.Its a must watch even if you loved superhero movies or even hated them. The makers should be credited for creative risk they have taken for the same.Cheers!",Hancock
440,kirksheppard,I liked it!,7,2 July 2008,"Big summer blockbusters aren't supposed to be this surprising. The trailers are supposed to reveal every plot point, give away all the best scenes, and sacrifice substance for style. Hancock is not a typical big summer blockbuster.I've always been a fan of Will Smith, dating back to his days as the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. His comic timing, his ability to convey emotions with his face and his body language, and his ability to humanize characters that were one-dimensional on paper have all made him one of our best actors. This is his movie, make no mistake. But he has tremendous support from Jason Bateman and Charlize Theron. Bateman has finally made it; his days on the Hogan Family are far behind him and who would have thought he would be the one to overshadow his sister's career? He plays these everyman characters with breeziness and charm. I think the last thing I watched Charlize Theron in was The Devil's Advocate (I know, she's done great work since then, I'm an idiot) and I hated her in that movie. She is fabulous here and is part of a twist in the story that has not been revealed in the trailers, making it that much better. Perhaps the most overlooked role in the film was that of Aaron, the little boy. His impact on Hancock's humanization is pivotal.I knew this would be a fun movie and I looked forward to it ever since I watched the trailer during American Idol. I expected it to be thrilling, funny, and smart; I didn't expect it to be equally as moving, creative, and sweet. Go see it!",Hancock

Loved the movie so much and liked the idea and the casts and the way I see it, this looks one of the greatest superhero movies ever.Will Smith was the best choice for the part and he's one the greatest actors ever.Last but not least, good job ;D",Hancock
443,Grumnarrh,Nice movie but it stops after the prelude,8,20 September 2008,"I've just watched hancock and i must say it's a really decent superheromovie. I really liked this worn-off gruffy superhero. I just think it should have been more of everything. More gruffyman, more pr-works, more cleanhero. The plot would have deserved 150minutes. Being as it were I just felt a little cheated when after what felt like the prelude to me suddenly the ending credits kicked in. It was a really nice movie but way too short. So I'm kinda looking forward for the sequel but the great chance to work out what should have been the main theme of this movie - how everything depends on good PR has been missed and I can't imagnie how it could be reworked in a possible Hancock II.",Hancock
444,imalamin,All in all... Entertaining,6,10 July 2008,"You know how Gotham City loves Batman, and how everyone in New York City is a fan of Spiderman? Have you ever wondered what a superhero would do if everyone hated him and everything he does goes unappreciated? You're not alone, and Hancock is here to answer our question. Hancock is a movie about an alcoholic superhero, John Hancock, played by Will Smith (I Am Legend), who everyone hates because he does more damage than good. He then saves the life of a Public Relations representative; Ray, played by Jason Bateman (Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium), after which Ray decides to help Hancock change the society's image of him. Ray's wife, Mary, is played by no other than the always beautiful Charlize Theron (Monster). Truth is; the less you know about this movie before going in to watch, the better. So is the movie any good you ask? Hancock is directed by Peter Berg, remember him? He is the genius that brought you last year's The Kingdom (also starring Jason Bateman). The guy is a really good director. The movie is very well directed and there are some really amazing shots in there. It is written by Vince Gilligan (Creator of TV series Breaking Bad and Co-producer of TV series The X-Files) from an original story by Vincent Ngo. Not trying to sound like I know more than I actually do, but this is where the little flaw of the movie is. Let me explain. I've read Vincent Ngo's original script, ""Tonight, He Comes"", and it is amazing. When it was rewritten into Hancock, Vince Gillian changed it a little, and personally, I think it did more harm than good (ironically, so does Hancock). Also, I think this movie is marketed very wrongly. It is being marketed as a comedy Superhero Movie. If you go in with that mindset, you sure are going to be disappointed; because for a superhero movie, the action sequences weren't that many. So if you want to really enjoy Hancock, I suggest you go in with the mindset of watching a Comedy - Drama in which the main character just happens to be a superhero. Do you really want me to talk about the acting in this? I mean, the fresh prince himself is the main character. We all know Will Smith can win an Oscar by just making a cameo. Well, maybe not; but he is very good. Charlize Theron is probably not going to win an Oscar for this like she did for ""Monster"", but that is not to say she's not amazing. And Jason Bateman: Funny as always. Even the extras in this movie weren't bad! If you were to divide Hancock into three parts, I'd give: the first part 4.5 out of 5 stars, second part 4.5 out of 5 stars and 3 stars for the third. This is because the third act is lazy and felt really out of place. Too many unimportant things happened and there wasn't enough development or attention to the important ones. That being said, the movie still lets you go with a smile on your face; just make sure you stay after the credits. So what's up with that Eagle? Don't know the Eagle I'm talking about? Go watch Hancock... you know you want to.",Hancock
445,charmed-33,Great Movie,8,25 July 2008,"OK, first of all this movie is probably not what you are expecting to see. If you think this is going to be the usual Superhero movie, than think again. In most movies you have a criminal MASTERMIND and a Superhero who shows the best of what humanity could be. You know someone your kids could look up to. Well don't expect that in this movie. The criminals are not masterminds and the superhero is a drunk. When seeing this movie for the first time, leave your expectations outside and just see the movie for what it is and not what you expected. I have noticed many people seem to miss the story altogether So ill give you this much, the movie is about hancock and Mary. Not so much about hancock being a superhero, but his life and Marys life. This movie was well thought out and is totally new. I loved it and hope you will enjoy it as much as I did. :)",Hancock
446,rdrotar,disappointed,5,5 July 2008,"This movie had more potential than most the films I've seen only because it half assed everything it did. From what i can remember there was spotty CGI, poor story development, less than great acting(and Jason bateman needs to learn that he cant act the same in all his roles), less than satisfactory back story on Hancock and his relationship with Charlize Therons character and the other demi-gods that were, to little build of the villain and explanation of why they become mortal and when, an ending that did little in the way of summing up this movie or hinting towards a possible sequel, all in all if this movie had been 20 to 40 minutes longer and taken more time to make and not rushing it to make sure it makes it to theaters in time for the summer blockbusters. The best part of this movie for me was the excitement and build up in the most exciting battle scene i saw... the trailer for the Dark Knight. That about sums up my disappointment in this mildly entertaining an utterly forgettable film. As always let me know your take on things i love movie chat so let me know.",Hancock
447,prosinger,Great movie for what it is,9,26 January 2009,"I thought about seeing this movie when it first came out in theaters, but I had my doubts. First of all, it's maintained a relatively hum-drum rating on IMDb since that time (not that I count that as a top factor, but it is a warning sign).Secondly, I am not a fan of ""superhero"" movies. I've always wanted to like the movies based on comic book heroes, but it's just not me, and I gave up several years back. The Incredibles was probably the only superhero movie I really enjoyed, apart from the great web-swinging scenes in the first Spiderman movie.Thirdly, I couldn't really tell from the few trailers I managed to see if it might actually be funny - and if not, what was it supposed to be? I think the answer to this question is what leads me to give the rating I'm giving.I didn't know what to expect from Hancock, and so when the opportunity finally arose, I just watched it.And I really enjoyed it. Hancock is part thigh-slapping comedy, part action movie, part melodrama, part romance, part absurdly dry observation, with generous slabs of comic book thrown in between.As one person pointed out, the plot was somewhat predictable in places, and yet we were still left guessing just enough - do you think it will happen this way or that way? And every time there was a new development, it caused us to think back to what we had seen 10 minutes before to ask ourselves if we had really seen it coming.We laughed, we grinned (wryly), we ""ewwwww""ed, and we said ""awwwww"". We didn't take the movie too seriously - it didn't take itself too seriously. And I think that's the main point. It tells a story, it makes it fun, adds pretty cool special effects, adds elements from a lot of different genres, and winds everything up nicely in the end.I am a reluctant fan of Will Smith. I didn't really know who he was as his fortunes were rising, and (being an avid rap-hater), I didn't really care. But despite myself, I am almost always impressed. I haven't seen all his movies, but his performances rarely if ever fail to leave me nodding in approval. I wouldn't exactly say this part was a dramatic stretch for him, but he was nicely cast, as were the other two leads.This is not the greatest movie since sliced bread, it is a nice, fun way to pass the time. Normally I would give it maybe 7 or 8 stars, but because I think it's gotten such a bad rap, I'm giving it a 9 for balance.",Hancock
448,skekses,Not so much...,5,6 July 2008,"I went to Hancock with an open mind. Half-way through the movie I thought to myself who the hell wrote this story. It reminded me of a Spanish soap Oprah on during the middle of the day. A great idea to have an alcoholic super hero who doesn't get the respect or support he deserves. After that the writer(s) don't really know where to go with the story. Should we throw a nemesis in there. Sure lets make it three random people who have had less then 1 minute of screen time. Should we throw in a love interest...Hell ya lets make it some unbelievable goddess who has been living in the same town as Hancock for the past couple of years. According to the story if they live close together their powers fade, but for some reason Hancock is able to be shot when he is far away from her. But to regain his powers he just has to jump out of a building and be the same distance away from her when he was shot. The story is all over the place it cant even be summarized in a logical concise manner. I will admit Hancock definitely is not your average ""Super Hero"" movie. The actors did a good job of what they had to work with and what they had to work with was crap. Hancock's horrible story-line which seemed to me that it was written by a child with A-D-D falls short of what it should have been. If you don't know what to think of this movie take my advice this movie sucked.",Hancock
449,kpwhitu0,Difficult to review,7,15 July 2018,"This film is one of the best first hour of superhero films ever. Simple as that. For the first hour it is funny, clever and has the correct amount of action. It is worth a watch, until the mood and story of the film changes too much. Without spoiling it, it becomes poor. It almost feels like no one really knew how it should actually end so botched together a really poor scenario. Kind of really like the film and hate it at the same time.",Hancock

I knew the general plot outline - a superhero who isn't happy with his powers.This film, in short, is absolutely fantastic. I was completely entertained from start to finish. The characters just seemed to gel together and it came across that they really enjoyed working together which obviously makes for a good film.I would advise anyone seeing this film to not really watch the trailers because they reveal parts of the plot that are better left not knowing about to be honest.But do go and see this film because you wont be disappointed.",Hancock

It was funny and had lots of laughs but you can tell if it was rated R it would have been even more funny. It still came very close as a lot of profanity was used. There wasn't a HUGE plot but still 2 nice twist, i recommend it but not over other films. I think what will appeal to most is Will Smith. He really does try to put his best foot forward in this and he honestly does a good job. The pacing could have used some work though but all and all its good. I usually would say to wait for the DVD but some scenes should be viewed on the big screen. overall its enjoyable and maybe a good date movie more then anything else.",Hancock

Standard Hollywood movie? Not by a long shot. Is it likely to garner a lot of Oscar nominations? No. Is it entertaining? Yes, yes, yes. As one of the other comments says, sit down and turn your brain off. It's most definitely not high art, but then again why does everyone expect high art from every film and then bag it badly when it isn't? Who cares if doesn't leave you pondering the ""meaning of life"" or make you want to protest outside the $%^&*#$ embassy about the way they treat their women/children/livestock?

455,MattsMovieReviews,Hancock is a superhero flick with a twist,8,6 July 2008,"Hancock is a superhero movie which holds a more interesting concept compared to its comic book inspired contemporaries, for while those films hold the usual tales of hero's with dual identities who continue to fight the eternal fight of good VS evil, Hancock's main protagonist is a crude superhero living in a PC world who must make amends for the disastrous consequences of his heroic deeds. Former Fresh Prince and current reigning king of the summer blockbuster Will Smith plays the tile character Hancock, a boozing loner and all around prick whose often well intentioned heroism leads to often catastrophic results and a spiraling out of control collateral damage bill. During one of his heroic exhibitions, Hancock saves the life of bleeding heart public relations agent Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman) who believes that Hancock is in need of a dire image change and offers his services as payback for saving his life. Hancock begrudgingly agrees and is convinced to voluntarily turn himself over to the authorities (who have several hundred outstanding citations against him) and do time in prison in a bid to win public affection and clean up his act. His stint in prison gives way to one of the more hilarious scenes thus far this year involving one prisoners head being thrust into another prisoners rear end! It is crass, but it works. With the first half passed what has been presented is an entertaining urban superhero movie which comes dangerously close to having already shot its load. However, with a switch of genre and some nicely placed twists, a love triangle is established between Hancock, Ray, and Ray's wife Mary (Charlize Theron) which adds some more spice to the unconventional superhero film. And so it goes, as the film jumps from comedy to action to drama and does so quite nicely. Throughout it all the films three leads adapt very well to the shifts in genre, especially the versatile Will Smith who hits all of the right notes. Charlize Theron  who I usually do not look forward to watching due to her often pretentious and dour portrayals of late  seems to be having the most fun on screen that I can remember, and low key comedy maestro Jason Bateman continues to forge a reputation of becoming quite the scene stealer, ala Bill Murray. Keeping the film on a steady register is Michael Mann protégé Peter Berg, who was brought in after several directors attached to the film before him moved on to different projects. Berg's gritty tones and shaky cam styling blends very well with the films big budget fodder, most notably the special and visual effects which are a visceral treat. Since Hancock does not play slave to a source material, it does not come off as generic. The only film which comes close to matching its concepts would be the excellent animated film The Incredibles. Yet while its script may be shaky  especially with its talk of Gods walking amongst men  the films performances and Berg's spirited direction make up for whatever flaws are present.

The camera angles wear horrible much to dizzying the camera never set still it was always moving i don't think they ever herd of tripods. Their was also senseless fighting between smith and Theron dialog could have taken care of the problem and made way for a joke or two. As far as i could tell their was no main villain. Their is also dialog that makes no scents. It may have been the screen i was watching it on but also the movie seemed dark the lighting was vary poor on it.

All I have to say is that this movie was great. I am still trying to figure out just what movie the critics were reviewing because trust me Hancock was all that and a bag of chips. In some ways Hancock was like a super hero movie for mature movie goers as the story line kept movie watchers glued to their seats. The movie twist that so many critics claimed were out of no where were great in my opinion and actually made the movie that much better. If you want to see a solid movie which happens to have a super hero as its main character, Hancock is that movie. Will Smith once again was at the top of his game.

I know, I sound like a 'New Age' nut, but I felt compelled to share my thoughts.

464,KoondoggSaints,"Not your typical ""superhero"" movie, but still good",7,1 July 2008,"I was lucky enough to go to a pre-screening of Hancock last night and I really enjoyed it. I don't understand all of the criticism this movie is receiving. Everyone take a second and realize this is not a Marvel or DC comic book superhero movie. Now think about that again. It is a different story entirely and has some very unique elements.Hancock isn't action packed. It doesn't have a Superhero vs. Supervillan plot. I would probably describe it as a character study of the superhero. I think this movie does a better job of addressing some of the issues (and vices) a superhero probably would have if they existed today. The biggest conflict in the movie is within Will Smith's character's attitude, not necessarily good vs. evil.I think much of the criticism I have read about is motivated by expectations that were not met, which isn't fair at all. If you watch Hancock with only the expectation of being entertained, you will leave happy. Its a good movie, don't jump on the bandwagon of not liking it just because you can. Give it a chance and take it for what it is, a July 4th action/comedy.",Hancock
465,radikian,another day in Will Smith's life!,4,6 July 2008,"let's face it, Will Smith is an action man and I like to watch his movies. This movie was not a total disappointment as I really went to watch it with no expectations, so it didn't really disappoint me.. The story is full of inconsistencies and lacks development... it tries to be intriguing, but it doesn't achieve it.. and I say it because while I was watching it I was thinking ""this or that makes no sense"" or ""awww.. isn't that clichéd?"".. the one thing that's different (at least for me) is the i-don't-give-a-damn-hero-attitude.. but, obviously, someone had to come and change all that to the super-man-type-hero who dresses neatly, and is kind to others... but well..In short, if you watch it just to have fun, then, by all means, go watch it. but if you're looking for a deep and elaborated story, it'll disappoint you to the bone!!",Hancock

The history has good lines,and some original. The music is not so great,but it hear good. The casting is very good too,so you can feel the reality. The Special Effects are perfect,but some times they see too CGI. The final is good too,the typical ""good end"". With these elements,you have a good movie,one of the greatest summer movies,and for me,it's enough to put in to the Top 250. I don't know why some of you don't like it,and i know that somebody will be in no deal with me,whatever,everybody have they opinion.

467,sshendy,"A great concept, poorly executed",5,7 January 2009,"Had a great trip to Canberra's fantastic Dendy again last night, to see 'Hancock'. Cheap Tuesday, and it was busy with hundreds of baby boomers lining up to see 'Mama Mia' and I ended up in the wrong line, feeling like a complete idiot when I realised that there was no one within cooee of my age in the queue. It was a relief, however, to find that we could walk right into the appropriate cinema and not have to jockey for decent seats.'Hancock' is a good piece of cinema, but very light. It's one of those films with a great premise that kind of falls down when the story should be getting interesting. You could see that spot at the end of the exposition and the conflict where the writersVincent Ngo and Vince Gilligansuddenly realised that they don't know where they're going with this story. It's good, but the best bits are in the trailer, so wait for the DVD.I'd like to give them ten points for trying, but this is one of those unfortunate films that has fallen victim to the Hollywood movie machine. The idea was fresh and new, which is more than you can say for most American films this century, but the execution just didn't cut it.I just wish we had opted for 'Ten Empty' instead. Oh well.",Hancock
468,arpavitt42,Entertaining blockbuster with brains,8,3 July 2008,"No doubt about it, at the beginning of the film you won't find the idea of spending 100 minutes with the surly John Hancock a pleasant one. He is a superhero who, despite saving many lives and catching even more criminals in his duty, also causes millions of dollars of damage, and his grumpy unsociable demeanour does not win him over with the public in his native LA. But all fears that this film will be as tetchy and charmless as its eponymous star are quickly banished.Hancock is a superhero film that drops all the natural clichés and instead goes about its business doing things its own way. There is no big ""origin"" scene, no defined hero and villain; rather there is a set of characters that must learn to live with each other.Will Smith, one of the few Hollywood stars that will guarantee a profit-turning film, delivers a convincing performance as the washed-up superhuman Hancock, particularly considering that ""charmless"" is not his forte. Apart from going against his natural type-cast, Smith is not required to give too much to this performance, leaving the special effects to do the bulk of the job, which they do with gusto. No doubt the main objective of the film is to entertain the masses, and it does this considerably well, maintaining an intense pace throughout and adding more twists and turns than would normally be found in a film twice its length.In its bid to engage, it does leave a noticeable hole where characterization should be. Only briefly is the subject of the loneliness of Hancock touched upon, and Hancock's PR guru, Ray, is far too one-dimensional considering his role to the plot. The importance of this character is played up in the film's first half, and then diminished in the closing half as his wife, played by Charlize Theron, replaces him as the film's second main character.This film is by no means faultless, but in terms of blockbusters, particularly superhero blockbusters, it is unpredictable, inventive and, bar a sugar-sweet ending, far removed from the formulaic plots that generally clog up the summer schedules. Despite this, it still manages to do what all big-budget films strive to achieve, and that is to entertain.",Hancock
469,avk1989,A over-hyped movie,5,12 July 2008,"Basically,I'm a Will Smith Fan. I have seen really good works of his. This movie was among the few bad ones. People may have given good ratings to this movie. The point of the story is actually pretty sad. The acting were good though. Going first to the positives. The screen play was amazing. The acting was good.Now to the negatives. Somethings in the movie made absolutely no sense at all. Tue story was well thought off but was poorly implemented. The ending of the movie was pretty stupid. Its like out of nowhere they say that they are linked. And Charlieze Theoren goes into the dead and returns. And she gets to live whenever Smith i.e. Hancock hurts himself. Overall I would rate his movie a five and recommend this title mainly for people below 16 or so.",Hancock
470,cattydecatcat,Changes...a bit....,1,18 January 2010,"Last summer a superhero film stormed the box offices both sides of the Atlantic. It was called Hancock, a film about an alcoholic superhero played by Will Smith. A bundle of laughs? NOThe film follows the path of a rude, disgusting, irritating superhero called John Hancock (Will Smith). The public hate him; he causes millions of ""dollars"" worth of damage, is a drunk and makes constantly obscene comments about people. But one day he happens to save the life of a PR Guru (Jason Bateman) and is offered a chance to save his image. This starts of his avid career as a superhero. Until a chance encounter causes the film to dive bomb into the realms of beyond crap.It slots perfectly into the genre of comedy, action, superhero, adventure, romance, sci-fi, fantasy and crime. Though this great mixture of genres usually benefits films, with Hancock it just doesn't work. The film jumps between the various genres so quickly that you never have the actual time to register what's happening and whether the scene is meant to be sarcastic or sentimental. The style changes drastically too; between sad violin music and the latest chart hip-hop; between big set action pieces and amusing family dinners. This attempt at appealing to everybody fails miserably.Personally I would recommend this film to people who have nothing better to do with their time then watch Will Smith throw cars around and make obscenely offensive comments about people. This is not a family film due to the crude remarks, excessive language and unnecessary violence; basically if you showed it to your grandma she would have a heart attack and spend the rest of her life in hospital only able to move the big toe of her left foot.The acting in it is frankly amateur (or should I say appalling). None of the actors seam to like what they are doing- they don't even seam to be trying- they're just acting normally. The producers have obviously tried very hard to get people to hate Will Smith and it works- he is possibly the most unlikeable character in the whole film. British actor Eddie Marsan plays the ""bad guy"" Red, he is acceptable apart the slightly dodgy attempt at an American accent. Not Good. If I was being nice I would say that Will Smith shows quite a good performance as the disgusting superhero, then I look through his previous films and realise that all his characters are basically the same. Only for really die-hard fans.The special effects are disappointing especially when he attempts to land on a pavement in front of some guys house. You feel as if you are watching a 1963 Batman film before they had discovered the wonders of CGI. In fact the CGI is so disappointing it's actually hilarious especially at the end, when you just really want somebody to die, but they just carry on throwing tea urns and hospital beds around while a giant CGI'd thunderstorm rages outside the window- not a good look.In comparison to other films in the genre of Superhero/Comedy it looks terrible. Take Hellboy for instance; the tongue in cheek humour of Guillermo Del Toro combined with the great fantasy creatures in the style of Pans Labyrinth and sarcastic superhero, the film does a really great job. However next to Hellboy the film Hancock just looks more annoyingly, terribly, irritatingly amateur. If you're looking for a decent superhero film with laughs see Hellboy, if you're looking for a dark, chilling superhero film see The Dark Knight and if you're looking for a boring, arrogant, overdone superhero film see Hancock.Overall this film is possibly the worst superhero film of the summer. Only see it if you have to.",Hancock

It was entertaining, took a unique take on the superhero thing, and didn't have an overt number of huge gaping plot holes or completely blithe dialog.If you're feeling like a Wil Smith movie, go for it.

472,Eland15,"Good, not great",7,15 July 2008,"Will Smith is an amazing actor, he has such charm and charisma on screen that its got to the point where he sells the film rather than the film itself being the attraction.Hancock as a summer blockbuster is a lot of fun. The acting on all parts is strong and the humour is well delivered. Others think that it starts well but ends weak, in my opinion it starts quite weak, but once you understand the characters better and Charlize Theron is introduced to the story it really gets going.The main reason why it wasn't great is because it should have been better, the script could have been stronger and the action is a bit too tongue in cheek.Hancock is a good film that keeps you entertained, however it has a few flaws that make it forgettable and puts it in the ""to rent"" pile. I want to see Will Smith get another Oscar nomination but he won't get far with films like this and ""I Am Legend"".",Hancock

474,mohommed_r,A movie too dull as sci-fi movie...good CGI effects though !!!,3,24 August 2008,"After watching this movie, I came to conclusion that some movies needs no story or plot if they have sufficient CGI effects. But even if I watched this movie just for CGI effects, it still turns out to be ridiculously boring, because all a movie need some sort of story or plot which is missing here. As viewing this movie as movie based only on CGI effects, it certainly gets some credits.But as I said, every movie needs a good story and climax or twist to keep audience bind to it. This movie lacks both of them. If you watch this movie without use of brain just for special effects, you would enjoy it. If you like Angelina Jolie's movie ""Wanted"", I'm sure then this movie is for you.",Hancock
475,mikebaylon2000,Hackcock Great concept but Dead on execution,5,2 December 2008,"First seeing the trailer months ago I was was amazed that it was a great looking trailer with awesome effects and a great concept of a super-Anti hero, who feels his super-Ness is a burden.Showing quick montages of him ""drinking and Flying, throwing a beached whale, throwing a kid up into the air, and stopping a train"", this movie was showing clips that Superman should of done in 'Superman Returns"". So I had to see this movie and the hype was clenching @ my feet.The movie starts off great with all the things I had listed above were just keeping my eyes glued to the screen. But half way through the film it took a turn with a very campy back ground story, that went on way to long. It literally made me think ""wow they're going this route""?? It seemed as if they had a beginning and a middle of a movie and just through in a back story that seemed to be whats the word? oh yes...LAZY, and some how decided thats how the rest of the movie should go. My thoughts were if your gonna use that, save that for a sequel not a 3rd act of a film. The 1st act or I should say the first film should of just been ""Hancock""being a homeless, alcoholic, Anti-Superhero struggling to be good. Thats a movie there I gave this movie a 5(half of 10, 10 being the best) because it starts off great! but the rest just flat out sucks. Great effects @ first then it turns into a C.G.I. nightmare and made me feel like I was suffering through"" My super ex girl friend"" once again.",Hancock
476,doubleo,A breath of fresh air!,9,4 July 2008,"Though the cinematography leaves something to be desired, Hancock is an amazingly original film, the likes of which comes out of Hollywood MAYBE once a decade. It takes a bold, fresh approach to the hackneyed & trite superhero genre and challenges its audience with some truly original and unconventional ideas and plot twists. Its characters are fully fleshed out and not the same old one~dimensional cartoons seen everywhere else; its concepts are unique and interesting; and even its special effects feel more real. The allegory of its story line is applicable to real life, and the relationships it shows are motivated by the same values as real relationships ~ not a single note rings false! Hancock deserves to rule the box office for weeks on end ~ and will, no doubt, do so for the more intelligent audiences of the nation.",Hancock
477,ShadeSiren,So Real,7,4 July 2008,"So many movies take place in a comic book universe - that is, one that's not REAL. One of the things I really liked about Hancock, was that while there's a superhero in it, it takes place in a world that's very real. People react like you would expect REAL people to react. Seeing a superhero that's not perfect - he steps up and tries, but he forgets that the rest of the world are regular people. Tearing off the side of a building is EXPENSIVE. I remember when I saw Ghost Rider, and they showed the devastation to the city street after GR tears it up, and I thought, ""Wow, you never see that! They always just wreak havoc, destroy the city, and then go have a soda while the world rebuilds behind their back. This is COOL."" Hancock was cooler :P The characters are great - but make no mistake, Will Smith and Charlize Theron are very, very good in this movie, but Jason Bateman plays the real hero. He may have reminded me a teensy bit too much of his character from Arrested Development, but let's face it, most of his characters have a similiarity. Doesn't matter - he was perfect. By the end, I was clapping and cheering for HIM.Don't pay any attention to what others say - this is a movie that you have to see for yourself; I could probably find something negative to say about it, but that would spoil it, and since I loved the ending, I won't spoil it by complaining about how I ALMOST didn't like how it ended.",Hancock
478,jazzyjerome,A flawed hero's journey.,10,14 December 2019,This is not your typical superhero movie which is a good thing. I like the character arch and development. They did a good job with the support characters as you get to know a little about them so you can have some feeling for them. It's not super action pack but the story is interesting enough to keep your attention.There is no comic book type of super villain that he has to defeat it is more about him. Hancock is a flawed man who wants to help people but his troubles get in the way. He has personality issues that he eventually overcomes to become the hero he was meant to be.What I really like about this movie is the fact that he had real life issues to deal with but the movie isn't overly preachy or political. The supporting cast was well picked and they do a good job in helping the story along.,Hancock
479,connorwayne,Will Smith's splinter in his HOF career,5,30 November 2012,"I'm sorry but this movie was definitely terrible! The story is excellent BUT it doesn't go more in depth with it like it should have! Though the movie does have fantastic graphics some are a little too far and overdue most of the scenes. Will Smith does do a OK job with his character but once again just like the story doesn't go far enough. Theron and Bateman do act their characters nicely and it is a plus that is well deserved. But seriously, there is no question in my mind why this isn't considered a great super hero movie and most likely will NEVER have a sequel (that it so desperately needs with all the storyline holes)! This movie could have been soooo much better and failed at almost every spot and horribly at the spot where it needed it the most...STORY!",Hancock
480,Bigdaddy2014,Not completely terrible,6,17 February 2012,"I'd be lying if I said that I wasn't slightly disappointed. Now the movie had an intriguing premise of a superhero that's not adored for his actions because of their destructive nature but it's not really a premise that's out of a superhero fans thought process. It had a pretty simple story and nothing that really made its plot stand out in any way other than the fact that Charlize Theron's character had powers too (which isn't even a spoiler if you saw the same original trailer I did) and that she claims that there were other super humans in the past but had since died off after pairing up and losing their immortality. But one thing that I wanted to ask the writers and director was, ""Why?"". Because I wanted to know why Hancock didn't care about the collateral damage he was causing. Why Mary (Theron) hated Hancock after he got injured because it's not like he intended to forget her. And she seemed to like him quite a bit before that happened so why now? And as for the criminal who wanted Hancock dead, not a good centered villain since he wasn't there for half of it. And as for all the other idiots who try to shoot Hancock, you think one of them would realize that he's indestructible and others have tried that. But all in all, Hancock is anything spectacular, but it'll get you through part of an afternoon with nothing to do.",Hancock
481,tylern2009,Give it some slack this was entertaining and underrated,7,13 January 2012,"Don't get me wrong here...this is not the greatest superhero movie of all time but its definitely refreshing. It takes the side of a superhero in a darker, comedic, adult version, and almost more realistic/relate-able side. It shows that even superheros aren't perfect which is honestly a great idea and great side to show. Hancock is basically a non-perfect superman. He has a drinking problem, doesn't care what people think of him, and has personal issues. This allows normal people like us to relate to someone who basically is an all powerful God, and lowers him down to be more on a human level, which again is refreshing and key word: DIFFERENT! After watching other cheesy, totally unfathomable, even for superhero movies, its takes a different viewpoint on what problems a superhero could face if they were in fact real, which gives it a more realistic feel to it. Will Smith also is great, hands down greatest actor of all time and if you don't agree....don't watch movies. He can play any role. But OK i will admit at the end it got kind of weird and I had my doubts because of the story that unfolds, but then when I saw the great acting and how much pain and sadness you could feel while watch Will and Charlize Theron, who have great chemistry together rooting from the Legend of Bagger Vance, it immediately took away my doubts and took the movie for what it is. The producers had a goal and accomplished it. This movie is very good but by no means great. Its very funny at times and very dramatic at times using realistic viewpoints in a very unrealistic world.

However the last 30 minutes are truly terrible. While the movie comes out of the gate at high speed (with a fantastic combination of black humour, effects and script) the third act is incredibly weak.There is a lovely twist at the film's mid point and at the time I honestly felt this could be something very special however it's almost as if a second director took over from there, one who has no idea what they were doing.To add insult to injury the 'villain' of the piece comes out of leftfield and feels like they have no place in a so called superhero movie.In a post screening discussion one of my pals made the very valid point; ""I am Legend"" was weak but Smith's fans won't forgive two dogs in a row."" How true.""Hancock"" is not terrible, just terribly disappointing. Especially when you consider the talent involved.On a final note we were asked to fill in response sheets on leaving so perhaps the studio have realised what they have on their hands and are desperately looking for feedback on how to fix it, albeit at this late stage.I hope they do because I feel there is a good (but not a great) movie buried somewhere in this mess.",Hancock

485,bigstuff2020,"Signing off on ""Hancock""",6,6 July 2008,"Some movies are simply poor ideas put into practice and thus become movies we come to regard as ""bad"". Others are good ideas that are presented to the viewer and are often well-received. Then there's Peter Berg's ""Hancock"", the story of a boozing, loutish, seemingly un-superhero that falls somewhere in between the aforementioned categories.Will Smith plays John Hancock, a superhuman with enhanced abilities in strength, invulnerability, and flight, who, though he tries to save Los Angeles from all sorts of crime, usually ends up costing the city millions of dollars in damages and endangering many people through his alcohol-induced carelessness. When the city's officials decide they have had enough, they issue a warrant for Hancock's arrest. At the behest of Ray (Jason Bateman), a publicist who has been saved by the ""hero"", Hancock enters a county jail to serve his time and prove that the city actually needs him. With Ray regularly consulting him on his public appearance and the city's crime rate rising at an astonishing 30 percent over a two week time span, Hancock emerges from jail by request of the captain of the LAPD to once again the city safe.With these pieces set into place with plenty of humor sprinkled throughout the movie, I was convinced that critics were simply being stuck up in their reviews - true to form, many critics poorly rate movies they deem to be below them. However, the plot actually takes a turn for the worse in trying to trace the path of Hancock's origin and also build his romance with Ray's wife Mary, played by Charlize Theron. While the first half of the film had been very much enjoyable, the last half hour or so drags, with the comedy running sparse and the storyline running thin. In the end, ""Hancock"" is less likable due to it's poor execution in the second half, and I found myself in the same situation as many critics - disappointed.And thus, I return to my initial point; ""Hancock"" is not bad idea for a film - in fact, it has the potential to work as a great action comedy - but it falls short of the expectations many would hold for it by falling somewhere in between ""good"" and ""bad"".",Hancock
486,Lil_Jul,Almost bad.,6,3 July 2008,"The beginning was quite OK, then it seemed as if the crew did not have enough imagination to create a fully developed image of the characters, time and place of the action. However, since this hero is unknown to the audience (no comic books, no prequel etc.), it is very hard for such movies to get immediately on the top and to gain the admiration. Yeah... I felt so odd... I did not know who Hancock was, and I had an odd impression maybe because I got used to the way how other such type of movies were created (Iron Man, Superman...). I do think that the crew HAVE DONE A GOOD JOB, but I feel it could have been better if instead of Charlize Theron there would be another actress.

And when I mean closeups I mean CLOSEUPS, to the point that only their eyes and nose and part of their mouths appear. It became very annoying. I thought it was just something that would go away after the very first closeup of Hancock, but no it just continued on and on and on.Lots of other things wrong with this movie. The jokes fell flat (especially with that whole a$$hole thing, a clear ripoff of Back to the future), the action was weak (other than the brief two-minute fight between Hancock and another individual), and the movie constantly felt as if it was being pulled in too many directions. It couldn't decide whether it was a drama, a comedy, a science fiction movie, etc. Basically what you saw in the trailer were all the ""momentous"" moments of the movie, everything else was just boring filler material.The only reason this gets a 3 is because as always Will Smith looks like he put in as much effort as possible into making this something. I've got to give credit where credit is due and say that Will always looks like he gives 110% to any project, and this was no exception.",Hancock

So the part till the love story was great. And then suddenly everything went back to the usual. The love story was too serious and it was not fun at all. Real, deep feelings ... again ... c'mon give me a break. It's a comedy after all, why there was any need of moral telling us we all have a soul mate. That was lame and used in thousands other movies. Also Hancock was changed to the ""I do only good things"" hero - he lost his cool and charm, and become a boring flying around guy.

The fx were almost good, but just not good enough so they really stood out as noticeably insufficient to carry the scene. All the talent is underused and again bland performances. No real conflict as the ""villain"" was so normal, regular, and useless. Actually that he became a villain came out of nowhere and didn't gel with the tone of the film. One might suggest the real conflict took place within Hancock himself, but even this was mismanaged. So many good ideas that just failed to deliver.

So then the movie transitions into an even greater more complex twist, which peaks our curiosity and has us wanting to know more about Hancock's origins. I was left wanting to know more and more... and I thought I was only gonna get some cheap White Chicks, low rate humor movie... but it turns into a suspenseful, action packed superhero movie with substance and suspense that had me and my friends at the edge of our seats, and at one point, holding our tears in. It brought me back to the heavy emotions and empathy for Will Smith's character in I AM LEGEND. A lump nags at your throat for what seems to be an apocalyptic fate for Hancock, the superhero of the movie. Then there is the lovely romance that you wish could somehow be rekindled for Charlize's character Angel and Hancock. But it seems that the Gods or God did not mean it to be so, for the sake of the world. It became an amazing story that I did not expect. To top it off, the extra clip that interrupts the rolling credits, after people had already gotten up, had people stopping in their tracks turning back, cracking up in laughter and applause. What an amazing movie experience Hancock was for me and my friends! Truly unique and more than we could have expected or predicted! A+++!",Hancock
491,shakespeares_assistant,Great film IMO,9,12 July 2008,"Well personally I really loved this movie. Best movie I have seen for ages!!!! And I though the fact that the main twist wasn't in the trailer was fantastic!!! Most Hollywood movies these days tell you the whole story in the trailer, making the film rather boring when you have watched the trailer first.Personally I feel that they both should have died at the end, which would have made me more satisfied. But if all movies where made to keep people feeling satisfied at the end then I think the movie world is definitely going down the class ladder.Another thing I liked about it was how appealing it is to a large age range. The young kids would enjoy it because of the humor and the typical Will Smith funness. And then those that have ever loved before can enjoy it for the feeling of link they get with the characters. You start becoming quite depressed if you put yourself in the shoes of the 3 main characters. For Hancock to experience love, he has to be with Mary, otherwise any other woman he grows an attachment to will die before him. Then there is Ray, he will die before Mary also, and I can imagine how it must feel that your wife is 'made for someone else'.. and then it's the same thing for Mary, she is going to outlive any other she falls in love with.Depressing but in a way quite nice. Set apart from the typical Hollywood drabble that you get these days by the connection and emotion it creates.Great film, if you are wanting to be entertained and moved then this one is for you IMO.",Hancock
492,ninjangsta,A Movie That Breaks Sterotype,10,8 July 2008,"Don't go to Hancock expecting a typical superhero movie. Because it's not. And I think that's what makes it so great. It isn't predictable in a way that it follows normal superhero movies. But sometimes it is a little predictable - just because the acting is so darn good. The little looks Mary gives Hancock every time she sees him...you just know that she's a superhero too.I've heard people complaining about how there's a dramatic switch of genre in the middle of the movie. Maybe it was just because I was so wrapped up in the movie, wanting to know what was going to happen next, but I didn't notice that. I still found comedy in the second half, and I did see drama in the first half. So it was all good.This movie isn't just about a superhero who has lost himself, and in the process fell out of the publics liking. This movie is about a man who finds himself, with the help of just one person who believes in him. This movie is about the sacrifices you sometimes have to make. This movie is about how you can change for the better.But most of all this movie is a fun summer flick. Are some people turning it into race and racism? Yes. Are some people calling it horrible? Is it supposed to make you think hard about it? I doubt it. But I also doubt it was supposed to be racist, and it certainly wasn't horrible. The ending wasn't the typical happy ending. But that doesn't mean it wasn't happy. Mary getting to stay with her new husband and her adopted son...I'd call that happy. And the AllHeart symbol on the moon? I don't think Hancock has any hard feelings. And neither do I.",Hancock
493,rajarshisamanta,best part of the movie was the trailer,7,16 July 2008,"the movie was good , bit different than the usual super hero movies but good.only thing wrong was the trailer. all the best scenes of the movies specially the action and comedy sequences , and mind my words all the good scenes were shown in the trailer. so when i actually went to see this movie with so high expectations i was a bit disappointed.disappointed to see that this was actually a drama.the humor is good not witty but typical will smith which only he can do.acting is above average.charlize theron has done the best job. cg effects needed little bit more finishing. but still they were quite real.my verdict is you should see this movie because its different where a superhero is shown as a normal man with the emotional problems of a common man.",Hancock
494,missl_2004,A good time until superwoman shows up,6,13 July 2008,"I saw this movie last week in Amsterdam and I really enjoyed the first half of it. The jokes were funny, the scenes between Smith and Bateman were nice to watch. Especially the adventures of Hancock were vivid and funny, take for example the opening-scene with loud hip-hop music, some jokes added and a few special effects, just simple but great movie.Then after half an hour, Charlize Theron turns out to be a superwoman as well. I really like Charlize but this just didn't fit in the film. The best parts in it were the scenes around and about Hancock, and from that point it focuses on Theron and Smith as ex-partners. They start with a very angry fight in the city which is there all of a sudden, it seems very pointless. Then at the end, some subplot is added about the prisoners wanting revenge, this was so weak that I almost forgot about it, writing about the movie now.The idea of Hancock is nice, and the movie starts with this nice idea. Will Smith is charming as always and the other actors do a great job, but they should have given Hancock a goal, not a partner superwoman.",Hancock
495,huren,it's so bad it's insulting,1,8 August 2008,"is this movie for real? it's hard to believe. it really makes me enjoy warning others about it because not only it wasted my time, no, it was so bad that i felt stupid and used for actually having watched more than 5 minutes of it...they were actually making fun of me for not abandoning my hopes that it will get better after these 5 minutes.and i only could take it for 15 minutes... go figure. i don't want to get into details, there is really nothing good about this one. smith should really be ashamed of his performance.one of the movies that should lead to serious consequences for the producers and most of the people responsible for the important decisions on this movie.believe me, it's bad.",Hancock
496,Ankit_Rana,"Hancock, not another super hero movie",10,9 July 2008,"Hancock is not a superhero movie... Those who have this feeling that they are going to see another superhero movie then re-make your mind. It is a movie of a guy who has super-powers. A guy who helps good guys and beat bad guys because others want him to, as they can't. The story is about John Hancock (will smith of course) who lives alone... is not very pleasant person and drinks lots of alcohol. This movie has a deferent angle about a super hero. He is not living a secret life. So he doesn't run into a elevator first to change his clothes. This movie tells you how a super hero will live a normal life like normal people except doing work and get up early. Have a family and etc.So instead of seeing a super hero movie you will see a movie of John Hancock who is a guy that is appreciated by none and is blamed for the side effects of his help towards them.. To some extent they are right as he is very casual and careless. He has no one to love.. no one loves him.But things change he is appreciated , he is loved, praised. Now he even wears a cool dress. But how, why and what about a super villain. Don't expect it here go and find out. The movie has every thing that makes it a must watch. its a comedy, emotional and super-power packed with Will Smith. 9/10",Hancock
497,pnlvijay,Don't Waste Your Time,3,3 September 2008,"""Doing something is better than nothing"" is what people say. This statement doesn't fit for this movie.Even though its a super hero movie, it is expected to have some strong points to strengthen up the story. The relationships shown in the movie are miserable. Smith and Charlize- Married coupes living from 04'BC. Smith don't remembers anything after he is attacked badly in 1930's. But Charlize remembers everything. If they both get close they loose their power. Writers should have thought a better concept to separate them.Charlize and Jason- Its little hard to find the relation between them as Charlize loves Smith, why is she pretending as she is in love with Jason. Jason can't find that his wife is a superhuman after living with her for quite a long time. As told in the movie that super heroes don't grow old.Jason and smith- Initially the plot is strong around these two but gets diluted away later. ""Hancock""- Unbelievable I gave 3/10 only for Will Smith.",Hancock

the prison scene is funny as hell.....",Hancock
499,joshL1,I liked this superhero movie.,7,13 June 2009,"I didn't see this one for awhile as the reviews seemed to hint that it was intended as a comedy and that it somehow fell short.When I saw it I realized that it was a good fresh-from-scratch (as far as I know) superhero story. Sure, there was humor to the plot that was introduced (a down-and-out type with Superman-ish powers and an image problem because he keeps screwing up) but I thought the character development was decent for a quick new superhero story, and I also liked the love story element. The hero's weakness was I thought a ""good"" one (it made me think a bit), and the love story aspect to the movie was something that worked OK I thought.There were values championed here that I didn't entirely agree with. The whole generic off-the-shelf anti-profit save-the-world-through-charity theme didn't seem to find enough contrast, I thought, though there was maybe a ""tiny"" bit. Still, some of us are accustomed at this point to having to overlook that sort of theme in order to find the elements of a story to like and I'm not sure Hollywood writers allow themselves to do many superhero stories that don't have this sort of theme hardwired into the plot whether we like it or not.What they didn't seem to have here was years and decades of comic books upon which to rely for their plot and villain and story-line development and so the movie may seem a bit more sparse than one of the big DC or Marvel Comics or other comic-book-based superhero movies, but I was very good with it, and while it may help really fill up the screen for 2 hours if you are doing a movie about 10-70 years' worth of comics, I suppose it might also weigh it down.I liked Charlize Theron. I'm not sure if it was her role, her look, her acting or the chemistry with the other actors or all four.I give it 8 stars, and would look forward to another installment if Smith and Theron really honestly wanted to do it (i.e.: if it came across as not being just about the money of a part II). I mention further development in part because I thought the basic aspects and powers and weaknesses of the superhero they created were ""not bad at all"" and so there could be other story possibilities.",Hancock
500,akembles2,Forget Marvel.,7,31 August 2020,"While Marvel is out there repeating the same old story with the same old boring actors that never seem to die, Hancock is and always will be the superhero movie we deserve.",Hancock
501,jon-631,23 Railway Cuttings?,2,4 July 2008,"I watched this film expecting a true-to-life biopic of the legendary British comedian Tony Hancock, but once again it seems that Hollywood just had to change to story to suit the idiotic public.Charlize Theron was very badly cast as Sid James, Hancock's erstwhile sidekick, and there was no mention whatsoever of some of his famous sketches like the blood donation and the economy drive.I have nothing against Will Smith but casting a black actor into a white role is just political correctness gone mad!! I'm fairly sure Tony Hancock didn't have any superpowers either, but I might be wrong on that.",Hancock
502,milostyl,A Superhero with the power to save a movie,6,5 July 2008,"It's a nice break from most superhero movies that just try so hard to take the subject matter seriously and fail so hard at it.This movie does not take the superhero seriously, it takes the person behind the superhero seriously but nothing else. No one does a better job at bringing a lofty character like Hancock down to realistic measures like Will Smith.The plot is far fetched and the twists it throws at you are beyond unreal. There's no real action. It's just scene after scene of Will, Charlize and Bateman doing what they do. Perfect roles for each of them.It's a performance movie with a questionable plot but the theme is understood. A comedy about a superhero, not easily pulled off, but an all star cast manages it well enough. Beyond the top three characters, there isn't much. The supporting cast is terrible. The bad guys are ridiculous. You really kind of believe Will Smith is a superhero because nothing else in this movie's world even comes close to him.He's a normal guy who just happens to save the day, whether he means to or not, but his greatest power is saving this movie.",Hancock
503,stompystomper,Desperate,1,10 August 2008,"Hancock was a most frustrating experience. With cinema ticket prices rising, the quality of American summer blockbusters is falling. The makers of this film failed so badly to appeal to an audience of fans of the 'lethal weapon' movies with it's outdated attempts at homophobic 'humour', and down and out heroes that it shows how desperate Hollywood is for original stories. It thinks it is progressive by presenting a story of fateful inter-racial partners with no qualms and on the flip-side mocking homosexual people. WRONG! The movie-going public has progressed further than this. I will never watch a movie directed by Peter Berg again, nor a movie starring Will Smith again, for their egos have been far too well fed.",Hancock
504,bradley-rogers-engineer,Just a stupid slow lame movie,1,20 June 2018,"I didnt see the begining only that it has Wil Smith so those with the remote insisted on watching it. So Smith is a self absorbed, self focused, self obsessed guy who chases some blond around smashing buildings. This was the most lame piece of junk Ive ever suffered thru. Smith is probably a real life alcoholic and drug user who is not able to act sober, so to give him a movie? They cast him as a drunken slob who has...uh super powers, yeah thats it, thats the ticket! Smith cant act and obviously has real life problems with substances and Hollywood wanted to make some movie with him?There is no plot, who ever produced this film is a total moron. They make excuses for Smith being a little bit off. Avoid at any cost! If you are looking for some action movie with special effects, dont waste your time or money on this flop with no story line its just a bunch of scenes and they cant even hold the camera steady. This is supposed to what, give the movie some credibility? There is nothing to cheer nothing to learn nothing real unless you like watching drug/alcoholics stumble around doing nonsense trash? Just a collection of scenes and money wasted destroying stuff hoping you think Wil Smith did it with his super powers to cover up the drug/alcohol abuse in real life.This movie is a total waste.",Hancock
505,thehursts-1,hmmm.. should have been a TV series.,5,29 August 2008,"Look, I like Will Smith's acting, he has managed to lift his last two outings, this and I am Legend out off the flop they could have been. His performance here is Fresh Prince meets Six Degrees of Separation, nothing more. Clunky photography and direction makes his lazy performance jarring at times but how can you not like Will Smith?Charlize Theron is completely wasted here, her character has no depth, which is a shame because her role is ultimately so crucial to the plot. A photograph of her is more interesting than what the scripts requires her to serve up.Jason Bateman, actually gives the best performance. His character is immediately engaging and and brings the the audience into the story through his all too human fallibilities. That said, his work is simply ignored in the second half of the film where he is relegated to an extra who hangs around to execute a fairly predictable plot device.The second half of the film... it is very much like the writers came up with a good idea but realizing this could not sustain a feature length film attempted to come up with another idea that simply is not as good, or at least not as well executed. Characters and themes important to the first half, Jason Bateman's and the boy and the theme of salvation are scrapped in the second half where under done characters, Charlize's and the villains deal with theme's of revenge and love. Either one could have made a decent movie with the cast but spliced together it simply does not work.I think this would make a great TV series along the lines of 'The Greatest American Hero"" this format would have given plenty of opportunity to explore all themes and characters and play out the comedy.",Hancock

Now, here's an actor who has had many great films over the years, and built up our trust because of them (I am Legend, Men in Black, Pursuit of happiness, Ali, etc.). He has earned his status. Now this won't ruin his career, but Will you owe us......for sitting through an hour and a half of shaky camera that was better for independent movie-making, $150 million special effects that looked like they cost half as much, a few funny jokes but a bunch more that weren't, and a laughable 'twist' that made the whole story hokey and well, let's face it, stupid.",Hancock
507,crunch_berries,Almost had it,6,1 January 2009,"Hancock is an entertaining flick. It starts out great, its got a fantastic and unique idea for a superhero. I had a lot of fun watching Hancock's antics, emotions, and general attitude toward being a superhero. Some of the other characters were great as well, particularly the supporting character of Ray, the two of them made a great match. I was very happy to be watching this film for a good while but it fell apart when it came to establishing an effective ending. this is just my opinion of course, I enjoyed the movie but I felt a lot of it was ruined by the complications and twists that did not seem to connect very well with the rest of the story and its theme of self renewal and achievement. It went in all the right directions and made a great attempt at a new kind of story but it just didn't make it in the end. But hey, its entertaining, its got some great laughs and its definitely worth a try. I imagine some people might really dig the ending. I certainly don't want to spoil anything so thats all i've got to write.",Hancock
508,luralakes,It challenges,9,1 February 2009,"I was thinking what would be a good way to start my review. This movie surely evokes extreme controversial feelings. Why? Because, all the movie-making aspects (directing, script etc) were leading to that. Why? It could have been on purpose  which I hope it was. But it could have also been because of poor execution of the idea. I am leaving the cast out of the controversies though. They were simply great. Now, I like to think it delivers controversial feelings on purpose. Isn't it motivating to you guys when a movie does not give explanations on the plate? When it does make you wonder let's say what could have happened millenniums ago? Isn't it challenging to see that our expectations could be wrong about a movie: that it was not about a superhero saving people's lives, but instead about how he was affected by this way of being? If we do not recognize that such controversies come from our difficulty to grasp different (or deep) ways of thinking, than we will surely blame on the movie. Yes, it could have been longer, but it was in line with the purpose of leaving things unrevealed. I personally love that: to have the space to imagine and visualize what could be beyond. Maybe you should dare to do that and not expect the movie to do it for you. And if you are not willing, fine. Just, find another movie that satisfies that need of yours. There are plenty of them. This one is for people who like the duality and completion from opposites: humor-gravity, good-evil, surface-depth, male-female, and so on. I would love to see a sequel. But it would be fine without that too. Thanks.",Hancock

My only complaint of this movie was, IT WAS TOO SHORT!!!! Will Smith is always a treat to see at the movies. But I must say this was worth the whole family going to.For those of you who have not seen it, do not listen to the critics. The two audiences I sat with cheered at the end and laugh throughout.

Well long story short, I went to the matinée and I still felt like I overpaid.This movie doesn't know what it wants to be- it's comedy/action for the first 45 minutes, drama for the next 40, and corny, gag me please garbage for the last 5.The jokes fell flat and nobody in the theater knew what was supposed to be funny. The resolution was pretty lame as well. I hoped Jason Bateman could bring some humor to the story, as I am a big fan of Arrested Development, but he just doesn't have the tools or dialogue to do so here. Things start to get ""serious"" story-wise and the plot elements are so ridiculous all you can do is groan and roll your eyes.Final Verdict : D Don't go to it.",Hancock
511,Violent_Mike,"It was good, but the ending was a bit weak.",6,8 July 2008,"**Warning-May contain spoilers** Don't get me wrong, I liked this movie. The beginning especially was good, with a lot of comedy and action that made me think I'd made a good choice in going to see it. However, it started getting a little weak toward the middle and, in my humble opinion, the ending was a little on the weak side. Also, the movie was pretty predictable. I had most of the plot-twists figured out before they were ever even vaguely mentioned by the characters. Then at the end of the movie, everything sort of fell apart in my eyes. Everything turned out alright for everyone except for the bad guys. In my opinion, there need to be more movies like the Saw series that defy the Hollywood cliché of happily ever after. Don't get me wrong, I love it when the good guys win. But sometimes, their triumph is far too convenient to be believable, even in the context of the movie. I like when there are twists where things still turn out all right, but maybe the hero lost his/her dog to the villain. So, in the end, Hancock was a good movie that could have been a lot better if they had somehow defied that age-old cliché of the good guys ending up with everything better than it was.",Hancock

Smith and Bateman show good chemistry and work well together. The movie hits you in the face with a couple of twists and original schemes that I have yet to see in other films. Nonetheless, at the end of the movie I still felt that there was just something missing to keep this movie in the race with other summer blockbusters like Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk. Still yet, the action sequences and special effects were fantastic. I didn't think this movie was as good as some of the other movies Smith has done in the past, but its still a must see film for the summer.",Hancock

There are only, really, two notable flaws to this flick. The first is the fact that it really isn't a good example for the kiddies. The second.... well is the fact that there was never a sequel.This is one of my favorite movies and I am still trying to put my finger on exactly why. Perhaps it's just the originality of it. Maybe it's the undeniable chemistry between Charlize and Will. Don't care. It's a must see in my book!",Hancock

For its genre I think it deserves an 8 actually.You're no doubt aware that this is a flying superhero movie that revolves around the main character's personality flaws. I've never read/seen the comic that this was born from but I wholeheartedly applaud the transition. Smith is great, the script is funny, and the effects are top notch. I for one didn't like the trailers and as a result expected the movie to suck,but in actual fact it's far more ""adult"" that you would expect and delivers a lot of laughs.I highly recommend Hancock and so do (I assume) the 300 or so other people who were laughing their asses off in the theatre.",Hancock
515,KaptD,Hancock it a good film with a great storyline,9,20 July 2008,"I think Will Smith has done it again. The humor matched with the tragedy in this movie is wonderful. The movie is plucky and keeps you laughing through out. The supporting actors of Jason Batemen and Charlize Theron were perfectly cast. Hancock does have adult language so keep an eye out on that for the kids. The story line was well written and gives the audience a great script to follow. Will gives a great performance and give his character true depth in the movie. Overall a great movie, I hated to see it end. I gave it a 9 out of 10 because the move seemed too short. It left you wanting more and in my opinion that is the mark of a great movie.",Hancock
516,robauld-1,"For some reason, underrated.",7,4 July 2008,"I read a number of reviews made by people who had watched the pre-screening and a number of criticisms that came up was things like camera work, the last half of the movie, lack of supervillain, epic fight etc etc The whole point of this movie is to see it behind a superhero who to be honest, isn't really super. This is a hero who doesn't follow the rules, who isn't ridiculously polite with a cool costume. He has a bad attitude and uses his powers to do what what he likes, though not to do bad things. It's more to it then that, it explores why he is who he is. What most superhero movies don't pick up on is what the knowledge of being the only one of your kind does to you. The film may not be action packed with a supervillain to fight and smash things up fighting but it does make you feel for Hancock, you feel sympathy for him.The other characters, such as Ray who is saved by Hancock and is the only one to thank him for his efforts despite demolishing a whole train doing it then trys to change his public image and his wife, who resents Hancock (for good reason, as explained in the film later) and is largely redundant for the first half the film (for definant good reason, as explained later in the film) are very minor when compared to Hancock, their history isn't as explored. Now, i know most people want the characters they are watching to be explored and to have in depth knowledge about them but this isn't about them, as the title of the movie suggests.There are some nice ideas, such as why Hancock is who he is and how todays world would probably react to a superhero and the damage he/she causes and yes, the ideas arn't used as effectively as they could have done but the rest of the film takes up the slack left by those minor faults. The twist is a well thought idea. The ending, while perhaps predictable, slightly silly, is excellent in my opinion. But it might just be me, I'm a sucker for Will Smith and superhero movies.I recommend this thoroughly. While not a conventional superhero movie, the special effects are amazing, a decent story with Will Smith's phenomenal acting as Hancock is worth the ticket price.It's a shame it's picked up so much criticism. Ignore them until you have seen it.",Hancock

I felt as though I needed to stick up for the movie after reading all the horrible reviews. I went to see it on the 4th, mainly because the trailers looked entertaining and because I enjoy Will Smith. This movie is not at all what I expected. There is a surprising turn of events that I did not see coming. Will Smith, in his usual style, is quick, funny, witty, and charming and I thought the timing between he and Jason Bateman was perfect. If you are expecting to see a movie along the lines of Hulk, Iron Man, Batman, etc, don't go because you won't enjoy it. If you are going because you like the cast and are ready to be entertained for 1 hour and 20 minutes out of your life, then it is definitely worth the price of admission.",Hancock
519,Brandon6019,Positive Aspects? Didn't expect that...,6,11 January 2009,"John Hancock is a film which I just watched via DVD. I had not seen this in theaters because it didn't look like a movie for me. After watching the movie, I was taken by surprise a bit. I expected this awful drawn out corny plotted film. Although the plot can be considered to be a bit ""corny"" I think it almost helps the movie. I gave this movie a 7 out of 10. So I'm thinking that's like an average score, maybe a C in a class? It held my attention, made me laugh a few times, gave me those great 1 liners that you can't get out of your head for 2 days after. But it also had a somewhat nice ending, throughout the movie you start to predict what will happen, but the nice thing is, it almost gives you several options as to ""what could happen."" I think that's a huge positive aspect in this movie. So would I recommend the movie? If you're at the video store, or on your Netflix account, can't seem to figure out what you want to see next, give it a try. It's only like 90 minutes, and I don't think you'll walk away thinking it was a waste of 90 minutes.",Hancock

Unfortunately, I'm not sure the writers could get those questions answered and keep the audience. Will Smith is a good actor, so naturally he does a good job in this film, but since the writing lacked I thought that the movie lacked despite Will's best effort. The cinematography was done well. Some of the shots were interesting to see. There is a lot of cussing, too much in my opinion. It became trashy instead of tasteful. Tone down the cussing and take the story back to the drawing board and you'd have a good flick.",Hancock
521,matt_brandon,"Good film, weak ending.",7,3 July 2008,"Going into this film I was slightly apprehensive, I wanted to enjoy it, but I wasn't sure it was going to be any good. I came out pleasantly surprised, the first hour of the 90 minutes, were funny, fast moving and a general good watch, the CGI was excellent, and as usual, the one liners from Will Smith were coming thick and fast. This was all great, until the film slowed to a grinding halt and vague stories of Hancock's past, and his dealings with Bateman's wife, who's name I've forgotten. The idea that they are mortal when close together was strange and not at all supported, remember when Smith is beating her with the kitchen things, surely that would have injured her, had the theory of there mortality when close been true. It appears little thought was put into the climax. If you accept the explanations for the powers etc, it all seems very plausible, but the rough edges of it all leave it hard to do this. Finally I am aware that I would not have enjoyed that film at all had it not been for Will Smith, credit to him for a seamless performance.",Hancock
522,Corky67,Enjoyable...if not reckless like it's hero.,6,22 July 2008,"In my eyes, Hancock is definitely what you would define as a ""blockbuster"". It is an original idea, it's action packed, funny, possesses a sound cast, it is infested with special effects and, generally, has that ""blockbuster"" feel about it. It is most definitely an entertaining film and there's no doubt in my mind that you will feel satisfied upon exiting the cinema however, it soon hits you that Hancock could have, and should have, been a better film. With a concept as original as Hancock, Peter Berg, does not necessarily fail, but is just unable to fully fulfil it's potential. As many a critic has pointed out, the first half of Hancock is great: the plot flows well, Hancock's character is developed very soundly and the spoofs are genuinely amusing. It is often pointed out though, that the second-half of Hancock is what lets it down. I for one, thought exactly the same when I had seen it but, after having a little ponder I decided that the problem was that Hancock was simply too short for it's own good. The events of the second-half are entertaining, don't get me wrong, it's just once the first-half has passed, it feels as though the rest of the film was mindlessly thrown together and it feels awfully rushed. Certain aspects of the story aren't fully explained, Jason Bateman's character is almost completely forgotten, the villain is weak (with no disrespect to Eddie Marsan who gives an effective performance despite this) and the ending, really, is just far too abrupt.But, like I mentioned before, Hancock is an enjoyable movie. Dialogue is snappy and the three lead characters are all developed very well. Will Smith puts in a sound performance as the lonely, public-scorning superhero Hancock and Charlize Theron is effective as the loving wife of Jason Bateman (who is also effective) giving a softly intimidating performance. Special effects are convincing and nicely portray the results of Hancock's recklessness. The action scenes are exciting enough that they make up for some of the film's low-points during the second-half.Hancock is definitely an enjoyable movie but it's lack of coherence during it's second-half and dodgy runtime of 92 minutes means it is unable to completely fulfil it's highly potential concept. Entertaining, nonetheless.",Hancock
523,violatedterror-2,Hancock: The Beginning sealed the deal.,7,7 July 2008,"Hancock isn't a film for everyone. I truly believe the trailer gave the wrong impression to a wide vote of people that the movie was going to be a comedy. The movie even starts off of a comedic foot only to switch feet abruptly about 45 minutes in. Was the shift to drama unneeded? Yes, the movie could've done perfectly fine without if it kept up it's upbeat comedy tempo but the shift did add some substance to the film although the shift to the drama wasn't the smoothest of shifts. Will Smith did a great job as did Charlize Theron but who really came out and did the best was Jason Batemen. My only true gripe with Hancock was the repetition of some scenes (i.e. Prison Talk Scene, Basketball Scene) and the crappy camera work in the majority of the shots. Now while the remainder of the movie after the shift was no where near the greatness of the beginning half, the movie still lands out at solid 7 out of 10.",Hancock

But just like any good scientist, I proved myself wrong.The first half, is all about character development. It shows us this super hero, whom everyone believes to be an asshole, and only causes problems, making you think ""man, that guy really is a jerk."" I really REALLY liked the first half. Then they introduce new characters, which at fist I was uneasy about.However the SECOND the blonde woman was introduced, I leaned over and whispered to the guy next to me (yes, I'm that person) ""I bet they were together at one point in time."" Correct.Next, I was thinking ""i bet she has powers too"". Correct. She was poorly developed, and I felt like the connection between the two were never really fulfilled.As soon as she was introduced as a super hero, it lost all its points with me. The movie was completely ruined, 40 minutes into it.Not to mention, the ending was INCREDIBLY rushed. Like ""hi, I'm your wife, we're getting shot, done."" Adding to it's lack of connection.They had me buying it on DVD, both special edition and regular edition, until i felt like it was just another comic movie, poorly done.Although, I did like the reference to Buster.",Hancock
525,PcWm,What was Will Smith and his agent thinking!!,4,13 July 2008,"OK, its not a completely awful film, it was mildly entertaining and some parts kinda funny, but these parts are extremely brief. The film starts on one plot line, and then decides to change it completely half way through. I mean there were some impressive action scenes, but they only last a couple of minutes and some of them are put in their for no particular reason, its just their to entertain you which its supposed to do of course but it has no effect to the plot itself. The beginning of the film is extremely boring, when Hancock is put into prison, but when he gets out, the film becomes as i said mildly entertaining.This isn't no exaggeration this is one of the worst films Will Smith has ever been involved in, its really not worth going to the cinema for, maybe check it out on the internet if you would like to be mildly entertained if not go and watch Deal or No Deal instead.",Hancock
526,nikbik,Twist on superhero films,7,5 July 2008,"It makes a change from all those pumped up, perfect superheroes as the character of Hancock is drunken, ill-mannered and generally unpleasant in most aspects. The scenes with Will Smith playing his wisecracking best are the most memorable, although Jason Bateman is a good, solid support. The only thing I disliked is the way the film descended into schmaltzy territory in the latter part. In some respects I didn't care what happened to certain characters, it was just the typical Hollywood syrup ladled on. The plot weakened and the scriptwriters obviously thought lots of shoot em up action would compensate - and that's what lets Hancock down. Overall though, its a pretty good film compared to what's on at the moment.",Hancock
527,reflectivist,This is one of my favorite superhero flicks,8,4 July 2008,"I thought Will Smith did a great job, and it's one of my favorite Will Smith flicks. Also at the top of my list of superhero flicks, along with Iron Man (2008) and Daredevil (2003)It's different and that's one of the things I enjoyed. Not a lot of tired old car chases, things blowing up, overblown fights or shoot-outs.Interesting plot, good cast, good acting, good characters, nothing was over-acted. They made it believable as this kind of flick can get. They got the length of the film right. Just a smart creative entertaining movie with a solid ending.",Hancock
528,heartsaflutter,only the start of something,8,9 July 2008,"OK so the trailer doesn't give a true image of the film with it's comedy scenes and of course will smith who we always expect to be funny and of course, smooth! This film I think isn't your typical superhero film, yet but if there is a sequel it would be! Here we find Hancock struggling with who he is and finding answers. There is tension between Charlize Theron and Will Smith's character which you could cut with a knife and when this comes to light as why it makes the film so touching. This film is about the consequences and weaknesses of being a superhero. Charlize is his weakness and so they can never be together. The scene where Charlize reminds him of this is so sad and when Will Smith is trying to get away from her so she'll come back to life was heartbreaking. There are some funny scenes but I think it should be seen as just the beginning as the next Hancock film could be great. Will Smith as usual is so great and really makes you feel for him. OK so maybe not in this film but one day he should definitely be given an Oscar if not for his amazing acting skills but for the most liked person in show business!x",Hancock
529,info-17209,Not Your Typical Superhero,8,18 July 2008,"Hancock is not your typical superhero.But is that really such a bad thing? In recent times of comic book after comic book converting to the big screen with your typical ""good guy, chummy"" superheros with super powers it's a relief to see a superhero that steps outside the box.Hancock is far from perfect. He is cocky and reckless, unappreciated and careless. He drinks all the time and treats people with as much or little respect as they treat him. Nearly everyone views his disregard as brash and constantly call him an ""asshole"". This attitude only makes him act more thoughtless. In one sweep he takes out blocks of the city Until one day he saves the right person.Ray Embrey, a local PR man, is rescued from a runaway train by Hancockwho manages to create quite a disaster during his rescue attempt. As the people around the scene boo and hiss at Hancock, Ray stands up for him, thanks him, and shakes his hand. Bond made, they work together to make the people find a reason to love Hancockmuch to Hancock's chagrin.Though I don't want to give away too much, I will say this. Hancock has every reason to act the way that he does. Years before he was abandoned and left for dead. This event left him scarred and alone. In the end Hancock finally finds a reason to do what he does and enjoy itthanks to Ray and his family.This film received more bad reviews than I believe it was due. Though Hancock is by no means an exceptionally great movie, it was entertaining and worth the money. Some of the ideas behind his powers and the way they affected the world around him were far more believable than a boy getting bit by a spider and suddenly having spider-like powers (Don't get me wrong, I love Spiderman) or a hero from another planet that comes to save us all. Hancock is believable, human, and most important normal.",Hancock
530,ratw-1,Who's Peter Berg?!?,4,1 August 2008,"When I first saw the movie's wallpaper I said to myself that it will be a decent one.The only things that I knew about it were the facts that Hancock was an alcoholic and ironic hero,a great scenario which had all the ingredients for a brilliant comedy. I expected Hancock to make ironic and sublime jokes not bucolic drollery,the peak being reached at the moment when our unamusing humanoid inserts a mug's head in the butt of another.This movie is a blotch on The Fresh Prince's career,to me it looks that the movie has been treated with superficiality.What would have happened if Charlize Theron wouldn't have been a part from the Hollywood's profits machine.If Mary's role would have been played by Talisa Soto(e.g.)the profit would have gone downhill.With a better director it would have been a different story and analysis,a remake would be good.Bar the poster,everything was undistinguished and stupid.",Hancock

If ANY other actors were placed in this movie, it would be a B-Movie. Make that a D. C-R-A-P. I LOVE the actors, think they are excellent. But completely wasted here. It started off as a good idea... but then it just seemed as though the writers said, ""Screw it! I'm tired of actually writing this. Let's just say *this* happens, and call it a day. It's been a whole 37 minutes we've spent writing this, and I need a drink."" DO NOT go and spend your hard earned money on this. Wait until a friend rents it, and go see it at their house.",Hancock

At first, it is mostly comical, but as it progresses it gets gradually more sincere. However, these ideas may clash, but it makes for some of the best viewing of the 21st century. How many movies have you seen that has a drunk superhero, who picks on little kids? How many movies have you seen with a superhero who doesn't have a job? Please attend this movie with an open mind, as the concepts within this film can be a little confusing. But this film has been made so we don't have to live with the idea that superman is all perfect, that batman really does have a batmobile, but what they do have is a personality and a personal life.",Hancock

So why wouldn't a person with super powers also fall for the same trappings? Think about it... you see movies stars that are rich and powerful and have everything they could ever want, lose it all to alcohol.This movie breaks the mold that people with powers fall into two categories.Type 1 - The Good: People that fight evil at all cost and have moderate character flaws.Type 2 - The Bad: Evil villains that are workaholics and work non-stop to make their evil dreams come true.Now we have Hancock.

The film was funny enough to keep you entertained for the first hour or so, but overall, the adding of another superhero into the spectrum killed the story towards the middle of the film. I thought Will Smith's Acting was pretty good, but the rest of the cast was pretty bad. And the climax fight scene also left me disappointed, along with the confusing end to it. I also thought the Nancy Grace thing wasn't needed exactly. I liked the films, but it is not one of my all time favorites. It was an overall OK film compared to what I have heard. Plus, the reviews were a little off in my opinion (It seems more like a 50% film, doesn't it?",Hancock

But the fact that this happens in every hero movie gets on my nerves. I first watched the movie expecting it to be a total different one from the other superhero movies, i was seriously bored of the invincible guys. Well, the starting 1 hour of the movie kinda was the way i wanted it to be, like we saw will smith in the promos. Comedy, action etc. was all there was. But later came in the same old 'sexy' superwoman and their history. Ain't that old already? but the story progressed well, so was the direction top class. Whatever, still could have been better.

536,hal_red_03,"I thought Hancock was an action-packed movie, with romance and comedy thrown in at the right times.",9,28 February 2009,"Hancock, is about a immortal man, John Hancock (Will Smith) with supernatural powers and a major attitude including drinking problems, who is hated by the public. When Hancock saves Ray (Jason Bateman), he is offered help to improve his public image. While working with Ray, Hancock meets Ray's wife, Mary (Charlize Theron) and son, Aaron (Jae Head). What Hancock cant figure out is, why Mary is so unsure and cold around him. But after Hancock figures out the truth, he starts becoming mortal, and maybe the only way to get this powers back is to get as far away from Ray's family as possible. I thought Hancock was a stunning movie with many chilling surprises. Charlize Theron was brilliant, and her coldness towards Hancock was extremely relevant and played an important part towards the end. Jason Bateman played a fantastic role as a supportive and faithful friend towards Hancock. Jae Head was very cute, and a great actor. But Will Smith was clearly the star, as he transformed from a rough and hard man , to a kind and brave hero. I loved Hancock, it was a truly fantastic movie that made me think about it, even after the end credits popped on.",Hancock

If you're o.k. with this, read on.I've heard so many bad things about this movie from friends, read bad reviews and whatnot but I like Will Smith and though the plot to be interesting so I watched it.I've seen my share of superhero movies: Batman, Superman, Spider man, The incredible Hulk... but a superhero bum? This one was bound to be different, and it was. If you want to see something on par with other superhero movies, an action-packed rock-you-out-of-your-seat thriller of a movie, then this movie is not for you. This movie was less about action, and more about character development.Imagine the batman movies where Bruce Wayne is discovering what he wants to do with his life, the Superman movies where young Clark Kent wonders where he came from, add in a lot of The incredible hulk movies where the Hulk is smashing everything left and right... take out all the action scenes, leave maybe one or two... and you've got this movie.If you like movies with twists, this one has definitely got one, but I doubt anyone would guess it beforehand.Just watch the movie, I don't like when people say ""its not that bad"" because it wasn't bad at all... it was rather good!",Hancock

Until, that is, he saves the life of a P.R. man, who makes it his mission in life to turn around public opinion.People on here have spent hours debating the how's, the what's, the what-if's, the why's...nonsense.Break out the popcorn, sit down, and as somebody else on here said - turn your brain off, and enjoy this film! it's one that makes you laugh, cry, and cheer.

Imagine my surprise when I went to see this movie today and loved it. I've seen Iron Man, Incredible Hulk, Indiana Jones 4 and now HANCOCK. The only movie that was even close was Iron Man. Indiana Jones, and believe me this is coming from an IJ fanatic, was OK at best. It went from being a believable ""Average, Everyday"" Hero, to this alien crap. I was waiting for Dr. Jones to peel back his skin and reveal that he too was in fact an alien. The Incredible Hulk...what can I say? Ummm.. it wasn't bad. As oppose to IJ4 we new what we were going to get CGI, CGI, CGI. But c'mon how many times can a movie be made. They come out with a new Incredible Hulk, Spiderman, Superman, Batman every other year, seriously! No new story lines just...This is batman, this is the Hulk as if they are introducing them to us for the first time. Yeah, yeah I know who they are, I seen a similar version last year.I look at Hancock as a refreshing new story that hasn't been told on the big screen. I'm trying my best not to give out spoilers because I hate knowing what's going to happen before I see a movie. But the general idea is that Hancock is a superhero who basically hates the world and the world hates him (except when they need him) You can see that he is obviously depressed which leads to his drinking, which leads to a wake of damage left in his path as he tries to fulfill his roll as a superhero. We watch as he goes from being an anti-hero to a superhero that the people can get behind.I loved everything about this movie. The acting was very good, special effects were great and it had a lot of comedic moments in this film. My comment is not here for the HATERS. You can go to the Godfather or Shawshank Redemption page and you'll have idiots saying they were the worse movies ever made. For whatever reason they want to hate so....let them hate. This comment is for the Will Smith fans who think these haters are right. I promise to all the Will Smith fans out there, you will not be disappointed. In fact, tomorrow I'm going to see it again.

Will Smith is an incredible actor and the story has some real flesh to it.The twist comes, and it all starts going downhill.

But he is a social misfit, seemingly with no direction in his life. He is a loner, living in a trailer near the ocean, and seems to spend most of his spare time with a bottle of booze to his mouth. As a result, when the cops seek him out to help, he flies erratically, shearing off parts of buildings in the process, tends to tear up the road with his landings, and destroys cars, trucks, and trains that happen to be nearby. As a result the public has a love/hate feeling about Hancock, and lately mostly hate.Hancock doesn't know his history. Eighty years earlier he woke up in a Miami hospital and didn't know who he was. When it was time to release him he was asked to ""put your John Hancock here"" and assumed his name was John Hancock! Because of his superpowers he doesn't age as a normal person would.Into the picture comes Jason Bateman as P.R. expert Ray Embrey. Ray sees an opportunity to polish Hancock's image, to make him more valuable to society and turn him into a gentleman. Part of that was for Hancock to submit to prison time for all the things he had destroyed, and in the process learn to quit drinking.The third key character is Charlize Theron as Ray's wife, Mary Embrey. We notice that she is very hesitant when she first meets Hancock at her home, but we don't know why. But it becomes an important part of the story.So here we have 3 very good actors in Smith, Bateman, and Theron. They create very interesting characters and the movie is very entertaining.

In all the other super hero movies you never get to see real people. It is always cartoonish. You know, dark swirly clouds. They could have left that and the bad language out. Still, I think this is a great candidate for a second movie. Won't happen though. One thing that always kills a movie in the US is blacks and whites kissing. Personally I don't care but facts is facts. Look at the data. Now that ""Hancock"" has been introduced to us, I'd love to see a second movie more on the serious side. It would be cool to see what would happen if Hancock got involved in some real life type issue we deal with in today's world like the many wars going on around the world. A super hero doesn't always need to have Kryptonite. Fighting an unwinable war would be interesting for a super hero. It is always the same story line though with the movie industry.

Hancock has super strength and can fly but does really have an outfit. Also he's not really liked by the people as he doesn't really like them either. Hancock, from what I can say and people can agree with me, has the power to start arguments with the people and has a way with words for them.The only problem I have with this movie is the lack of thought for a SUPERvillian. Ray's wife, Mary, who is just like Hancock in every way besides their sex, can be called a villain at some point.

Were the plot holes less damning, I would rate this movie an 8 easily. I still highly recommend this movie.*****SPOILERS***** Now time for the plot holes and other spoilers. The first one is simply nitpicking. When Hancock throws the boy Michelle up in the air, the sudden acceleration at both the beginning and end of Michelle's journey surely would have killed him.More problematic is when Hancock goes to prison and most of the inmates circle and threaten him. In much the same way that a mugger with a knife as a weapon won't attack an entire swat team, a group of unarmed thugs would not logically attack the equivalent of Superman. Sure there might be a few crazy inmates who would think they could do something, but not the dozens shown in the movie.Last is the whole thing about Hancock and Mary losing their powers whenever they are close. The proximity and duration, the only two factors affecting their power loss, seem to be inconsistent throughout the movie. They lived in the same city for years so the distance has to be relatively small. Since this is the case, Hancock should not have gotten injured at the liquor store if Mary was at her home as was shown in the previous scene. That would most likely have been ample distance between the two for them to remain immortal. Still, after Hancock got shot, Mary should have fled the city ASAP after she found out Hancock got shot. That way Hancock could have gotten healed almost immediately. She could have then returned and he left then all would be fine.Not a plot hole but still a spoiler: The hospital scene when Hancock is about to get killed and Ray comes to save the day is far too comedic for the mood set by the preceding 10 minutes and by the following 3 minutes. I would have been perfectly fine if Ray had knocked out the villain, but chopping off his other hand in addition to the lack of music, the villain's comment of ""You didn't!"" and the panning to his hook hand completely destroys the mood. Those five seconds absolutely destroy the movie and that is the biggest flaw with the movie, easily costing it 1 star.",Hancock
550,lilguy156,Great Movie,10,3 July 2008,"Wow. What a movie. I went in thinking this was just your run of the mill summer action movie, But let me tell you, it is all that and then some. The story was awesome, the acting was fantastic, the whole thing was just great. I'm not going to go into what the movie was about because everyone already knows, but let me tell you, your money will not be wasted on this movie. I laughed, I was wowed by the special effects, and get this, it even brought tears to my eyes more than once. A terrific job by everyone involved. My hat is off to all of you. Thanks. This is the kind of movie that makes you remember why you love to go to the movies. I know none of the people who were in it or made it will probably ever read this but if they do, Thank you. You should all be incredibly proud of yourselves.",Hancock
551,poohtiger,Surprise! Hancock is actually good.,8,3 July 2008,"Based on all the negative reviews coming out on Hancock. I thought going in this movie would be pretty bad. Batman and Robin bad. Catwoman bad. Wild Wild West bad. Speed Racer bad. But lo and behold it delivers the goods. I agree with the consensus that the first half is funny and has all the jokes and the second half gets all serious and dark. But I thought that it worked. Will, Jason, and Charlize were all great. The effects were good, not great. I just imagined that this would be a total train wreck of a movie and it's nowhere close to that. It's entertaining and I actually plan to see it again. That's why I say a person is their own best critic. Don't listen to the media. As far as ranking Hancock with the other pics of the summer that I've seen I would say Iron Man, Indy, Hancock, Prince Caspian, Wanted, and The Incredible Hulk. Haven't seen any other ones yet. But I'm glad Hancock turned out to be good.",Hancock

553,mister_a,a SUPER-disappointing movie,5,4 July 2008,"I have never been more sorely disappointed with a film in my entire life. Peter Berg apparently didn't to know who he made the movie for as parts seem geared toward a younger demographic (Will Smith doing ridiculous things that are cartoonish and physically impossible) while other moments are quite adult (certain scenes border on an R-rating). These elements would be fine if Hancock were purely and action movie for grown-ups or a light-hearted comedy for the whole family, but it just doesn't work trying to have them both in the same film. Also, the comedy just didn't ""click"" for me, it seemed out of place and childish, and the entire role of the guy from Arrested Development (an AWFUL show in my opinion) didn't need to be there - and the same goes for Charlize Theron's character. The shaky cam was distracting, the characters were unlikable (other than Hancock), the story was whack, and as with I am Legend, the Fresh Prince is the only saving grace, but unlike that movie, the depths of his acting talent cannot save a movie that is this broken. Worst of all, the best scenes were in the trailers, making them more entertaining to watch than the actual thing - I almost asked my friends if they wanted to walk out. The one good thing in it - the action - does not last nearly long enough to warrant the rest of the picture. Do yourself a favor, even if you love Will Smith, and save your money. Check this website before watching another Will Smith movie, and never see another one of Peter Berg's messes.",Hancock
554,sigurdurkolbeinn,Will at his best,9,9 January 2020,"A nice action flick with lol moments in abundance. Changes tone in second half and I didn't have any problems with that just more for the buck. Loved the acting, all the main characters have great charisma and likability. Overall, well above average and highly enjoyable.",Hancock
555,Curt-23,Refreshing new angle in a sea of 'Same old' superhero movies,9,1 July 2008,"I'm surprised that I liked this movie so well. I went in with pretty low expectations.Take a moment to readjust your perspective. Hancock is not your typical superhero movie. The villains are not larger than life. This is a movie with the premise of what might it really be like if there were superheroes among us.The twist is fun, and adds some explanation to an otherwise random meeting of people. Are there cheesy bits? Yes. Would it have been a better movie without some of the more unnecessary crASS comedy? Yes. But overall, we laughed, we empathized, we left the theater happy and talking about the subtleties. What more could you ask for for a summer popcorn flick, really?",Hancock
556,kyrintethron,Popcorn Bucket Reviews - Hancock,9,17 July 2008,"Hancock was the highly anticipated Will Smith superhero movie about a super who's not really quite the hero. It was Will's 8th blockbuster film in a row, making him the only actor in history to achieve such a feat. The trailer was hilarious, it was visually astounding, and it stirred up quite a buzz. So how was the movie?Story: 5/5 Buckets Of Popcorn Hancock is the story of a single man on Earth with superhuman powers but not the super hero mentality. He rises to the needs of the public, but not nearly as gracefully as, say, Spider-Man or even The Incredible Hulk.With alcoholic tendencies, a general disregard for public property, Hancock serves as the ultimate conundrum: he saves the day, but causes millions in damage; he helps uphold the law, all while breaking it at the same time. The cops want him arrested, but how do you capture a super hero?Well I'll try to not to divulge too much of the movie, because it's quite good really. But suffice it to say that this problem is creatively overcome by Hancock happening across a public relations manager (Jason Bateman) whose wife (Charlize Theron) doesn't approve of the hapless hero being around.Bateman suggests that Will turn himself in to clean up his public image so that he won't be hated everywhere he goes, he does some time in jail until the police chief calls in for his help, and Hancock saves the day in a mass of broken glass, bullets, and explosions.Ordinarily, this would only warrant a few Popcorn Buckets, but I didn't tell you about the second half, which is awesome and earns the story a full 5 Buckets Of Popcorn out of 5.Acting: 4/5 Buckets Of Popcorn If you've been paying attention to the film world at all, you'd know that this cast is renowned for its on screen presence. Jason Bateman's Emmy-nominated and Golden Globe-winning, Carlize Theron is an Academy Award winner, and Will Smith has gotten better with age like a good bottle of wine. Earning 2 Oscar nods, Will has shown growth like no other since his 2004 blockbuster I, Robot into the charming, mature actor he is today.In the movie, Bateman plays the perfect regular human buddy of the hero, torn between his appreciation and gratitude toward Hancock for saving his life and his wife who has little but contempt for him.Charlize gives another fantastically convincing performance as the bitter, cautious wife of Bateman, which really comes to life in the second half of the movie...which I'm not telling you about.Will shows us a side of him that we rarely get to see as the gritty, uncaring ne'er-do-well that Hancock is. He is still true to his comedic stylings that made us all love The Fresh Prince from the beginning, but he comes with the acting chops that got him nominated in Pursuit Of Happiness.This movie really does ride more on its special effects and great story, but the performances and subtle nuances and mannerisms that these three bring to the movie earn Hancock 4 out of 5 Buckets Of Popcorn.Entertainment: 5/5 Buckets Of Popcorn Entertainment?! This movie's got it in spades! From beginning to end, this is good old fashioned fun, the way that Will Smith's always done it. I mean, come on, it's a super hero movie. If it wasn't entertaining, it would've totally missed the mark.The movie starts off with Hancock hilariously sleeping on a park bench, hung-over from liquor consumption, and being called to duty by a little boy. To start his heroics off right, he dashes off into the sky, destroying the park bench and sidewalk where he took off from.He zooms through the Los Angeles skies, smashing through highway signs, destroying the road, and ultimately impaling the SUV of the bad guys on the steeple of the Met-Life building. This scene's got everything entertainment requires: hilarious dialogue, gunfire, invincibility, flying, destruction, and the ultimate ridiculous scenario of a truck hanging from the top of a building.As the movie continues along, the hilarity tones down a bit form the high comedy to a more tame (save for one jailhouse scene), becoming more focused on the story and the special effects that make this movie so much fun.Again, in the second half that I'm not going to talk about here, the movie shifts into high gear, resulting in one of the more entertaining movies of this decade. 5 out of 5 Buckets Of Popcorn.Movie Magic: 4/5 Buckets Of Popcorn Sticking to the formula that first made him a star in Independence Day, continued his success in Men In Black, shined through in I, Robot, and most of his other movies, Will has created another summer blockbuster with amazing special effects.From flying, to explosions, to wind storms, throwing a whale across a beach, and all the other supernatural feats that take place, this movie delivers up a heavy batch of movie magic that you won't soon forget.It's not the same spaceship battles, blowing up cities effects you get in ID4, but they definitely know how to sell a movie with some CGI. For that, Hancock receives 4 out of 5 Buckets Of Popcorn.Overall Score: 4.5/5 Buckets Of Popcorn - At Least My 2nd Favorite Will Smith MoviePlease visit http://www.celebsystem.com for more Popcorn Bucket Reviews.",Hancock
557,isaacn-38374,really cool,10,6 May 2019,"This movie was much more intriguing then other super heroes movie.

559,alx_maria,best movie i've seen in months,10,17 July 2008,"The only thing i can say is you should see this movie, it worths all the money. I really haven't seen such a good movie for months! Great special effects, great actors, great plot. When i bought tickets to this film i wasn't sure it was the right choice, because i find the superhero movies kind of boring and predictable, but this one is a really unic idea, dotted with a lot of funny moments(i didn't expect to laugh watching a superhero movie), also with some romantic and dramatic moments. So if you wanna have some quality time watching a good movie, trust me, you should see Hancock. I definitivly recommend it! I'm 100% sure you won't be sorry!",Hancock
560,Moviesjonno,Don't expect to much!,7,16 July 2008,"OK people this is my first comment ever so don't flame me to hard OK. I watched this movie yesterday and i must say i was surprised by it. Hancock is a superhero movie and i must say i don't like them very much. A friend of mine convinced me to come with him and we enjoyed the movie i must say.What makes this movie fun to watch is Will Smith and his so recognizable humor. And that its not an average superhero movie, the plot is a little different from spider man, iron man and those other Marvel productions.Don't expect to much from this movie, it does what it does. My opinion is that if you don't expect to much you will enjoy yourself.",Hancock
561,oreodogvomit,"""Really not OK"" (spoilers)",2,3 July 2008,"This movie does not live up to the hype at all. I don't even know where to begin. As a comic reader I don't think the idea of a substance abusing superhero is all that new, however, it's not something we see on film that often so kudos to the makers for that. That, however, does not save the film from an underdeveloped story with characters I didn't give a crap about. The ending was so anticlimactic, the vague origin of Hancock and Mary felt uninspired and too convenient, and the humor was hackneyed and unoriginal. It turned into a different movie halfway through and got really boring.I can honestly say this movie was worse than what I was expecting (and I wasn't expecting much after seeing the trailers). It's not a good popcorn movie; it's not even a good TV dinner movie. I wish I had seen WALL-E instead.",Hancock
562,havocrazerdb,Completely Original and Refreshing,8,2 July 2008,"This movie has received a lot of negative feedback due to people disliking the genre. These nay-sayers have most likely not even seen the movie or walked into the theater with a bad taste in their mouths and were determined to denounce the film before even watching it. With that being said Hancock is not revolutionary, however, you won't be dissatisfied when exiting the theater after seeing this film. Will Smith and Charlize Theron being their full spectrum of experience to the screen and definitely do not leave this film lacking in emotion. Hancock contains an even mix of comedy, romance, and action and fully delivers as an unorthodox action superhero film. The one annoyance to the film is Jason Bateman's similar acting style in Hancock to his character in Arrested Development. Though his acting is fitting for his role in Hancock, it is also very stereotypical for Bateman and comes of a bit irritating when the movie includes stills of Bateman's facial expressions that are identical to his expressions in Arrested Development. Overall the movie was a solid 8.0 and might even be considered an 8.5 for sheer originality in the superhero film genre.",Hancock

564,rory-oh,This movie is actually not THAT bad.,7,5 July 2008,"Hancock - A very entertaining and fresh look at the superhero genre.I went into this movie having seen a picture of it on the NYTimes.com, and my only other knowledge being that Will Smith is in it and it has SOMETHING to do with superheroes. Having seen it with no expectation I have to say it was a great summer movie. Jason Bateman is very funny as per usual, and I truly enjoyed Will Smith in his role as the foul, dirty, whiskey chugging, superhero. I thought the role was surprisingly dark for Mr. Smith and I generally enjoyed the concept of an apathetic superhero. The action sequences were good enough, but most of all I was pleased not to be watching a Marvel Brand movie, which I for one and COMPLETELY sick of seeing over and over and over and over. This movie offered a lighter mood to heroes and allowed us to laugh at them, which is something I would definitely like to see more of.I think too many people are giving this movie a hard time, when it really is a solid summer movie. Not film of the year by a long shot, but quality entertainment for a few summer dollars.",Hancock

It was great! The plot was original and the choice of actors was exceptional! Some people said the story dragged, i didn't think it did at all! It actually went by too fast, they could have added more scenes! Will smith was great, and i am in love with Jason Batemen! When he starts to become the lovable hero, you cant help but wish he was real! the twist was amazing, i honestly didn't see it coming! and i usually guess a lot of movie twists! if you like comedy, action, and just an all around great summer flick.... Go see Hancock!!!!",Hancock
567,gianfrancopetacchio,Disappointing,5,29 June 2021,Good idea but poor execution. It starts with a dull action sequence and ends with a very poor and too much guessable ending. Good acting but poor direction makes this film a missed opportunity. Quite boring. Waste of time. Don't watch.,Hancock
568,kezzie_w,Hancock,10,9 July 2008,"Hancock is action packed from beginning to end, one of the best Will Smith films of all time and the best film of this year... John Hancock is an alcoholic with a very bad temper and doesn't take to kindly to being called an 'arsehole' Will Smith keeps you entertained and wanting more the way everything came together was absolute genius... Charlize Theron's character comes across has prim and proper but when you get to see the character in her true light it is shocking and complete genius on the writers part... Hancock had me laughing from start to finish... I also had tears because you see his character in a light you wouldn't expect... Hancock is absolute genius at its best and has one hundred percent thumbs up from me.",Hancock
569,RaidenCage,Best of 2008,9,5 August 2008,"Contains SpoilersNow this right here happens very rare, but when it does, it means the movie was very sweet... You know how after watching a certain movie, right when the credits starts, you say to yourself: ""I wish i could erase the last one hour and 30 minutes from my memory, just so i could watch and enjoy this magnificent movie all over again. Well to me thats exactly how Hancock was. Before watching it, i didn't know anything about the movie. I didn't watch the previews, i didn't see any trailers, i didn't watch any news or read any critics. All i knew was that Will Smith was starring in it.. So as u can see, i didn't have any expectations. And thats probably why i liked it so much. Oh and if i hadn't mentioned it already, i stopped watching previews years ago, just because while watching it you get to see half the movie already anyways.. Now if i had watched the trailer for Hancock i would have already known about his powers, his character, his attitude towards people and vice versa. I would have known all about how he could fly to the moon when he had to. So what I'm trying to say is, there would have been nothing that could have shock or surprise me.I do have a couple of criticism about the movie though.. The first one is: yep you guessed it, its the fruity looking superhero suit. He looked a lot like a hero when he had the bum outfit and an alcohol bottle in his hand. The second was the ending, it was great up until he was doing all that jumping just to bring that chick back to life. But right after that, 1 month later, he gives Ray and Mary a call with a blue-tooth device on his ear (which i have no idea where or how he found the money for) and tells them to look up to the sky where he has made a heart shape on the moon, and just takes off.. The movie was so good that it left the crappy ending in the shade... P.s: never watch the previews, specially if its a comedy movie preview, and you'll be fine...",Hancock

Don't waste your time... If you want to watch a real good hero movie, see The dark knight from batman series. Spiderman 3 or The Punisher. Maybe its the worst film from Will Smith... Charlize Theron was a great actress in Monster movie and I also enjoy The Devils advocate with Al Pacino and Keanu Reeves. In this poor movie its a total disaster...

Smith does an excellent job as the drunken, down-and-out, and absolutely alone superhero who always acts to help, but ends up simply hurting. Jason Bateman plays his standard, business-man type character and does it well as he always has (I fear for his type-casted future though...). The film was explosive, sad, gritty, and sometimes even quite epic while always maintaining an atmosphere of hope and light-heartedness, more akin to a strictly PG type of movie. From the moment the film started to when the credits started to roll, than stopped briefly for a final scene, before continuing again, I enjoyed myself. Will it win any Oscars? Surely not, The Dark Night is already being handed all of those. Is it my favorite movie? No, definitely not.Was it a good movie? Absolutely.Hancock is everything that you want in a summer blockbuster. Plain and Simple.",Hancock

It had plenty of action and a great plot. I was glued to the screen the whole time and not wanting the movie to end. All actors and actresses did a great job with their roles. I never used to care for Will Smith too much, but man this guy has been doing amazing lately. I'm looking forward to seeing what he does next.Back to the movie, From what I hear the people that didn't enjoy it as much blame it on the quality of some special effects, but the average eye wouldn't notice a thing wrong with them. Also a few people aren't into the twist the movie throws..(Which is completely original) I wont go any further into that.Overall, the movie is awesome. Give it a chance for sure. Though, I warn you, if you are wanting another superman or spider man... don't watch Hancock.",Hancock

As for the story, it is fast paced and takes an unexpected turn in the second half. The humor in the first half of the movie was nothing less than riveting.It has all the ingredients for a summer blockbuster.Will Smith is a largely under rated actor and I think given a good author backed role he is definitely an Oscar material. As for the critics , what is wrong with them? This movie definitely deserves more. You can go and see it with your family and don't forget your popcorn!!",Hancock

You could write a better ending in the parking lot with your friends, I actually wrote a couple in the theater, it distracted me from what I was watching.

There is a wonderful balance of comedy and action. Also, there is a love story and a great twist. It makes you laugh and cry. I couldn't take my eyes off of the screen waiting to see what would happen next. This is the perfect movie for the summer. Will Smith did a wonderful job (as he did in I Am Legend and just about every other movie that he has done). Charlize was a perfect addition and they made wonderful costars.

They should of had Mike Epps throughout the whole film, because he had the most funniest part of the movie, other than Will Smith teeling the lady that he have been drinking,,LOL!!! Those who seen this film knows what I'm talking about.I still don't understand how Critics critized this movie so badly, it didn't deserve all the negativity it has gotten.",Hancock
577,mmmarkkk,Enjoyable enough but it's no Iron Man,6,27 June 2008,"This film was entertaining enough, but an idea this rich should have been much better. Truly surprising twist. Doesn't overcome the unappealing explanation... or the unsatisfactory villain, or the nausea producing camera-work.Great casting. Jason Bateman brings nice notes, but the character is a little thin. Will Smith looks like he's having a great time playing an a**hole. Just don't call him one! (The quote about calling him a ""Jackass"" - that's not the word they use in the film.)If you try to be careful about making the most of your movie dollar, wait for the DVD and go see Iron Man again.In fact, when the DVD comes out, skip it and rent Iron Man again. Iron Man is satisfying in ways that Hancock can't come close to.But if you're determined to see it, go. You'll probably enjoy it.",Hancock

Sadly, this transformation occurs within a matter of 15-20 minutes on screen, and in a brisk 2 weeks Hancock has become a ridiculously smooth sexy saviour. With another 40 minutes or so to go and nothing to do, the plot decides to cough up twist after twist in a desperate effort to keep things going... with enormous (and overly dramatic) secrets about Hancock's past suddenly pouring on-screen. The film becomes gag-worthy at many points... though I continued to give it a chance until the end.2 stars from me for the fun first 40 minutes.",Hancock

We all make mistakes but those mistakes do not have to shape our future.I think this movie has it all. Great special effects, terrific storyline, and incredible acting. Will Smith proves once again that he is one of the great performers of our time. All of the actors deserve applause. As a writer, I could only hope to write something as good as this movie. I hope there is a sequel planned!",Hancock
581,supervillainxx,Major disappoint in Will Smith's latest film,6,7 July 2008,"Hancock is unfortunately full of disappointment. The movie starts off with the potential to be as good as any of Will Smith's great titles (Ali, Independence Day, I am Legend, etc); but the ""twist"" suddenly deteriorates the movie and, at least in my mind, it joins the ranks of such a silly film as ""My Super Ex-Girlfriend"".This isn't your average superhero movie. There really isn't a defined villain or evil Will Smith has to fight besides his own attitude towards the world. Will Smith does a great job for the role, but the story is indeed disappointing. The movie looks like its going great until everything is turned around by a lackluster twist.Also, I'm not sure if this movie is aimed to be an action flick or a comedy. The beginning had lots of wisecracks and smart remarks from Will Smith and company, but by the end of the film the only laughing I was doing was at the poor story being told.Basically the first half of the movie is done to perfection; pure, genuine Will Smith blockbuster, but sadly its turned upside down by a silly twist (Oh, and don't even get me started on the CG)",Hancock
582,umutercan13,"to tell with one word, excellent !!",10,7 September 2008,"i don't usually comment on movies here but i have to comment on this, because rating is so low.. i don't understand what people expect from movies.. hancock has every kind of material in it and it's end is great. will smith acts great as always, plot is great, scenes are great. and why i like this movie so much is what it is trying to tell at the end.. maybe some of people couldn't catch it, but it is that someone has gotta go anyway, this could be the woman sometimes and sometimes the man.. even superheroes can love and even superheroes can be sorry but that you are a superhero doesn't mean you can hurt someone.. so, if one has gotta go, he/she has gotta go no matter how hard it is.. believe me it is more than an action movie, better watch it twice.. i am sure no one believes that i cried while watching :) :(",Hancock
583,ceekaynj,Give Hancock a Break!,9,4 December 2008,"It is hard to understand all the negative responses to this movie. I get the fact that people had EXPECTATIONS based upon the troika of Will Smith/Summer Movie/Superhero  like they were looking for that really GREAT MIB sequel.Well, it's not. Get over it.What HANCOCK is is a really good movie and it would be a really good movie whether it came out in the summer or in February. Maybe the problem is that HANCOCK is a superhero movie for adults (and with some of the language, the drinking and where he shoved peoples' heads  this was no Spiderman flick). Ang Lee tried to do this in the first Hulk movie. The film wasn't about the Hulk  it was about Bruce Banner. This movie is about this guy  Hancock  who is a loner, a drunk, anti-social and probably smells bad but has superpowers. Who is he and how did he get here? Hancock would like to know this as much as the audience would.That's the story. This is not a franchise-making, summer toy. This is a story. And for everyone griping about the first-half/second half, from the MOMENT Hancock and Mary met  something was going on. Charlize Theron (amazing as always) did a great job of showing both an attraction and an apprehension of Hancock. I thought for a while she would turn out to be the villain and this thing would jump into Fantastic Four land. I'm glad it didn't. I totally dug the mythology the writers created. It was new! It was fresh! It gave the characters a human depth. And she and Will made it believable. Sure  Jason Bateman played his usual role, but he was a good counter-point to the other two. Will Smith  I thought  gave an excellent performance. For once  his character didn't cruise through the movie on charm. Hancock rarely smiles and he's not the life of the party  but he is a hero, which he proves to himself by the end of the film.See it for yourself. Don't bring expectations and you will be rewarded.",Hancock
584,Quarky42,I enjoyed this movie very much because of its differences.,9,7 July 2008,"I don't believe any spoilers are listed here. All references to the movie are kept especially generic. Read at your own risk anyway just in case you are uber sensitive. I don't tell you what happened or talk about any specifics.After seeing the previews and thinking to myself that this is a movie worth checking out ""sometime"" I then saw Will Smith being interviewed on a talk show. His enthusiasm in portraying an atypical super hero combined with how much he loved shooting a flight scene with old-school stunt work plus some special effects instead that would normally be done all CGI got my interest in this movie piqued.I enjoy many types of superhero movies and usually find ways to enjoy most of them. Hancock was no exception, and in this case I found that it really stood apart from other super hero movies in a new and refreshing way. Personally I thought it was new, intricate, funny, and full of ""eye candy"" (scenes that are especially fun to watch).Will Smith brought some style and flair to the role and gave us a glimpse of a person going through some hard times and going through some changes. I think there was one part of the movie that ""dragged"" a little for me, but sure enough right around the corner was some more intrigue, action, and other eye candy to watch.I probably laughed the most at a scene that reminded me of the Anal Dwelling Butt Monkey of ""Bruce Almighty"".",Hancock
585,steveglean,A new type of super hero,8,3 July 2008,"I will make a strong recommendation that you go see Hancock and make up your own mind. I read some of the early reviews and comments and I was expecting to be disappointed. What I ended up seeing was a great entertaining movie which was really about 'fate' and however much we try to escape our destiny it has a strange way of bringing us back to it.Don't look for super evil villains, meteors from space, or quick costume changes. Hancock is a new and slightly more human super hero, perhaps the truest representation of a comic book hero we have ever seen. He does not fight for justice and the American way. If there is any fault in the film we are never really told what motivates Hancock to do what he does, but we do know he's alone.I enjoyed Hancock, and more importantly my 11 year old son enjoyed it.",Hancock
586,wamba112,Hancock,9,2 July 2008,OK this movie wasn't excellent I agree. But trust me it wasn't BAD it was really good. The movie wasn't another superhero movie with just saving and then living on and at the end the big Boss fight. This movie was original and take my advice and go see it. O and another thing you can not call the movie boring because there is all of the time a nonstop action going on. And well frankly people who love only action shooting and that kind of movies well yeah they might not appreciate this movie as much as I did. So get a ticket and go see that movie. Trust me you will not regret it. P.S. One of THE movies of the summer and of the year.,Hancock

It began with a great mixture of comedy and action, follow up with a slow not-too-interesting mid-section of the movie, and end with a love story finish. Not what I expected with the previews portraying an action and humor packed blockbuster. Big surprise when he found his ""wife"" though! I don't want to spoil the movie for those who are interested so let's just say I wouldn't pay to see this movie again. Not one of Will Smith's or Charlize Theron's best movies but if you enjoyed I Am Legend, this movie might be a great one for you.

Let me say this in closing superman it was not ""RIP"" C Reeves; but go see it wit the kids or the guys. I sure you will have a good time watching this, as far as a summer block buster mmm datz up in the air. But i'm sure it will make lots of money @ the box office & that no worry.

Having seen the trailers to Hancock I really wanted to see the film....I watched the film and thoroughly enjoyed it, it didn't make me think too much, it made me laugh enough and it passed the time......The few small problems I had with the movie were:(1) The lack of a decent, well worked, well acted villain (2) I wanted more drunken superhero mayhem (3) The last half hour or so didn't keep up the pace and laughs of the first hourWithout giving away spoilers the plot twist was good and well worked if under-explained......Overall 6 out of 10.....worth a watch for sure, Will Smith was excellent!",Hancock
591,inyrogatling,A Superhero Movie that Doesn't Fly,6,2 July 2008,"Here I am, left speechless by the pure potential of this movie. The storyline, the characters, the secrets... the whole film positively reeks of opportunity. Unfortunately, the theater I was in just, well, reeked. And the experience I had expected going into the movie was not to be found. Instead, I was left with a perfect example of ""What Could Have Been: Hancock."" Now, let me begin by saying that I enjoyed the movie. Will Smith, along with the rest of the cast, creates a great character. The change from down-and-out, drunk Hancock to superhero Hancock, around which the first half of the movie revolves, is done stylishly, and not without a few well-placed laughs. Jason Bateman, playing the part of a Public Relations agent for the ""All Heart"" organization, a ""for the people""-style, charitable endeavor, works wonders on the silver screen. And Charlize Theron, acting as Bateman's wife in the film, adds a sense of mystery that, toward the end of the movie, grows into an attractive, powerful character.The comedy, which many had expected to be the bulk of the movie, is well-placed and effective, though an overabundance of joking at the beginning makes the middle (which housed long stretches of drama) seem drawn out. Smith's portrayal of pre-reformed Hancock is hilariously well done, and he keeps that flair for the comedic throughout the film, breaking the tension where he needs to and reminding the viewers that Hancock is not, by any means, Superman. Bateman's character, Ray Embrey, successfully plays off of Hancock's amusing persona, helping to get the punchline across and adding a few of his own in the process.Unlike the great comedy, however, the action and suspense scenes leave much to be desired. Whenever a point of conflict hits, the camera seems to be a few hundred feet away, watching from a distance as the short, fast-paced scenes flash past. The visual effects are indeed as good as the commercials show, yet Director Peter Berg chose not to use them to their full potential. The suspense lasts mere seconds, the characters exchanging a few quick blows, and the scene ends with one of the opposing parties simply leaves.Unfortunately, the story of Hancock takes after the action. Though many, and I stress that there are many, chances to expand the story reveal themselves throughout the movie, director Berg leaves them untouched. Unanswered questions plague the film almost from the start, and tantalizing ideas of more powerful plot points leave me speechless. Opportunity for greatness runs rampant through every character and every scene. Even, I may add, what could have been a sequel.Overall, Hancock is worth seeing once, not for the action or story but instead the comedy. The idea of a degenerate being the proverbial superhero is well executed by Will Smith, though the rest of the movie falls short. With good acting by the whole cast and a healthy dose of humor throughout the film, I recommend the movie for fans of Smith or Bateman, and superhero movie fans.",Hancock
592,filmlover1978,"Stay away, far away!",3,4 July 2008,"My god, this film was awful. I remember seeing the trailer for this film and thought it would be awesome but it really is a lot down. The film shifts halfway through into something totally bizarre and seems to lose it's identity throughout the film. What on earth were the filmmakers thinking of when they put this dross together.Will SMith in my opinion has made to serious errors of judgement, first with I am Legend and now this, is he just now cashing in and taking the money instead of looking for quality films to star in. Very disappointed indeed.Everything about the film was just wrong, acting was poor, the story was garbage and somehow they got themselves confused with the genre of the film. The first half of the film was entertaining and I think had they stuck along these lines for the rest of the film then they may have had a winner, it would never have been the best film of 2008 but people would have at least given it credit for what it is, a half decent comedy superhero movie not some bizarre film trying to use some sort of ancient mythology that just did not work.",Hancock

Since I saw a preview for the first time some months ago, I'd been looking forward to seeing this movie. But, all the critics were saying it was a big disappointment, that it wasn't as good as Will Smith's other movies, and that he didn't do a very good job of being a jerk. However, everyone I went with loved it and so did I! It's fast-paced, funny, and has a really good plot twist that I didn't expect. Smith gave a really strong performance, as usual. A negative was the sometimes shaky camera. Overall, a great summer movie, and boo to you, too-harsh movie critics, you almost ruined it for my friends and I!!!",Hancock

With many a wise crack on the way. The first 30 minutes of this had me almost in tears. From breaking off a foot in an ass to children being tossed in the stratosphere, I was amused. Then it all went wrong. So so wrong. I'll make it as short as my attention span was having struggled through the jail scene. Its not a spoiler , its simply advise. Hancock in Jail = Stand your ass up and leave.Please. For the love of humanity. Just forget the monetary aspect. And try and force as many of the audience as you can to follow suit.

595,cm266825,Funny and very unorthodox,8,5 July 2008,"Usually when I see a trailer for a new superhero movie, I think it will be just another one of those cliché good vs. evil kind of plots. I couldn't of been more wrong. This movie focuses more on the life and what goes on inside the mind of a superhero. This very unorthodox plot is one of the elements that made this movie more interesting than the typical superhero movie. It's mainly about Hancock (Will Smith) finding out who he is, where he came from, and why he is what he is. He then finds out that the wife of the man trying to help him reform has superpowers as well. After this happens, we find out that love is their weakness. When two superheros fall in love, they lose their powers, grow old, and die. This movie emphasizes the strengths and weaknesses of Hancock. However, there still was a small and simple good vs. evil plot which I honestly think was necessary in order to show exactly how these strengths and weaknesses came into play. A criminal that Hancock put in jail escapes and comes after Hancock. This movie was very funny as well which I also think was very necessary to keep the audience interested. For people who don't want to see this movie just because the trailer looks stupid, let me just tell you that looks can be deceiving. The trailer really doesn't tell much of what this movie was actually about. For anybody who reads this comment, I'm telling you to give this movie a chance.",Hancock
596,racineperson,Terrible Cinematography,3,6 July 2008,"I will confine my comments to the cinematography of this movie. Have these guys ever heard of a tripod? Even when the subjects were not moving the camera was all over the place. Closeups were too close with the frame consisting of two eyes, a nose and a mouth. Shots were too short-often as little as two or three seconds. The action scenes reminded me of the Batman ride I took at Great America. Things went by me so fast that I couldn't focus on anything that I saw during the ride. Apparently this style of filming is considered to be a new type of cinematographic art form. If so I would take credit for inventing it when I was 8 years old and shot my first footage with a movie camera.",Hancock

One might say that I have aged and am no longer able to understand the new generation but I surely have not lost my yearn for adventure. I would rather have an action movie or a sensitive feely movie, but I don't want an action film with feely filming. I hated the fact that it was filmed in shaky, first person, war footage camera work. I don't see life that way unless I'm really drunk, and when I run it is only on occasion but when it comes to a movie, especially an action film, I want to see what's going on and that won't happen unless the camera moves more than three feet away from Will Smith's face. He's cute and all but not that good an actor to pull off an action film by just showing how drunk he is. Show me action. If in the first 30 mins. I haven't seen long shot action then shave Charlize Therone's eyebrows and have her kill a couple of guys. That is entertainment. That is emotion with suspense.

598,YouThinkImFunny,Great flick ... if you go in with low expectations ...,9,6 July 2008,"After reading several reviews on Hancock, mostly tearing the movie apart, I went in to the cinema and had a very pleasant experience.The movie wasn't bad at all, not by a long shot. Will Smith was top rate. Underneath his tough exterior, there is a misunderstood man aching for some support from the L.A civilians. You can see this in Hancock's eyes, especially in the scene above Ray Embry's house.This movie has great comedy from a variety of characters and Bateman settles into his role straight away.Although, saying all this, like every movie, Hancock does have some flaws. The whole Chalize Theron business could have been developed a lot more and the finale of the hospital scene was very confusing. It wouldn't have hurt to extend the film in order to develop the second half of the movie. Also in some parts, the camera work is kind of sloppy, people come in and out of focus.My Conclusion: Don't go in and try to find the flaws that have already been pointed out and you will be very surprised.",Hancock

Projectors for the higher-resolution package have been installed in 200 theaters in the United States with two dozen in evaluation. The impact of the package has been debated, with one argument being that the difference is not noticeable and the counter-argument being that the higher resolution has future value.[22] Prior to the film's opening five-day weekend in the United States and Canada, predictions for its weekend performance ranged from as low as $70 million to as high as $125 million.[23][24] Hancock was shown in advance screenings on July 1, 2008 in 3,680 theaters in the United States and Canada, grossing $6.8 million. The film was widely released on July 2, 2008, expanding to 3,965 theaters.[25] At the conclusion of the five-day weekend, Hancock took top placement at the box office in the United States and Canada, grossing an estimated $107.3 million. The film had the third-biggest opening 4th of July weekend after Transformers (2007) and Spider-Man 2 (2004). Hancock was Will Smith's fifth film to open on a 4th of July weekend and was his most successful opening to date. The film was also Smith's eighth film in a row to take top placement in the American and Canadian box office and the twelfth film in Smith's career to lead the box office.[26][27] Hancock was also Peter Berg's strongest opening of his directing career to date.[28] Outside of the United States and Canada, Hancock grossed $78.3 million in its opening weekend, drawing from 5,444 screenings across 50 markets, ranking it the third highest international opening of 2008 after Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull and Iron Man.[29] Hancock averaged $14,382 per screen. It placed on top in 47 of the 50 markets in which it opened;[30] its strongest openings were the United Kingdom with $19.3 million, Germany with $12.4 million, South Korea with $8.5 million, Australia with $7.3 million, and China with $5.5 million. The Chinese opening was the fourth-biggest opening to date for the country. Other international performances included $3.4 million in Brazil and $3.1 million in Taiwan.[29] In Hong Kong, the film opened in first place with $1.3 million, averaging $37,300 across the 35 venues.[31] Hancock opened in France, Mexico, and Russia on the weekend of July 11, 2008.[29] The film's overall gross for its opening five-day weekend worldwide is $185.6 million.[30] In the following weekend, Hancock fell to second place in the United States and Canada behind Hellboy II: The Golden Army, grossing an estimated $33 million, a ""modest"" 47% drop in revenue.[32] To date, Hancock has grossed an estimated $165,034,000 in the United States and Canada and an estimated $180,200,000 in other territories for an estimated worldwide total of $345,234,00.that only means that the sequel of hellboy is not beating Hancock, and in the final of the summer we will have Hancock against The Dark Knight.

It seemed so cliché, but yet out-of-place. Her explanation about where she came from didn't seem well thought out at all, and destroyed what otherwise would have been a decent film. It almost seemed like the first half and last half of the movie were not written by the same people.

First part where we see Hancock character is developing and trying to get better, and the second part where things become very cliché and boring.The first part was very interesting and fun, often burst me in to laugh, which I think what they intended to do. I do believe that they could have put more fun stuff, and funny lines to this part, instead of focusing on a public relations professional, Ray Embrey's cult idea of making a better life for others, and his wife..Then sadly , the movie started to evolve and change in to something very weird and unnecessary. It seemed like the director didn't have enough preparation to do so too. I didn't see and good lines or anything interesting. All it really involved was bunch or special effects and more Charlize Theron. I gotta say I am not a fan of her at all. Her acting was too hysterical and her moves were often too much. Will Smith does a great job on this movie and gets in to character really well. As said before, this is not a cliché superhero movie, at least not in the beginning.

Can't understand how such a big movie can go so wrong. I seriously considered leaving the theatre towards the end but didn't as I never have done and would have disrupted a lot of people trying to escape.Gave it 5 out of 10 for cast and acting but plot deserved 4/5 for first hour then 0/5.

We were shown things that Hancock was looking at but from our perspective not his. Why were they out of focus? Is the new thought in making movies to see if you can make the audience ill. Yes we had to leave 45 minutes into the movie because my wife was so nauseous she just couldn't continue to watch to film. I was having eye strain from the focus technique also.No, I wouldn't recommend seeing this movie on the big screen. Maybe it will be easier to watch on video.",Hancock
610,wosaf11,Why does everyone hate?,9,1 August 2008,"Personally, people judge these movies based on what happens that could ruin the movie. I watched this movie expecting some lame attempt at a superhero movie, and I received a bit of a shock. Yes, this superhero wasn't in a comic or published 50 years ago, but the movie had great twists and turns throughout the film that kept me edging on my seat. I never once thought the filming or idea of the story was far-fetched, just like i never thought Peter Parker getting bit by a radioactive spider was far-fetched. With new ideas, you have to open your mind to possibilities, and this one brought a great idea to the lime light and succeeded. Now a sequel would be going to far for this one, but I would purchase this movie because it was so good. You'll like it if you can open your mind to possibilities. Not comparable to batman, but what is? 9/10",Hancock
611,camos1294,Just not a will smith movie,4,22 July 2008,"I just saw this movie and it was NOT as good as I thought it would be. Myself, being a HUGE Will Smith fan --I Like Prince of Bel-air, Hitch, The Pursuit of Happiness, Men in Black, I-Robot, I Am Legend-- was not happy about Hancock. Storyline-Will Smith portrays an alcoholic superhero/anti-hero named Hancock who is despised by the public. When he saves the life of PR executive Ray Embrey, the latter helps rehabilitate Hancock.Yes, it had a few laughs but I couldn't wait until it was over.If you are going to a movie I'd recommend The Dark Knight, Journey to the Center of the Earth, Wanted, or Meet Dave.",Hancock
612,virtrael,You heard me... Jackass!,6,28 July 2008,"OK, let's face it.This movie similar to Bitter Lemon: Sweet in the beginning with a light bitter after taste.And the way i like Bitter Lemon, i like that movie: The right portion of humor and action with that typical after taste most ""mainstream"" movies have.After 2/3rd of the movie i got a not so nice feeling about the end. OK, after the first part of the movie you get a pic how it could end. I'm sorry to tell you, my feeling got proved. Nice idea of Hancocks story, but it was... well, i think you know what i mean when i say... to Hollywood...Thanks for (i hope so) not burning my account for my first ""review""",Hancock
613,denius_1,"As the title suggests there are Super Heroes and then there's Hancock, so don't mistake this for another Superman movie!",8,1 August 2008,"As i read the currently front-side review of Hancock here on IMDb, i was left with the urge to write my own, so as to not leave the people misinformed.This movie should not, i repeat should NOT be mistaken for an ""Epic super hero action movie"", because it is none of those things. If i had to summarize it in one sentence it would be ""A comic, human look in the life of a super hero."" The movie had a specific idea which to my surprise managed to accomplish quite well, and that was to show a super hero which is not your run of the mill comic book protagonist. Hancock is one pi***d off, mean, drunk, smelly a**hole who happens to have super powers. And the whole twist here is that, although he is all those bad things, he does not become a villain, instead he still continues to help people in his own twisted way. Why? Because he is inherently good.As for the execution of the movie itself.Action. Extremely comic and well done. The scenes were short, but what do you expect? After all it's a super hero going up against mere humans, there's only so much ""s***wing around"" he can do, before he kicks their a**es. Although the last review i read, said that the CGI was lacking, i tend to disagree, with the current technology it could not have been done better in my opinion.Drama. This is a comic/action movie, and it still managed to put in a few moments where you really see pain in the eyes of Will Smith's and Charlize Theron's characters. It is a small amount of drama, but just enough to get the feeling through without making it soapy.Comedy. Well, all i can say is... Will Smith, and you know the comedy will be good.Lack of an Archvillain. Once again, this is not a super hero movie, so why should there be an Archvillain? As for the camera moving around all the time, i find this technique of shooting in specific moments, extremely effective as it changes the whole atmosphere of the scene. I specifically liked it.The only criticism i have, is the execution of Ray's character. They just didn't make him ""human"" enough, especially in the last scene when his wife is dying and he is just standing there looking at her like she is not someone he has lived with for several years. I know i would be throwing a major fit if Charlize Theron was dying several feet from me.All in all, extremely good idea, VERY good acting and tons of fun! Not a lot of movies can surprise me with a twist turn, but this one managed it, even more so as seeing how this is not a plot twist driven movie.",Hancock
614,nicolasestrup,A funny disappointment...,5,1 August 2008,"Will Smith delivers a good performance over-all. Only problem is that in all the excitement that the movie builds up over the first 45 minutes, you are left with a bland script that a 14 year old could have wrote.It was predictable the entire time. And have you seen just a fair share of super- hero/action/comedy movies you will be left with a empty feeling of spending an hour and a half of your day when the bits that you thought were funny are all stuffed into the trailer!So over all major disappointment. See the trailer and you have seen the movie!Over and out!",Hancock
615,mcluvin31,Hancock is good but not great,6,5 August 2008,"Hancock to me was good but not great. The story was okay, but Will Smith really steals the show in this one. The only reason I thought it was okay is because the story had no real villain, and to me, it kind of felt like a kid movie. Not much like most of Will Smiths movies which are made for people who can understand it. When I went to the theater to see Hancock, I have a good experience because I went with some friends and that kept me in my seat but I was not into the movie. One thing I can say is that the movie is hilarious and well presented, which surprised me because it looked like it did not have much potential. I recommend that you see it but don't get to excited about it, seeing as once again, it is good not great.",Hancock

I can see this idea being remade years from now, and pulled off even better. It's not a fault of Peter Berg, the film's director, as the real weakness is in the screenplay, which falters after an excellent and wonderful opening act. It's not a bad film by any means, nor is it great. It's in between ""okay"" and ""good"".",Hancock
617,GailTulane,Loved It,8,27 August 2008,"Wow, I have learned for the umpteenth time that I have to make my own decisions about what to see. When Hancock first came out, because of all the negative reviews that appeared in the newspapers, I did not rush to see it, and I am very sorry about that. I just saw it and, and I really enjoyed it. First and foremost, this film is a love story. It just so happens that it uses the superhero genre to tell it. Although I would agree that the numerous bathroom jokes were childish and detracted from the film, I feel that the negative reviewers lacked the maturity and sophistication to see that, seeing as how most superhero films of late are spoofs, the makers of Hancock chose a spoof of those spoofs as an entertaining and attention-diverting backdrop on which to paint a portrait of love. And not just love between two people. The love in this story is between all of the protagonists--father, mother, son, and Hancock, and ultimately about the love between all things that feel. If you can let your hair down, I believe that this fun and genuinely imaginative film will provide you with smiles, perhaps a tear, and a very warm glow. (P.S., I love feedback, and will be happy to hear your comments on mine.)",Hancock
618,victor_liu-1,It would have been better if this was a series instead of a movie *some spoilers*,7,3 November 2008,"The first half of the movie focuses on the character development of Hancock where he changes from an outlaw to a superhero loved by the citizens of the city through the help of Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman). Everything was going well until the middle of the movie where the story suddenly changes to Hancock's past with Ray's wife which brings in a complete twist in the story which brought the *somewhat* downfall of the movie. It would have been better if they stuck to either Hancock's character development or just his past but combining both of them together? I would say that 'Hancock' would have been better if it was a T.V show with a few episodes focusing on his character development then the rest on his relationship with Ray's wife, Mary because seriously the only thing that stopped this movie from getting a good rating and good comments was the unwise mishmash of two different episodes in one movie.7/10",Hancock

His long lost wife, Mary is also a super hero who had been hiding married to another normal human being for the past 8,000 years. The movie went from coolto Ancient-Greek-Hero-Like. After Hancock finds out about all this he decides to get her back into his life. But the closer they get, they attract these other super villains into tracking them down and try to take their powers away, which they do, but then Hancock kills them and then gets his and Mary's powers back again. After that, Mary goes back to living with her husband while Hancock continues to be a super hero, the end.

I was unimpressed with his performance in this film. the sudden plot twist was just not believable. I give this film a 3 and a ##Boring## !! on the fun meter. Come on Will Smith! You can do better.Will smith needs to focus on making films that do not put the watcher or the audience to sleep. I did not like this film. I thought they really hyped it up as an amazing idea and film.. and it fell short and fizzled out. I enjoyed I robot. An inventive awesome idea and plot but this film fell flat and was a major let down and disappointment to me. I expected more from a man such as this that has such a good following and billing. Maybe next time he will come up with a better plot for us.,Hancock
621,luke_bsh_lincoln,Good Action Flick But Flawed as a Complete Film,7,14 March 2009,"Hancock is your typical summer-action flick; it contains fast-paced, exciting scenes, a lot of comedy, and a great twist in the plot.Will Smith, the protagonist, plays the part well as a lonely superhero. He is a natural at completely getting into the role of his character. Hancock is portrayed as a likable, funny individual that is looking for a purpose.Jason Bateman's character seemed kind of dry and plain, but he and Will Smith had some on-screen chemistry in a few of the scenes. Charlize Theron did well with her part. Whenever her character met Hancock for the first time, the audience can sense the underlying tension from her, which is a major part in the film.The film was enjoyable, but the movie contained some plot holes that needed to be addressed and further explained. The climax was mediocre, and the villains weren't up to par. They didn't exhibit the typical characteristics of an antihero.Fortunately, the action and comedy in this movie appeals to the viewer. If you want to watch Will Smith fly around and attempt to save the day, then this movie is highly recommended.",Hancock
622,wiseash71,"Lots of Potential, Not Fully Realized",6,14 August 2008,"Making a Will Smith character unlikable is not an easy task. Unfortunately, Peter Berg devotes a lot of time and effort up front trying to achieve that very thing, and succeeds in large measure in making you loathe the character Hancock and the film along with it. When things finally kick into gear about half way in, it's almost enough to make you forget the 20-to-30 minutes of squirming uncertainty at the beginning--but not quite. Smith and Charlize Theron are terrific together, and the plot line is surprisingly intriguing, once the film finally gets around to it. Then there's Jason Bateman, who while likable enough, seems to be playing just another version of befuddled Michael Bluth, and is overshadowed by his charismatic costars. With its two dynamic lead actors and half-realized idea, Hancock is a pleasant diversion. But you can't help but think it could have been so much more.",Hancock
623,peacheslang,Hilarious with a few twist of disappointments,8,23 March 2010,"A movie with Will Smith as Hancock, Charlize Theron as Mary, and Jason Bateman as Ray Embrey can't go wrong. The movie was hilarious, why shouldn't it be Will Smith was the protagonist. Charlie Theron was stunning through out the movie and Jason Bateman was oh so charming.A hobo with super-natural powers who saves the day at the expense of the city. The movie has extremely funny scenes and some poor special effects. He ends up saving the life of Ray who in return wants to help Hancock become the traditional super-hero. His invited to Ray's home and you can immediately feel the love in the air between Ray's wife Mary and Hancock. Mary ends up being his wife from the past with super-natural powers as well. There story is reveal, few jail scenes and more fights to keep you entertain. At the end you can pretty much predict the outcome finale.It will keep you in suspense until the very end, when it becomes somewhat dull but not outrageous bad.

624,nathanm95-72-719318,a mediocre summer blockbuster,6,12 August 2012,"Will Smith stars in a comedy super hero action movie as John Hancock a not so stereotypical superhero. Hancock is a gifted middle aged man who has been disowned by the public because of the destruction he creates when trying to do something right, costing the city millions. Then Hancock runs in to Jason Batemans character (Ray) who wants to try and change the public's impression of him. Everything seems to be going all right until Hancock meets a woman who has super powers like him and is the key to unlocking what happened in his past.The story is not well thought out and feels that it has been written in a very short amount of time. I think the writers found it hard keeping the idea of a non-stereotypical super hero and because of this the film is only 92 minutes. By the end of the film the story falls flat and so they fill the end up with CGI fight scenes which are actually well-made and quite convincing. To make the story better I think they should have developed Charilze Theron character more. One other problem I found with the story is there is no well fleshed out villain in the story which can leave the audience a bit confused.""Hancock"" is directed by actor/director Peter Berg who has directed films such as ""Welcome to the Jungle"" and ""The Kingdom."" Peter Berg uses a big variety of camera angles that work well with the shot situation. During the whole the film the only shot transition used is fade; I think the editor does this to create effect. He does this because he doesn't want the movie to come across too fun and silly he wants to show the audience that the film is also serious. In ""Hancock"" all the original music composed is by one man John Powell which has produces music in films such as ""Shrek"" and the ""Bourne series"". The original music in this film works well and effectively throughout the film. It helps to show the audience what the film is all about and what the main theme is. The movie also contains songs from different artists the majority of them are RnB songs which reflect Will Smiths character (Hancock) and shows the tone of the movie. Some examples of these songs are ""move"" by Ludicrous and ""colours"" by Ice T.The film is backed up by an all star cast which includes ""I Am legend's"" Will Smith, Charlize Theron and Jason Bateman they all give good performances. Jason Bateman, who is the character that connects Smith and Theron characters together, is great as usual and likable. Will Smith performance is as good as ever, he nails the drunken superhero very well whilst delivering some funny comedic lines. Particular good scenes for Will Smith is near the end were Hancock becomes all emotional because he remembers what happened in his past. During this scene Will Smith gives his best performance during the whole movie.Even though ""Hancock"" has a rating of 12A I wouldn't recommend this film for children under the age of 12 because it contains some bad language and violent scenes which could scare some children. I think this movie will appeal to teenagers and young adults the most because they would enjoy the type of comedy in this film and the great action and fight scenes. Older adults may enjoy this two but I feel that adults were not the intended viewer and I don't think that some of the comedy will appeal to them.All in all ""Hancock"" is an average film; it's not an amazing nor awful. It is a film that I feel doesn't live up to the good story premise although It was an interesting look at a super hero movie compared with all the ""Supermans"" and ""Batmans"" we are given today, in a sense it is more realistic. I like the way that you can see what life is actually like as a superhero. This movie contains many funny moments, good acting and outstanding special effects. I think that this film would be worth renting but i don't think it's worth seeing at the cinema; it's nothing to rush out to see unless you're a die-hard Will Smith fan.I give this film 2.5/5 stars.",Hancock

I'm a fan of Will Smith and an even bigger one of Charlize Theron, but still this movie seemed like a waste of money and time. The key weakness is the script - it goes nowhere - and its hard to tell whether this movie wants to be a comedy or a drama. It's as if the 2 halves were written by completely different people. The acting is decent though, including Jason Bateman. But there is not much character development and substance in the roles. The effects are good, and it has a few laughs - almost all are shown in the trailers.. But i was left a bit ""Huh?"" when the movie ended.Its just a pointless film.

I really do wish there will be another film, because the ending is happy but still leaves you with anticipation of what will happen next.

As well as most members of the audience since they were complaining about that at the end of the movie. So those are my only two things - close up and plot twist that was expected. Other than that the humor was alright and the special effects were good.

With the premise of a drunken superhero who found much difficulty trying to fit in a society that hated him, which was mainly due to the damages he had caused during his ""grateful"" assistance.Sadly, the movie failed to live up to the expectation. It did started off well, with it's portrayal of a troubled alcoholic superhero which was pretty interesting and funny at times. The cast, Will Smit and Jason Bateman, did an excellent job for their performance as i pretty much enjoyed it. However, as the film continues, the substance somehow gets a little too repetitive.**** Spoiler Alert****** However, the film main weakness was the sudden twist during the second act. It was totally unbelievable and felt rather rushed. It was from this points onwards, that the film starts to deviate from its original idea. There was not much explanation for the twist and it felt that the audience should just believe what the film had stated. Worst still was the ending, where it was kind of stupid. The action sequence were not the standard we expect from a superhero movie. It was not stylish enough like Spiderman or Iron Man and were rather short and very quickly paced. The camera shots were rather weird too, it was too quick, shaky and overall pretty hard to view.I won't say that this film was not totally awful, as it did have some pretty good moment such as the jail scene and the change in the character of Hancock from a bad-attitude, alcoholic superhero whom everybody hates to much better attitude superhero, whom everyone likes. Jason Bateman did an excellent job as a PR executive trying to improve Hancock image.But the movie was not very good as well. Its a US$150 million dollars production and what we get was simply a mediocre movie experience.

I would have enjoyed this film a great deal more if those screenwriters Vince and Vincent hadn't scribbled this yarn with the Fresh Prince in mind. He was good in the Legend of Bagger Vance, but was not fit for colossal leading role. As far as the film goes I could have done without all the h.j. references. Red was cool, who saw that coming?

The screenwriters almost graduated high school -I think; and the director probably needs to get back to rehab. You can see it for yourself and draw your own opinions - but taking into account all that Smith has done in the past, I cant help but worry about his film-making future.

Some textbook rules should never be bent. Every superhero must have an equal opposite. In this case we have an opposite which is not much of an opposing force. To add insult to injury the superhero is somewhat dwarfed by someone who is neither the villain nor a superhero itself. Personally, I believe it was the twist that killed the movie. The twist in an attempt at political correctness causes this movie to stumble and eventually come undone.

639,natrap,Who approved this script?,3,6 August 2008,"I really wonder who's job it is to vet and approve scripts in Hollywood. The story was written in 1996 and only went into production in 2007. Perhaps someone knew not to make this film.The story was just so terrible. Until Charlize Theron's character revealed her powers the story was developing, let's say, routinely. After she revealed her powers the film went from bad to worse. The concept of the story was just so uninteresting. As with many Hollywood action blockbusters the only thing I suspect that keeps people watching are the A list actors and action scenes, which as it turns out I thought were very poor also. The fight scenes between Will Smith and Charlize Theron were pretty ordinary. The origin and powers of the two ""heroes"" are not explored or explained, but let's face it, the audiences aren't supposed to think too much watching this film, they are just supposed to ooh and ahh and Will Smith and Charlize Theron and at how cool their powers are. There was zero chemistry between Smith and Theron, despite the endless strange looks between them.It seems Hollywood has run out of superhero comics to make into films that they are resorting to creating their own. I think we should establish a rule when in comes to superhero films. If Marvel or DC didn't write it it should not make it to a cinema near you, and if it does stay far far away. Without a doubt one of the worst films of the year.",Hancock

The script is more like a sum of ideas for different movies than a standalone movie. The writers in their desperate attempt to knit everything together even use an ""After one month"" sequence.The only two positive things about the movie are: the cool and funny Will Smith; and the good- looking Ms. Theron, who delivers a good performance.

Oh and also, plot holes. There are lots of them in the second half of the movie. They might not drive you crazy like how they did to me but personally, the movie felt really rushed as details are left out.Overall, it's a good movie to watch on your free time but definitely not a blockbuster.

642,csigrissom24,Hancoock will be cold-cocked by audiences,3,2 July 2008,"HancockDuring the first 45 minutes of this movie, I was constantly pinching myself hoping to wake up from the nightmare i was being subjected too--unfortunately, this was not a nightmare--I was witnessing the talents of Wil smith, Jason Bateman, Charlize Theron, Director Peter Berg (who is responsible for the second best show on TV-Friday Night Lights) and writer Michael Mann (Heat, Miami Vice)--how could all this talent be responsible for such an abomination of film-making. A sloppy narrative, uneven directing, lethargic writing, and unlikeable central character--the movie had me clamoring for the exit.However, in the second half, when the audience learns something about another character (hint Bateman or Theron might have a secret-wont tell you which one)--the movie shifts into actual watchability--in fact--if the revelation in the second act would have been the central focus of thefilm from the start-it may have been a better movie. I was frustrated because Bateman (who is always first-rate)and Theron (who can be hot or cold--but is definitely warmer than usual in this movie) are the real strengths of the film. Smith's character becomes likable in the last 30 minutes but it was a little too late. The film is filled with about 342 ideas-some good and some bad, most of them not followed through. The second half had the makings of a decent popcorn flick but was weigheddown by its convoluted plotting and misdirection. The last scene involving something that Will Smith does with the moon belongs in a romantic comedy like Sleepless in Seatlle and not in a summer action flick---its an extremely cheesy moment! I think the movie my draw the Wil Smith fans in the first few days, but in the end, Hancock will be cold cocked by its failings. First 45 minutes--F second 45 minutes B- overall borderline C-/D",Hancock
643,aballout,Don't buy into the negative critics,8,2 July 2008,"If you don't like Will Smith you won't like this movie. Will Smith has a unique ability in this movie to insult small children, be an overall drunk and an ass to basically everyone he comes in contact with while simultaneously captivating a hopeful audience that he'll eventually ""come around"".I was so upset when I heard the pre-release reviews of this movie being terrible but I was pleasantly surprised at how much I found myself enjoying this movie. Its entertaining, its funny and its heartfelt.There is a twist that most people will probably not see coming but the negative reviews of this movie that say it missed the mark simply don't add up.Jason Bateman is AWESOME as usual and Charlize Theron cast as his troubled wife was wonderful.",Hancock
644,k_mckearn,gack,1,17 July 2008,"This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The plot is threadbare and totally predictable, and it's really only a minimalist vehicle for the special effects, which are also predictable (and violent and repetitive).Will Smith is smug and 2-dimensional at best. Jason Bateman's character is pretty much the guy he played in Arrested Development. Charlize Theron is also 2D.The closeups were all done with a jiggly hand-held camera look, which was mostly just really irritating. I resorted to just keeping my eyes closed after awhile.I was really tempted to ask for a refund of the ticket price. It was that bad.",Hancock
