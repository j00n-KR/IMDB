0,bkoganbing,Holmes And Watson At Holy Orders,8,24 February 2007,"Murder is being done at a medieval monastery and before the Inquisition in the person of the malevolent F. Murray Abraham gets involved in it the order has its own pair of sleuths. A pair of monks who have taken holy orders, Sean Connery and his novice Christian Slater arrive at the monastery and are determined to get to the bottom of why a whole bunch of monks are dying there.Fans of the Brother Cadfael mysteries of which I am one, will like this film very much. A lot of it rides on the chemistry between Connery and Slater and the two of them play off against each other very well.You do get the feeling you really are seeing a glimpse of the fourteenth century, helped in large part by the actual location shooting. In fact much of the film is shot at an actual monastery in Germany that is still standing from that time period. In fact one of the things that I really marvel at is the reconstruction of the labyrinth inside the monastery which leads to the library which is where the riddle of these murders is solved.The medieval Roman Church is certainly shown as having many sides to it. One is represented by the monks who in their cloistered existence, saved, translated, and preserved a lot of the knowledge of the ancient world we have today. Unfortunately there's the other side of it, as represented by F. Murray Abraham and the Inquisition. A force determined to force conformity in Christendom and add to their own power at the same time.Our monks do engage in some very unmonk like behavior and that includes both of our medieval Holmes and Watson. The scene where a village girl seduces Slater is both amusing and quite erotic. Could never have been done back in the days of the Breen Code.According to the Citadel Film Series book, The Films of Sean Connery, The Name of the Rose flopped badly here in America, but in Europe was a smashing success. Possibly because the story a lot closer to home there and Americans had little interest in European middle ages.That's a pity because The Name of the Rose is a worthwhile film that can be appreciated anywhere on this globe.",The Name of the Rose
1,Leofwine_draca,Atmospheric murder mystery,6,14 February 2012,"THE NAME OF THE ROSE, a murder mystery set in an Italian monastery in the 14th century, is based on a hugely inspirational Umberto Eco book that inspired 20 years plus of historical detectives (recently, C. J. Sansom's DISSOLUTION provided a reworked version of that tale). The film is well shot, well directed, with a neat script and atmosphere all of its own.Essentially, this is a film about Sean Connery's monk prying into hidden secrets, lurking in darkened corridors and shining lights into shadowy, cobwebbed corners. My first impression was what an ugly film this is: the monks are invariably repulsive-looking (none more so than the hunchback played by an astonishingly good Ron Perlman) and the whole location filled with mud and grime. It's no wonder that a sex scene between 15-year-old Christian Slater and a beautiful woman is so memorable in the midst of all this drabness.Connery is Connery, of course - when hasn't he been? - and the mystery is sufficiently dark and brooding to hold the viewer's attention. Later on, the Inquisition show up (in the form of an evil F. Murray Abraham) and things build to a grand old climax. I'll admit that this isn't a perfect movie - it's a little too slow, a little too laboured, and a little overlong - but it's a more than decent one.",The Name of the Rose
2,SnoopyStyle,confusing at first,6,7 November 2016,"Adso of Melk is an old man recalling a pivotal time during his youth. It's late 1327 in the dark north of Italy. Adso (Christian Slater) arrives at a Benedictine abbey with his mentor Franciscan friar William of Baskerville (Sean Connery) to argue the issue of the church's wealth. William is a Sherlock Holmes character with exceptional perception and deduction. The Abbot is trying to keep a recent death from William and wait for Inquisitor Bernardo Gui (F. Murray Abraham). William notices the fresh grave. It's a young manuscript illuminator whose work he admires. He and his young novice investigate the death but then others die. Adso has sex with a local girl. William befriends hunchback Salvatore (Ron Perlman) from a heretical sect. They discover a labyrinthine secret library as William's nemesis Gui arrives.The first time I watched this, it was a mess of confusing characters and ideas about the medieval world. The resolution is understandable. Solving the murder became secondary to trying to immerse in this world. It gets better the second time around. I'm sure the book is more in depth. The red herring needs more exposition time. Novel adaptation often has this problem. The setting has the foggy muddy part down. The secret library has plenty of stairways. The acting is solid. It takes a couple of times to ingest everything from the movie.",The Name of the Rose
3,classicsoncall,"""Beware of this place. The beast is here among us.""",8,12 June 2018,"Prophecies of the Apocalypse and mysteriously dying monks make for an effective murder mystery thriller set in an isolated, Fourteenth Century Benedictine abbey. Sean Connery looks like he might have been made for the role of William von Baskerville, exuding a worldly wisdom to go with his venerable appearance. His young ward Adso (Christian Slater) does appear somewhat a lightweight by comparison, though the Franciscan brothers do complement each other quite well. The story turns on a virtually unknown sect called the Dolcinites, notorious for murdering wealthy priests and bishops who corrupted the Christian principles of poverty. An intriguing aspect of the story resulted in a debate on whether Christ owned the clothes he wore, something I've never even had occasion to consider before. Some of the story elements get a bit confusing and muddled, although the Sherlock Holmes type instincts of Brother William eventually discern the cause of deaths at the abbey, even if he has to place his own life in jeopardy at the hands of the Grand Inquisitor, Bernardo Gui (F. Murray Abraham). There's an effective sequence that takes place in the labyrinthine alleys of the abbey's secretive library, home to volumes of forbidden books and texts that their protector wishes to remain undiscovered. And there's a monumental test of Adso's vow of celibacy that he monumentally fails. Needless to say, this is an offbeat murder mystery in an offbeat setting, and made with an eye toward bump in the night creepiness. Say your prayers before and after watching.",The Name of the Rose
4,gavin6942,An Interesting Mystery,7,11 May 2015,"An intellectually nonconformist monk (Sean Connery) investigates a series of mysterious deaths in an isolated abbey.First of all, thank you to whomever cast William Hickey. The man has not been in enough films, so it is great to see him here. Truly an underrated talent.Connery's character is said to be an amalgam of Sherlock Holmes and William of Occam. This is quite evident, with the way he treats Christian Slater very much like a young Watson. And even Occam was apparent following the belief that the easiest explanation was probably the correct one... this is, in effect, a Holmes tale with a medieval twist.The film did poorly at the box office in the United States, playing at only 176 theaters and grossing only $7.2 million on a $17 million budget. However, it was popular in many parts of Europe and had a worldwide gross of over $77 million. It received generally positive reviews from American and Italian critics. Why Italian, who knows? But the critics were right, and this is a great film. How it failed to go over well in American is a mystery.",The Name of the Rose
5,jboothmillard,The Name of the Rose,8,30 May 2009,"I watched this film, based on the book by Umberto Eco, once or twice before, certainly when I was in college. There came the television series, starring John Turturro and Rupert Everett, and I knew that I had to watch it again, and to get a better opinion, directed by Jean-Jacques Annaud (Seven Years in Tibet, Enemy at the Gates, Two Brothers). Basically, set in the 14th century, at a Benedictine Abbey in Northern Italy, Franciscan friar William of Baskerville (BAFTA winning Sean Connery) and his novice assistant, Adso of Melk (Christian Slater), are arriving to attend an important conference. But the abbey is in fear, following the recent death of a young monk, a brilliant illustrator, and many of the monks believe it to be caused by supernatural forces. The Abbot (Moonraker's Michael Lonsdale) asks William, known for his great intellect and a former investigator for the inquisition, to help solve the mystery. William examines the evidence and concludes the monk committed suicide from another part of the abbey, and that his body was moved. The conference takes place, but immediately another death occurs. Greek translator Venantius (Urs Althaus) is found upside down in a huge pot, and when examining the body, William notices he has blackened fingers on his right hand and a blackened tongue. The assistant librarian Berengar (Michael Habeck) denies William and Adso to enter the library to examine the two dead monks desks. William finds a cryptic clue, written in invisible ink; it is directions to a secret location in the library. William and Adso chase after Berengar and split up to search the Abbey. Adso wanders into the storehouse and hides when monk Remigio da Varagine (Helmut Qualtinger) is searching for intruders. Also hiding there is a beautiful quiet peasant girl (Valentina Vargas), and he is surprised when she makes passionate love to him before disappearing into the night. Meanwhile, William engages in a conversation with half-wit hunchback monk Salvatore (Hellboy's Ron Perlman) who, along with Remigio, is a former member of a heretical cult. Salvatore tells William what he has seen happen between the illustrator, the translator and the assistant librarian. The next day, the body of the assistant librarian is found by the abbey herbalist Severinus (Elya Baskin) submerged in a bathtub, he also has blackened fingers and tongue. William tells the Abbot that he believes the illustrator killed himself as he was racked with guilt trading sexual favours with the assistant librarian to get access to a forbidden book, a ""book that kills"". The assistant librarian put the Greek translator's body into the pot and died while taking a bath. The Abbott is underwhelmed by this explanation and says he has no choice but to call in the Papal inquisition to get to investigate. Bernardo Gui (F. Murray Abraham), an investigator who nearly got William executed in the past, will be arriving to take charge. William asks the librarian Malachia (Volker Prechtel) for access to the library but is denied. Later, he and Adso pressure Remigio to help them sneak into the library tower, which they discover is a labyrinth of rooms and passages. They use a copy of the directions to locate what they believe is the entrance to a secret room, but they fail to figure out how to open it. The next day, during the conference, William is interrupted by the Abbey herbalist who whispers that he has found the secret book hidden behind a jar in his building. But before William can get away, the herbalist is killed by the librarian and the book taken back. That night, Bernardo catches Salvatore there with the teenage girl, he concludes that she is a witch. William however realises that the girl was more likely exchanging sexual favours for food. Despite this, Bernardo sentences the girl, Salvatore and Remigio to burn at the stake. That afternoon, the librarian dies, and his fingers and tongue are found to be blackened. In the resulting confusion William and Adso manage to slip away and return to the tower library. They hope to find evidence that will force the executions to be halted. They find their way to the secret door and find how to open it. There, they find Jorge de Burgos (Feodor Chaliapin Jr.), the blind and humourless senior member of the Abbey, with the secret book. Jorge invites them to examine the book, but William realises the pages of the book are poisoned. This is the reason anyone who has been in possession of it has died, from licking the pages. When William tells Jorge, who cannot see anything, that he is wearing a glove, in the ensuing chase, a candle is knocked over, setting the library on fire. Jorge hides and starts to eat pages of the book. Outside, the Abbey the girl, Salvatore and Remigio have been tied to stakes. Salvatore and Remigio are burned, but before the girl's stake can be ignited, Bernardo, the monks and guards notice the library tower is on fire. They run back to the Abbey while the girl is rescued by peasants. Bernardo, seeing the library on fire and deciding things are out of control chooses to flee the Abbey. The peasants however, angered by his sentencing of the girl, topple his wagon off the road and down a cliff where he is fatally impaled. While chasing Jorge, Adso and William are separated. Seemingly trapped by the blaze, William orders Adso out of the building. Jorge dies of poisoning from the poisoned ink that he ate. Adso makes it out and, at the last minute, so does William, who also rescued a handful of important books. They depart the smouldering Abbey. On the way, Adso sees the girl one last time. The narrator (Dwight Weist), Adso as an old man, says that she was his only love, but he never found out her name. Also starring William Hickey as Ubertino de Casale, and The Spy Who Loved Me's Vernon Dobtcheff as Hugh of Newcastle. Connery gives a great performance as the wise sleuth friar, young Slater is also good, the supporting cast all get their moments as well. The story is just about easy to follow, the political stuff is less interesting, but you can follow the clues and guess who the murderer is, the period detail and location is well done also, it is a terrific historical mystery drama. It won the BAFTA for Best Make Up Artist. It was number 52 on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments for young Slater's sex scene with the Girl. Very good!",The Name of the Rose
6,rmax304823,The Game is Afoot,6,19 June 2002,"An unusual flick, divided into two parts, the first part taking up most of the screen time and being the more involving.  William of Baskerville -- a name to conjure with -- and his sidekick Adzo arrive at a medieval monastery run by Dominican monks, rather like Monte Cassino.  The Dominicans were never known for their sense of humor.  Baskerville and friend are Franciscans, a different order of monk, characterized more by a sort of mystic love of things human and animal.  Since Baskerville is a Franciscan, there is immediate conflict between him and his hosts, one which, in the end, turns out to underlie in a complicated way the entire mystery with which the film starts, turning on the apparent murders of several of the Dominicans.  It's this mystery story which intrigues the viewer.  Who dunnit?  Baskerville, aided (and sometimes hindered) by his pal, young Dr. Watson, I mean young Adzo, exercises all of his ratiocinative powers to solve the case, using a magnifying glass, examining footprints for their unique points, figuring out ways to solve directions to the Musgrave cellar, I mean a labyrinthine library.  It's all rather neatly done.  Sean Connery is utterly charming.  Christian Slater is under more control than usual. The monastery's inhabitants are right out of a Charles Addams cartoon.  Man, do they have odd haircuts.  And bad teeth.  And opaque eyes.  And some are obese and pale and given to homoerotic escapades.  In fact it could be argued that Baskerville and Adzo are the only two ""normal""-looking folks in the crowd.  The mystery has something to do with a horde of forbidden books, including the second book of Aristotle's ""Poetics,"" hidden in a secret library.Then Professor Moriarty arrives and the whole structure weakens and shivers like one of Aquinas's arguments that prove the existence of God.  F. Murray Abraham plays it straight.  He's genuinely evil, and does a splendid job as Bernardo Gui.  Bernardo finds three people -- ranging from the misguided communist to the frankly psychotic -- guilty of conspiring with the devil and consigns them to the flames.  The burning is pretty gruesome too.  The agony isn't as prolonged as Dryer's Joan of Arc, but it's pretty horrifying. But really.  Everything seems to go awry during the last third of the picture.  Adzo escapes the burning library but Baskerville is trapped in the holocaust.  The director cross-cuts between scenes of Baskerville having a philosophical conversation with the chief villain -- ""You can't expect to deny laughter is a human characteristic"" -- and scenes of people getting roasted outside.  Then Baskerville emerges from the holocaust that is the monastery with a handful of precious books from what has been described as ""the finest library in all Christendom,"" and this is treated as some sort of victory.It was during this period when Western civilization didn't have much going for it, except what literature had been salvaged from the ancient Greeks, and that was in the hands of the church.  The crusades were to bring us into contact with the Saracens who reintroduced the rest of us to additional Greek and Roman literature and science.  Algebra was their own contribution. (I don't think I'll ever forgive them.)  The Christian church was one potent sociopolitical force.  Did Lord Acton really says, ""Power corrupts; absolute power corrupts absolutely""?  It's been quoted so many times I'm not sure I believe it anymore.  But the church then wasn't the church we know today.  You could be absolved of a sin you committed by confessing it to a representative of the church and then doing penance, which often involved a financial contribution to the church.  After a while, it became possible to be absolved of sins you had not yet committed by paying for an indulgence. You could then sell the indulgence to someone else, possibly at a profit. Eventually there came to be a futures market in indulgences, with priests and monks hawking them like peddlers in the town square.  So crooked they remind one of today's inside traders and the CEOs at Enron.  Compared to them, these monks are pretty benign.  The movie ends on a wistful note, but not a happy one.",The Name of the Rose
7,Tweekums,The Name of the Rose,9,5 December 2019,"This murder mystery is set in a monastery in the early fourteenth century. A monk has been found dead in mysterious circumstances... his body was found on rocks below a window which could not be opened. Some of those present suspect the work of the devil; William of Baskerville, a visiting Franciscan with investigative experience, suspects the answer is more earthly. With the help of Adso, his novice, he starts working to determine what happened. As further deaths occur he finds possible links to the monastery's secret library, and the presence of former members of heretical sect. Tensions rise when a leader of the Inquisition arrives with his own methods of discovering 'the truth'.If you enjoy a good mystery and are looking for a different setting then this is definitely one to check out. The fourteenth century setting feels real; we see that the church has near absolute power; the poor scramble for scraps and there is a sense of supernatural-paranoia. The mystery itself, while set in the era, goes the way one would expect an investigation to go... clues are followed, suspects and motives are identified and ultimately the truth exposed. Sean Connery is on fine form as William of Baskerville and a young Christian Slater impresses as Adso. There are also notable performances from Ron Perlman, as a hunchbacked heretic; Michael Lonsdale, as the Abbot; Valentina Vargas, as a village girl who seduces Adso; and F. Murray Abraham as the leader of the Holy Inquisition. The setting is very impressive; I particularly liked the labyrinth within the library with its maze of rooms and stairs. There are some scenes that may disturb some viewers, put nothing too severe for most. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to mystery fans looking for something rather different.",The Name of the Rose
8,ma-cortes,A monk and his novice helper attempt to solve a series of killings in a fourteenth-century abbey,7,7 October 2012,"Germany/Italy/France co-production with interesting and suspenseful screenplay by Andrew Birkin , Gérard Brach ,Howard Franklin and based on novel ""Il Nome Della Rosa"" by Umberto Eco . Set in 1327 , when after a strange death in a Medieval Abbey, the Benedictine monks are convinced that the four riders of apocalypse are coming ; many of the monks fear that there can be only an evil, supernatural explanation . The abbey is in fear over the recent death of one of their young monks, a brilliant illustrator who was found killed by an impact at the base of a cliff outside . With the Abbey to play host to a council on the Franciscan's Order's belief that the Church should rid itself of wealth, William of Baskerville(Director Jean-Jacques Annaud was not keen on casting Sean Connery in the role of William of Baskerville, and a large number of actors were considered prior to Connery being cast. Some of those actors include: Michael Caine, Albert Finney, Richard Harris, Ian McKellen) an intellectually nonconformist and respected Franciscan monk investigates a series of mysterious deaths in an isolated abbey. The Abbot (Michael Lonsdale) asks William to help solve the mystery as he is known to be a man of great intellect and a former investigator for the inquisition. As he is asked to assist in determining the cause of the untimely death, and is accompanied by a novice (Hundreds of teenage boys were scouted before the production settled on Christian Slater who was only 15 years old ). Meanwhile , there happens several murders and the young monk finds a mysterious girl (Valentina Vargas is the only female character in the film). This is an acceptable screen rendition of Umberto Eco's bestseller and the movie took 5 years of preparation . The picture contains thrills , suspense , mystery , sexual scenes , intriguing issues and results to be quite entertaining . Very fine acting by Sean Connery as a monkish Sherlock Holmes trying to solve a series of murders , he is fun to watch . Good support cast plenty of uglies , such as Elya Baskin as Severinus ,Michael Lonsdale as The Abbot , Feodor Chaliapin Jr. as Jorge Burgos , William Hickey as Ubertino Casale , Michael Habeck as Berengar , Urs Althaus as Venantius , Ron Perlman as Salvatore , Leopoldo Trieste as Michele Cesena , Vernon Dobtcheff as Hugh of Newcastle , Donald O'Brien as Pietro d'Assisi and F. Murray Abraham as Inquisitor. Jean-Jacques Annaud admitted to casting the ugliest actors he could get because he wanted the characters to appear ""real"", based on the men in the village where he lived . Colorful and luxurious cinematography by Tonino Delli Colli , filmed on location in Bruzzo , Rome, Lazio, Italy and Taunus Mountains, Hessen, Germany . Impressive and spectacular production design by Dante Ferreti , as the monastery was constructed as a replica on a hilltop outside Rome, making it the biggest exterior set built in Europe since Cleopatra. Many of the inside shots were taken in the monastery Eberbach, which lies close to the Rhine. The catacombs that appear on the movie are private and belong to a small restaurant that the crew frequented on production. Evocative as well as thrilling musical score by James Horner . The motion picture was well directed by Jean Jacques Annaud . He spent four years preparing the film, traveling throughout the United States and Europe, searching for the perfect multi-ethnic cast with interesting and distinctive faces. The magnificent filmmaker Annaud creates yet another picture excellently directed and stunningly produced . Annaud directed particular films with almost no human dialogue such as ¨Quest for fire¨ and was an expert on animal movies as proved in ¨The bear¨ , ¨Running Free¨ about horses and ¨Two brothers¨ dealing with tigers . His most successful pictures were ¨The lover¨ , ¨Enemy of the gates¨,¨Seven years in Tibet¨ and of course ¨The name of the rose¨. It was 4th highest grossing movie of its year in France , though failed at the US box office, grossing only $7.2 million. However, in Europe it did exceptionally well, contributing to its overall worldwide gross of over $77 million",The Name of the Rose
9,moonspinner55,"""From the beauty of the past, now disappeared, we hold only names...""",3,1 January 2011,"William of Baskerville, a Franciscan monk, and his young novice Adso of Melk visit his Benedictine brethren at a remote abbey in Northern Italy in 1327 at a most inopportune time; one of the monks has just died a horrible and mysterious death, and soon more bodies are discovered. Blood-sloshed, deliberately-paced medieval mystery starring Sean Connery (sniffing about like a robed Hercule Poirot) sounds better than it plays. While the chilly atmospherics--where the lonesome vocals of the monks intermingle with the howling winds--set an appropriately grim tone, we could surely use more of Connery's dry wit to perk up the narrative. Based on Umberto Eco's book, the film has retained a devout following although individual taste will have to dictate its ultimate success. Director Jean-Jacques Annaud unfolds the tale methodically, while the flamboyantly bizarre behavior of the monks is off-putting and general interest in the mystery at hand wanes after the first hour. *1/2 from ****",The Name of the Rose
10,dbdumonteil,a cursed abbey in the mountains...,8,29 September 2004,"Jean Jacques Annaud is a film-maker with a daring character. After he shot this medieval thriller and among the plans he made, he made ""the Bear"" (1988) with wild animals as stars and he got down to adapt the Marguerite Duras' novel ""the Lover"" in 1992 and however, Duras' works are difficult to adapt for the screen. No, back in 1986, to adapt Umberto Eco's voluminous book was no small matter. On top of the detective plot, the work comported a theological reflection and a philosophical richness. They could be sufficient enough to lead the viewer astray. Jean Jacques Annaud seemed very aware of it. That's why he preferred to erase the quoted topics for an investigation à la Conan Doyle with a passionating enigma which is arguably more accessible in the spectator's eyes. Like Christian Slater and to reassure oneself, we rely on Sean Connery's wisdom and insight because we move in an isolated and mysterious place where lives a gallery of disturbing religious characters. The whole is scattered with beautiful pictures and a certain humor adds to the interest of the film. The director also found place to denounce the Inquisition with its unfair methods. Umberto Eco may have judged the adaptation of his novel as too simplistic but the public gave it an ovation in 1987. If you are interested in Annaud's cinema, don't miss this movie.",The Name of the Rose
11,Coventry,These nasty monks haunted my nightmares for 25 years...,10,5 October 2019,"Only a limited number of films that I watched during my youth managed to leave an everlasting impression on me, but Jean-Jacques Annaud's adaptation of Umberto Eco's ""The Name of the Rose"" is one most definitely of them! I forgot for what purpose it was, but I actually watched ""The Name of the Rose"" in the fourth grade at school. I don't know what my teacher was thinking because this seriously isn't the type of film to show to a bunch of 9-year-olds, but on the other hand I'm strongly convinced the experience contributed a great deal to my current obsession for grim horror movies and convoluted murder mysteries. Even though we are 25 years later, and I've seen perhaps 15.000 films since then, I still remember practically every detail of that wondrously grim and mysterious film in which creepy monks were being killed off in a remote and petrifying old monastery. I found it even more impeccable & effectively disturbing now, especially since the recently released TV-series (produced by and starring John Turturro) was somewhat disappointing and tedious.The charismatic Sean Connery puts down one of the most stellar performances of his rich career as William of Baskerville; - wise Franciscan friar and Sherlock Holmes ahead-of-time. He and his young novice Adso Von Melk (Christian Slater) travel to a remote monetary in the Italian alps, supposedly to participate in a grand Catholic debate, but the vicious murders quickly absorb all of Sir William's attention. Undoubtedly the #1 reason why ""The Name of the Rose"" forever kept stuck in my head is the extraordinary casting work. These monks are a dozen times scarier-looking and more menacing than immortal horror icons like Jason Voorhees or Freddy Krueger, and the image of several of them (like the hideous Malachia, the old & blind Jorge de Burgos, the disgusting Salvatore, ...) appeared in my nightmares for several years. The film also looks simply stunning! The 14th century set-pieces, and most notably the claustrophobic library-labyrinth are downright astounding. The costumes and photography are fantastic, and the script also contains a few fascinating history lessons that are far more educational than anything you'll ever learn in school, like for example the completely opposed interpretation of religion by the Franciscans and the Vatican.",The Name of the Rose

Music is scored by James Horner and cinematography by Tonino Delli Colli.Sean does Sherlock the Monk.It's one of those film's that I just can't get into, three times I have tried but it's now consigned to the recycle bin, never to be unearthed again. I see there is great artistry there, it's very literate and the mystery element is strong, but it saps my strength to the very last. Connery is miscast because he plays it as nudge nudge wink wink detective fare, and film strains too hard to be some intellectual medieval musing on inquisitional power, berserker religion and the search for truth. Now I like gloomy moods, especially when part of some Gothic architecture, but even with the delightful weirdness of this monastery and the even weirder haircuts, I find it hard to sit still, such is the haphazard directing of the plot. In all honesty, the makers really would have been better off just making another Sherlock Holmes movie and setting it in a monastery. Now that would be fun...This wants to be a paean to Arthur Conan Doyle, a brain teaser and an observation on some tricky subjects, but the mix doesn't work, sadly, for me anyway. Because I don't like it doesn't mean it's a bad film, clearly it is loved by many and has things of value to a discerning viewer.

14,preppy-3,Long and complex but fascinating,8,13 December 2011,"In medieval times William of Baskerville (Sean Connery) and his young helper Adso (Christian Slater) try to solve murders at a remote abbey. Most of the monks there think it's the Devil at work but William thinks it may be a human. What follows is a VERY complex and long but intriguing movie.I read the book ages ago. It was an excellent book but I didn't see how it could ever be a movie. It was very long and had tons of theological discussions. The movie throws out most of the discussions, simplifies the story (but doesn't talk down to the viewer) and moves things along as quickly as possible. The mystery is deep and puzzling but I figured it out. During the last hour or so F. Murray Abraham shows up an Inquisitor and things really get out of hand. Still I was never lost.The setting itself is bleak and remote perfectly fitting the tone of the movie. The acting is great. Connery just acts up a storm in a very pleasing, easy-going manner. Abraham takes his role and runs with it. You hate him every step of the way. Slater is given little to work with but he's still good. This is not for everybody. It portrays a somewhat realistic view of what an abbey would have looked like. It looks dirty and most of the monks look ugly and most have teeth missing! This is not a movie to watch if you want a pleasant feel-good movie. However it's great for people who don't mind the grimness and love a good mystery with theological digressions..

While you have to really apply yourself to figure it out before the characters do, it's not impossible. There are many details that you need to notice keep in mind and use as clues, and no reveal feels like a cheat. Technically everything is there, on screen, although of course you only gradually get to see all of it. The detectives are smart but not improbably so.The many virtues found here in don't end there. All of the acting is excellent. The director makes great use of Ron Perlman, just like he does in The Quest For Fire and Enemy At The Gates. Cinematography and editing are excellent.

You wouldn't normally think of a monk seeking to solve an unnatural death, and uncovering a greater mystery, in a remote monastery in the depths of winter in the middle ages.But that is the premise of this superior movie, with Sean Connery as master detective William of Baskerville, treading a careful line between the need to discover the story behind sudden death while remaining cautious of Church politic s(and, particularly, the deadly hand of the Inquisition), with Christian Slater his unworldly apprentice.The mystery is a good one, its sleuthing and solution fair, the performances are excellent, and the atmosphere is terrific - this place is truly cold and inhospitable.An unusual and excellent film.",The Name of the Rose
17,The_Void,Fascinating atmosphere and a great murder mystery,9,28 July 2009,"The Name of the Rose is a great film; combining a mouth-watering atmosphere with some good characters and an interesting mystery, Jean-Jacques Annaud's film is fascinating throughout. The film is based on a book by Umberto Eco and apparently bears similarities to the popular book/film The Da Vinci Code. Having not read Dan Brown's book or seen the film version, I can't say whether or not that's true- but if it is true then Dan Brown took his influence from a good place. The film is basically a murder mystery with religious overtones. The Name of the Rose is set in 1327 and takes place in an Abbey. A man has been found dead and the monks have called in Franciscan monk, William of Baskerville, in order to uncover the person that committed the murder. The monks within the Abbey are disturbed as they believe the murder signals a Satanic presence within the Abbey; and this view is made all the more troublesome when more monks begin to turn up dead. William of Baskerville must solve the riddle before the Inquisition arrives to conduct their own investigation.The main thing I loved about this film was the atmosphere. Director Jean-Jacques Annaud ensures that the film is absolutely beautiful and the Abbey itself takes centre stage. The aging walls and many catacombs provide an intriguing place for a murder mystery to take place, and it is well used. The acting is fantastic and Sean Connery is brilliant in the lead role; giving just the right atmosphere to his character. He is joined by a young Christian Slater who plays off Connery well and their relationship provides the backbone to the film. The murder mystery itself is well plotted and there's always plenty going on to ensure that the running time passes quickly. The film takes a twist midway through and then we are catapulted into a labyrinth below the central location, and this again is well used. On top of the murder mystery, there's also an insight into the attitudes of the church and how members of it attempt censorship. The film boils down to a worthwhile and fitting conclusion and overall I have to say that this is a great film and comes highly recommended!",The Name of the Rose

Ados even prayed to the Virgin Mary to save her from being burned as a witch. There was plenty of horrible looking monks running all around and plenty of secret passage ways.  In order to open one secret panel, you had to press the eyes of a SKULL. William & Ados did their very best to try and locate some very forbidden books which dealt with Laughing and Comedy.   This film would make a very excellent film to view at Halloween if you want to spend a very boring evening inside!!",The Name of the Rose
19,JamesHitchcock,Bleak and Sombre,7,11 October 2013,"Umberto Eco's novel ""Il Nome della Rosa"" was one of the great publishing phenomena of the 1980s, becoming a best-seller not only in the author's native Italy but also in many other countries. In form it is a mediaeval murder mystery, set in a Benedictine abbey in Northern Italy in December 1327. The detective-figure is an English Franciscan friar named William of Baskerville who, accompanied by his young novice Adso of Melk, arrives at the abbey where an important theological Church conference is due to take place. A mysterious death has occurred- a young illuminator appears to have committed suicide by leaping to his death from the abbey walls- and William gains the Abbot's permission to investigate. Over the next few days, several more suspicious deaths occur, and it becomes apparent that something very sinister is happening and that William and Adso are in danger. William's name is of course a reference to one of Conan Doyle's most famous works, but Eco's book is much more than a 14th century Sherlock Holmes story. It is an intellectually complex work which also touches upon mediaeval history, theology, philosophy (Eco seems to have conceived William of Baskerville as a mixture of Holmes and the philosopher William of Ockham) and classical literature. An important part of the story is Aristotle's ""Poetics"", a work which has had immense influence on the development of European literary theory. It is known that Aristotle originally wrote about both tragedy and comedy, but only the part dealing with tragedy now exists. Eco imagines, however, that one single copy of the part dealing with comedy survived, that this copy was to be found in the abbey library and that there were those who would kill to prevent others from getting their hands on it. Given the book's success, it was inevitable that a film adaptation would follow. Many of Eco's themes do not readily lend themselves to a cinematic treatment, but this film is far from being the sort of downmarket cheapening of a literary classic which so often results when Hollywood tries to tackle novels with a serious or intellectual theme. Much of the credit for this must go to the French director Jean-Jacques Annaud, a great admirer of Eco's book, who went to great pains to stay faithful to its spirit. The leading role, that of William, is played by Sean Connery. This was, apparently, a controversial choice in 1986. Connery's career was in something of a slump during the late seventies and early eighties. Few of his films from this period are particularly distinguished and he was even prevailed upon to play James Bond for one last time, something he had sworn he would never do. (The film's title, ""Never Say Never Again"" is said to be a sardonic reference to this broken vow). And yet, slump or no slump, Connery retained that essential part of star quality, the ability to take any part he played and make it so much his own that one cannot imagine any other actor in the role. Eco, who apparently disliked this piece of casting, would doubtless be appalled to hear me say so, but ever since I first saw the film Connery- intelligent, humane, sceptical and possessed of a fine logical mind- has been William of Baskerville for me. The film seems to have contributed towards reviving Connery's career as his next film, the crime drama ""The Untouchables"", was a great success and brought him his only Oscar. A teenage Christian Slater does not make much of an impression as Adso, but there are a number of good performances in supporting roles- from F. Murray Abraham as William's adversary, the sinister and fanatical Inquisitor Bernardo Gui, from Feodor Chaliapin, Jr. as the Venerable Jorge, the abbey's aged librarian, Helmut Qualtinger (who died shortly after the film was made) as Jorge's creepy deputy Remigio de Varagine and Ron Perlman as the demented hunchback Salvatore.Annaud appears to have spared no expense in realising his vision of the book; the abbey we see is not a real building but rather an immense set built on a hilltop outside Rome. The action takes place in winter, and the film is notable for its bleak and sombre look, in keeping with the dark and sombre deeds which make up its plot. The film version of ""The Name of the Rose"" may not have the intellectual depth and power of the novel, but it is nevertheless an impressive piece of film-making. 7/10",The Name of the Rose
20,=G=,"Elementary, my dear Adso!",6,18 February 2002,"In ""The Name of the Rose"", Connery plays a 14th century Franciscan monk who, with his novice (Slater) in tow and armed with a wealth of scholarly knowledge and acute powers of observation and deduction, visits a dank European abbey to solve mysterious deaths. Little more than an enjoyable European cum Hollywood popcorn flick, ""....Rose"" is entertaining though obvious and contrived. Now on the cable circuit, ""....Rose"" is free and contains some comic book characters such as Pearlman's hunchback, a sexy little scene where Slater kisses some skanky local babe hello and his celibacy goodbye, and a visit from the ever-popular and always wicked Holy Inquisition folks.

22,theowinthrop,Movies on medieval theological problems and history fail in Peoria,9,24 February 2007,"For the last three years we have been under the effect of the novel THE DA VINCI CODE, which swept the world's best seller lists, and then was finally turned into a film. It dealt with the so called secret writings of coded messages that are to be found in the works of Leonardo Da Vinci, and which deals with a hidden secret that the Roman Catholic supposedly has hidden. The film was a flop in the United States Some twenty one years ago a similar phenomenon hit the U.S. and Europe. The Italian, Umberto Eco, wrote a complex novel about the early 15th Century in Italy, the Roman Catholic Church, the rise of the great monastic libraries, and the rise of the inquisition. THE NAME OF THE ROSE became the great best seller of the middle years of the 1980s. It was made into a film starring Sean Connery, F. Murray Abraham, and Christian Slater. And the film flopped in the United States, but was successful in Europe.The events of THE NAME OF THE ROSE occur about the year 1410 in North Italy. A series of murders occur in a monastery that has one of the finest libraries. The abbot calls his old friend, the humanistic William of Baskerville (Connery) to assist in finding out what happened - if the murders are by human hand or the work (as some have said) of the devil. William comes with his young acolyte assistant Adso of Melk (Christian Slater), and slowly finds he is facing two enemies. One is the murderer who is in the monastery, and whose motives are unknown. The other is an old enemy, the fanatical inquisitor Bernardo Gui (F. Murray Abraham). Gui has had a previous run-in with William over a man William defended. William was tortured until he renounced his defense, and the man was executed. But in Gui's closed, evil mind once you defend a condemned heretic you are a marked man if you raise your head up again.The film follows William's struggle to solve the mystery and evade his old enemy's threats. It also follows Adso's romance with a local girl (Valentina Vargas) who shared his moment of love in the novel. In the end William does find the killer, but at a cost - the loss of the great library. Eco's novel, because it was a novel, could go into greater detail for the reader than the film could. While one picture is worth a thousand words, unless you read thousands of words you will not know what to look for in the picture. In Europe, where the medieval world is not too far from the modern in some cities (those that were not flattened in the two world wars, like Prague), one had the education to follow the story and see the ironies in the tale. 1410 is an ironic date, and few Americans understood that.In 1410 the Roman Catholic Church's center of operations was not Rome. Most Americans have never heard of the ""Avignon Papacy"", which began in 1360 and lasted sixty years (until 1420). The French monarchy, in a moment of anger at a Pope, invaded Italy and grabbed his Holiness and brought him back to Avignon with the Papal Curia. This would mean that from now on the Papacy would be an adjunct to the French throne, and the rest of Western Christian Europe resented it. But nothing was done about it for decades. By 1410, to the French it looked like Avignon would be permanent. That year a movement began to sweep Europe. In Bohemia a reformer, Jan Huss, arose and created a national Christian church. This was fought by Avignon, and the inquisition was created to combat it. It did eventually kill Huss, in 1416, after a show trial. But the Hussites survived (and actually formed the first reformation - beating Martin Luther by a century).But worst was to come. The enemies of Avignon picked up on this heresy and said it was proof that the French Pope was the anti-pope. Soon there were two other Papal courts in Italy that excommunicated each other and Avignon. But after awhile the two Italian Popes realized how absurd the situation made the Church look in the eyes of the world. So they sent representatives to meet, and they created a joint resolution (and a new jointly recognized Italian Pope - with backing from the rest of Europe). Avignon was declared heretical - and the newly created machinery of the inquisition turned upon the original creators. After 1420 Avignon was an unpleasant memory (only revived as a threat first by Napoleon in the early 1800s and later by Hitler in World War II to control - if necessary - the Curia and the Pope in Rome).The irony of this is not noted by American audiences as much by European ones. If Gui had not died in the film (well merited as it is) he would have switched sides and gone after his former French masters.Also not noted is that the final irony of the story is the title - the ""rose"" is the young woman Adso loves and sleeps with. He never learns her name.The acting of Connery and Slater is fine, as is the performance of the doomed ""heretic"" (who has been feeding the locals against the Church's orders) Helmut Qualtinger. Abraham makes Gui a contemptible bully, but he does occasionally rant too much (though that is easy given the bully's nature). His death sequence is ironic too, as he tries to get help in his precarious situation from the peasants who know he killed their friends - he begs for their assistance and they don't come. Also note Fyodor Chailapin Jr (son of the great opera basso), as the blind monk. Certainly a fine performance for this elderly actor, best recalled for the dog-loving grandfather in MOONSTRUCK.",The Name of the Rose

This eerie mystery thriller separated by time and place occurring in the mists of the 13th century in an isolated monastery brings a whole new meaning to scary crime scene investigations that Sherlock Holme's Hounds of Baskerville ambiance. Underlying this sometimes creepiness and foreign occult suggestive movie is a strong undercurrent of Doctor Zhivago (1965) as a subplot that by the end almost seems to be resound as the lingering emotional pavement of the entire movie. The rich set design, this movie is steeped with ancient religious practices and Sean Connery's character brings an intellect of the mind coming up against the emotional and religious fervor of faith. A gorgeous and compelling thriller with a heart.",The Name of the Rose
24,The-Sarkologist,A dark journey into the real middle ages,8,23 December 2013,"I've notice that the original title of this film is 'Der Name der Rose' which suggests that it was originally a German film, despite the fact that it is in English and that it has English actors. Maybe it is because the book was originally in German, though I have not read the book, so I cannot really comment on that (and I am not so sure about the origins of this film, though I have always believed that it was an English film).The thing that stands out for me in this film is not just the setting, which is a very dark and dirty Medieval monastery where the actions of the monks are basically ignore by the inhabitants (there is a suggestion that one of the monks is a pedophile, and there is another scene where one of the main characters has sex, and even though the main character works it out, he says and does nothing about it). If our belief of the medieval monk is a pious and saintly follower of God, then this film goes about and completely destroys it.The Name of the Rose is basically a murder mystery, and Sean Connery, a Franciscan monk, comes along and begins to use his investigative skills to try to uncover what is going on. The murders, however, have a lot of religious undertones, and we have here a debate between whether laughter is actually spiritual or not. We have the Benedicteens, who believe that laughter is sinful and should be avoided at all costs, and then we have the Franciscans who believe that laugher is a gift from God that should be embraced and experienced. We even settle down to a theological debate over that very point.However, the film is about a book, or a very specific book, and that is Aristotle's second part of the Poetics, and that is the one that deals with comedy (which, by the way, we do not have, but we do have his first part, which deals specifically with tragedy). It is suggested that this book is actually in possession of the monks in their library, where they keep a collection of all the books that they deem to be dangerous, but because they are books, they will not destroy. However this book they consider to be exceedingly dangerous, and will go out of their way to actually kill anybody who as looked inside.When I was much younger I started watching this movie but ended up becoming bored with it because it did not portray the medieval setting that I wanted to see, and that is of shiny castles, beautiful heroes, and magical feats. Instead what we have is a medieval world that is dark, dirty, and probably much closer to what life was really like back then rather than our rather fantastic views of this world.",The Name of the Rose
25,slightlymad22,Connery Is Brilliant,8,27 May 2017,"Continuing my plan to watch every Sean Connery movie in order, I come to Name Of The Rose (1986)Plot In A Paragraph: William of Baskerville (Connery) an intellectually nonconformist friar investigates a series of mysterious deaths in an isolated abbey.After a three year break, this was a much different Sean Connery who returned to cinema's. Reinventing himself as the older, wiser mentor. In the first of 3 great performances in a row, Connery delivers an absolutely wonderful performance. Imagine if Sherlock Holmes was an old monk, and you get William of Baskerville.Sean Connery's career was at such a low point away from Bond, then he was asked to read for the role, which he did, and then Columbia Pictures refused to finance the movie when director Jean-Jacques Annaud cast him as the deemed him box office poison.What we have here is the premise of a great movie. Sadly it's filmed in such a way, that at times it's so dark, it's hard to see what is actually going on. The screenplay is lacking at times too. There are so many good things in this movie, most of the performances, the reconstruction of the period, the over-all feeling of medieval times, that if the story had been able to really involve us, this would have been a brilliant movie. As it is, it falls short, but is still a really good movie. Ron Pearlman is heartbreakingly good in his supporting role, as is F Murray Abraham and Bond Villain Michael Lonsdale. However based on this performance, I would never have guessed that Christian Slater would still have an acting career 32 years later. Columbia Pictures fears proved to be founded as Name Of The Rose only grossed $7 million at the domestic box office. However it was a decent sized hit internationally adding $70 million to its total.",The Name of the Rose
26,filipemanuelneto,An excellent period film.,9,16 February 2017,"This film is the cinematographic adaptation of Umberto Eco's homonymous novel, telling the story of a series of mysterious murders inside an isolated Benedictine abbey, in the middle of the Italian Alps during the Middle Ages. Its an excellent adaptation, as the most relevant content of the novel is passed on to the screen pleasantly and rigorously. As its a period film, its not uncommon to see some historically dubious details but, since the more obvious ones come from the original book, we cannot blame the film crew. Moreover, I didn't see any situation so obvious that it took value to the film, directed by Jean-Jacques Annaud. Sean Connery and Christian Slater are the central actors in the plot, in the role of two Franciscan friars sent to the abbey for a meeting with a papal delegation. They will try to solve the deaths of the monks, their hosts, before the arrival of the delegates. The two actors were at their best and the same can be said of Michael Lonsdale (the abbot), Feodor Chaliapin Jr. (the blind Brother Jorge) and F. Murray Abraham (the inquisitor Bernardo Gui), who shone in the secondary roles. The film makes a real effort of realism: the locations were handpicked, the scenarios faithfully reconstruct the abbey described by Eco, the costumes, the choice of the ugliest extras, even the black ink bath given to the pigs, everything was thought to recreate the medieval environment, which is truly one of the great advantages of the film. Some of the scenes are worthy of anthology, such as the scenes in the labyrinth or the scene in which Slater is seduced by a young peasant (Chilean actress Valentina Vargas). This film is, definitely, a good example of what must be a period film.",The Name of the Rose
27,leplatypus,... but not its odor (tv),10,27 December 2011,"Annaud really achieved a timeless classic because I don't remember many movies with such a drive: First, you feel really isolated in this high-perched monastery, surrounded by mountains and frozen by winter. As you are stuck up there, you wish for a warmly welcome but the brothers either look like crazy people or criminals. Fortunately, your companion is Sean Connery and with his bravery and intelligence, he is the perfect help. In other words, the locations and casting are excellent.Next, the story is about a criminal investigation in Middle Ages. I think it's the oldest thriller I have ever seen and Connery looks very much like an ancestor of Sherlock Holmes! Actual filmmakers and screenwriters should remember that a thriller is about asking questions and seeking clues instead of chases and gunfight! But foremost, the movie is a sharp criticism of the Catholic Church of that time. Instead of being the voice of love, truth and charity, the brothers are cunning, liars, cupid, blind and exploit the poor. Instead of bringing a message of equality and education, the women are considered like nothing and they strongly believe in censorship. I don't understand how this church could reverse its values like this and I am as shocked by watching « Angels and Demons ». As this latter happens half a millennium later, you can say that Catholics haven't evolve for the better and it's then a stenching rose.For those who criticize actually Islam, they should watch this movie and learn how the most powerful church behaves at the same age.",The Name of the Rose
28,Tweetienator,Great Movie With Some Unnecessary Flaws,9,16 November 2017,"I read the book written by Umberto Eco three or four times over the years and it is still an outstanding masterpiece - an exquisite thinker, a sharp and witty writer and someone with a great expertise in history, philosophy, and theology - not many writers have such an immense background they can use to make such a fine piece of literature.Like the book the movie directed by Jean-Jacques Annaud gives us a little glimpse into the life of people living in the Middle Ages. Sean Connery as William of Baskerville plays superb, Christian Slater as Adson of Melk is a rising star, and all the other actors play good to very good- a well-composed cast (not to mention Ron Perlman as a hunchbacked monk).The movie really got a feel of authenticity. The only aspect I have to complain about are some of the changes done regarding the book - well, imo they are no improvement - especially the almost happy-ending regarding the rose named girl (in the book it is indicated that she would burn with the two monks in Avignon after trial) and as Bernardo Gui (the inquisitor) is a historical person - he did not die in real life (and in the book) like in the movie depicted. Eichinger (the producer or whoever is responsible for those changes) did imo regarding the ending of the movie too much sugar-coating for the audience. For those unnecessary but important changes, I got at least to distract one or two points. Anyway - still a magnificent movie.",The Name of the Rose
29,robert-temple-1,The Threat of Laughter to Oppressive Powers,8,21 September 2008,"THE NAME OF THE ROSE (DER NAME DER ROSE) (1986) Summary: The Threat of Laughter to Oppressive PowersSeeing this fascinating film again, I was more struck this time with the bleakness of its grim vision of people and life. The only sights to relieve the eye in the entire film are some exquisitely carved stone doorways and lots of old bound folio leather tomes, like many which I have myself. (Note: in 1327 these did not exist, but never mind. Maybe the budget could not stretch to vellum.) Everything else is like a vision of hell, and presumably that's what everyone thinks of the Middle Ages. There are some perfect performances in this film, such as F. Murray Abraham as Bernardo Gui the Inquisitor, and Michael Lonsdale as the Abbot (what's he doing speaking English? back in your French box, Lonsdale!). But the most spectacular performance, and the one which steals the film to my mind is that by Ron Perlman as Salvatore, a hunchback who is more interesting than all the other monks put together, and who speaks the most astonishing multi-lingual gibberish I have ever heard come out of a human mouth. I wonder if he were dubbed! Sean Connery is smooth and convincing as William of Baskerville, but better still would have been someone a bit more cerebral. (I kept expecting him to pull a gun from under his cassock and start blasting away.) Christian Slater is charmingly naive as William's young protégé, and probably just right for the part, though rather a tepid presence on screen. The chief importance of this film, though few viewers may have realized it, is that the main theme is based upon scholarly fact. There really was a Book Two of Aristotle's 'Poetics' dealing with the nature and philosophy of comedy and laughter, and it is lost, and probably for the very reasons which the author Umberto Eco suggests. There are some publications on this subject, such as Richard Janko's book 'Aristotle on Comedy: Towards a Reconstruction of Poetics II' (Duckworth, London, 1984), based on a precis of part of the work which apparently survived in a treatise called 'Tractatus Cosilinianus', made in the tenth century. Certainly, Aristotle's comments on parody, ridicule, and mockery would have made members of the Inquisition nervous. Part of the surviving precis says: '... there is a place for some mockery in comedy, since a reproach becomes acceptable if it is sweetened with wit. The joker aims to expose the faults of mind and body in his victims ...' Not what cardinals are fond of! After all, during the decades of Soviet oppression, the Eastern Europeans took refuge in subtle satire as a way of attacking the tyranny, and in the Middle Ages, it was the only way to deal with the Catholic oppression. So the Inquisition was not anxious for a manual on satire to be handed round as a guide for attacks on their sanctimonious prating and their vicious persecutions. Laughter really is a threat to the oppressive, since if there is one thing a sadist cannot tolerate, it is being thought to be laughable. Sadism comes from vanity, and vanity is too readily punctured by humour for humour to be encouraged or allowed. That is why stand-up comics are now being reined in and told they cannot make fun of this or that group, on the pretext of 'political correctness', but really to force them to submit to censorship by the humourless mediocrities who preside over every oppressive bureaucracy which has ever existed. After all, there is nothing funny about being mediocre, it is deadly serious, and so are the efforts of the mediocre to silence those of us who might laugh at their pretences and ridicule their power. It is rare for a major film to be made from an intellectual book, especially one dealing with fundamental issues of society. Will we see another anytime soon? Or will pigs fly first?",The Name of the Rose

In England Universal Education did not arrive until 500 years after the setting of Eco's ""The Name of The Rose"".Between them,the Church and the Aristocracy clung grimly to the ""droit de seigneur"",keeping the underclass under by denying it access to literacy and books,the tools of knowledge. Hidden away in the monastery at the centre of the movie are the books that have been given in to the custody of the monks to prevent the peasants improving their lot. Proto - Nazi F.Murray Abraham attributes a series of unexplained deaths to supernatural events in this era before ""The Enlightenment"" whilst worldly liberal Sean Connery and his assistant Christian Slater attempt to prove a more secular explanation. Signor Eco's 1980 novel was an imaginative masterpiece,but,like the later ""A Brief History of Time"" by Stephen Hawking was read more in the breach than in the observance,as one might say.The movie has made an excellent job of making a complex multi - layered work accessible. Set in a Europe in the middle of a mini Ice Age that would last for 200 years there is a distinct chill in the atmosphere.Breath hangs in tne air,skins are red and raw,clothes rough and uncomfortable.There is little joy to be found in contemporary life except perhaps for the Brothers in the closed community of the monastery in whose very exclusivity was to be found warmth of a sort. The shrewd and benign William of Baskerville and his energetic helper Brother Adso bring a brief touch of the outside world to this enclosed Order.They defy Orthodoxy and promote humanism to an extent that makes them persona non grata. ""The Name of The Rose"" is not an easy movie - which is not to say it is elitist or obscure,because it is neither,but it does require that you pay it your full attention in order to get the most out of it. Even if you have no interest in medieval history it can be enjoyed as a clever murder mystery in its own right.Mr Connery - possibly inspired by a role more challenging than many in recent years - is exceptionally good,young Master Slater - surprisingly perhaps - even more so.A fine literate script retains much of the meat of Eco's work whilst winnowing it down to a bum - friendly 2 hours or so.

But underneath all the moral observations and arcane Latin tags is an old-fashioned whodunit in the best Arthur Conan Doyle tradition, with Sean Connery portraying a Franciscan monk (transparently names William of Baskerville) who ingeniously deduces the truth behind a series of gruesome murders in a 13th century Italian monastery. The diabolical plot involves an unwritten book by Socrates, a labyrinthine tower riddled (pun intended) with secret passageways, corpses with blackened fingers and tongues, and the unwelcome attention of the Inquisition. Four writers are credited with the adaptation, and the film (perhaps as a result) is both literate and lively, effectively recreating the grime and severity of the Middle Ages but not above allowing the young novitiate Watson a fairly explicit sex scene with a comely young peasant lass.",The Name of the Rose

Sins and prayers, life and death, love and hate, are all equally present. The most interesting part is the theological debate on whether laughter is a sin or not and if Christ himself ever laughed. The monastery Annaud shows us is very accurate and interesting, and so are the performances he gets from his actors: Abraham, Slater and Ron Perlman are all fascinating in their different roles, but it is of course Sean Connery who steals the show, with terrific lines and a character mixing Sherlock Holmes' brains with James Bond's charisma. 007 and The Untouchables aside, this is Connery's best work, but this movie is also recommended if you like thrillers, history and peculiar individuals.8,5/10",The Name of the Rose

After a series of murdersattributed to the presence of a supernatural force that are taking place within the cold walls of the godforsaken battlement, Brother William of Baskerville (Connery) ends up undertaking an investigation to solve the secrets surrounding these unexplainable crimes All of them bearing blackened fingers and blackened tongues What follows, brings William face to face with Bernardo Gui (F. Murray Abraham), the sadistic Grand inquisitorappointed by the Pope to hunt down and free the Church of hereticswho sees the abbey enshrouded in a terrifying mystery and the devil roaming behind every foul deed Gui burns every last suspected devil-worshipper in the village, forcing Baskerville to uncover the truth before innocent blood is shed As always, Connery lends dignity, intelligence as the acute and prudent monk who has knowledge, both of the human spirit and the wiles of the evil one Connery plays his role with gusto Newcomer Christian Slater plays Connery's faithful sidekick, Adso, the youngest son of the Baron of Melk who sure does like to watch his master at work One nightexpressing fear and confusion he gets feminine carnal delights from a peasant girl, 'a creature that rose like the dawn, was bewitching as the moon, radiant as the sun, terrible as an army poised for battle' For a moment, Ron Perlman steals the show as the heretical hunchbacked monk named Salvatore who is ugly yet phenomenal His scenes with Abraham are stirring ""The Name of the Rose"" is atmospheric, but disturbing at many levels Some might say, contradictory, leaving plenty of twists and turns unresolved and unexplained, but the film was a smash hit in Europe Annaud succeeds in capturing the claustrophobia and panic of being truly lost in the menacing, creepy Dark Ages",The Name of the Rose

36,barnabyrudge,"Criminally underrated by some, hailed as a masterwork by others. Who's right? The ""masterwork"" campaigners, of course!",9,16 December 2004,"'Variety' got it completely wrong when they called this film ""sorrowfully mediocre"" and ""sluggishly staged"". For in all honesty The Name of the Rose is one of the greatest films of the '80s, and a film that grows in greatness every time you revisit it. Based on a major bestselling novel by Umberto Eco, the film is an excellent murder mystery further heightened by its authentic period trappings and a clutch of tremendous performances.Brother William of Baskerville (Sean Connery) and his young apprentice Adso (Christian Slater) are monks who arrive in a 14th Century monastery having been summoned for a religious conference. Soon after their arrival, a series of bloodthirsty murders take place and the friars still alive begin to fear that either the Apocalypse is upon them, or a highly disturbed individual is out to bump them off. Brother William has a penchant for sleuthing, so he probes into the mysterious deaths and discovers that each victim had laid his eyes upon a Greek manuscript hidden deep within the interior of the monastery. He gradually realises that the killer must be targeting those who know of the book's existence, but just as he is about to solve the killings an inquisitor (F. Murray Abraham) arrives and tries to discredit Brother William's theories, preferring to blame the crimes on non-existent heretics and satanists.The film is very realistic in every way - the cold, uncomfortable monastery; the graphic murders; grotesque and disfigured characters; a startlingly explicit sex scene; authentic-sounding dialogue; excellent indoor and outdoor locations; and well-researched costume designs. Furthermore, it is a superbly paced film, never in too great a hurry to unravel but never so slow that it becomes a plod. Connery is great as the hero, surpassed only by Abraham in a breathtaking role as Bernardo Gui the inquisitor, and Slater does well considering his tender age as the loyal apprentice. Both Roy Scheider and Michael Caine were short-listed for the Connery role, but I don't see how either actor could've done better with the character. Jean Jacques Annaud directs outstandingly, capturing every shadow, every expression and every plot piece with the eye that only a director obsessed with his material possibly can.

40,onepotato2,See... Pretty boys in Peril!,5,25 December 2004,"I haven't read the book, but perhaps this movie was slammed because it transfigured Eco's book into a kitsch version of The Crucible. Worse still, the unintended message here, is that a secret library full of knowledge, preserved through the middle ages & kept under lock and key by conservatives almost made it, until our liberal heroes showed up and caused it's destruction. Uhhh. Thanks guys. And thanks for saving those um.. eight... books Sean.The silly villain is a scapegoat supplied in the form of the historical Bernardo Gui, played by F. Murray Abraham as a self-righteous douchebag. Did Gui really have such a hard ""ugly American"" accent back in the eleventh century?It's kind of a hard-sell to get adult men to go to a movie with only men in it. And if they were avoiding a gay feel to it, they've failed. This is really gay stuff. Once again filial affection exists in a movie only adjacent to overt homosexuality, leaving male camaraderie and affection to be depicted under the guise of aggression (so straight guys approve; fight club, every war movie ever made) That's really getting the culture somewhere...This movie is a ""who's who"" of gruesome faces. Ron Perlman is quite good as a hunchback/scapegoat. It's populated with chubby drama nerds (in tonsure) master thespianizing all over the scenery. William Hickey may have been a great casting agent but he's a truly terrible actor.I enjoy this movie for various elements, but I don't think it adds up to a compelling whole.

Slater is also confused about his calling and his feelings towards a local peasant girl, also look out for Ron Pearlman of Hellboy fame in a role as a heretic hunchback. The plot and story line is gripping. It had me guessing until the very end. What makes this a great film is the cinematography, locations and acting.

The directing of the film, the sets and of course the scripts all perfectly intermingle to make you feel a part of a 14th century Italian monastery.The film is beautifully set in an Italian monastery that looks like it is straight out of the 14th century, the film is an excellent twist on a murder mystery It's the work of the Devil. That's what some say when a bizarre series of deaths strikes a 14th-century monastery. Others find links between the deaths and the book of Revelation.

44,classicalsteve,Jean-Jacques Annaud's Accurate Depiction of the Late Middle Ages a Must-See for Medievalists,10,5 July 2009,"A lot of our perception of the Middle Ages comes from previous Hollywood movies, such as Robin Hood and Excalibur. In reality, Europe of the Middle Ages was dark, damp, and dirty, there was no middle-class, and the clergy and the nobility ran society like dictators. Consideration of personal hygiene was almost non-existent, medical practices were atrocious, and the search for knowledge was discouraged by the church. Aside from the great Gothic cathedrals, much of the architecture was comprised of either large stone buildings or small shacks for the peasantry. And religious fanaticism raged all over Christendom. If you weren't fearing for your life in the hereafter because of sin, you might be worried that the church would haul you in on charges of heresy. But there was one small consolation: it was the period when some of the most beautiful books ever created first appeared by the artistic hands of monks in scriptoriums. This is the world of ""The Name of the Rose"", the film adaption of the novel by Umberto Eco.The story concerns several murders that take place in a medieval monastery circa 1327. But this monastery is special (although essentially fictional): it contains one of the greatest and most extensive libraries in all of Medieval Europe. Not all aspects of the Middle Ages were gloom and doom. The age produced some of the most extravagantly beautiful hand-written books western society has ever seen. The large ornamented calligraphy was adorned by beautiful illuminations in the margins, artwork that surrounded the text. (The art of hand illumination has been subsequently lost to modern printing innovations.) William of Baskerville (Sean Connery), a Franciscan monk, and his pupil Adso (Christian Slater) arrive at this Benedictine monastery hidden in the snow-clad mountains presumably near the border of Italy and modern-day Switzerland. At this time, the Franciscans were a relatively new monastic order, their order barely 100 years old, as compared to the Benedictines that by this time had boasted an 800-year history. William and Adso learn about the death of one of the monastery's best illuminators who worked in the monastery's scriptorium. The scriptorium was the area of a medieval monastery in which monks copied, illuminated and illustrated books. The story becomes a narrative about medieval books, classical writings, and the power of thought--medieval thought versus classical (aka Ancient Greek) sensibilities. As William of Baskerville (so-named referencing Sherlock Holmes) begins to piece together the puzzle, he realizes that the death has much to do with the library and its books, and possibly one book in particular.Although this is a loose adaption of the book, the film ""The Name of the Rose"" is one of the best depictions of the Middle Ages. Unlike most Hollywood offerings concerning the same period, the actors in ""The Name of the Rose"" were probably similar to the strange-looking and care-worn monks that habituated 14th-century monastic life. Most of these people (save the two Hollywood actors Sean Connery and Christian Slater) are gaunt and less unattractive people occupying large drafty buildings full of stench and grime. Their lives amounted to sleeping, eating, working, and worship. Leisure was not just avoided, it was largely unknown. Their only solace is the beautiful Gregorian Chant that echos through the Church Sanctuary during morning and evening services.No one in this movie is particularly attractive, and there are even a character or two who will make you cringe. The cast, mostly made up of French, Italian, and American actors, is outstanding with a few notable standouts. Ron Perlman as Salvatore, a dim-witted hunchback who doesn't know whether he's speaking Latin, Italian or French is the absolute tour-de-force performance of the film. His portrayal is worth the price of admission alone. I didn't realize the actor was actually American until much later! Feodor Chaliapin as the venerable Jorge, an aging blind monk that does not let his age nor his blindness interfere with his expressing opinion gives a stalwart performance. Volker Prechtel as the stoic librarian and supervisor of the scriptorium; his character could give any modern-day spinster a run for her money. William Hickey as Ubertino of Casale, an exiled Franciscan who is strangely lovable despite his age and his dying teeth! And F. Murray Abraham (of Salieri fame in Amadeus) is also memorable as the historical figure Bernardo Gui, a true-to-life 14th-century inquisitor. You really believe you are walking in the 14th century among these people. But would you want to invite them for coffee?This is an outstanding film, granted not exactly escapist and definitely not for the feint of heart. Simultaneously, this movie provides a window into the world of Western Europe 700 years ago, when democracy did not exist, people were stratified, religious fanaticism the norm, and the world was lit only by fire. A compelling time and a compelling subject. Personally I love to study Middle Ages and its history and culture. Would I ever want to live back then? Not on your life. I'll use movies and books instead like the Name of the Rose.",The Name of the Rose
45,Andy-296,Poor adaptation of Umberto Eco's masterpiece,5,15 January 2008,"A dull and disappointing adaptation of Umberto Eco's masterpiece by the mediocre French director, Jean-Jacques Annaud. If you have only seen the movie, you will have no idea of the richness of Eco's novel. The movie only deals with the murder mystery (and it does this poorly) leaving aside all the philosophical debates and the esoteric minutiae that made the novel so compelling. The reconstruction of the era makes it look grim and depressing, and I don't think that was the feeling in the book. It's hard to think of a novel so poorly translated to the screen as this one (Reportedly, Eco is of the same opinion, and this is why he hasn't let other books of him be filmed). Connery (a fine actor) is indifferent here, while a young Christian Slater is totally out of cast as Adso (he has a ""what the heck am I doing here"" look).

Sean Connery is on decent form as one of the very few likable characters (look out for the guy who looks a lot like uncle Fester), while a very young looking Christian Slater is fine as the apprentice monk. The best aspect by far though is the bleak, cold, and impressive looking setting which incorporates an actual Italian fortress, and some of the location work and cinematography is very good. Above all else this is a murder mystery, and because of the setting it makes for a quite unique and interesting watch.

48,gkeith_1,Connery as 007,10,9 May 2008,"Remember dear old 007, namely as portrayed by Sean Connery? He was a very good sleuth, and always surrounded by fashionable women. In ""The Name of the Rose"", however, he is still leading us through a good detective story, but the gorgeous women are absent. There is a bodacious bad-girl character who dabbles in witchcraft and illicit sex with a lecherous gone-bad goofy priest, but that is as good as it gets. In this movie, Connery (as William of Baskerville, a Franciscan monk) has to butt heads with gluttonous and gloomy fellow monks and priests. Some of these men are crooked, corrupt and wearing very fancy gold-embroidered robes. Baskerville, of the plain-brown-robe-with-rope-belt of the Franciscan persuasion, is investigating why young monks are suddenly winding up dead as doornails. The supervisory monks/priests say, ""Why, those were accidents!"" Baskerville/Connery is not convinced. No, siree. Meanwhile, he is training his young assistant monk-in-training, Adso of Melk as portrayed by Christian Slater, in the arts of sleuthing and quiet discovery. Later, Slater engages in sinful lust with said bad-girl (Slater was the smart monk, not the dumb one as described earlier). You would be surprised what these monks did behind the scenes. Baskerville finds out the answers to his questions, and in the end goes off into the sunset to find another adventure. I miss the Aston-Martin and dashing black suits Connery wore in his James Bond movies, and I even miss Bond's old ""villain"" friends. The villains in ""Name of the Rose"", however, were evil and corrupt priests who were literally getting away with murder and greedy mayhem. This movie was part of a college course about early church history, where we studied about different orders of the Catholic Church, how some stuck to vows of poverty and others lived lives of sumptuous wealth and wasteful, wicked days. 10/10.",The Name of the Rose
49,petra_ste,Ten little monks,7,3 August 2007,"Adapted from Umberto Eco's novel, this movie by director Jean-Jacques Annaud is basically a whodunit in a medieval setting. Which, in itself, is fine, but the book was much more than that.Early 14th century: Franciscan monk William of Baskerville (Sean Connery) and his disciple Adso (Christian Slater) visit a a monastery in Northern Italy; the Abbey (Michael Lonsdale) asks William to discover the truth about a monk's death. Other murders follow: William unravels the mystery while inquisitor Bernardo Gui (F. Murray Abraham) is more interested in finding someone to burn.Always charismatic Connery plays William as one third erudite monk, one third Sherlock Holmes and one third... well, Sean Connery. Slater's Adso is essentially a teenage Watson. F. Murray Abraham is all piercing stares and icy malevolence - after his arrival, the focus shifts from the murder mystery to the conflict between him and William.The movie goes to great lengths to give each secondary character a grotesquely distinctive look - some of them are downright monstrous, like Ron Perlman's repugnant, incomprehensible Salvatore. Production values are remarkable, sets convincingly damp and ominous.When you adapt a book - especially a complex one full of cultural and historical references - minor characters and subplots should either be given the proper time or cut entirely. It doesn't make sense to keep them just for the sake of it. The Name of the Rose doesn't always suffer from this tendency, but from time to time it does: see the character of Ubertino - interesting in the book, here transmogrified into an obtuse creep whose antics are played for laughs.The debate between Franciscan and Papal delegations and the events concerning Dolcino and followers are handled confusingly, but admittedly it was difficult to give them justice in this medium. Shame, because they are part of the thematic backbone of the story.Although there is Adso's love story with the unnamed girl, the most poignant moment actually comes when a frantic, desperate William tries to choose books to save from the rising fire. There is no sense of triumph at the end, with a melancholic, downbeat coda which elevates the whole movie.7/10",The Name of the Rose

It's suspenseful, entertaining, well-paced and well-acted (the finest performance of Connery's career), with gorgeous atmospheric cinematography.

52,loganx-2,There Shall Be No Smiling,8,12 June 2008,"A murder mystery set in a fourteenth century monastery. Based on the novel by author, philosopher, critic, extrodinaire Umberto Eco, the story combines a love of pop detective fiction like Sherlock Holmes and Nero Wolfe, with an rigorous interest in mid-evil monastic ritual, philosophy, esoterica, and politics.A young monk is killed, and before the Inquisition is summoned, Sean Connery is given a chance to crack case as a wise but contentious monk, who uses early scientific method and deduction to reason out a case most are ready to claim as the work of the devil.Hidden passageways, mysterious libraries, forbidden passions, and an old conspiracy, all make there appearances without ever succumbing to so many of the cliché's associated with them.The only real problem here is that a true understanding of the films end calls for a pre-understanding of Philosophy and not just books that are written and why, but books that don't exist and what that suggests.What if comedy is was just as important to western culture as tragedy, how would this affect our literature, philosophy, and religion, down to our daily lives of sacrifice and toil? What if laughing was as beatific as martyrdom, and seriousness held in as high regard as fleeting joy. What if there were no highs and lows in culture, no or less distinctions between the sacred and the profane(the story begins with the murder of a monk known for his satirical illustrations). Well everything kinda hinges on that, but it's not communicated very effectively, these ideas make an appearance late in the script and unless you already know(SPOILER), that Aristotle's Poetics on Comedy was lost, and that we have only on the parts concerning Tragedy with which to base (for hundreds and hundreds of years, and amongst some still to this day) the absolute definition of the nature and purpose of literature and how to identify quintessentially a ""good work"". The birth of literary criticism and absolutism with regard to western writing.Well the film asks the question which may be more interesting a proposition than the movie itself, still it's a fascinating intersection of genres, styles, and concepts, a torch lit labyrinth of ideas and gloomy monks with magnifying glasses.

I would like to, but there are so many books and so little time.I feel a bit conflicted. I think the movie was quite good in theory but lacked something that would make it my favorite. Maybe it had a little bit too much over-dramatic elements, like the old monk with weird looking eyes, and the hunchback character. Also how the characters behave often struck me as ""real monks wouldn't be like that"". Not that I am a monk but I've seen some other movies about such monks like Francis of Assisi, and I think I liked those better. This movie, despite the monk robes, was more a murder mystery movie. Which is not bad, I mean the plot was ok. I just...maybe I expected more of some profound deep message but was left with ""quite nice"" thriller adventure.Technically it's a well done film.

The script as well as the characters in it are 100% fit in to the era ,a time in which life was usually hard and short, prejudice against anything that they couldn't explain was in every mind and the fear of God's Wrath was routed in everyone alive. Europe back then was quit different from the later centuries and nowadays we usually have little to no idea how was life back then and we unfairly simplify it to swords, battle, death and after the Renaissance. But here as with few occasions we see a widow in to the workings of this world.Continuouning Sean Connery gives us a monk who isn't as in line as the rest of his order, he is a man in love with the works of the Classicals and the idea of first reason then result and from his student Adso of Melk we see how odd that ideas were seen as almost magic. Now you may think that a monk to use these ideas in 1327 when the story takes place is inaccurate ,but the monasteries were basically the economic, cultural and educational centers of Europe then so person like William ,would exist here and there. The knowledge of the Classical period may was suppressed ,but the large portion of it was stored in monasteries all over the place, in order to be read by the bishops for understanding better the essence of God and then came a Martin Luther and the printing press and all that knowledge came out and the Reformation began. OK it wasn't as simple but that is the basic idea, for that William ideas aren't as out of place as they may seem. Also he is from Baskerville where centuries later another investigator would have a certain case with a dog ,or better a Hound if you will ;).One other fact ,which the film addresses is the power of the Catholic Church back then, which literally power over life and death and if you weren't in line with them then you were a heretic and death! To that I think Mr. Eco intentionally set the story in 1327 ,for if you a history buff like me, you definitely are familiar with a certain invent in not only European but World History, the spread of the Black Death which hit Europe in 1347, just two decades later. To put it differently this work ,is a representation of the might of the Catholic Chirch in its prime, just before the plaque came in and start its decline. If you don't like that thought , it is my speculation and my alone nothing official.All in all it is a great mystery would watching and thinking about and definitely check in out as this year marks its thirtieth anniversary!",The Name of the Rose

But the real star of the film is the library of the monastery, a labyrinthine building that is many floors high and created with stairways that seem to always lead away from where you want to go. I found the book, frankly tedious. Umberto Eco writes in a style that is very pedantic at times, and just plain confusing at others. But the story translated well to the screen, but you must be willing to exhaust a little brain sweat to get anything out of the story. Be well rested before you watch this one.",The Name of the Rose

59,emuir-1,The Novel Predates the Davinci Code by 20 years,10,13 March 2005,"A number of people have commented on the similarity of this film, and the Novel by Umberto Eco, to the DaVinci Code. For those who were not born then, The Name of the Rose was published in 1980, thus predating DaVinci by about 20 or more years. I must admit that I found DaVinci to be a mass market popularization of Eco's theme, in short a ""rip off"". Still, it may be the popularity of Brown's novel which has resulted in Name of the Rose being brought back in a DVD version, and for that I am truly thankful.For a film which was not favorably reviewed by the critics, it is surprising how many reviewers 20 years later are giving it a 10. Either the film wore well or tastes have changed. I loved the film first time around and was delighted to find it on DVD. Certainly the screenplay had to deviate from the philosophizing of the book. It would have been almost unwatchably ""talkie"" had it not, and those of us who want to read the sermons/discussions can read the book. The film stands on it's own.The most ominous feeling for me, living in the religious and politically free thinking 21st century, was the realization that the church had such a grip on every aspect of life and thinking in the middle ages, and that any perceived repudiation of accepted Church dogma was deemed heresy and punishable by torture and a horrible death. That one group of people should wield such power, and the length they would go to to hold on to that power is truly frightening. The rigid class structure where the nobility and church owned the land which the peasants worked, and supported those above them while being kept down by those above, was very well conveyed in the film. Life was short and hard, health was poor and the plague could return at any time, carrying off those who had not been carried off by the incessant wars. Not a pleasant age to live. The period of the film is set just prior to the reformation. It is hardly surprising that the teachings of the various religious orders began to be questioned.",The Name of the Rose

61,Sonatine97,Watch the movie first - don't worry about the book!,9,24 June 2000,"I have yet to read the Umberto Eco novel from where this film was adapted; and even though a lot of reviews here prefer the book I'm just a little scared to do so.The reason - well I loved the movie, even more so for Connery moving away from the Hollywood glitz & sterile movie roles.Yes I suppose the book is superior, but then most books are. Books are relatively cheap to publish; an author can drift into detail to his heart's content sprouting off hundreds of pages of discriptive without having to worry about making it very clear to the reader.Trying to adapt such a book in its full glory would mean a film lasting about 7 or 8 hours at a cost of several million dollars. But who would honestly want to sit and watch that in one session?So what we have is a watered-down version that I presume tries to keep key points from the book into sharp focus on film.Connery is a 14th century monk, turned detective, called into investigate a murder at a remote cliff-topped monestry; ably assisted by his young aide, Adso Melk (Slatter)So far so Sherlock Holmes! What we have is a crime thriller seven hundred years ago. But what makes this movie stand out is not only the visuals but also the things we don't see.The visuals are really good - most of the monks at the monestry are not pretty to look at - hunchbacks & grotesques seem to fill every room, contrasted rather nicely with the rather angelic good looks of the young Melk.But its not only the actors who are not particularly hansome, but the monestry itself - gargoles, deep caverns, rat invested tunnels & mazes; dim candle light, damp walls and an overall feeling of cold & foreboding.Connery is well suited to play the monk - no dinner suits, Aston Martin cars & admiring girls here.But Slater too, deserves a mention, for his wonderfully underplayed role of the novice monk caught up in murder, deception, torture; and of course the love of a girl!The camerawork is very good, especially the lighting. The music too helped put us in the mood for some Dark Ages detective work.So I still haven't read the book and don't feel inclined to do so. Whether I'm missing out on something I really don't care. The film mesmerised me enough that I don't feel willing to have all those moments destroyed by a book - better or for worse.****/*****",The Name of the Rose

The story is appealing and Sean Connery is as great as he can be as a medieval crime investigator. However, there are some points that go completely against reality. An anti-christ (in this film the inquisitor) is too powerful and adored by the herd, so that the people revolting against the inquisitor and toppling his car down the cliff is totally unrealistic.

65,wrxsti54,"Dark, dramatic Middle Age mystery film",8,22 October 2021,"Set in 14th century northern Italy, this dark but elaborately staged drama takes place in a Benedictine monastery, the Abbot of which (Michael Lonsdale) welcomes a Franciscan monk and scholar William of Baskerville (Sean Connery) and his young teenage novice Adso von Melk (Christian Slater). The visit soon turned into a murder investigation as Brother William is called upon for his investigative skills to figure out what lies behind a series of unexplained deaths that the Abbot is blaming on dark Satanic forces. Set at a time when the Catholic Church was at the zenith of its power under the Inquisition, monastery life is rife with superstition and rigid but often contradictory conduct by monks in monasteries.William is able to trace the murders back to attempts to cover a huge treasure trove of hidden 'heretical' books. Evil influences and deaths are easily blamed on the presence of a controversial hunchback (brilliantly played by Ron Perlman), a disobedient monk and an impoverished village girl (Valentina Vargas) caught stealing who is easily branded as a witch. It's made more complicated by the fact that she had, only days earlier, seduced the young novice in preference to the lurid old monks. After Adso confesses, William reveals his more lenient and liberal tendencies as he describes his prior involvement with the Inquisition. In the middle of this arrives the Pope's own representatives for a theological debate.Bernardo Gui (F Murray Abraham) plays the sinister prosecutor from the Spanish Inquisition and he charges and obtains convictions for heresy against all 3 and Brother Williams objections only lead to him also being charged with heresy. William escapes and reveals a venerable ultra conservative monk protecting a poisoned Greek book of humor as the source of the deaths.In a dramatic conclusion, with the three so-called heretics ready to be burned at the stake, the perpetrator tries to burn down the library and Brother William rescues books whilst Adso is instrumental in driving Bernardo to his death. The beautiful girl begs with her eyes for Adso to stay with her but he travels on with his master.Filmed in and around actual medieval monasteries in Italy and Germany, with careful attention to details of costumes and props, this dark but intense and authentic piece is enhanced by the excellent performances of several A list actors. This was the 2nd major movie for a youthful Christian Slater. One wonders how many modern parents of a 15-year-old boy would allow him to be cast in such an explicit sex scene with a 22 year old woman.",The Name of the Rose

67,KFL,It's only an illumination--it's not the text,8,29 April 2000,"As others have said, the book is far more satisfying and comprehensible than the movie. Though the movie represents a good effort, within the constraints of the medium.This story deals with books--which, in the medieval period, means the text, and the illumination (the accompanying images or decorations in the margins) meant to embellish the text. It's important not to confuse things:  the movie is only the illumination, the embellishing images. The book is the text. Seeing the movie without reading the book is almost like trying to understand a Dickens novel by looking only at the etchings which appear every 40 pages or so.As an illumination, it is less than perfect. The labyrinth in the book was only two-dimensional, and several separate events in the book are merged together in the movie. To cater to Hollywood sensibilities, a particularly vicious character meets an ugly demise, the girl is not burned after all, and the love-interest aspect is strengthened. Despite all this, anyone who has read the book will gain much from watching the movie.It is interesting that both the book and the movie end on the same quasi-nominalist note, but in quite different ways.",The Name of the Rose
68,frankgaipa,Empty Names,4,18 March 2005,"In his 1983 ""Postscript to The Name of the Rose,"" Umberto Eco alluded to the film-ability of his novel: ""Marco Ferreri once told me my dialogs are cinematographic because they last just long enough. Deliberately, when two of my characters pass, conversing, from the refractory to the cloister, I write with an eye to the floor plan, and when they arrive they stop speaking"" (my translation). Though it was a bestseller so full of intricate discussions, historical and ecclesiastical allusions, and, of course, names, that many more may have bought than read it, The Name of the Rose is intensely visual. It's both visual and claustrophobic. The overall ""set,"" the monastery, is so small, and the possibilities within it so constrained and so few, yet so full as Eco has written them, that the right filmmaker had only to follow Eco's lead.Peter Greenaway (Drowning by Numbers, A TV Dante, Belly of the Architect) comes immediately to mind, because of Eco's labyrinth and puzzles; but so does the still active ninety-six-year-old Manoel de Oliveira (The Covent, The Divine Comedy, The Cannibals), who like the late Bresson sees religious pathways where the rest of us might not. I think the Rohmer of L'Anglaise et le duc, but also of My Night at Maud's, might have been an ideal translator of Eco's discussions, while the bluntness of the story's deaths, dangerous Inquisitor Gui, and the all-consuming final conflagration might have helped answer some filmgoers' problem with Rohmer. I love against-type casting, and might surely have ""cast"" Rohmer as this violent film's director.I vaguely recall liking the film, as just another movie, in 1986. The chilly mountain monastery on the big screen must have impressed. But Annaud and his four screenwriters diminish Eco's work to Sherlock Holmes in cassocks.Early on they wrest the point of view from Adso, lazily, to show the Abbot and aides uttering expository lines. Adso, young and old all at once because he tells the story years later with the perspective of age, unreliable and maybe-reliable narrator all at once for the same reason, is as pervasive and as absent as Boswell. His experience with the peasant girl comes dead center in the novel. Everything builds to and falls from it. This is ironic, tragic, laughable or (to be gentler) comical, because it's not his story. He's telling it. He puts her there. But it's not his story. So many years later there's simply no one left to stop him putting her there. Annaud & Co. make her something other than what both Adso and William, with the cruelty of their avocation, term her, a prostitute. Adso's obsession, his repeated use of the word ""love"" based on a single wordlessly grappling experience, without so much an exchange of names, wreaks biting satire upon celibacy. The girl's repeated appearances in the film, and her beyond belief escape from Gui, destroy Eco's satire, replacing it with the worst sort of maudlin.Gui, as Eco portrays him, isn't a villain. He's more like bad weather: an unstoppable, unavoidable force. F. Murray Abraham plays him as a smooth thug who in movie cliché terms must fall. Eco dispatches him for Rome, with the Adso's doomed girl and Salvatore irrevocably in tow, before the conflagration precisely because he cannot fall.Eco's title for the book might have been ""Adso of Melk,"" but Italian publishers, he says, dislike proper names. Annaud seems to have wanted Eco's rose to be a rosebud. It's Kane's sled! It's Adso's girl! But Adso's superbly contradictory final line (I don't know Latin) is something like ""A rose gone has no name; we keep empty names.""A rose is a labyrinth. Or, the Rose here is the Labyrinth? Shadow between its petals leads to its center. Annaud & Co. diminish the labyrinthine library. The crisis it entails begins in Eco's first few pages when the Abbot, portrayed more sympathetically, and as a wiser man, than in the film, challenges that the ingenious William should be able to deduce all he needs know about the library without setting foot inside it. Even though William fails to the extent that he must eventually enter the library and even return there, how could filmmakers, movie-makers, have thrown out this wonderfully Holmesian challenge?! Peter Greenaway might have build all else upon it. The difficulty of entry and close terror of being lost inside the library barely surface in the film.Other losses: the significance of Arabic texts; the full impact of the running argument around blind Borges' disdain of laughter; any real sense of the monastery buildings' and rooms' locations in relation to each other with respect to the solving of the murders.Please don't chide me about the different demands of prose and film. I've written about them myself. When I closed ""Il nome della rosa,"" I knew I'd just read a beautiful film.I can't imagine that this will ever be remade, and maybe that's just as well. But it could and should have been more than this too-simple movie.",The Name of the Rose
69,DeuceWild_77,Masterpiece of the literary world became a master work of filmmaking !!,10,26 October 2017,"Adapting a book of more than 600 pages to the big screen wasn't a easy job, even with the collaboration of 4 screenwriters under the supervision of the 'artsy' french director, Jean-Jacques Annaud, fresh from the critical success of his previous work, ""Quest for Fire"" ('81) and even the author, the Italian novelist Umberto Eco, knew that, but he gave the approval and after 4 years of preparations, the production starts filming a palimpsest of his 1980 historical murder mystery debut novel. ""The Name of the Rose"" is a well-crafted drama / mystery / 'whodunit' film, set in the Medieval Era and telling the story of a Franciscan Friar, William of Baskerville (Sean Connery), a wise middle-age man with great power of deduction and his young novice, Adso of Melk (Christian Slater) which arrive to a somber Benedictine Abbey in northern Italy, during the wintertime, to participate in a debate with Papal emissaries about the excess of wealth in the Church. The Abbey is covered in sorrow and fear because of the recent demise of a young attractive manuscript illuminator, in a deemed unnatural way, which prompted the Brothers to suspect that was the work of the Devil. The Abbot (Michael Lonsdale) asks William for help to solve the mystery and to calm the Abbey's population before his last resort of demanding the Holy Inquisition, led by the ruthless Bernardo Gui (F. Murray Abraham), to find the guilty using their own sadistic methods...Eco's choice of naming his protagonist William of Baskerville was a clearly homage to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's mystery novel, ""The Hound of Baskervilles"" featuring his most famous creation, Sherlock Holmes and his inseparable & dearest partner and future chronicler, Doctor John Watson, here personified by the young Adso which also serves as the narrator, telling us the terrifying events which occurred in the ancient Abbey, many years later. The name William is also believed to be based on the English Franciscan Friar, William of Ockham, a Scholastic Philosopher, well known for his significant works on logic, physics and theology. He even created a methodological principle called ""Occam's razor"".Now, what more can be said about this sterling piece of art ? The direction is top notch as so are the high production values involved: the locations; the Art Direction, Set Decoration and Costume Design; the Makeup Department (where were the Oscar nominations ?), all together makes this movie experience looks and feels like we're in the Middle Age, it's probably one of the best films ever made depicting the life in the Dark Ages, the authenticity is astonishing !! The cinematography by Tonino Delli Colli is splendid, giving a visually eerie feeling and a realistic gloomy look at the secular Abbey, especially the sequences inside the labyrinthic library (amazingly designed in the Gothic architectural style by the Production Designer Dante Ferretti) that were masterfully shot. Last, but not the least, James Horner's haunting compositions embraces the viewer into the intricate mystery helping to establish the moody tone of the movie.The cast is superb, kudos to the casting director and Annaud himself for selecting some of the most unforgettable and distinctive faces ever put on-screen. Sean Connery was tailor made for this kind of role, playing the open-minded William of Baskerville who can see the light of reason in a time of blind faith. After almost a decade into oblivion appearing in lesser known films as the romantic lead, the then 55 years old (but looked a bit older) ex-James Bond, convinced Annaud that he can do justice to William of Baskerville and he did and with that career decision, Connery re-invented his screen persona in the mid to late 80's, becoming, with major success, the Mentor of the protagonist for the rest of his career (""Highlander"", ""The Presidio"", ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"", ""Family Business"" and so on...). Christian Slater at 16 years old, have here is breakthrough role as Adso of Melk, participating in a way graphic sex scene with the 22 years old actress Valentina Vargas, who shocked the censors in America and UK, but as a French / Italian / German co-production, this seemed more common, natural and harmless there. F. Murray Abraham, in his first film after he won the Academy Award for performing Salieri in ""Amadeus"" ('84), is always 'machiavellian' and 'over-the-top' playing the antagonist, and Bernardo Gui, the head of the Holy Inquisition, fits him like a glove. Michael Lonsdale, Volker Prechtel, William Hickey, Elya Baskin and Helmut Qualtinger are all outstanding in their supporting roles, but the then 81 years old Feodor Chaliapin, Jr. as the blind Venerable Jorge de Burgos and the great character actor and forever typecast in this kind of monstrous roles, Ron Perlman as the hunchback Salvatore, both stole the movie every time they're on-screen. Perlman was, criminally, snubbed from an Academy Award nomination, probably he gave the best supporting performance of 1986.The only complaint about this production is that the third act feels rushed to finish the movie and was edited in a way that breaks the unsettling pace established earlier, maybe with more half a hour the movie could have been even better and escalate to the top of the best 'whodunit' ever made.In short, what Ron Howard did, exactly 20 years later, adapting the similar themed puzzling mystery, ""The Da Vinci Code"" with a routine & by-the-numbers direction and collecting all the accolades, Annaud did it first and better, giving us a truly memorable film, a triumph in craftsmanship, misunderstood when it was released (Roger Ebert gave it a lacklustre review), but re-appreciated and re-evaluated in more recent times and occupying nowadays the podium of one of the best films that came out of the 80's decade. For fans of a great & thrilling detective story, out of the Hollywood's standards, who also makes the viewer think, this is a must-see film.Highly recommended !!",The Name of the Rose
70,Deusvolt,The book was intended as a survey of medieval culture but the film turned out to be something else.,3,7 May 2005,"Umberto Eco, the author of the book of the same title obviously intended it to be a survey of medieval culture and an exegesis of the workings of the medieval mind. To do this, he used the well-worn genre of the cloak and dagger mystery through the character of a monk who is a combination of Sherlock Holmes and Father Brown.Alas! The makers of the film obviously didn't understand the purpose of the book for it became a tawdry imitation of a Conan Doyle yarn. You would be better off watching a re-run of the classic series that starred Jeremy Brett, the best and most faithful Holmes ever. With this treatment, the plot - thin as it was - became obvious and humdrum; quite unlike in the book when you felt that the detective monk was truly up against an evil supernatural power.In any case, the pleasure of the book was in satisfying one's intellectual curiosity especially in areas of medieval theology and history. Isn't it useful to understand the cause of the splintering of the Franciscans, one of the greatest religious orders of the Church, into factions led by the Spirituals versus the Conventuals? What was all the fuss about heresies in those days? What were the differences and similarities among the Waldensians, Bogomils, Albigensians and Cathars? How were they related to the early Christian Gnostics? How did they affect art? What's the difference between the art of Fra Filippo Lippi and Fra Angelico? Who was that Fra Dolcino who led a peasants' revolt a la Spartacus? How could the professors of the University of Paris censure a Pope (John XXII) and warn him that what he was teaching was heresy (and he retracted!)? He taught that the faithful do not gain the full beatific vision upon death and will have to wait until the Last Judgment before they could see God. He got this idea from a misreading of the Apocalypse.The Benedictine monastery was presented as filthy and sloppy which was far from the way it was described in the book. After all, the monasteries were the repositories and transmitters of the civilized aspects of the ancient world which were lost to much of the known world during the Dark Ages. Even the illustrations in Eco's book show the monastery in the story as an oasis of order in a confused era.Michael of Cesena, leader of the condemned Spirituals was portrayed badly as an ineffectual fanatic, almost senile, while in the book he had a magnetic personality that attracted Adso and impressed Fra William (Sean Connery).The rollicking humor in the book was passed over too as missing was that scene in the treasury of religious relics where Fra William of Baskerville cracked a joke about the holy skull of St. John the Baptist when he was a boy.",The Name of the Rose

73,georgioskarpouzas,a comparison of two best-seller adaptations,7,18 August 2006,"The Name of the Rose was a best-seller that made Umberto Eco a household name and in Greece allowed its' publisher to launch a series of very serious commented translations of politico-philosophical classics presided by a major-now late- Greek philosopher residing in Germany. The series was a intellectual triumph and a financial disaster which led to the publishing house been bought by a competitor. This national parenthesis aside one must point out The Name of the Rose as a book was much based on dialogue while Da Vinci Code in action. In the respective movies as in the books Wiliam of Baskervill was what we now term a liberal Catholic while Sir Henry Tibing was an avowed enemy of the established Roman Catholic Church. It is a major difference and obviously had to do with the greater negative or positive appeal of the latter film given the evolution of marketing and promotion techniques from the days of the name of the rose. The age that the films refer is also all important, in the age of the Name of the Rose the Church was absolutely dominant and even its' opponents accepted its' frame of reference while nowdays the Church, despite the efforts of the late Pope, is on the defensive to say the least, especially in the the countries where movie going is a massive social phenomenon. The Name of the Rose had two definite villains in the persons of Horhe of Bourgos and the Inquisitor while Sir Henry Tibing is a villain but with a cause which the others accept despite loathing and opposing the methods used. In many aspects the films are worlds apart but the secularized tendency of modern mainstream cinema makes films with a church related theme look similar in the same way that atheism and agnosticism unite all disparate religious denominations against them and give the impression of similarity to outsiders.",The Name of the Rose

I would really like to watch this movie with good quality and in it's original aspect ratio as I can say this is a really good movie and I think maybe the bad circumstances clouded my impression a bit.Broder William of Baskerwille and his novice Adso of Melk, two Franciscan monks, have come to a Benedictine Abbey to attend a meeting with a representative of the Pope. When they arrive they learn that an unexplained death has occurred and more are soon to follow. While the other monks believe it's the work of anti-Christ, Broder William is not so sure. He and his novice start to investigate and they soon discover that there are secrets within the walls of the abbey.The story is set in 1327 and gives a pretty scary, yet true picture of life in those days. It's a well written film with a good puzzle. If you pay attention it's not hard to understand and it's not hard to keep track of the story. The characters are good. A little mysterious, but that only makes them more interesting. The voice-over are a nice touch that makes it all more personal and you get to know the character better.Sean Connery is good as William of Baskerwille. His style of and his figure as a sophisticated and wise man fits this role very good. A young Christian Slater also does a rather good job and Ron Perlman's performance is very good. His character is very special, but Perlman handle this very well. The rest of the cast is over all good.The cinematography is good. I watched it in 4:3 so the composition was not good, but if it had been 16:9 it would look good. There are some cool lightning and it's never hard to see what's going on.The score is special. There are very little music. It's clearly not an American movie. There are some score here and there and then there are the classic Gothic music and songs that the monks sing that sets the mood very nicely.This film is very realistic. The look and feel of it is very well captured and is expressed very well. It's cold and dark and the characters, story and everything else supports this very good. It's clearly not an American Hollywood-style of movie as there are no ""action"". It is also a relative slow pasted compared to Hollywood, but don't let that scare you. There are always something happening and it keeps you interested. You get caught up in the story and the characters and if you wan't to experience the dark ages this is the movie. Der Name Der Rose is a good and recommendable European move.",The Name of the Rose
80,MinorityReporter,Excellent - despite the film medium's short comings!,9,6 October 2005,"Der Name der Rose is by all means a great film. The story is an excellent mix of Sherlock Holmes-type crime thriller and religious criticism/commentary. I found this to be exceptional as the book was labeled as impossible to remake as a film and while the book is indeed better than the film, the film is certainly not without its charms.First of all the cast is pretty much perfect. Reading the book Sean Connery wasn't who I had in mind as the character but he certainly makes the character his own. His performance is for lack of a better word unique. He brings his usual indescribable something to the character which makes him almost instantly likable and believable. He delivers his lines in a confident manner that suits the character. Like in many other of his films his character is a teacher character but he does not seem to berate his pupil (Christian Slater) but allows him to grow on his own merely nudging him along. Even though not my first choice to have played the character I cannot find any other who would suit the part after seeing the film. Christian Slater plays the protagonist in what must be described as his break through character. His inexperience as an actor shows and once again suits the character who is also quite inexperienced in many ways. He portrays the change and ultimate conflicts of his character well enough and like Connery makes the character his own. Michael Lonsdale is pretty good as well and even though the character is not as well defined as in the book he provides the broad strokes in a satisfactory manner. Feodor Chaliapin Jr. does an excellent job in bringing Jorge to life and matches Connery's authority in their scenes together but once again the character is done in pretty broad strokes and you only get a small taste of what the character was like in the book. F. Murray Abraham's character is not like in the book and even though I was slightly disappointed by the film's portrayal of the character I understand why it was necessary to change the character for dramatic purposes. Ron Perlman who has since gone on to become quite a big star has a small role in this film and he does a decent job.The film thrives on its complex story (which is nowhere near as complex as in the book) and deep characterization of the main characters who are about as defined as characters can become without internal monologue. There is voice-over by the older version of Christian Slater's character but is basically only used in the introduction and end part of the film and at a few crucial moments. The fantastic characterization is also helped by the incredibly sharp and well written dialog which never gets boring or forced like you could have feared given the religious content. In many scenes the dialog was in fact so good that I got the chills. The film focuses mainly on the mystery elements but the religious elements of the film are somehow weaved into the overall plot but there were plenty more of these religious elements and factors in the book. Overall I think the film should have been at least 15 minutes longer to get more of these elements in but maybe thats just me. However, all the most important plot points (and a few sub-plots) are covered so in that sense the film is successful.Another thing that works very well is the atmosphere of the film which is very tense and mysterious. The tension is helped by the music which like so many other things in the film is quite unique and fitting. The set work is pretty simple but as it is a monastery you cannot expect the most flamboyant of sets. The sets work in their simplicity, however, and there is really no point of critique to be found in the set work. The lighting is kept at a minimum as well and once again this works in favor of the film as it adds to the overall tension. Sometimes the lighting is a little to dark but it happens so rarely that its not really a problem.All in all Der Name der Rose (or The Name of the Rose) is a wonderful film but what drags the film down ever so slightly is that it can some times feel a little rushed because of the amount of material it is covering and there were a few elements from the book I would have liked to have seen in the film. In general, however, the cross from book to film is very well done and the overall plot is very well depicted with many tense, frightening and interesting moments. The film is definitely one of Connery's best and it is mainly because of his performance that I am giving the film a 9 in stead of an 89/10",The Name of the Rose

As they debate in ""Trainspotting"" - this movie is the last glimmering star in Sean Connery movie-history, since this it has pointed downward with a few exceptions like ""The Untouchables"".This is a medieval-thriller with all the right attributes. Mystic monks, labyrinths, secret books, murderers and conspiration in all corners of the abbey.Connery is a medieval Sherlock Holmes (he even uses the fraise ""It's elementary""). But this is not a rip off. If you study the history of the book you will see that there is some reality-connections about Connery's monk ""William of Baskerville"". So to the debate...is the book better then the movie? Yes and No. If you read the book you will get the movie-title and also more of the thriller/religious part of the movie. You will better understand the actions of the monks because you are told a lot of historical facts concerning medieval catholic Europe. But the book is very long and descriptive so it is difficult reading, therefore in one sense is the movie better. It still has the mystic and nagging-notion but it never tires you.

83,barev-85094,Agatha Christie meets Sherlock Holmes at a Medieval Italian Monestary,5,29 June 2015,"THE NAME OF THE ROSE, 1986. Directed in English by French helmer Jean-Jacques Arnaud and based on the international best seller by Umberto Eco. Viewed at the 2015 Munich film festival. The year is 1327: after a mysterious death in a Benedictine Abbey, the monks are convinced that the apocalypse is coming. I saw this at some festival back then, probably Tokyo, and walked out on it early because it was so heavy and dreary. This time I sat it out, at the Gaststeig great hall in Munich, but only with effort, being tempted to walk again several times, until at last It picked up some steam after the hot copulation scene I had missed in Tokyo, between a peasant girl in heat and Connery's naive young sidekick. At the time Connery was trying to cut loose from the pigeon holing of his James Bond image and this was the first major step in such a direction. In this murky shaggy dog whodunnit mystery in a medieval Italian monastery Connery plays a Franciscan friar wrapped up in a thick wooly cloak, who is called in to investigate a strange death in a Gothic Benedictine castle. Sean has an admiring young sidekick (Christian Slater) who refers to him as ""Master"" but ends up teaching the chaste spiritual master a thing or two about carnal love between man and woman. The relationship between Sleuthing Connery and awestruck Slater is obviously derivative of, if not actually a homage to, the more secular Sherlock Holmes doctor Watson pairing. Along the way there are dark intimations of homosexual leanings by some of the creepier monks, there is a hunchback of Notre Dame clone, the only character in the film who occasionally speaks bits of Italian -- and lots of bloody grotesquery as the murders in the monastery keep piling up until the killer can't keep pushing the blame off onto the works of the devil any more. There is a big thing about banned books in a secret library -- notably one by Aristotle that the church regards as Heretical, and F. Murray Abraham following up his borderline villain role as Salieri in Amadeus with a full blown villain role here as head inquisitor Bernard Gui (Pronounced ""gooey"" and he lives up to his name in spades) -- This revival was the center piece of an Arnaud homage and retrospective, and Mr. Arnaud, now a white haired senior citizen was on hand to accept a lifetime award. The director was introduced by veteran German Actress Veronica Foss, quite a dish still at fifty. Very good English and Great legs.",The Name of the Rose
84,tom-456,Excellent theatrical rendering of a complex literary work,8,13 January 2005,"Having just finished reading Umberto Eco's excellent book, I sat and watched the movie on DVD, not once, but twice, and parts of it even more. The difficult plot of the book is preserved in the screenplay as well as can be expected, and more importantly, the dark and repressive atmosphere that was predominant during that point of the middle ages is conveyed convincingly.The complex theological underpinnings of the book are omitted, which was necessary. The major plot that remains is one that Arthur Canon Doyle would surely have liked for Sherlock Holmes to have solved, if Sherlock could have been transported back in time to the late middle ages. As William of Baskerville, an elder monk of the Franciscan order, arrives with his novice and assistant Adso of Melk, they soon learn of the recent death of a young monk of the isolated abbey, a death for which foul play of some sort seems evident. William quickly concludes that the death is more easily explained as a suicide, but that leaves unanswered the question of what would have compelled a young monk to take his own life, and why so many of the monks believe that the devil himself is at work in the abbey.A second body is discovered, with the exact cause of death being uncertain, but with mysterious discolorations found on the fingertips and tongue. When the assistant librarian subsequently turns up dead, William is able to infer, from his many astute observations, certain essential facts, the most important among them being the central role of some mysterious, coveted book. But he does not know who is responsible for the two deaths that do not seem to have been suicide, and being a learned man consumed by the passion for knowledge and a love of books, he will never be content until he has discovered what mysterious book could have led to so many deaths. He is prohibited, however, along with all of the other monks except for the librarian and the recently departed assistant librarian, by long-standing rule of the abbot, against entering the library.Soon his detective work is side-tracked by the original purpose for his visit to the abbey. A delegate of Franciscans arrive, soon followed by a delegate dispatched from Avignon by the Pope and complete with the Pope's personal Inquisitor. The trials soon commence, which are of a duplicitous nature, and which are facilitated for the convenience of the Inquisitor by the discovery of a fourth corpse. This time it is the herbalist, who was overheard whispering to William, at a time when William could not take leave of the trial, that he had discovered a strange book in the infirmary. When William arrives at the scene, the book is no longer to be found. Knowing that the monk who is accused of that murder is not guilty, William defends him openly in the trial, only to find himself accused of heresy, which is also for the Inquisitor's duplicitous purposes. The only hope that William now has is to discover the truth which is protected by the secrets of the library, and he must solve its riddles quickly, lest he end up on the pyre himself.This movie will be best appreciated by fans of the book, but anyone who has an interest of that period, or who simply likes a good murder mystery, will find this to be a very enjoyable movie, even if a second viewing is needed to sort out the players and to understand the sequence of events as they unfold. As I said, the movie is missing the theological underpinnings of the book, but the fact remains that very few movies are so successful at capturing the essence of the book from which they are derived, particularly in the case of a book as literary and complex as this one. I highly recommend this movie, and for anyone with a particular interest in the political and theological history of the period, the book as well.",The Name of the Rose

86,berberian00-276-69085,A Palimpsest on Umberto Eco's Novel,10,30 March 2016,"Umberto Eco (1932 – 2016) has been always difficult to handle. More so after he is already dead and have left a solid legacy. ""Name of the Rose"" (1986), both the novel and the film, have inspired considerable acclaim now in its 30th anniversary. Perhaps the movie guild should make an effort to prepare a new critical edition since the last release from 2004 on DVD and Blu-ray, which is good but outdated.I thought some time before writing these lines. It says in the introductory cadres of the film - a Palimpsest on Umberto Eco's Novel! Definition from Gerard Genette (1982) - ""Palimpsest examines the manifold relationships a text may have with prior texts ... In this regard it treats the history and nature of parody, anti-novels, pastiches, caricatures, commentary, allusions, imitations and other textual relations"". Wikipedia can provide further extension on this definition. This is in essence literature in the second degree!Then came the pressure of semiotics - What is it all about? I have a huge library, some 10 000 volumes that I have purchased with my pocket money for many years on a row. My selection here is with David Crystal (editor) ""Encyclopedia of Language"", where unfortunately Umberto Eco is not included as semiotician. By-and-large starting with Charles Peirce and Ferdinand de Saussure, we get here an updated scheme on Semiotics where subject matter is three-some or five-some:1. Auditory or vocal language with speech, musical effects, vocal cord physiology, etc;2. Body language or non-verbal communication with A/ Visual mode with signs and symbols, writing, kinesics; B/ Tactile mode for deaf and blind with codes, proxemics, etc;3. Olfactory and gustatory signals which is bio-semiotics and predominantly models communication in the animal kingdom.I hope that my reflections haven't hurt anyone, not least the estate of the author himself. My humble origins doesn't give me a single chance to become celebrity like Umberto Eco. I live in the fringes of Europe and my home town Sofia - although having perfect record of European residence - have been overshadowed by Turkish and Soviet populace. I don't see much future in those places and much less opportunities for science and film industry. However, future is with the young generation and people like me live on minimal retirement pension, with reflections on the past. Thank you!",The Name of the Rose

To get in some details:1)William of Baskerville is an intelect but was an inquisitor and quite harsh.When he felt some doubts about what he was doing he just quit.He was never tortured.He was never a heroe suffering to save some scribe who had a greek book.He never cares about Rose.In this movie he is also not a very good thinker.No mention in the movie of him dying in the plague between 1346-1353.No mention of his working for the emperor against the pope.2)Adso of Melk,an Austrian,had already travelled through both Germany and Italy,first alone and then in the company of William.He was not that naive as in this movie.No mention of him continuing to be a monk,a traveler and a thinker of noble origin.In the end of the book he wishes for death and oblivion.He also misses the long-dead William and the also long-dead Rose.Where is this in the movie?3)Rose got burned.Why does the movie refer to her as surviving?Adso never had the chance to decide whether to stay a monk or live with her.4)The old monk is neither stupid nor crasy.The movie never explains his way of thinking and the life he lived.5)By the way Connery doesn't look the way William should look.

A cerebral mystery, the different setting and time draws the watcher in a little deeper than your ordinary whodunit.A young Christain Slater adds emotional content to the movie as his first sexual encounter with a village girl bonds him to her, despite their class. There are secret passages, the quest for the lost tome, cloak and dagger mystery and a wide array of characters to appeal to the imagination of fans of fantasy settings. The inquisition turns up to add a little flavor and intimidation factor to the movie as Sean Connery's character has been previously tangled up with them.

90,v_haritha_in,A Rare Good Period Sleuth Picture,9,10 July 2014,"A detective story set at an Abbey in the Middle Ages. Any story based on that premise should normally have a contrived feel to it, but this movie manages to pull it off quite well. William of Baskerville (Sean Connery) and his apprentice, Adso of Melk (Christian Slater), two Franciscan monks go to an isolated Benedictine Abbey to attend some sort of a Medieval theological conference. At the same time the Abbey is plagued by a series of unnatural deaths which most of the monks are willing to pin unto the devil and a prophecy. William is unwilling to accept this explanation, and with the help of Adso, looks for a logical solution. The cinematography, production design and costumes are brilliant and help us, the viewers, see why the period was called the Dark Ages. The social ills of the time - exploitation of the poor, suppression of free thinking or any kind of descent, Kangaroo courts, harsh punishments, misogyny, etc. - are all vividly brought to life. The movie does not have a single unimportant scene and yet its length also conveys the monotony of the monastery life.Connery does justice to the role of a well-studied, devout yet reasoning monk who commands the respect of even those who are against his way of thinking. F. Murray Abraham as Berdardo Gui, the Inquisitor properly inspires hatred in us and we also see why he inspires such fear in the monks. Slater portrays the learning curve of his character pretty well. The supporting cast of monks have been chosen as much for their ugliness as their acting ability. Collectively they give a creepy and repulsive feel to the Abbey and make us pity any young/handsome monk who may have the misfortune of landing there. There are only a couple of points to nitpick on. The peasant girl who portrayed Slater's love interest should have had a few speaking lines; there was no reason why she should appear to be mute. And, the set design of the library is obviously inconsistent; there is no way the sets we see as its interior would fit into a building the size of the set we are shown as its exterior.Its is a must watch for all period movie lovers and Connery fans.",The Name of the Rose
91,DegustateurDeChocolat,Gripping Medieval Mystery Story,8,18 August 2013,"I watched this movie more than ten years ago and liked it a lot and just last week I had the chance to watch it again on TV. I thought I'd start watching it a little and then turn it off, but it was too gripping to leave it so I watched it all the way through. It's the story of two Franciscan monks, one of whom masterly played by Sean Connery, who happen to be in an abbey where mysterious killings of monks are taking place. William of Baskerville (Connery) and his pupil Adso (Slater)try to find out the truth not without difficulties, due to the opposition of the hosts monks. The cruel inquisition, led by Bernando Gui (Abraham) also investigates the mysterious killings. The plot is very well developed and there is a good pace of the story. The setting is just perfect to describe the creepy and dull atmosphere of the medieval abbey. The physical features of the monster-looking monks (see Salvatore played by Ron Pearlman) contribute, along with the darkness of the photography, to a fearsome atmosphere. The references to real history characters, described by a reliable medieval scholar like Umberto Eco, adds something more to it.",The Name of the Rose
92,burgan6203,A movie that must be watched straight from the beginning,7,2 October 2004,"I was channel surfing one evening and came across ""The Name of the Rose"" on FMC. It was about halfway over when I tuned in and I didn't have a clue about what was going on. However, I was intrigued enough by what I did see to rent it and watch it from the beginning.When all is said and done, I liked it very much. The acting was good and solid by all involved, from the charismatic Sean Connery to Christian Slater(this is the only film I've liked him in)to the ensemble cast of European unknowns.The movie also truly excelled in its depiction of a fourteenth century monastery;this probably has some of the most accurate period detail of any movie I can think of.It is incredibly dark(story and lighting both)and violent, but for those who enjoy suspenseful mystery and anyone interested in medieval church politics, ""The Name of the Rose"" is good choice.",The Name of the Rose
93,ozymandiaskingofkings,excellent,10,11 July 2006,"If Arthur Conan Doyle and St. Thomas Aquinas ever collaborated, the end result would I feel probably resemble ""The Name of the Rose"", a sort of theological thriller, which raises interesting questions about the church's purpose and dogma.If this sounds boring, then I apologise because boring its not. The film is centred around a magnificent but sinister Gothic monestary in the 12th century that is due to host a debate on the divinity of Christ between the Benedictines, Franciscans and Papal monks. However, unbeknownst to the outside world, a serial killer stalks the shadowy halls of the isolated abbey leaving a trail of dead monks with blackened fingers and tongues.Enter Brother William of Baskerville, an English monk brought in to solve the murders and determine whether, as many suspect, the devil is at work there. He uncovers conspiracy and corruption but his investigations are ground to a halt with the arrival of a fanatical inquisitor with a score to settle The first thing that strikes you about the film is how good it looks with cinematography and set design collaberating to create a claustrophobic and paranoid depiction of a monestary, the Escher-esquire library in particular is a treat and the scenes that take place there are masterfully suspenseful. The films use of striking colour and shadow is also extremely impressive, as is director Annaud's impressively complex, and at times expressionistic composition of scenes.The film's other main strength is its acting with Sean Connery in a career best role as Brother William, a man of reason in an age of madness, which he lends a deep psychological complexity and intensity to. Christian Slater is also very good as his naïve assistant whose existential angst about his purpose and his sexual awakening forms the emotional backbone of the film. The supporting cast is also excellent, a gallery of grotesques on whose faces you can literally see the corruption, from the sinister abbott to the fanatical venerable and hunchbacked heretic Salvatore. The only exception is F Murray Abraham, who hams it up cringingly as the inquisitor without revealing much about the characters inner drives.Overall, this is a beautiful, intelligent and thought-provoking film which questions the authority of the church far more effectively than potboilers like the ""Da Vinci Code"".

The always excellent Sean Connery has the lead as Brother William of Baskervilles, scholar, teacher and sleuth, with the youthful Christian Slater doing a fine job as his novice and ""Watson"", Adso.I remember getting into a discussion with the person I first saw the movie with about Ron Perlman's supporting character, the slow, multi-lingual (usually in one sentence) hunchback monk Salvatore. He was not only able to make the character sympathetic/pathetic even though he was not likable but also interesting enough to inspire conversation. (Spoiler: when Salvatore, now mentally ""gone"" after a night of torture, is tied to the stake to be burned, and the fire is light, he actually casually leans over and tries to blow it out, very child like, it's obviously not really registering to him what's about to happen.

96,nbwritersinbox,Powerful Historical Drama - With An International Flavor,8,27 July 2011,"On the face of it, the bleak setting of an abbey mired by poverty and corruption in the 12th century does not have much going for it.A combination of strong cast and Umberto Eco saves the day. Writing of this quality and depth is rarely translated with such skill to film. The clash of competing ideologies, a fanatical brand of religious superstition on one hand, in direct conflict with rational logic on the other, makes for compelling cinema.Whether or not, such a progressive rationalist as William Of Baskerville could have existed in the early Dark Ages is open to question. Since the story hinges on this supposition, one has to be forgiving, because the result is riveting drama.Many strong performances make the film highly entertaining, not least, Ron Perlman's outstanding portrayal of the rat-catching, heretical hunchback. Connery is convincingly solid, as is Murray Abraham as a fearsome ""Inquisitor"".Due to a graphic ""kitchen scene"", one would have to class Name Of The Rose as adult historical drama, rather than an atypical Hollywood movie. Of its type, its one of the best I've seen.",The Name of the Rose
97,metaphor-2,It doesn't get much better than this.,10,16 April 1999,"A murder mystery set in a medieval monastery, this film manages to be intriguing, amusing, thrilling and terrifying.It was adapted from the first novel by the Italian semiotician Umberto Eco, a book concerned with the monopolization of knowledge.  Eco approached this subject by concocting a series of mysterious deaths that occur in an isolated monastery, which eventually prove to revolve around a small coterie of disobedient monks who are partaking of a forbidden book.  This leads to the discovery of the monastery's great secret, a vast hidden library where the knowledge of the ages is being allowed to rot away by authorities who hoard the books on the paternalistic justification that the knowledge they contain is too dangerous for ordinary people to possess.  The library is a vast maze, and being lost in it is one of the novel's central episodes. (The maze theme, and particularly the library-as-maze, is one Eco shares with Jorge Luis Borges, and it feels here almost like the baton passed from one marathon-runner to the next.)    It is a novel filled with the love of books themselves, and dressed in a stunning evocation of one of the bleakest periods in the intellectual history of the last 2000 years.Jean Jacques Annaud's masterful adaptation of this book wisely retains some of the novel's elements, and transmutes others into terms far better suited to the medium of film.  Annaud creates the milieu of the monastery, bleak, dank, claustrophobic, almost drained of life, brilliantly.  (This film is the only way I'd ever want to visit a 13th century monastery.)  The suppression of individualism that is part and parcel of this monastic life is the obvious outward expression of the mindset that would suppress the product of centuries of human thought and writing.  Into it he brings William of Baskerville, excellently cast and wonderfully played by Sean Connery... a man who appears to be a monk solely because it is the only occupation in which he had the opportunity to study and exercise his mind. An obvious pre-cursor to Sherlock Holmes, William believes his eyes and ears, even when they contradict doctrine and the Official Line.  He is brought in by the Abbott to explain deaths and quiet the rumors... before the impending visit of a notoriously ruthless official of the Inquisition. To the Abbott's great dismay, William dismisses an easy explanation and instead seeks to unravel the mystery.  And coming ever closer is hovering threat of The Inquisition, which is eventually embodied on screen by the sinister F. Murray Abraham.Where Annaud's film departs from the novel is in shifting the emphasis away from ""the suppression of books"" as the central theme.  It remains a powerful symbol, but it is not required to stand on its own for the idea behind it. It is touched on in a wonderful scene where William first enters the library/maze and realizes what's hidden there, books he's heard legends of and longed to read his whole life, and he becomes totally giddy with the joy of this discovery.  But the seduction of the maze, the high-point of the novel, is a distinctly literary effect, and Annaud and his writers shrewdly perceived that it would be rather flat on screen.Instead, they center on the suppression of Free Thinking by the Inquisition, and the ruthless forms of terrorism employed to intimidate the ""useful"" minds into staying in their place, and thinking only what they are told. The human drama of the flames of the Inquisition ""read"" far more effectively on film than the intellectual drama of the imprisoned books, and that is driving force that makes the film, in its own medium, every bit as effective as the book.In all, this film is an entertainment for the mind as well as the senses, filled with remarkable performances an indelible visions.",The Name of the Rose
98,csjintn,One of my favorite films of all time!!!!,8,29 March 2005,"THE NAME OF THE ROSE is a classic who-dunnit with great performances from all and a terrific script based on the 600 page book by Umberto Eco. The book was a tedious read but engrossing never-the-less. The film version focuses on the salient portions of the book. The battle between the rigid and narrow mindedness of the Inquisition and the free spirits who wanted to learn other things outside the church but still focus on these things as a part of the church. Enter William of Baskerville(Sean Connery), a sort of Sherlock Holmes for the 1300's, and his novice Adso of Melk(Christian Slater), a sort of young version of Dr. Watson. The two enter the Abbey at the request of the Abby's leader(Michael Lonsdale) to investigate the strange deaths occurring at the Abbey. What follows is not only a very sharp and crisp mystery but a film about the differences in the church. It asks very good questions about faith, commitment, and love. Is it possible to enjoy things outside the confines of the House Of God and still be a faithful servant of God. The performances are rock solid and the direction is methodically steady and driving. This is accompanied by a positivley gorgeous score by James Horner. This is one of his very best scores he's ever done. It is available (or was) on Virgin of France label. But if you get a chance to see this film........ SEE IT! **** out of 4.",The Name of the Rose
99,palaste,Not for the faint-hearted!,10,7 January 2002,"If you are going to watch this movie seriously, you must prepare to be quite stressed at some points. This is definitely not for casual viewing.The movie is set in a medieval monastery where some mysterious character is murdering monks one by one. Add to that the absurd life these monks live - the Church is an authority with absolute power, new ideas are banned - and the setting is really intense.Sean Connery (in his later years) plays the British monk William Baskerville, who has been invited as a guest from another monastery to solve the murder mystery. He and his assistant Adso Melk turn out to be the only sane characters in the entire movie.The movie is based on a book by the contemporary researcher and columnist Umberto Eco. Even though the book (and the movie) appear to be a serious picturing of medieval life at first, I couldn't help thinking Eco intended the story to be a satire of the absurdity of blind Church worship. (**SPOILER ALERT** Particularly satirical is the scene near the end where the revered Jorge publically admits that there is no new knowledge at all, but only the old knowledge must be repeated.)This movie might change your view on certain aspects of life after first viewing. If you think you can handle it, by all means give it a go.",The Name of the Rose
100,budad2007,a movie gem that's ageless,10,21 January 2015,"One of my favorite films, I have crossed paths with allot of film buffs that have this film on their shelf, out of all the films I claimed to be the best they have fallen off over the years but this one remains in the same spot, to me this is because it is so immersed in its setting. the characters and supporting characters have a purpose and you could almost understand their life story by looking at them, everything has a lived purpose about it and is weighed to the world it represents. Flawless, this film should be in every film school and studied with a close eye.The film has gotten allot of attention on release, but unlike allot of films that fall to the side and time beats them into submission. if you have not seen it, go out and do so. A stand out film that has a pulse",The Name of the Rose
101,redrawn,Great film,8,29 January 2013,"Sean Connery leads a great cast in this visually beautiful adaptation of Umberto Eco's best selling novel.A myriad of themes are interwoven into this wonderful mystery movie, as Sean Connery's Sherlock-ian monk unravels the mysterious deaths occurring in the abbey.Wonderfully shot, the film makes great use of its mountain landscapes and the beautiful architecture of the abbey. The production is admirable, their costumes and props are all very realistic, and the lighting is some of the best put to film. Jean-Jacques Annaud's camera is patient and restful, lending a very naturalistic air to his film and letting us comfortable bask in the medieval setting.Moments of humour abound, amidst the gore, sex, and ignorance. This helps break up the mystery, and the evil forces at work, giving us moments of rest and igniting our modern view to highlight the themes of hypocrisy and the primitive ideas of these simple folk.Of particular note is Ron Perlman who performs with great sympathy, humour, and disgust as an outcast hunchback. Of equal note is F. Murray Abraham, whose powerful voice, is put to effective use as a villainous inquisitor. Christian Slater is fine as the young monk, filled with naivety and exuberance. Sean Connery is good in the lead and puts in a fine performance.Except for a few editing issues and an abrupt sexual liaison, the film is masterfully put together and an eighties treasure; one of Sean Connery's last great films, and a marvellous European production.",The Name of the Rose
102,alone_onthebeach,The Name of The Rose,8,23 January 2011,"I saw this movie three times and I was really disappointed that I didn't get to see it in the cinema. It was brilliant at depicting what life was like in those old centuries. It doesn't pull any punches. Life then was more unfair and The Name of The Rose just showed it so. Conditions was vile and filthy and people were poor (from my readings etc) and The Name of The Rose brought it back to live quite well.It was cruel, it has twists. It makes me quite sad tho'. It was a love story, but it was a sad one. The final parts were heart-breaking and tells of untold and powerful sacrifice.I was small when I first saw it, I didn't think it was suitable for me back then. Then, I wish it ended differently. In 1994 when I saw it again, I still hoped it ended kinder and when I saw it again alone in a darkened room on my large-screen television in Nov 2010, it still breaks my heart and I still crave for a gentler end.",The Name of the Rose

The movie does a very good job in depicting the atmosphere of the book however.The movie is set in medieval times, and almost everything happens within a monastery; a micro-cosmos so to speak.This movie is interesting on a lot of levels. I really like the cinematography, the whole scenery adds to the threatening atmosphere that is constantly present, while at the same time it is at times really beautiful. A lot of story lines are running in parallel.This movie is still interesting after seeing it many times. Highly recommended!",The Name of the Rose
104,mobile707,Noble Effort; Partial Success,7,7 August 2005,"This movie has several undeniable strengths; probably the most notable of which is the thorough and convincing manner in which the viewer is transported into the 14th century. Like ""Black Robe"" (set in 17th century Quebec) the film has created with amazing success a world with which no living person has any direct familiarity. Most of the acting is magnificent; even young Slater is somewhat credible. Sorry to say, much as I respect the talent of F. Murray Abraham-- and I respect his talent enormously-- I thought his scenes were a tad overplayed, especially where he is interrogating Qualtinger/Brother Remigio at the ""trial."" It must be said that some of the plot-developments simply do not come across with much sense. For instance, the young monk's motive for committing suicide before Connery & Slater arrive is never really explained. For that matter, the reason for Connery's arrival is not really explained either. Evidently he is to participate in some way in the forthcoming negotiation between the Franciscans and the delegation from the Vatican, but this is not made clear.Most frustrating of all is the question of why-- if this infamous book of Aristotle is so damned ""dangerous"" in the eyes of Brother Jorge (played by Chaliapin)-- he allows certain monks to see it, and why he doesn't he just privately destroy it, since hardly anyone else is even aware of its existence. Of course, at the climax, he begins eating the poisonous pages, but surely he's had years and years in which he could have eliminated the book with less drama-- not to mention with minimal consequences to his own health.The character of Ubertino (played by William Hickey) baffled me. I never quite figured out why he was included in the story, least of all why-- if he is a ""heretic"" hiding from the pope-- he should come to the abbey just before the arrival of Father Gui. And why-- since he *has* chosen to come-- he can't simply hide somewhere on the grounds.",The Name of the Rose
105,esm97,good movie,8,21 May 2006,"I will not say much about this movie, there are plenty of well written reviews about it here in IMDb. This is a great movie, seeing it is inspiring me in buy the book on which the movie was based on as some people said the book is even better than the movie. The acting of Sean Connery is impeccable as always, we can see a very young Cristian Slater, and some other performances that are very well done like Ron Perlman as Salvatore and Helmut Qualtinger(r.i.p). I didn't like the performance of Cristian Slater as Adso, I thought at first that probably because of his little experience as a young actor, but checking his filmography I can see he already had several TV series and a couple of films in his resume. Anyway I'll recommend everyone to see this movie.8 out of 10.",The Name of the Rose
106,lingerer-1,Many shiny elements but rough around the edges...,7,11 November 2010,"I remember first seeing this movie when I was about 13 or 14 sometime in the early 9-ties. I then was somehow weirdly attracted by the grim, mystic medieval atmosphere, the setting and the characters, without properly understanding what it all was about. And one scene cut deeply into my memory then ;). You know, the one with the girl...Since then, every time I thought about ""The name of the rose"" (the movie) I felt a strange attraction to it, thinking about how I should re-watch it or, probably even better, read the book. It's almost a mystery to me that it took me over 15 years to do that, until a few days ago. I bought the book and read it. I was so hooked by it, I still think about it a lot. It's a masterpiece. With the book still in fresh memory, the movie had some pretty large shoes to fill. The scenery is chosen extremely well, I actually can't imagine a better one. The monastery feels very authentic, the Aedificium in particular. It's inner labyrinth, the library, is also presented nice, different from the book but it works well on screen. The casting is excellent for most of the characters, though some, in my opinion, like Malachias and Bernard Gui don't seem to completely fit. The former is visually portrayed too cartoonish for my taste while the latter's accent doesn't fit in (Gui was French, not British). The issue with the accent only sticks out because the rest of the voice work is done so well. The different accents in combination with the many obscure and memorable characters (Berengar, Salvatore, etc.) capture the social complexity in the monastery well. The best of the cast, is (ofcourse) Sean Connery. This role seems to have been written specially for him, he IS William from the book. The young Christian Slater fits the role of his young apprentice also great. The already mentioned scene with Slater and the girl is one of the most erotic I ever saw on screen.What falls flat in the movie is the feeling of the political/theological complexity and tension described in the book. At times it feels like the cast simply is too small, most obvious in the conference between the papists and the Franciscans. The metaphysical dimension described in the book, the human indistinguishability between good and evil, between right and wrong doesn't even try to rise in the movie. Consequently, the movie lacks depth. The script further feels stitched together most of the time and it doesn't always seem logical (this doesn't really matter if you read the book, though). The acting, while good most of the time, isn't consistent throughout the movie. Some scenes should have been given a second or third take.The story (novel), the characters and the setup of ""The Name of the Rose"" build the fundament for an intelligent, intriguing and memorable thriller. The experience is diminished by a (at times) sloppy screenplay, that introduces a few conveniences too much. Depth is traded off for something that almost feels like a happy ending. None the less, it will stick with you, if you liked it or not. There just aren't (m)any movies comparable to it even 25 years later...",The Name of the Rose
107,Lebech,Detective novel set in middle age monastery,9,17 July 2000,"Eco's detective novel set in a middle age monastery has long been one of my favorite books of the 20th century. Combining a complex crime story with the intricacies of the complex political situation in medieval Europe, postmodern philosophical reflections about the nature of truth and limits of reason, and a love story on top, the novel holds your attention from start to finish despite its complexity and numerous quotes (in Latin - translated in the back) and notes. The historical details about the political situation in the middle ages are quite accurate, when I studied history some years ago, the book was a favorite among several of my professors of medieval history.The movie adaptation is not bad and probably could not have been done much better without distorting the story, but it cannot live up to the book. Basically, the philosophical and to some extent the political parts of the book are left out and what is left is the detective story which is somewhat simplified, although probably not enough for people who have not read the book - this is probably the reason for Maltin's negative view of the movie. This is a general problem for movie adaptations, but often the adaptations make up for it in other ways. If you have read the book, it is very nice to put pictures on the places and faces on the characters in the book and watch the action in the way that only a movie can show it. The plot is quite close to the book, so you can use your knowledge from the book when you watch the movie. If you haven't read the book, you have to watch the movie very closely (or watch it twice) to keep tract of all the murders and characters.Generally, the movie is very enjoyable, and is highly recommended, especially if you have already read the book. I would give it 9 stars out of 10.",The Name of the Rose

I searched the net for DVD unsuccessfully & recently I managed to get a VHS from a store & I watched it at least half a dozen times since I bought it.

110,SithApprentice,Nearly flawless masterpiece,9,2 October 2005,"""Der Name der Rose"" takes us back into a Benedictine monastery in the year 1327 a.d. One of the monks dies under mysterious circumstances, and the Franciscan monk William of Baskerville and his apprentice Adso of Melk are asked to investigate the matter. While more and more monks are being murdered, which leads some to the conclusion that the apocalypse is near, William is slowly discovering the truth behind the terrible murders, revealing corruption and perversity going on in the monastery. But William must find the truth quick, as the infamous inquisitor Bernardo Gui is sent by the Vatican to investigate the incidents, and he is well known for acting mercilessly... I haven't read the novel the movie is based on, but nevertheless, ""Der Name der Rose"" is an outstanding movie with few to none flaws. But what makes this flick so great? Above all, it's the fact that we get a historically accurate and shocking glimpse at the circumstances in medieval monasteries. There's nothing holy or in the name of God; most of the monks are ignorant or perverse. Then, of course, the actors in this one are magnificent, with Sean Connery shining throughout the movie and proving that he is one of the greatest actors alive; he brings the intelligent yet arrogant William of Baskerville to life. But one has to give the other actors credit as well, especially those playing the almost insane monks (Berenger, anyone?). Yet it is sad to see what has happened to Christian Slater: in this one, he shows that he indeed is a talented actor, but today he ends up in crap like ""Alone in the Dark"". The storyline is very intriguing (yet I don't know how faithful it is to the book), thanks to a great script and the film's perfect pacing. There's no scene that feels too long or too short; and the slower paced scenes are in perfect balance with the faster and more intense sequences. The movie also takes its time to introduce and deepen the characters. This, along with a dark and fascinating mood and a fitting soundtrack, creates an atmosphere that sucks you into the storyline. Honestly, I can't think of any flaws in ""Der Name der Rose"". Congratulations, Monsieur Annaud. You have created a masterpiece.",The Name of the Rose
111,Tomas_T,Intriguing murder-mystery from the middle ages.,7,24 March 2013,"1986 film adaptation from Umberto Eco's best-selling novel, The Name of the Rose, is a witty murder-mystery film bound to leave a permanent impression.Name of the Rose begins with a Franciscan monk William of Baskerville (Sean Connery) arriving to a religious convention with his apprentice Adso of Melk (Christian Slater). What was supposed to be a peaceful theological gathering at Italian monastery soon takes a turn for the worse as monks start to die under mysterious circumstances. While others seek a more divine explanation for the deaths, William of Baskerville being a man of reason resolves to more earthly investigation techniques to explain the events.William of Baskerville as a character is a satisfying combination of legendary investigators like Sherlock Holmes and Hercule Poirot, with a little religious twist which makes him unique, and I could think of no better match to portray the character than Sean Connery with his gentlemanly charm. From the directing perspective, French director Jean-Jacques Annaud's realistic directing style and his brutally honest depiction of middle age monastery life and its downright grotesque people and oppressive atmosphere might put off some viewers, but I found it a nice change from modern day Hollywood cleanliness.The film does have a rather slow start but thankfully the intensity picks up around half way to the film as the murder mystery plot deepens. Also could not ignore some of the abrupt scene changes with the film which seemed bit out of place and tell of less than perfect transition from novel to film, but these were minor glitches and nothing great enough to hinder the film's overall resolve.The Name of the Rose is not an easygoing film but I urge everybody to give it a try as it has a terrific cast, involving story and its out of mainstream directing style provides a realistic peek into one of the darkest time periods of mankind's history.",The Name of the Rose
112,IvanKaramasov,Great film based on a great book,9,17 January 2006,"I remember this film made a huge impression on me when I first saw it in the cinema almost 20 years ago. I think I watched it three times in a couple of months. Recently, I purchased the DVD and my memory did not prove me wrong, the film is still great. It is a quite free adaption of Umberto Eco's novel, and if you have just recently read it, you may be irritated by all the deviations from the story of the book. But it is important to remember that to fit a 600-page, quite academic novel into a two-hour movie one just have to make adjustments. In fact, I have to admit that I think the movie is superior to the book. The book is very good indeed, but to my taste slightly too dry. The movie is perhaps more ""shallow"", but it has a totally unique atmosphere and an exciting plot. Sean Connery does one of his best, if not the best, role as a combination of Sherlock Holmes and a medieval philosopher. Very entertaining indeed! If you buy the DVD, the extra material is almost as interesting as the movie itself. The almost two-hour interview with the director Annaud is very inspiring, and he really comes over as almost a renaissance man. Very thoughtful, yet energetic and with a real purpose to his work. I remember when I first saw the movie, that I felt I had never seen any movie which so convincingly pictured life in the middle ages.

And his face reminds you James Bond so you've got a clean modern person playing a poor monk who is wandering around according to his Franciscan order. He didn't persuade me. I think a lean ascetic figure would be more appropriate. Christian Slater was talentless. He ruined the film. The second roles were too exaggerated. But the biggest mistake is the motive behind all those killings. At that time around 1300 AD when most monks didn't know to write or read who would murder all those people for a Greek book that is supposed that scandalised the monks to laugh? I saw the film and I was expecting at the end that a big secret would be revealed, a great intrigue.

Although it says USA the film is thoroughly European which explains the bad US reviews, because unfortunately the Americans have yet to make a good medieval film. The only other new and good medieval film I know of is the Reckoning, with William Dafoe and Betthany. A film about the middle ages requires outstanding realism and grittiness. The faces and characters in this film are superb, the book is obviously much better but its quite different. Essentially the book is a microcosm of the entire 14th century, whilst the film is necessarily focused more on the detective murder mystery and love storyline which only actually represents half of the book.

Umberto Eco, who specialized in semiotics, must have been familiar with the ideas of Jacques Derrida, when he wrote ""The Name of the Rose"", which puts forward the (subversive) ideas of poststructural deconstruction. Jacques Derrida in ""Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences"" claims that history in terms of structure must be thought of as a series of substitutions of center for center. Both Derrida and Eco recognize the lack of centered structure as necessary to allow unlimited interpretation. There has to be confusion and destruction of the abbey, which has represented a center haven for truth-seeking (epitomized in Jorge of Burgos who eats pages of the Aristotle manuscript in order to protect and preserve his notion of purity). William of Baskerville is presented as the charismatic intellectual who espouses Scholasticism in an attempt to understand reality from the viewpoint of a human being. The philosophical aspects of Scholasticism were not dictated strictly by a set of theological dogmas but rather worked with both faith and reason. However, both dogmatism imposed by the holy inquisition and contentious Thomism are subject to elimination as subversive forces constantly threaten the established frameworks: (homo)sexuality, irrationality, doubt. The Aedificium and the monastery are destroyed by fire. Without the commotion, Adso may have received a definitive response.

The self-flagellation by Savaltore is an image which stays in mind till today.

That's the only thing I thank Annaud's film. When I read the book, I became a fan of Umberto Eco, and later on I bought some more books written by him. The novel is obviously too long to fit in a standard movie format, and I'm aware of that fact. You can't reach the depth of the plot that Eco has written if you want to make a commercial film. But the thing that I don't understand is: for God's sake, why did Annaud had to change the end of the novel??? If you want to make a fairy tale with a happy end, go and make some Cinderella film and leave a good book just like it was written. It's a pity, because until the final scenes, the movie's alright. It's very respectful of Eco's novel, it's filmed in beautiful locations and it's got a lot of great actors (Connery is wonderful, as usual) and an beautiful actress (yes, just one actress). But the final... well, it is the actual spoiler of the film.",The Name of the Rose

INSTEAD, WATCH FIRST THIS WONDERFUL FILM AND THEN, GO TO THE BOOK",9,8 September 2018,"The name of the rose, is one of the most refined thriller-films you will ever see. Every single role is well played. Sean Connery is flawless here. His character, William of Baskerville, is one of the most inspiring ones of all times: elegantly arrogant, but so humble when confronted to the possibilities of science and reason. The way Jean Jaques Annaud depicted the medieval times is flawless. Also, the director took the time to give us every single line and scene to display the right spins at the right time. It is not like the book... but once you think how to put such a big bestseller in a movie, you would realize that Annaud did a great great job. Besides telling the story of a series of crimes in an abbey, the film also takes you back to the fundamentals: who decides what knowledge is; how access to information shapes us even these days; what is education and how is that different from alienation?... If only everyone of us had a teacher or a mentor just like William of Baskerville, life would be so much more difficult and at the same time so much more fulfilling!! That guy, if he actually existed, was born in the wrong time. Watch this wonderful film!!!! Then go to the book. I can guarantee you that you will begin an adventure... going through Umberto Eco´s great work. May be the only mistake that the film makes comes to the very end when it kinda suggests why the movie is called The name of the rose. Paradoxically it shows the very last line of the book in latin: ""The ancient rose remains by its name, naked names are all that we have."" Or better said: all that is left from a rose is... its name.",The Name of the Rose

The period is pre-enlightenment when the only books in the land (Italy) are owned by the different denominations of the Catholic faith. Inquisitions are the order of the day and the atmosphere of mistrust and misrepresentation which accompany such a fragile state, is expertly realised.Enter Sean Connery playing a Sherlock Holmes (`Elementary my dear Wat-shun') from the dark/middle ages, replete with a magnifying glass of sorts and a recognisable system of logical deduction. The story is a fine balance of complexity (easy enough to follow, but not too simplistic) with the inclusion of a number of sub-plots to keep it all ticking along nicely. The acting is very good but what makes it stand out is its evocation of another era, which is reproduced with authority. Highly enjoyable.",The Name of the Rose

I'm historian, and this was one of the few historical movies i've ever seen that really portraits history well. I didn't find much to complain about that. However, as a huge fan of the book, i find the end of the movie very frustrating. It was made way too happy. In Eco's novel there was a real hell on earth in the end, now we have this Hollywood fairytale. I'm not surprised that after this, Eco didn't like the idea of any other of his books converted to movies. So, in comparison to original book, i give it 5 out of ten. My bottom line is: Good movie, very bad translation from the book. I give it 7, because its a good compromise.",The Name of the Rose

One of Connery's best performances. Excellent performances by the supporting cast, Christian Slater, William Hickey, and a host of others, many European.Even more relevant today, 2006, as we are in the midst of a struggle with enlightenment versus adherence to strict religious dogma, the West vs. Islam, particularly with respect to the lack of a sense of humor.Students of history will feel the pain of the loss of the library of Alexandria.A great movie for the thoughtful.

But the whole movie was basically a rehash of standard mystery and period film fare.  Although I enjoyed figuring out who, how, and why, it made the film seem to drag on with gratuitous sex and violence.-spoilers follow- This is the type of film that would be a decent movie were it not for the forcible insertion of a love story, which seemed so unrelated to the plot of the movie and so underdeveloped that it was more of a distraction. Perhaps they needed to reaffirm the heterosexuality of some monks.  Perhaps they wanted to give this movie some wider appeal.  Perhaps they needed to find some way to make this movie's title make sense.I mean, geez, call it something else, please.  The movie is about murder, laughter, repression, the Inquisition, religion.

136,treeherder,(Contains SPOILER ) Information is Power,10,10 September 2005,"Eco's story starts with a 100+ page immersion in medieval thinking patterns and conceptual themes, from the mind of Adso of Melk, now aged, but remembering a striking adventure in his youth. The film immerses us in the historic sense of those times, but without the conceptual themes.Something lost and something gained, however. Starting with a 10 stars out of a possible 10 story, the film honors what it can, acts out what it cannot honor, and transacts what it can't act out. It's hard for me to say whether this is a better film or a better book, it's so close.The control of information is the representative theme .. the collection of information in a tower of power, the library in the fortress-monastery that is lost nameless in time. The political wheelings and dealings, the lust for information, the self-abasement to satisfy the goal of acquiring hidden knowledge ... all among the monks who are supposed to have the highest of ideals.Laughter is the focal point of the drama .. whether Christ ever laughed and whether laughter is divine or satanic, good or evil .. and the hidden knowledge that is lusted after is related to the lost volume of Aristotle's Poetics, On Comedy. The !? last extant copy !? of On Comedy is housed in this monastic library .. and someone has decided that anyone who reads this work must die .. that anyone who knows, with certainty, that the work exists, must die. Why? Because Aristotle is such a powerful intellectual figure that the monks who read his thoughts in On Comedy will be unable to make the ""right"" choice and reject his arguments. (The murderer, of course, is able to see right through Aristotle's error in this case ...)Should it ever be the policy that ""the information must be kept out of the hands of the common people""? (Although in The Rose, the monks, in their time, were likely in the 99th percentile of education.) One last thematic issue is the nature of libraries themselves .. no matter how much you try to ""make the materials accessible"" .. there must be gatekeepers and guardians: to keep out the rats, to keep out the ruffians, scalawags and Visigoths, etc.The library at Alexandria .. the greatest collection of knowledge of ancient time .. burned.

All is very good here, 1.) the stellar cast (the aging Connery at his most charismatic and witty, Christian Slater as his innocent apprentice, Murray Abraham as the unforgiving grand inquisitor, Ron Perlman in a fantastic work as the multilingual jester monk Salvatore, but also the supporting actors: Helmut Qualtinger,Volker Prechtel, Elya Baskin,Michael Habeck play all very rememberable, unique characters, also Valentina Vargas´ raw take on ""the rose"" that gained her immediate fame). 2.) the perfect pacing keeps one spellbound also after repeated watching, 3.) the brooding mood and gloomy scenery, 4.) great dialogue.",The Name of the Rose
139,glenn-232,A great great movie,10,24 May 2007,"The Name of the Rose is a perfect example of what a great movie should be. It should take you to places you've never been before and it should enlighten you in some way while providing an intriguing story, excellent characterization and ... oh yes, it certainly helps if the director is able to pull off something unique that hits you in the core of your gut and makes you ponder about life and your place in the scheme of things.That's a lot to ask, but it usually determines whether I'm going to savor the experience and repeat it regularly and The Name of the Rose fits the bill.Sean Connery is still the best of all Bonds, especially in those first three Bond movies that were meaningful, but his performance as William of Baskerville is so perfectly executed, (spoiler warning) it almost takes your breath away when he steps out from the disaster of the abbey, smoke pouring from his robes, a look of triumph tempered with an overwhelming sense of relief at having preserved at least a small portion of the knowledge that had been so long repressed as the books fall from his loving grasp and plop down around him. It's all about the books and what they represents. This is one of my favorite scenes of all time among a couple of others from this movie.The rest of the cast seem to fit their roles about as well as if they were really the people they're portraying. Even a young Christian Slater is perfectly hesitant, unsure and timid, but fearless in the end having lived through and survived the nastiness of the Inquisitors and matured rapidly in the process.I prefer movies that make me think, they are the ones that have lasting value. Sure, a screwball comedy or action flick is a nice escape from time to time, but this type of movie, with its historical background, fascinating cast of characters and an intriguing, unpredictable story does more to justify the pastime of sitting still and watching a moving picture.I can understand why lots of people would have a difficult time with The Name of the Rose. Perhaps age, experience and whether you're a reader of books will determine how much you appreciate what's going on in this movie and why it's so powerful. It's not important to have read the book or not, having done both, it's a much easier ride watching the movie than reading the book. In this case, best to see the movie first and read the book afterward.This a movie that has remained on my top ten favorite list for a long, long time and I pull it out regularly and watch it just to appreciate why it was made in the first place even though I'm sure that puts me in a relatively small group when compared to the audience for most movies.",The Name of the Rose
140,rokkein,i think there may have been a misunderstanding...,4,18 June 1999,"wow. so i read the book before i watched the movie (i am biased). in general, many adaptations of novels into film become watered down, distorted, and in many other ways 'hollywoodized'. name of the rose< is one of these films.it must be a daunting task to capture the brilliance of an eco novel on film. so, maybe one decides to interpret artistically the novel on film; eco wrote a book to be read, not to be seen and so a film is granted certain allowances in its translation. perhaps one uses the inherent qualities of film in the way eco uses intellectual discussions (or whatever), leaving the plot as common ground between the two. but this film is mind boggling in its lack of attention to detail -- its glossing over of plot elements in the novel. seemingly important points are never discussed, the characters are not developed. for instance, i felt the initial sequence in the novel regarding brunellus [the horse] was rather important in establishing william as an intellect, but we see nothing of this in the movie. we just get some guy and his novice. bizarre.so, i dont know. all i can suggest is read the book; its much better. watch the film if you are curious (like i was), but ... well, you will see for yourself.",The Name of the Rose

142,Miss Sophie,Fantastic even after the sixth time!,10,31 December 2000,"I've just seen the movie for about the sixth time in my life an I'm still simply fascinated. It's one of my favourite movies and the best one, I think, of Sean Connery. He is a great actor and simply marvelous especially in the scenes at the end when he is in the burning library and tries to save some of the books. The whole film creates an really medieval atmosphere and although nobody can be sure how life in the 14th century has been, this film shows how it COULD have been. There has been a lot of discussion if the film is better than the the book or vice versa but I think it's very hard to compare film and novel. I love Eco's novel most for it's philosophical parts but the film is mostly a whodunnit set back in the middle ages. There are a lot allusions that refer to the themes in the book (like the discussion about laughter) but they don't play an important role in the film. But perhaps you must have read the book to understand the title of the film and the novel. Umberto Eco is interested in nominalism and this plays an important role in the story. ""The Name of the Rose"" means, that the names of the roses stay alive although the rose itself does no longer exist. In the film the rose stands for the girl although Adson never got to know her name. I think it means that he still remembers her although he doesn't know if she is still existing or what had happened to her. She has become a symbol for him which leads back to the other interest of Umberto Eco: semiotics. He said that he chose the titel because the rose is a symbol for many, many things, so you can interpret it in many ways.",The Name of the Rose
143,mightymariner,"Flawless book, almost flawless film",10,18 August 2003,"I've been enjoying films for 20 years now, and this is the first comment I've put on any film website.  I've always had the mickey taken out of me for loving this film, and it's right up there amongst my favourites of a very eclectic bunch.  Why?  Well, firstly and I have to say, very importantly, it's taken from the finest piece of modern literature I've read.  Umberto Eco's novel has such mammoth scope of subject matter and detail, it is was always going to be extremely hard to put into film (Dune anyone??), and Annaud certainly doesn't succeed in every way, but my lord he gives it a damn good go. The film quite rightly focusses on the human story within the book of a group of murders committed at an Italian abbey in the 14th Century, and the ongoing search for the purpetrator, by a Franciscan monk and his apprentice. The book encompasses many other issues and plotlines, which could not be fitted into the film. The three screenwriters do an excellent job, of filming the almost impossible to within 2 hours or so. Most importantly to me, the cinematography and set are sublime, almost unsurpassed in modern film to my mind, and still to this day amazing. I've always found that many non movie-lovers remember this film, for good or bad.  The main reason for me is that it recreates so impressively the period it represents. Tonino Delli Colli, I salute you. The production team deserves a similar merit for bringing together what was in essence an European co-production, whilst not forgetting the biggest exterior set built in Europe since ""Cleopatra"". Step forward Dante Ferreti. I salute you too. 0.1 of a mark off for the editing, but let's not dwell on that. The acting is, bar none, marvellous, with even Christian Slater in his first main role putting up an extremely decent stab of being an apprentice monk.
I like a good whodunnit, but I adore a whodunnit which throws in the visual magnificence of a different age, top notch performances, a script taken from a extraordinary source, and assured directing. 10 out of 10, and my mates can carry on taking the mickey out of me.So in summary, I'll leave it to the director himself.. `When I see a film, I love it when I'm entertained, when I care for the actors, when I share their emotions, when I'm scared, when I'm in love, but also if I learn a little something, if I have the feeling that I haven't seen something before, and that's what `The Name of the Rose' has.'",The Name of the Rose

148,martynsommer,"A rose by any other name doesn't smell as sweet, as it turns out.",5,16 August 2014,"I recently went back in time 30 years. First, I decided to complete Umberto Eco's first novel, The Name of the Rose, after having tried many times without success. Then, upon eventual completion (it took around two months),I re-watched the movie, which I had initially seen about 27 years ago.My general impression of the movie was that the writers hadn't understood the novel at all. The arbitrary narrative that they chose to select from the 600 plus pages had very little to do with the point Eco was trying to make (which seems to have been lost on Jean-Jacques Annaud and crew). However, considering that most people who watch this movie won't have read the book (and I was guilty of this on my original viewing), this film still works as the forerunner of medieval murder mystery movies.Both Sean Connery and an adolescent Christian Slater are great in their roles as Franciscan monk and novice apprentice, respectively. Connery as the Sherlock Holmes-like Brother William is especially ideal for the part. His penetrating one liners are delivered with classic virtuoso. Another positive point is that this movie doesn't feel dated, mainly due to the competent cinematography and colorful cast of assorted freaks.For those who have read the book and hold it in high esteem, this film will not hold much stead and will ultimately disappoint. The characters are all one dimensional, as opposed to the complex figures of the novel. Furthermore, the focus on the love interest for Adso is quite lame and the choice between the girl and the church that he makes at the end borders on cliché. There are a lot of minor characters who make a brief appearance for no particular reason, leaving the viewer perplexed.This is by no means a bad film. It's just not The Name of the Rose that Umberto Eco brilliantly and painstakingly created. The book has the potential to change our fundamental processes of thinking. The movie is just an interesting historical drama.",The Name of the Rose

At this time glasses were considered the work of the devil.Umberto was so worried that he would go to God without confessing what he had witnessed, he wrote all that he could remember to the best of his knowledge in a ledger.Several hundred years later, the ledger was found in a European book store by a young starving writer, who transcribed the book over a period of ten years.During the time of Umberto's life, religious icons had their own agenda in pushing ""faith"".If you are a deeply religious person this is not a book for you to read.

So much passion for the subject makes this film a legendary one. Every detail is been thought about and you can see that. It is quite humorous that a reason that the film has become such a huge success, is Sean Connery.
