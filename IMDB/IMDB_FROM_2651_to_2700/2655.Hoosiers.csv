0,MartinHafer,Formulaic...but in a good way.,8,19 March 2012,"The film begins with the hiring of a new high school basketball coach (Gene Hackman) in a rural Indiana town in 1951. Despite the townsfolk loving basketball (after all, it IS Indiana), the people really aren't that friendly. They try to tell him how to coach and some of his players have major attitudes as well. It's easy to say that it's a downright unfriendly place for outsiders. However, being a movie, you figure things must change...otherwise it wouldn't make for an interesting film! Into this enjoyable but predictable formula, fortunately, you have a lot of great characters. There is the nice but sick Principal, the teacher who initially hates the coach (Barbara Hershey) and, the most interesting of all, an alcoholic who is actually hired to be the coach's assistant (Dennis Hopper). All of these, along with lovely writing and a strong attention to 1950s details, make this an inspiring and impressive film.I wish all basketball players were forced to watch this game today. It has a lot to say about the game, self-discipline, self-respect and teamwork. So, even thought today's players are probably a lot better than those back in the old days (they are a lot bigger and stronger, that's for sure), they still have a lot to learn.As you watch the film, you need to keep reminding yourself that basketball was MUCH different back in the 50s. There was no shot clock and games OFTEN had total scores below 60...or even 40! So, the Coach's insistence on passing, passing, passing is pretty consistent with the way the game was played at the time--sort of like playing keep-away with occasional shots. So, actually, while the game seems kind of slow in this film, it's really a lot faster than they usually played it back then. They also seemed to have a lot more fights in the film than they probably had in real life.Recently another film was made that was clearly patterned on ""Hoosiers"" (""The Winning Season""). However, this newer clearly ignored the positive lessons of ""Hoosiers"" and is a funny film...though I clearly would NOT want to have a real coach be THAT awful! Well worth seeing...sort of an ""Anti-Hoosiers""!One of the best films of the genre.",Hoosiers
1,TheLittleSongbird,One of the better sports movies out there,10,23 January 2011,"I am not a big sports fan, but I do like a good film with some. Hoosiers is exactly that, one of the better ones along with Breaking Away and Remember the Titans. Is it clichéd? Perhaps, but even so everything else is so good you are past caring. The movie looks beautiful with crisp cinematography and scenery and the basketball sequences are stunning. Jerry Goldsmith's score is very evocative, the film is sharply directed, the script has a perfect balance and the story is heart-warming and snappily paced. The acting I have no qualms with either, Gene Hackman is simply brilliant as is Dennis Hopper. Overall, Hoosiers(or Best Shot) is wonderful and one of the better sports movies out there. 10/10 Bethany Cox",Hoosiers
2,bkoganbing,"Basketball, the Indiana state religion",7,31 January 2010,"I guess because on either side of Indiana, both Ohio and Illinois have two major league baseball team franchises, the state of Indiana has rebelled and adopted basketball as the official state sport. Some could compare Indiana's basketball mania to many southern states and their local devotion to college and high school football. It's more like a secular religion down there.In the early Fifties Gene Hackman has been hired by a local high school to coach its floundering basketball team which is built around one star player, Maris Valainis. Maris's father was the assistant coach and is also the town drunk and is played by Dennis Hopper. He's as jealous as Lloyd Bridges was when Gary Cooper didn't recommend he move up to the job of marshal in High Noon.Barbara Hershey plays a teacher who is worried about Valainis getting a good education and who actually now has custody of the kid because Hopper's been ruled an unfit dad won't let him play. That's the specific problem that Hackman is facing.The general problem is that especially in a small town setting everyone and his brother think they can do a better job than the current athletic coach of whatever sport. Just listen to any sports phone-in show on the radio and you'll have that fact confirmed. Still that's just what comes with the territory. The best character in Hoosiers is without a doubt Hopper. He was a star basketball player in the town and he can't get over the fact that those years in high school were the high point of his life. He never went on to anything else and that's what Hershey is trying to prevent happening with his son. Ironically this same situation is humorously exploited in Married With Children where Al Bundy waxes nostalgically about his high school football days, remember four touchdowns in a single game.In fact Dennis Hopper got an Oscar nomination in the Best Supporting Actor category, one of two that Hoosiers got the other being for best musical scoring. I think Hoosiers misses being a classic though a lot will disagree with me. The characters except for Hopper are not really developed by the script. Other than Valainis the kids on the team have no real individual identities, we never learn just Hackman did that brought him out of college ranks and in the Navy for eleven years between his last college job and this one.The basketball scenes move at a good pace though and Hoosiers is after all about basketball. And nothing but basketball.",Hoosiers
3,SnoopyStyle,traditional underdog sports movie,8,24 August 2015,It's 1951. Coach Norman Dale (Gene Hackman) arrives in the small Indiana town of Hickory. His old friend Cletus gets him a high school teaching and basketball coaching job. He's a former college coach with a troubled past. Fellow teacher Myra Fleener (Barbara Hershey) is intrigued by the newcomer. The best player Jimmy Chitwood refuses to play after the lost of his beloved coach. Myra looks after Jimmy with his troubled home life and doesn't want him to play. Dale throws out the bossy local coach and a mouthy player in the first practice. They are severely undermanned and he benches a disobedient player despite having only four players on the floor. Shooter Flatch (Dennis Hopper) is a drunken former star player and father to one of the players.This follows the long tradition of the underdog sports movie and builds on it. The story is all cliché and proud of it. Hackman is masterful. Hopper is a great drunk. Hershey is the wearied type and I'm glad that they don't have a 20 year old bright-eyed hottie to play the romantic lead. The movie is earnest to its core and there lies its charms.,Hoosiers
4,Hitchcoc,Captures Its Time Period,8,27 February 2006,"I like good sports movies. There is a delicate touch involved in making them work. As a child, my friends and I would read every sports book we could get our hands on and we were very critical of the authors. I remember a basketball book where a team that was fouled declined the foul and kept the ball. This was the end of that author as far as we were concerned. We were pretty picky. I started watching basketball in fourth grade which would have been about three years after the time of this movie. When I looked at the portrayal of the players in the movie I was impressed. The old gym, the cars heading to the visitors' town on a Friday night, the whole town completely involved, mainly because there was nothing else to do. Then, of course, it was Indiana. I couldn't begin to understand that since we never got that serious.I will go to a Gene Hackman film and assume it will be above average. I really like his portrayal of the coach. He has incredible baggage as he hits the small town and is past the time when he needs to just please people. He is complex and proud and knows deep down inside that this team isn't going anywhere unless there is a commitment. The townspeople want a lot of scoring. He wants discipline. This of course causes him to get into a war with the townies. He even throws one of the better players off the team. Of course, there's the subplot of getting the young phenom to come back to the team and the romance angle. But ultimately it is the way basketball was in the fifties. Hackman takes his character, which has many failings, and throws it into the soup. He's a master craftsman as an actor. See this.",Hoosiers
5,classicsoncall,"""Let's win one for Coach who got us here"".",8,27 September 2016,"Like a lot of sports movies, this one has less to do with the game being represented than it does about relationships, discipline, teamwork, finding the good in somebody, and ultimately, redemption. Perhaps that's why a lot of reviewers who are negative on the picture see it only as a cliché ridden story in which the underdog comes out on top as was expected all along. Gene Hackman makes his character Norman Dale the kind of coach that all high school players of any sport would be proud to know and strive for. One that measures success by the hard work and perseverance that goes into boring, repetitive practice that produces successful shots, kicks, and goals into something that becomes second nature. I was particularly impressed by the scene in which Coach Dale has himself ejected from a game in order to help his assistant coach Shooter (Dennis Hopper) regain a measure of self respect and dignity, a selfless gesture that takes more character than most bystanders at a local ball game might appreciate. That simple sacrifice in turn helps bring an alcoholic father back into the good graces of his own son. The full circle nature of these singular moments have a way of reverberating throughout a school and community at large, and this story shows how it can be done. So once more, a basketball story that's more than just basketball, but about making one's way in life.Also cool to see that Purple People Eater guy Sheb Wooley as the Hickory High School principal. I didn't recognize him wearing a suit and tie and not riding a horse.",Hoosiers
6,gavin6942,Decent Basketball Film,7,27 August 2015,"A coach with a checkered past (Gene Hackman) and a local drunk (Dennis Hopper) train a small town high school basketball team to become a top contender for the championship.Although I am not one who cares for basketball or sports films (they all seem to follow the same general plot), this one does have some good things going for it. Namely, Gene Hackman, who never makes a bad movie (or at least never plays a bad role). And Dennis Hopper, who is something of a wild card and is appropriately cast as a drunk.Beyond that, it is just a feel good movie. Nothing too heavy, sort of the thing you expect from the 1980s. And that is just alright.",Hoosiers
7,ccthemovieman-1,In Inspiriing Story Of Second-Chances,10,21 March 2006,"What makes this one of the most popular sports films of all time isn't just the sport, it's because it's such a human-interest film, such a wonderful story of giving people second chances in life. Add a true-life David beat Goliath story and you have an appealing film.It doesn't hurt that Gene Hackman is the star, either. He may not have that celebrity appeal or the looks of Clark Gable or Bratt Pitt, but this man can flat-out act! He makes a very believable high school basketball coach who is tough-but-fair on the outside and soft-and-compassionate on the inside.The story of an extremely tiny school defying the odds and becoming a state champion in dramatic form was so inspiring that this film has played thousands of times for 20 years now by high school coaches to their kids for motivation.But the key to the story is the coach getting a second chance in life to do what he loves and does best and he, in turn, giving others a second chance such as the alcoholic here played by Dennis Hopper. There are great lessons on teamwork, patience, tolerance and a whole bunch of other qualities. In one of the DVD documentaries, both Hackman and Hoppper comment on how many times people have approached them and THIS is the movie they mention that meant so much them. That says a lot since both men have made many famous movies.An unsung hero of this movie is the cinematography. Man, this is beautifully filmed and the rural Midwest has never looked so pretty and appealing. It paints a beautiful picture of this part of the United States. It also paints a fond remembrance of the early 1950s. You get an honest-to-goodness feel of what it's like to be part of a basketball in this area during that time, Basketball meant an awful lot - and still does - to these folks. If you are sports fan in particularly, this movie will bring a tear or two to your eyes. However, this story is for everyone who believes people deserve chances to overcome previous mistakes. Few films, whatever the topic, have the ""heart"" this movie demonstrates.",Hoosiers
8,rmax304823,Hard To Take Seriously.,3,5 October 2012,"It's 1951 and Gene Hackman is an ex basketball coach who has spent the war years and then some in the Navy. He's hired by a small-town high school in rural Indiana to care for their team. The team members are a little self satisfied, having been runners up in some small-time contest a few years ago. Hackman finds the town unfriendly. They liked their last coach and resent him. He brings new ideas to the game -- no more zone defense but rather man-on-man. But he's determined to see these boys whipped into shape and win Big Time.I ask you, the discerning viewer, does he succeed? Barbara Hershey is a teacher hostile to Hackman. Does he win her over? Dennis Hopper is a disgusting drunk but he knows everything about the local teams and how they play basketball. Does Hackman hire him as Assistant Coach? Does Hopper overcome his demons? Is Hackman fired by the town but saved at the last minute by a revelation of some sort? Does he improve the team's spirit. Does he make them want to fight like dogs? Does this get them to the Big Tournament at the state capitol? Does the music on the sound track swell with triumphant fanfares? Are you kidding? I couldn't predict all of the obstacles that would crop up in the screenplay but, once presented with them, pretty much knew exactly how they'd be solved.Maybe part of the reason I found it so tiresome is that I'm not a fan of basketball. But I don't follow baseball either and always enjoy ""The Natural."" And I'm a lousy pool shooter but think ""The Hustler"" is a near masterpiece.On the plus side, the cinematography by Fred Murphy is very good indeed, and so is the location shooting. When the distracted Hackman first arrives in Hickory, Indiana, it LOOKS like the beginning of school in September. It's misty, people's breath steams, the ground is littered with tannic leaves. And, as the season progresses, the branches become bare and patches of snow appear in the shadows. If you were driven to find a small farming community dominated by an over-sized white church and an elderly brick high school, you'd want to come here.But how is it possible to take any of this seriously, as the writer and director seem to expect us to? It's a heart-warming write-by-the-numbers story of dispiritedness turning to success. It seems to be aimed at the kind of audience represented by the gangly pituitary cases we watch on the court. The harder you pray, the harder you play.Ho hum.",Hoosiers

10,edwagreen,Hooray for Hoosiers ****,10,3 June 2013,"A truly wonderful basketball film with Gene Hackman arriving at a small Indiana town in 1951 to coach a high school basketball team. Hackman's arrival meets with contempt by the town's people as he attempts to instill his brand of discipline to a young team. Of course, when it's discovered why he left New York, it doesn't help his cause as well.The set decorations best depict Indiana during this period. Conservative as always, the people respect human values, but will they be tolerant of this newcomer?Barbara Hershey, as the acting principal of the school, is a difficult character to fathom. With pride for her school, yet an unhappiness but willingness to remain at the home town, her character needed more development, but is more than sufficient as depicted.This is definitely a story of redemption, commitment, and small town values in the 1950s. Dennis Hopper has some scene stealing moments as a town drunkard, who with a son on the team, eventually finds his way. Hopper was nominated for a well deserved best supporting actor Oscar for this 1986 film.",Hoosiers
11,jotix100,That championship season,10,23 August 2005,"David Anspaugh's ""Hoosiers"" is a film about the passion to excel in sports. It's also about a man's comeback to the game after a rough patch in his own life. ""Hoosiers"" is a timeless film that will look good after years of its release because it speaks to us about how someone can inspire a group of people to do their best, as they become confident in what they are trying to accomplish. The film was lovingly written for the screen by Angelo Pizzo.Coach Norman Dale gets a reprieve in life when he is hired to coach the Hickory basket ball team in rural Indiana. Basketball is the game where most people in that state take an unusual interest. Their passion for the sport is evident. The new coach is looked with suspicion because he is an outsider and he believes in teamwork. He wants everyone to participate equally, which doesn't make for excitement in the court. The coach doesn't want anyone overshadowing another, that's why he insists in total involvement. Needless to say, his method clashes with the parents and towns people from the start.The coach's past comes to haunt him when Myra Fleener, one of the teachers, discovers an article that reveals an incident Mr. Dale would like to forget. At the same time, Myra realizes the goodness in the coach's heart by involving the drunken Shooter into helping him with the team.Gene Hackman has one of the best opportunities of his distinguished career with his portrayal of Coach Dale. He is splendid in the film and he wins us with his decency and by sticking to his principles, which he passes on to the team members. Barbara Hershey is also good as Myra, the young woman who falls in love with Dale. Dennis Hopper plays Shooter, the father of one of the kids in the team who has a drinking problem.""Hoosiers"" is an inspiring film that ought to be seen by young people because of its message about team spirit and how to interact with one another in peace and harmony.",Hoosiers
12,view_and_review,Small School Makes the Big Stage,7,29 January 2020,"I would be lying if I thought that Coach Dale (Gene Hackman) would have kept his job after the first game. He lost his first game and at one point he opted to play four guys to teach a player a lesson. I don't know a single coach that would've been allowed to coach his second game after a stunt like that. But that was all an effort to show us just what kind of coach Coach Dale was.Coach Bob Knight, er um, Norman Dale was a tough coach with a military background. He demanded respect and unfailingly adherence to his game plan. He didn't promise the world in return, just that they would be a better team. And they were.",Hoosiers
13,Uriah43,Captures the Basketball Climate of Indiana in an Excellent Manner,8,22 February 2017,"""Norman Dale"" (Gene Hackman) was a college basketball coach for 10 years until an incident force him to leave and subsequently join the Navy. Now, 12 years later, he has returned to the profession he loves by accepting a coaching position for a high school in Indiana. However, the people in this small town take basketball extremely serious and they aren't nearly as enthusiastic to his new methods as he would like. To make matters even worse he only has 6 players on the team with one key holdout named ""Jimmy Chitwood"" (Maris Valainis) deciding not to play the entire season. That being said, when the team gets off to a rocky start everyone in town begins to call for his scalp. But he remains determined in spite of everything that has gone wrong. The question is whether he can turn things around before he gets fired. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that having spent a little time in Indiana this film did an excellent job of capturing the basketball climate as well as presenting the small town atmosphere there during that particular time also. Truly excellent. Additionally, along with the aforementioned Gene Hackman, I also liked the performances of Barbara Hershey (as ""Myra Fleener"") and Dennis Hopper (""Shooter"") as well. In any case, this is one of those few movies that I can watch over and over again and I have rated it accordingly. Definitely above average.",Hoosiers
14,whpratt1,"Danville, Illinois Classic Star",8,13 May 2006,"Over the years I missed this film starring Gene Hackman,(Coach, Norman Dale),""Heartbreakers"",'01, a true story about a small high school in Indiana who struggle with many ups and downs and are considered one of the worst teams in the Hoosier State. Coach Norman seeks the help of an old pro at Basketball, who is a burned out drunk who goes on and off the wagon and needs to dry out most of the time. The film keeps you on the edge of your seat wondering if this team will ever amount to anything. However, the town people are big supportive fans and do get tired and discussed with their coach and have a local meeting in a town church. There are lots of scenes showing plenty of corn fields and even some romance is squeezed in between games. Gene Hackman was born in Danville, Illinois, near the Indiana border where all you can see for miles is corn fields not far from Champaign, Illinois where the University of Illinois is located. Gene fit in perfectly with this film and it was great entertainment.",Hoosiers
15,DKosty123,"UnderRated By Many, But A Spirited Classic",8,29 May 2010,"With the recent death of Dennis Hopper whose support in this one as Shooter is a classic support role, this film was very much over looked by everybody when it was released. After all, this is only about high school basketball and it is very much a period piece. It is set in the 1950's, in the Mid-West, but with a very big city cast. It was over looked despite the fact that this is the classic under dog from the small town getting to the state championship at the high school level. This is the theme that the NCAA's are built on in college basketball every year. Yet the film did not get positive press on it's initial release.Then the film hit television, & like the Wizard of Oz, this film has a plot that plays well on television. It has Gene Hackman proving he is more than Popeye Doyle as he plays a high school basketball coach who rarely exists in reality. He plays that role with a relish that carries this film. With Shooter (Hopper) in support as a mentor, but a mentor with a drinking problem, a small school beats the odds. That is a heart which works in many classic motion pictures, & it works well here.This is a big time cast working with a director who really, this is the best & only big time film he has directed. Like the underdog, his directing here is just classic. What makes this film work is the dream. This film represents that dream, the underdog coming through. Hackmans speech, the cast around him, & a great story line, come together here by accident. While this is not Dennis Hoppers most memorable role, Shooter too represents this spirit.",Hoosiers
16,sddavis63,Disappointing: That Sums Up The Movie And Hackman's Performance,2,19 August 2002,"I tuned into this movie not because I am a fan of U.S. High School basketball (in fact I only rarely watch NBA games) but rather because I am a fan of Gene Hackman, who usually manages to bring an impressive depth to his performances. In this case, however, I was sorely disappointed. This was not one of the bright shining stars of Hackman's career.In fairness to him, he didn't have a lot to work with. As Norman Dale, the new coach of a small town high school basketball team in Indiana, he wasn't called on to do much acting. Basically his performance consisted of pacing up and down basketball sidelines ranting at the referees. I didn't find him particularly believable in the role to be honest. I also was unimpressed with the requisite romance between Dale and Myra Fleener (Barbara Hershey). Quite honestly there was absolutely no chemistry between Hackman and Hershey. The romance never captured my attention, and neither did the basketball ""action,"" which was altogether too predictable.There were far too many problems with this movie to make it worthwhile. I never did understand the depth of the sheer hatred that so many of the townsfolk had for Dale, almost from before the time he arrived. The character development was poor and the story itself was poorly developed. Too much basketball and not enough human interaction, in my opinion. How many shots of kids shooting baskets do we need to see to get the point that this is a basketball movie? There was no suspense: is it even possible to doubt that Hickory is going to win the big one? I realize that this is based on a true story, but I guess it proves that not every true story should be a movie. Quite frankly, it just wasn't a very interesting movie. Definitely a movie Gene Hackman would like to forget.No better than a 2/10 in my opinion.",Hoosiers

No way.But, even so - I did find that ""Hoosiers"" certainly had enough going in its favor that it actually did manage to hold my interest for a good part of the time.I'd say that ""Hoosiers"" greatest appeal was that its story was based on ""real-life"" events that had catapulted an underdog, high-school basketball team into Indiana State champs back in 1956.If you are a basketball fan - Then - I'm sure that ""Hoosiers"" will be a satisfying movie-experience for you, all around.",Hoosiers
18,ElMaruecan82,A powerful sports drama with a motivational score like only the 80s could produce...,8,25 July 2019,"""We love it when giants fall. It's part of our collective social consciousness. We build up heroes and once they reach a certain plateau of success over a period of time, we tire of them. We love underdogs and want to see an upset""This is from Stephen Denny's ""Killing Giants"", a fascinating book drawing many parallels between business competition and the sports world, insisting that while anyone can be small size-wise, there's no such a thing as a small player, it's even the most enviable position as you've got to beat the odds as well as the opponent. That's why cinema too loves underdogs, it's the stuff dreams are made on.David Anspaugh's ""Hoosiers"" is one of these sports movies, distilling from real-life a story that underlines the term ""underdog"" so much the film might only be accused of insisting too much on the ""small"" thing; small town, small high school, relatively small basketball players, to the point that ""Rudy"", the second feature film from Anspaugh makes a perfect companion piece to ""Hoosiers"". And like ""Rudy"", the main cast doesn't actually play the game, the team is ""only"" the instrumental device meant to bring pride to the Indiana farmers, the Hoosiers people. Their shot at the championship is theirs for feeling significant and happy and accepting the banal normality of their life. Sport is an instrument of social cohesion and it's the film's credit to evoke the passion from the outsider's perspective.Here's another example: few weeks ago, the Moroccan team was eliminated from the African Nations Cups in the worst possible way: a missed penalty shot at the 93rd minute that would have meant victory. Those make-it-or-break-it moments define the fascination for sport, a metaphor for life where one tactical choice, one move, a boost of insurance or a moment of hesitation make the difference, one can get off a game as a hero or a pariah, the verdict of the crowd is part of the game too. As Moroccans, we all felt shaken and betrayed not much because our country lost but because we were prevented from an opportunity to be happy. And the vox populi blamed the coach for having picked the wrong player. This is a situation Norman Dale could have related to.Some aspects of the Hickory team's story have been fictionalized and I read that the real coach wasn't exactly a middle-aged man but it doesn't matter, the film does add a few cinematic conventions but finds a nice way to make Hickory's ascension to the title tie the plot together, with the overarching idea that everyone deserves a second chance, it's all a matter of seizing the opportunity once it comes. For once, it's not about the players, they're good already, the closest to a real underdog is a vertically-challenged boy who must deal with mockeries and his own insecurity, and Jimmy, an enigmatic young prodigy who's mourning the death of the previous coach and refuses to play anymore. We expect his entrance to be pivotal in the plot and it is, but in a way that honor the script's restrained tone, not going for cheap emotionality despite the temptations. This is not the eighties' ""Rocky's"".The film doesn't play either the circumstances that pushed Dale outside the basket court like a sort of trauma or big reveal, Gene Hackman with his unbeatable instinct to play normal guys, plays it smoothly as someone who doesn't want to get into trouble and tries to deal with the defiance of the townsfolk who disapprove his methods (some are on his side though). The philosophy of Norman is that whoever wants to play gets in the court, he respects Jimmy's choice and never tries to overstep the boundaries of his authority and doesn't want in return his authority to be defied. He's a man of discipline but not an iron-hand either. And because he believes in second chances, he gives one to Shooter, a former star and player's father, played by Dennis Hopper (Oscar-nominated for the role).Hopper gives a remarkably desperate energy that cuts straight in your heart, a man for which basketball meant something and is transmitting not only the passion but the expertise, that's the kind of nuances so smart and well-pointed that I regretted the film's needless romance with Barbara Hershey or a few missed moments with the players, who're getting with the coach the chance to be on the top of the world, and even once in a lifetime makes it all worth it. That was the philosophy of ""Rudy"" as well, something that transcended the banal goal of victory and make sport the real star of the film. Basket-ball couldn't have a better homage, the tactical moves aren't just artistic licenses and we get enthralled by the final game and the way the winning points are won at the last minute, you might think it's unbelievable but sports is full of such unbelievable stories.In his ""Killing Giants"" book, Denny provides an interesting example example among many others involves a 1941 boxing game where Joe Louis won by knocking down his opponent, a cocky Irishman named Bill Conn who wanted the knock-out although he had the game already, he seized the final opportunity to get him with an uppercut and the heavyweight title in the process proving that it's not over till it's over. Basket-ball allows more latitude to the players but also works under the same conditions, and right now I still don't know which score stuck the most to my mind, the final 43 to 40 or Jerry Goldsmith's inspirational theme that makes me want to take my trainers and go run ten miles, right now I have that music playing in my mind!",Hoosiers
19,Cineanalyst,"""God Wants You on the Floor""",8,15 July 2021,"Often considered the best basketball film ever made, and they might be right, at least if one doesn't count a documentary such as ""Hoop Dreams"" (1994), ""Hoosiers,"" however, isn't effective because it's a sports movie so much as it's because it's a Christian one. Something about the 1980s, perhaps, as there seemed to be a few such spiritual sports flicks: ""Chariots of Fire"" (1981), ""The Natural"" (1984), ""Field of Dreams"" (1989). None of those are quite as fervent in their conviction, though, and are largely about other things, too, whether religious freedom, patriotism, daddy issues, capitalism, or what have you. The only other film I've seen since that approaches such reverence is Spike Lee's ""He Got Game"" (1998). There, it's the last temptation of Christ. Here, it's David and Goliath. Both are tales of redemption and masculinity, with ""Hoosiers"" uniting that more to divine grace.It's apt, especially being set in Indiana, a state known for its devotion to the game--particularly its high-school tournament. Wikipedia even has a page for ""Hoosier Hysteria."" Indeed, the film is loosely based on a small-town team that won the championship in 1954. Usually, it seems sports fanaticism is treated as a displaced, secular religiosity. The passion that unifies communities where once a church might have; after all, many a rural village will be spotted with several temples of different denominations, but only one team for a sport, and their events oft tend to be better attended. Of course, that's mythologized, too, and is why ""Hoosiers"" is a nostalgic look at supposed past glory, including as regards gender roles or the the absence of racial recognition even when versing their sole integrated opponent. It makes no mistake, either, that its basketball is religion--of the sort dating back to Victorian-age protestant notions of Christian manliness. The arguments between Gene Hackman's coach and Barbara Hershey's school teacher are all about this role of basketball in the community, the role of redemption, and over the masculine or feminine control of raising men--particularly concerning the education of the fatherless Jimmy between father-figure coaches, as well as the sobering of the alcoholic father played by Dennis Hopper.Another key player is Strap, who although he ends up a reserve spending most of his time on the bench in games, is the most devout member of the team--kneeling in prayer for extended periods of time (hence the quotation placed in the headline of this review implored by the coach to get Strap on the court) and whose father drives the the team's bus because God told him to. It's through Strap that divine grace is most readily apparent as the movie moves towards montage mode with heightened dramatic music, as ecstatically scored by Jerry Goldsmith. If not for this thematic congruity, ""Hoosiers"" would surely be unbearably clichéd and sentimental. That's probably why the same director's, David Anspaugh, and writer's, Angelo Pizzo, overrated ""Rudy"" is so obnoxious, as with many other underdog, last-second-shot heroic sports flicks. Here, it works, though, because there's an underlying theology instead of merely contributing to an endless string of ""Rocky"" (1976) idolatry.",Hoosiers
20,kenjha,OK Hoop Drama,7,26 December 2012,"A shy but talented young man leads his small town high school basketball team to the state championship. The small town atmosphere is nicely evoked in this film, which was inspired by the true story of the Milan High School's 1954 state title in Indiana. The game action is well simulated, but it seems too calculated and predictable to create true excitement. Hackman is terrific as usual as the coach who's been given a second chance to revive his career. Hershey is also effective as a teacher that Hackman initially clashes with. Hopper has a showy role as a former star player who's now a drunk, but is given a chance by Hackman to redeem himself.",Hoosiers
21,zkonedog,Leans Into The Melodrama & Supported By Incredible Acting/Soundtrack,8,28 March 2021,"""Hoosiers"" is never going to rise into my all-time favorite films (9-10 star range). It is a little too cliche-driven and predictable for that. However, director David Anspaugh and writer Angelo Pizzo expertly lean into those cliches to great effect and are supported by some iconic acting performances and a soundtrack for the ages.For a very basic overview, ""Hoosiers"" tells the story of Norman Dale (Gene Hackman), a disgraced former basketball coach given one last chance at a small-town high school in Indiana. Initially given the cold shoulder by most of the townsfolk--especially teacher Myra Fleener (Barbara Hershey)--Dale brings his unique coaching style to the court in an effort to elevate the team (and himself) to a dream neither would have believed possible.One thing is clear about ""Hoosiers"" from the get-go: it is 100% melodramatic ""sap"", if you will. If you're expecting a philosophical deep dive, you're in the wrong place. That being said, the filmmakers manage to expertly tap into the aesthetic and mystique of ""yesteryear"", small town life, and high school sports. They lean into the schmaltz and somehow make it all not feel utterly ridiculous. If you aren't leaking from the eyes in the film's final moments, you are likely in the slim minority.None of this works nearly as well as it does without the steadying presence of Hackman. Somehow, he is a renowned actor who often manages to be underrated. Here, his role is to ""play it straight"" in the midst of all the heartstring-tugging, and he comes through with aplomb. His ""my team is on the floor"" line and measuring the hoop scene are now iconic in the lore of sports films. Another notable performance comes from Dennis Hopper playing the town drunk (and father of one of the boys) who is given a chance at redemption (if only he could manage to not screw it up).Then, of course, there is the soundtrack. What Bill Conti is to ""Rocky"" and ""The Karate Kid"" or Randy Newman is to ""The Natural"", Jerry Goldsmith is every bit their equal here. His mix of soulful violins to personify Midwest life and synth-driven beats during the basketball action is truly special.Overall, I have one final (if rather odd) statement on ""Hoosiers"": It is more iconic than great. Its melodramatic nature may remove it from ""best of all-time"" lists, but it's cliches, performances, and music have become iconic in the subsequent decades after its release. Anytime a film can accomplish that, something special has been achieved.",Hoosiers
22,helpless_dancer,exciting sports drama,9,20 March 1999,"Very good movie about the price one has to pay for a grand achievement. The basketball coach took a group of goof-offs and losers, and showed them that there is no free ride; if you want something, you have to sweat and work for it. The ending of this film could have been corny and anti-climactic, however, it came off as a real nail biter. I honestly didn't know who was going to come out on top all the way to the final gun. A real heart stopper, and an entertaining story with a good lesson. 5 stars.",Hoosiers
23,mjneu59,corn-fed inspiration,4,27 November 2010,"Critics compared it to 'Rocky', but this hackneyed inspirational drama actually looks and sounds more like 'The Natural', trading an enduring baseball myth for the fairy tale of small town high school basketball. Never mind the competitive spirit: the film is more a celebration of spacious skies and amber waves of grain, with hard luck coach Gene Hackman leading his undisciplined team to the Indiana State championship, bullying his way into the hearts of taciturn, conservative farm community where the game is regarded almost as a religion. The outcome of every match up is never in doubt; no matter how far behind they may be, the Hickory Hucksters always manage to find themselves with a tie score just before the final buzzer. But the music-and-montage approach to the sport flattens the genuine mania and suspense generated on a high school basketball court. Every cliché, from the triumphant music fanfares to the slow motion, game winning jump shots to the exultant crowd scenes, is as familiar as an old pair of gym sneakers, which is sure to be a reassuring comfort to some viewers. But to others it may simply mean the time has come to buy a new pair of shoes.",Hoosiers
24,fertilecelluloid,"Simply great drama for non-sports fans, too",9,8 February 2006,"I'm no armchair sportsman and I've never played basketball, but to enjoy ""Hoosiers"" you don't need to meet those requirements. ""Hoosiers"" is simply great, superbly acted drama. The story is standard underdog material, but with a terrific cast including Gene Hackman, Dennis Hopper and Barbara Hershey, it soars. It is refreshing to see a sports movie in which the players are not a bunch of arrogant, obnoxious, beer-swilling yahoos whose only ambition off the court is to get laid. No, these high school boys from a very small town are a sorry lot whose spirits are revived by a coach (Hackman) on the last legs of his checkered career. Dennis Hopper, who plays the embarrassing, alcoholic father of one of the players, is a revelation here as a man given yet another chance to prove that he isn't a terminal loser. The film is comprised of many games, and in the hands of a hack, it might have become tiresome. But director David Anspaugh works hard to inject great dramatic tension into every game and is ably assisted by Fred Murphy's beautiful photography and Jerry Goldsmith's extraordinary score, a mix of electronic and strong orchestral elements. The film has an extremely emotional build and powers along like a steam train. Hackman, a long way from fine work such as ""Prime Cut"" and ""The Hunting Party"", is simply ultra-solid and commanding. A marvellous film about being given chances. I suggest you give it one, too.",Hoosiers
25,Agent10,The epitome of small time lunacy,8,8 June 2002,"While some regard this is an endearing epithet to the hunger of Indiana basketball, it seems to make fun of the madness which surrounds the sport in the little Midwestern state. While the story seemed hackneyed and disbelieving, one has to look at the power of the film as opposed to the technical aspects. While Hoosiers is virtually every basketball fan's perfect movie, it is one that really encompasses the spirit of fortitude, much in the same way Rocky I did.",Hoosiers
26,FlushingCaps,The spirit of Hoosier Hysteria shines brightly here,10,2 March 2019,"The much-acclaimed movie about a fictional Indiana high-school basketball team that wins the state championship is set two years before the famous, real-life Milan Miracle that saw a tiny high school actually win the Indiana state title-when all 751 schools in the state competed for one state championship, not four or more-is a wonderful drama, with a few comedic quips and scenes that has touched the hearts of millions of fans, many of whom don't really like basketball, or sports in general.The film accurately gets into the heart and soul of how so many of the people in small towns in America, and most particularly in Indiana, really care about how well their high school basketball team fares each year. In other parts of the country, it is football that dominates.We see the new coach, Norman Dale, arriving to begin his new job of teacher/coach just two weeks before basketball seasons starts and encounter all sorts of hostility from people who make wrong assumptions about him, or who don't want a coach who changes the way things have been. He struggles to even get enough players to suit up, deals with the best player in town not wanting to play at all-for reasons that have nothing to do with him-and even has to endure a town meeting where he is almost voted out of a job halfway through the season.Slowly he builds character in the team, gets them to understand the teamwork it takes to ultimately succeed, and they make a run to the championship game in Indianapolis. There are many basketball scenes which is a joy to this viewer because I've seen too many ""sports"" movies where we spend, say, 100 minutes watching the movie and don't see more than 6 or so minutes of action on the playing field, as the film spends almost all of its time on personal relationships by either coach or players, frequently the ""love story"" the filmmakers always insist on including to draw in more viewers. However good the ""romantic"" story may be, I feel gypped if the movie delivers very little of the topic it is billed as.Dale even converts a hostile teacher who misjudged him in the beginning, even though she found out about his past record of hitting a player on his team and getting banned from coaching in college basketball. He takes time to help out the father of one of his players, a struggling alcoholic, by making him an assistant coach and then putting him in a position where this assistant had to take over the team and plot a game-winning play. The coach does much for all the players, even the short guy who was just the team manager who suited up for practice so they'd have more than six bodies on the court.I've read some of the reviews on IMDB and am astonished to read people writing that they didn't care for it because the ending (the team winning) was predictable. At any murder mystery movie, where there are, say 6 or more suspects, you can find many dozens of viewers who honestly DO predict who the killer is early on. With millions watching, every character who is a possible murderer is going to be predicted by some of the viewers. Here we have a basketball game, where there are two possible endings for the team in question-a win or a loss. I know people two years earlier made similar ""predictable"" complaints about the film ""The Natural,"" even though the novel had it end the opposite way the film ended.It isn't possible to make a film about a sports team without a sizeable percent of the audience saying the ending was predicted by them long before it was over. When this film was released, there were surely a few million of the many viewers who early on thought, ""I'll bet they're going to surprise most of the watchers by having the team only come close to winning, but lose at the end."" End the film differently and THEY would be the ones telling us it was ""predictable.""More surprising are the people complaining about this film not being very good because it had too many scenes depicting basketball games. I guess they would hate a movie about Frank Sinatra or Elvis Presley's lives because ""there was too much singing.""One reviewer was disappointed they didn't reveal at the end what happened to all the players, and the coach, after that year. Perhaps that person doesn't understand the definition of FICTIONAL!What I loved about this film is the way the got the atmosphere of small-town basketball, at least in Indiana, correct. At an hour and 54 minutes, they couldn't do too much to develop characters more without taking out most of the basketball action. Sure they could have done a few things better-what movie couldn't?The two biggest changes I would have made would have been to skip the one romantic scene that wasn't important to the story, and not had all the gyms depicted have a vertical U.S. flag hanging backwards, with the stars on the top right for people to see. I have seen some arenas that do hang them incorrectly, but I believe everyone shown in this film was hanging wrong.But as made, it's surely one of the best sports movies ever made. It's better than most of the baseball dramas-which I say even though baseball is my game and basketball not even close.",Hoosiers
27,RNMorton,Okay so this one chokes me up too,10,27 August 2006,"I don't think there's any question that this movie is the best basketball movie EVER (even better than the classic Teen Wolf), and certainly up there for best sports movie of all-time. I start getting choked up about 20 minutes in and it goes all the way to the end. Hackman is fabulous in sometimes understated role as embattled coach for small Indiana high school, I don't know if there's ever been a sports movie tour de force like Hackman in this one. The period stuff is spot on, the music fantastic and the supporting cast (particularly Hershey) wonderful. My favorite moment, of many moments, is when Hackman gets thrown out of at the end of a game so Hopper can coach. So they threw every sports movie cliché and some new ones into the mix, and the resemblance to the facts of the real 1954 Milan championship are stretched to say the least. It's a wonderful time, don't see how it didn't win the Oscar for Best Picture.",Hoosiers
28,hnt_dnl,A winner anyway you look at it,10,1 June 2009,"What's the best sports film of all time, you ask? Well, it's debatable, but I'd rank HOOSIERS high up there. Coming out in 1986 (the dated decade!), HOOSIERS still holds up remarkably well thanks to really great cinematography and set design. It really looks and feels like 1950s Indiana, even today. Without overdoing the period piece aspect and focusing on small town life and hometown values, HOOSIERS is a top-notch movie. In particular, the film is incredibly fast-paced.All credit goes to the great Gene Hackman, who plays dejected, displaced, and disgraced Coach Norman Dale from a big-time college program, who must take a downgraded high school coaching position as head coach at Hickory High School, the Huskers. Hackman exudes credibility as a no-nonsense, firm, yet sensitive man at the crossroads of his coaching career and his life. This actor could do it all by just being himself! Coach Dale arrives in the small town of Hickory, Indiana circa 1951 and immediately faces disdain and uncertainty upon his arrival. The small towners see him as a big-city guy who looks down on them and won't fit in. The locals question his coaching tactics and even challenge his authority directly at times. But Dale sticks to his guns and instills discipline and toughness into the promising basketball team. In particular, Dale shows particular interest in Jimmy Chitwood, a pure shooting guard who at first is not on the team, but then decides to re-join them on the condition that Coach Dale stays.Dale also has an initially rocky relationship with local Myra Fleener (well played by Barbara Hershey), who isn't very crazy about basketball and thinks education is more important. Best Supporting Actor nominee Dennis Hopper plays town drunk Shooter, whose son is on the team. Hopper almost steals the show, but I still think this film belongs completely to Hackman, especially with 20+ years of hindsight.Special mention should also go to the young men who played the Hickory Huskers. Really a band of unknowns who I don't think any have become famous since this film, the fact that real teens (and basketball players) played these characters helps make HOOSIERS all the more authentic.Of course, you have the obligatory happy ending, but it all fits into this gem of a sports film. Really, it doesn't get much better than HOOSIERS!",Hoosiers
29,gab-14712,One of the Best Sports Films!,9,9 September 2020,"Hoosiers is about as predictable as a sports movie can get. It follows the same formula that Hollywood has been doing since the beginning of time: the losing team, the new coach, the obligatory training sequences, the team driving toward its darkest hour before finally heading towards happiness and triumph. Despite the lack of originality, the movie stands out because of its charm, heart, and knowledge that screenwriter Angelo Pizzo and director David Anspaugh interject in their film. The movie understands the role of small-town politics on high school sports; how parents and school councils believe they know more about sports (in this case, basketball) more than anyone else. As a small-town man myself, I agree with how they portrayed the rural, small-town feeling.This is one of those movies that nearly faded into obscurity. The studio, Orion pretty much just dumped the film and offered little support. It was produced on a tiny budget. Little cash was left for the studio to hire anyone for the basketball teams, so they hired locals from Indiana to help. The crowd shots you see are actually legitimate shots from actual games. Even actor Gene Hackman had no faith. He quoted that this movie would be a ""career-killer"" for him. If the filmmakers took a trip to the future, they would find out the movie had financial success, excellent critical response, two Academy Award nominations, and the fact that it is often rated as one of the top sport movies of all time (which is a fair statement).The movie is very loosely based off the 1954's state victory from Indiana's Milan High School. During this time period (and until 1997), Indiana was a state that had its high schools play in one division unlike other states, so that made this championship run unique. The championship game in the film is very similar to the real-life team, even down to exact locations where baskets were being made. The main difference is the season itself. The film's Hickory Huskers were a losing team while Milan's team was a contending powerhouse despite fielding a very small team alas ""the David slays Goliath"" scenario.In addition to being about basketball, the film is also one of those classic redemption films on a smaller, more personal scale. A coach trying to redeem his past and his heart, an alcoholic father of one of the kids trying to redeem himself, etc. The Hickory Huskies are a team that has no heart and no hustle. Coach Norman Dale (Gene Hackman) is hired to help this team turn around. The coach was mired in a scandal in his past and seems to have unorthodox training ways. He also falls in love with one of the teachers in the school, Myra Fleener (Barbara Hershey). Meanwhile, he allows Shooter (Dennis Hopper), one of the player's fathers, to be his assistant coach provided he stops drinking. Will he bring a championship to the team despite the increase in pressure of his personal life?Sorry, Mr. Hackman but this film did not kill your career. In fact, I strongly believed you were one of the film's many highlights. As a coach, he comes across very likable...but there is a complexity within his character. Hackman was able to bring these two traits together. That said, I do not think his relationship worked well with the teacher on the whole. Some interesting scenes, but I did not buy much into this relationship. Dennis Hopper was a very likeable alcoholic and I liked where his character arc went. He allowed some of the film's emotion to take place, and his performance earned him an Academy Award nomination.What lacks in originality, Hoosiers makes up with heart and determination. Pizzo and Anspaugh understood the dynamics of their characters and setting. The film was made with lots of skill and a lot of love was given to this film. I could see the ending from miles and miles away, but its how we get to that finish line that matters. As for sports movie, this is as great as it gets. When you can make deep characterizations within a sports setting, that's when you have something special on your hands. Sadly, the film could have used less one-note relationship scenes. Anyhow, definitely recommend this movie!My Grade: A-",Hoosiers

While I can see that some may enjoy the film, I found it difficult to sit through because I do not enjoy watching/following basketball, and it was just a little too flowery and feel-good for my liking. It's the typical underdog sports story where the team and the coach overcome the hurdles then go to win it all. Very touching, but it did nothing for me.

You have a great lead in Gene Hackman playing a high school basketball coach coming to a small town to turn around a bunch of sad sack losers into a championship team. Overcoming teams from much bigger schools with much bigger players on their rosters. The locations and the atmosphere of the movie was spot on, they had a very bar minimum gymnasium to play in. The emphasis they put on basketball in small town Indiana was perfect since it really is the most important thing to the towns people since a small town like that doesn't have any pro sports teams of their own so they have to latch onto their high school teams.",Hoosiers

All of the rest of the cast perform admirably, also.With the film now 20-years-old, since it depicted events in the 1950's, 30 years prior, it is just as fresh, and even a bit more nostalgic now than when originally released.(An interesting fact to note if you watch the film again: the actor playing Jimmy, the team's super-stat, while athletic, had not been a basket-baller in real life; whereas the shorter young man playing the team's ""scrub,"" was the best in reality, and had to ""act"" to appear less-talented than he was.)",Hoosiers

The description for this movie states that it is based on the true story of the 1954 Milan High School team. Actually, you would have to say that it is VERY loosely based on that team since they have nothing in common.Our story starts with Norman Dale (Gene Hackman in one of his best roles) arriving to the small town of Hickory, Indiana as the new Coach for the High School boys basketball team. The welcome he gets is anything but warm and cordial, and his rough and strict ways behind the whistle doesn't gain him any friends either. Yet, he perseveres ... turning a bunch of no-name guys in a hole-in-the-ground town into winners, both academically and on the court. Before they know it, their dream of playing for the state championship becomes reality. But will Coach Dale and his hopeful players have a chance against the much more talented South Bend Bears?This is a wonderful movie. It will make you want to stand up and cheer. It will invest you into the story, the characters and the team. I saw this one back in 1986 when it hit the theaters and it quickly became a personal favorite of mine. I honestly couldn't even tell you how many times I've seen it over the years, and I never get tired of it.This comes at a very high recommend. The only reason it doesn't get a perfect 10 stars score is because, unfortunately as with other films from that time, it is dated. But, it is still relevant and should be required watching for film students. It captures what is best about movie making, what is best about acting, and what was so important for many youths who grew up in small towns - a chance to be somebody.",Hoosiers

37,WhimsicalVonia,The rare sports film that does it right.,8,16 September 2018,"Hoosiers (1986) 
Director: David Anspaugh 
Watched: 8/20/18 
Rating: 8/10 Gene Hackman delivers one of the most unassumingly impressive performances in his career. The authority and restraint with which he conducts his role as Coach Norman Dale is nothing short of award-winning. His character perfectly exemplifies how a great coach can either bring an ineffectual team to victory or be the downfall of an all-star group of players. Another high school underdog team comeback inspirational sports film? I about I was convinced this was so. Fortunately, I was shown that biases and preconceived notions are- well, exactly that. What makes ""Hoosiers"" succeed is balance. Unlike most other sports films, there is an equal caliber of character and story development both on and of the court (or diamond, field, rink, track, etcetera). The off-court stories could have used some more closure and back story, yes. But they undoubtedly excelled in adding necessary dimension to the characters, which in turn engenders affinity and empathy for them on the court. This is what ails many potentially great sports films: If the audience does not care about the players, how can we care about the game? Indeed, ""Hoosiers"" is about much more than basketball. Yes, most of the film takes place on the court. But it exemplifies how a team sport- a way of life in a small town- can be the center around which so many relationships are based. How- with the most ideal turn of events- it can serve as the magnet that pulls together otherwise antagonistic or insouciant parties. Especially meaningful of these relationships are between Norman and Shooter, Shooter and his son Everett, Norman and Myrna, Norman and Cletus, and Norman and Jimmy. **** Spoilers **** The Kobe Bryant team could learn a lot from this film. I am referring to teamwork, of course. I could quote this film's aphorisms and maxims on teamwork- or I could describe scenes like Coach Norman benching an recalcitrant player despite the fact that it left only four players on the court, but watching this film in its entirety would be the best way to truly grasp its importance. Despite the cliches that are present (Ollie, the team's ""only a body"" shortest player making the winning foul shots in the game that qualifies them for the finals, giving the town alcoholic a second chance), ""Hoosiers"" manages to avoid contrivance and- for the most part- remains sincere. In fact, moments in the film can send chills down your spine. (The scene that comes to mind: Norman handing the reins over to Shooter at a pivotal point in the game and seeing the sheepish assistant coach slowly come to life- from utter self-doubt to celebrating with the team in victory- and then the cherry on top, his son expressing his pride). As much as I did not want to be lured by the inspirational score, I was. And in that last game- at the winning shot that served as the poster child for teamwork- I caught myself clapping. And, yes, while watching alone. Though the outcome is predictable, the way in which the story is told still holds some surprises. Unfortunately, much of this is sensationalization by Hollywood. Hickory never existed, in fact. It is based on Milan. A very rare event for someone as adamant about authenticity and truth as I am, I actually found myself not wanting to know how inaccurate this film was. I wanted this Coach Norman Dale to be real. I wanted this idealized comeback from an underdog middle-of-nowhere Indiana high school team to have really occurred. I wanted this to be proof that teamwork and hard work really wins. And some of it is true. But only some of it. ""Hoosiers"" is by no means perfect, but is an exemplary sports film that is not only emboldening but entertaining to watch, basketball fan or not.",Hoosiers
38,mOVIemAN56,Solid Sports Drama,9,19 March 2005,"(Possible Spoilers)Hoosiers is the definition of a well-rounded, strong sports movie. Taking place in southern Indiana where basketball is life, a new coach named Norman Dale (played by Gene Hackman) takes over as coach of a small town high school team in Hickory. Within his first ten minutes of coaching two players have quit. Things don't start out well, the team only has six players. Soon, however, the team rebounds and a new player joins up with them, Jimmy Chitwood (based on the actual player for the state championship team Milan, Bobby Plump), and things go up. Coach Dale soon finds an assistant in a drunk towns person named Shooter. Throughout the film we watch Coach Dale deal with everything from being booted as coach to helping Shooter get over his alcoholism to constantly being the underdog.What else is there to say, Hoosiers gives a person the real-sense of what high school basketball is and how it's a persons life in some places. The movie is well-acted, well-written (even though over forty minutes was cut) and well directed. The only problems with the film I had was that the events actually took place in 1954 and the actual school name is Milan. these details are small and don't have any effect on the movie.All in all see Hoosiers. 4 out of 5 Stars.",Hoosiers
39,bix171,Good Performances Outweigh No-So-Good Everything Else,6,27 November 2002,"Some of our finest performers (Gene Hackman, Barbara Hershey, Dennis Hopper) are terrific here but David Anspaugh's high school basketball Cinderella story works more like a industrial motivational film promoting teamwork, which it does all the way up to its conclusion--and then it abandons the concept in favor of the individual heroics that's been chastised throughout. Anspaugh tries to cloak his rah-rah enthusiasm by setting his story in 1951 rural Indiana (it's based on a true story about the 1954 Milan Indians, the smallest Indiana school to ever win the state championship), projecting a more innocent time so that this type of story can be conferred the status of legend. But the contemporary (for 1986--it's very dated today) synthesized score by Jerry Goldsmith gives it away and Angelo Pizzo's misguided screenplay doesn't trust its own premise, leaving the viewer confused and a little skeptical. Still, there's plenty to admire in the committed performances by the leads: regardless of the spacy script, they insist on delivering top-notch work, even though the filmmakers don't deserve it.",Hoosiers

Some of those issues play a pivotal role in the movie such as Dale hiring Shooter (Dennis Hopper), a former basketball star who's now confined to being the town drunk and father to one of the players. Another one being that Dale has only eight, not twelve team members, which includes the equipment manager (no pun intended).As for the games, the tension is so real that you could feel like that you're there, watching the game unfold so quickly. Plus, I couldn't help to admit that it was certainly heart-pounding, without a doubt. The movie's photography, shot by Fred Murphy (""October Sky"") with such excellent skill, makes the appearance of each gym and even the landscape takes your breath away. Also, the musical score, composed by Jerry Goldsmith, is definitely authentic and I'm left wondering why it's not available on CD.""Hoosiers"" is like the ""Rocky"" of basketball in a certain way, but by looking at these underdogs for a moment.

41,jb_campo,Inspiring David vs Goliath sports story and more,8,22 May 2017,"Hoosiers is one of the best high school sports films ever made. Made me think of Bobby Knight because the story follows a washed up coach Norman Dale (Hackman) who gets one last chance to coach because of a personal friendship with the principal at Hickory HS. Like Knight, Hackman lost his job because of anger problems. He comes to Hickory to seek redemption.Hoosiers excels at so many levels. The cinematography is beautiful and breathtaking, capturing the local community and nature with wonderful shots of being alone in mid America. Hackman also gets isolated when he lets the locals know in no uncertain terms that HE is the coach, not them, and that they better let him be. Hackman delivers a masterful performance with his smiles and easygoing yet tough exterior. He uses charm to get his way, but he uses his tough character to teach the boys that he's serious about coaching them to be great.Barbara Hershey's character is more complex. A local who left and came back. She seems stuck in the mud, at time literally, in this little community, this little school of 84 kids. Never going anywhere. Makes you kind of think of George Bailey in It's a Wonderful Life. Hershey is not as good an actor as Hackman by any stretch, and she had trouble keeping up with him. Also, the screenplay with their relationship left me wondering if that part made any sense.Hackman guides the team with help from a recovering drunk played wonderfully by a young Dennis Hopper as Scooter. He's terrific, and offers another challenge for Hackman to overcome, especially because his son is one of the stars on the team.The team improves when Jimmy rejoins the team after a personal tragedy. He's a star and immediately lifts the entire town. They fight and claw and battle and give it their all. Can they go as far as they are challenged to go?Like MacFarland or Friday Night Lights or other sports comeback flicks, this one will leave you cheering. I think the end could have been a bit longer and more played out. Plus the Hershey/Hackman relationship could have been revised a bit. Otherwise - great film. A classic basketball film that will have you cheering. Enjoy.",Hoosiers

43,heisenberg12,More Poetic Than Just a Sports Movie,10,2 March 2021,"Hoosiers is more poetic than a movie about competitive basketball. On the surface, many viewers will rightfully focus on the inspirational sports story, but underneath of it is poetry in motion, the story of redemption, faith, self belief, and the beauty of basketball the way it was born to be played (and this is based in the 50s or 60s).Hackman, stellar as always, delivers one of his finest and most memorable performances, never short on heart and poignancy. He nails every syllable of every line of his dialogue. The music is all-time historically great, a score that is up there with the top 10 scores of all-time easily- a classic, masterpiece level score.Unlike if it were made today or recent years, where they would be shallow on character development and thick in on-the-court action, Hoosiers builds characters, setting, scenery, and dialogue to deliver not only a classic sports movie, but one of the greatest movies of all time.9.7/10",Hoosiers
44,rhinocerosfive-1,"""Well, we're way past big speech time.""",7,25 November 2007,"This is a sweet, gentle fairy tale, full of nice writing and subtle performances. The good kind of sports movie, it mostly allows the game to serve as a tool of the story. If the end is not difficult to guess, still it is a thrilling emotional journey. This is quite a trick with a handful of clichés as your plot points; but pros can pull it off, and there are many jobs well done on this production.The photography is in a lovely muted palette, and the design is exquisite. The Midwestern landscape has rarely been quite so Norman Rockwelled by a movie. The games look like old Life Magazine Ektachrome prints come to life. The town and especially the school are straight out of the American collective memory. Barbara Hershey is complex and fascinating; the ball players break your heart; Gene Hackman wisely does not try to be likable, instead bleeding loss and hope from his scuffed leather jacket. My dad always liked Dennis Hopper as a wasted father figure - ""Rumble Fish,"" ""True Romance,"" ""River's Edge,"" this - so it's hard for me to fault ""Hoosiers"" for trading shamelessly on the inherent melodrama of the situation. The relationships are economically revealed, conservatively developed, and satisfyingly hokey without very often becoming unlikely. There are only two things really wrong. One is the ""Airwolf"" synthesizer score that crashes in the 50s heartland like a flying saucer on crack. Two is the equally dated easy-out of a series of montages instead of a third act. Come on. That's using condiments as food. Because of this hurry, several scenes in the second hour are more scaffolding than story.But when it's good it's very good, which is most of the time; more often, I think, than David Anspaugh's other Sports Underdog Who Achieves Momentary Greatness movie. I mean ""Rudy,"" not ""The Game of Their Lives,"" which I'm not likely to see because I'm an American and could care less about real football.",Hoosiers

Fighting against everyone to defend is unique style of teaching basketball, he slowly starts seeing the results of his efforts and get people on his side.

46,arthurclay,Best basketball movie ever made,10,4 May 2005,"I have seen it more times than southern people have been UFO's. It's a true story of a basketball coach who led his little high school basketball team to victory against all odds. Coach Norman Dale (Gene Hackman) is a former college basketball coach of the Ithaca Warriors who turns up in French Lick, Indiana to coach their local high school basketball team. He has a checkered past and a history of causing trouble. Right off the bat he gets into it with Barbara Hershey who is a teacher who becomes acting principal when the former one has a heart attack. Hershey doesn't like Dale at first but gradually warms up and becomes his ardent supporter and romantic interest. The townspeople don't like the Coach at all either and try to get him fired to no avail. But Dale has a recipe for success and it shows quickly when his team keeps winning and winning. I must say all the performances are terrific the best being Hackman and Dennis Hopper in his best role as Shooter, an alcoholic dad of one of the players who loves and knows basketball better than anyone and who Hackman recruits as assistant coach. Hopper is pure magic and it's touching to watch him with Hackman as Dale cares about him and won't give up on him. If you haven't ever watched this one do so it's an inspiration.",Hoosiers

It's the old story - right out of the British comic books, where a team of speccy geeks and fatties take on the Brazilians at soccer and win.This film, admittedly well put together, is full of these clichés. The only part I didn't predict was when at the town meeting, the star player suddenly decided to side with the coach. No reason was ever given. It seemed like a very strange thing to do seeing that everything was going his way hitherto. Maybe he just felt sorry for the poor guy.Gene Hackman plays a locker room Popey Doyle. I am sure that an actor of Dennis Hopper's calibre found nothing particularly challenging about his role. The same can be said about Barbara Hershey.All in all, a film full of clichés that might have been done a lot better than it was.",Hoosiers
48,kergillian,"A strong, feel-good movie",7,14 June 2001,"This film is entertaining, well-written, and definitely one that will get you cheering for the team! The down-side is that it's at times melodramatic and overly-tear-jerking and uses almost every sentimental cliche ever written at least once. While there are some great lines ('God wants you on the floor, son') there are also some *horribly* cliched lines as well ('I've wanted to kiss you since the moment we first met!')Gene Hackman is fabulous in this, as the former college coach turned Navyman who comes to small town Hickory, IA to coach basketball. And being from Bloomington, I can vouch for the frenzied obsession we of Indiana have for basketball;), so it was no surprise to see how unwelcome he was in town with unorthodox methods and bing an outsider as well (always a good kicker for a plot). Add the loss of then best player in town, who decides not to play ball that year, and the challenge is on!But the plot slips away too much at times. The Dennis Hopper as an alcoholic former basketball star who is given a chance to be an assistant if he cleans up plotline could have been interesting; but his 'agonized' moments on the floor dragged on too much, and the plot turned sour when he relapsed, and was eventually discarded and never resolved properly (save for a sloppy and cheezy heartstrings moment where his son declares that they'll move in together when it's all over, -snif-snif-snif-). As well, the shameless and worthless attempt to inject romance into the film stuttered and failed...Barbara Hershey playing a colleague who the coach gets off on the wrong foot with and then falls for, is too typical and rated barely a glimpse or two in the overall story. Why bother?? It was a subplot that had absolutely nothing to do with the story, hardly had any screen time, and was never properly dealt with. It was just wasted screen time.Still, the film as a whole is worth the cheeziness of some parts. The ending is predictable, but in a heart-swelling way. Sure, some of the scenes are a bit too long and jerking, but in the end it doesn't matter because it just feels right. It's handled as well as possible, considering it has to be Hollywood, even in little Hickory. A solid film, could have been better, but not by too much. 7/10.",Hoosiers

When they get a new coach (Gene Hackman), his tactics fall foul of the locals at first. He's a tough coach who wants obedience and commands respect, and gradually over the course of the film, his ways pay off.Thanks to assured direction, solid performances, and an uplifting score from veteran composer Jerry Goldsmith, 'Hoosiers' transcends its cliches in inspiring ways. And much of this is owed to its script that never forgets to flesh out its characters. With a suitably dramatic conclusion, this is a highly recommendable sports film.8/10",Hoosiers

I am not into basketball, I find it rather bland with no real coaching needing. Football is way better because after every play each team gets about 30 seconds to plan their next move, as well as anticipate their opponent's move.

Anyway, this movie was pretty good, even the simple basketball games have you cheering for the small town Indiana team.

55,brower8,Basketball is only the cover...,8,6 May 2003,"In Hoosiers, one gets a view of 'flyover' country -- the part of America that people get through quickly on the way to somewhere else. Small-town life isn't as simple as it looks from urban America, and it wasn't very simple even in the 1950s. Human relationships are as complicated and intense in rural America as they are anywhere else. Just because few people are around doesn't mean that they can't get in one's face (to use an anachronistic term); one can't hide from any personal conflicts that arise from trying to do things differently, and one can't even get away from the town drunk. What is there is there, and one challenges other people's sensibilities and habits at considerable risk to one's happiness in such a place. Small towns allow privacy only at the price of all intimacy, and intimacy only at the price of all individuality. Trust me on this -- I live in a small town just outside of Indiana. Hoosiers gets the visual feel of rural America in the 1950s, specifically Indiana, very well. It's apparent that the cinematography exploits the changing seasons of the Midwest as beautifully as can be done, rivaling Alfred Hitchcock's >The Trouble with Harry< (to be sure a very different movie) in part because preparation for basketball season begins in the fall and that basketball ends as winter gives way to the ugly, nasty time of early spring.The sets are real high schools -- available cheaply because many school districts have abandoned high school buildings once a new, more modern high school has been built. (A little secret about Indiana -- the public buildings of a certain age in rural Indiana are essentially identical in Indiana for each type because such buildings all have the same architectural plan). The basketball sequences are almost hackneyed. How much variety can one get out of winning, even by setting the scene thirty years (now fifty) years earlier)? Basketball is the pretext for personal conflicts -- such as the coach's ideas of how to win and the ideas of the supposed experts in town and that between the coach and the English teacher, who wants the star basketball player to seek an academic scholarship (requiring him to give up basketball) instead of a basketball scholarship, even though basketball is the surest source of lasting esteem in a small town that offers few economic opportunities other than working on the family farm and waiting to inherit the farm when Dear Old Dad dies. Most of all, we have conflict between characters and their worst tendencies -- selfishness, low self-esteem, alcoholism, and anger. Hoosiers is a great movie, one of the best (better than, for example, >Field Dreams<, even if it falls short of >Raging Bull>) of involving sports, because human drama overpowers the sport. Thoroughly unpretentious, it catches rural Midwestern reality very well. It is neither saccharine nor maudlin, and it doesn't require that one be a basketball fan or to have much knowledge about basketball.",Hoosiers
56,Supachewy,Another Corny Sports Film,5,6 September 2010,"The sports film Hoosiers is directed by David Anspaugh and stars Gene Hackman, Barbara Hershey, and Dennis Hopper. The film takes place in 1951 Indiana.The film starts off with Norman Dale (Hackman) coming to a high school in Indiana to coach the team and also teach. He is not welcomed very warmly by the town because of how they are not used to change. Dale has not coached basketball for twelve years due to the fact that he was in the marines. At first the basketball season goes quite poorly and everyone in the town thinks that it is because that Jimmy, the town's best player, is not playing on the team because his mother is sick and that his father died. The local drunk of the town, Shooter (Hopper), knows much about the sport and becomes Dale's assistant coach. The two of them try and lead the team to a successful season and maybe a championship. Yippee!The screenplay was written by Angelo Pizzo and is one of the corniest films I have ever seen. How does someone make a true story feel so fake? It feels so formulaic in how that the team is down but then they come up and then they go down again. It seems like Pizzo just read the guidelines for how to make a basic sports film. There was just too much on the side of the sports story that makes it feel fake. For one is how suddenly the coach and Myra Fleener have a relationship out of nowhere and it really has no effect on the film at all. Another is how at every game they win with only three seconds left and it is really lucky. I've seen many basketball games and that really happens. So the screenplay for this film is poor.The direction for this film by Anspaugh was also poor. He helped create the fakeness and corniness that is felt throughout the film. The only thing I can say that he did well was get good performances out of his actors, but I have a feeling that since Hackman and Hopper are some of the greatest actors there are they just gave good performances without the help of Anspaugh. It also annoys how directors think that when they have shots of beautiful scenery it makes them a good director. It is not that hard to do that and it is not something for a director to be proud of.As I said in the last paragraph the acting was pretty good. Hackman played the coach and he gave a funny yet motivational performance and kept the film entertaining. His character did not have that much depth so Hackman couldn't really give that much depth so that is why Hackman couldn't really give a great performance. Hershey's character I truly believed had no purpose in the film besides being an unneeded love interest for the coach and she did not give a memorable performance what so ever. Dennis Hopper is the only one that really shined in this film as the drunk man trying to get his act together to be the assistant coach. When he performed best I believed was when he was forced to coach when Hackman was kicked out and his nervous face was just so funnily brilliant. I think he deserved his Oscar nomination and he made the film.Overall I give this film a 5/10. I would have given it lower if it wasn't for Dennis Hopper's performance. I would recommend this film for anyone who enjoys the sports genre.",Hoosiers

All of those movies had a little more than just plain sports. Whether it was a mans ascent and then descent from greatness, or a man losing out on a dream by the actions of a vindictive coach, or the effect of money on professional sports. In Hoosiers, there is not much content. It didn't even seem as though the movie had a beginning or an end. There was no character development, all of them were forced on us.

63,Slim-4,This is one of the greatest sports movie ever made and scores on several levels.,9,5 February 2000,"This is a beautiful film that offers much more than the usual sports action. It tells the story of a tiny Indiana high school whose basketball team soars to great heights in the Indiana State High School Basketball Tournament.Gene Hackman plays a coach with a checkered past.  Ultimately, we find out about his past.  Dennis Hopper, an avid basketball fan and the local drunk knows but doesn't tell.  Barbara Hershey finds out and the story is revealed in the stubble of a cornfield as they talk.  Hershey plays a local girl who has come back to teach school after going away to college.  ""Why'd you come back to Hickory?"", Hackman asks her in one scene.  She doesn't tell him.  I wish she had.  Her character is very enigmatic and is perhaps the most interesting in the movie.  The character has unusual depth.  She is a substitute mom for a local basketball star. She wants him to focus on his studies and to get away from Hickory and basketball.  She doesn't understand the importance of basketball to everyone around her.  It appears that she may even resent the importance that her parents' placed on her brother's basketball experiences.  Resentful or not, she too attends the games to cheer the team on.  Her enthusiasm for the game and the team is more muted than most, however.  There is a deep ambivalence in her character.Dennis Hopper delivers a terrific performance as Shooter, the former high school basketball turned drunk.  In one scene where he is describing an upcoming opponent to Hackman he is almost poetic.  Hackman offers him a chance for redemption when his assistant coach (Sheb Wooley) becomes ill. The film offers us an opportunity to cheer for Shooter's redemption as well as the team.  Hopper plays the role with sincerity, humor and emotion. There is a touching scene late in the film in which he and his son interact before the big game.  Shooter who is now in the hospital must listen on the radio, but the film doesn't forget him.I particularly enjoyed the visual aspects of this film.  The film's opening scenes of Hackman driving through the rural Indiana countryside are some of the most beautiful images ever put on film.  In one scene he stops at an intersection on a narrow road.  There is a prettly little white church and a lot of corn.  Otherwise, there is nothing.  He passes a barn where some boys are playing basketball against a makeshift basket and backboard.  This establishes at the beginning the importance of basketball in Indiana. Throughout the film there are beautiful scenes that showcase the Indiana countryside.  The film deserves credit for showing Indiana's beauty against the backdrop of Winter.The film found an beautiful old elementary school at Ninevah, Indiana to serve as the exterior for the Hickory High School.  The school was closed several years ago because of asbestos contamination.  The last time I saw it it was a wreck.  The windows were broken and the building was surrounded by broken bricks and glass.  I almost cried. There is an intimacy in the basketball scenes that is missing from most sports movies.  The gym at Hickory reminds me of my old home town at Winlock, Washington.  The gym at Hickory, like the one at Winlock, has a dim, boxlike quality which roars to life on game night.  In the final scenes the game loses this intimacy as the team goes to Indianapolis for the finals.  Hackman realizes this and tries to help his team realize it's just another gym.  He has them measure the distance from the foul line to the basket and the height of the rim.  ""Same as at Hickory"", he says.I also enjoyed Jerry Goldsmith's musical score for this film.  There are beautiful cues to help us appreciate the beauty of rural Indiana.  There are also pulsating themes underscore the sometimes tense basketball.This is a great film which can be enjoyed on several levels.  It has great characters, a wonderful script and awesome visual values. I watch it over and over again and have never tired of it.",Hoosiers

When we were done with it I saw that it lives up to its reputation. It is a classic movie based on a true story about a small school in rural Indiana were basketball is big. It follows the journey of a coach who has a very good reputation for his coaching skills, but hasn't coached in a very long time. This movie teaches you what can happen if you work hard and never give up on anything.

70,leczorn,A great portrait of Indiana high school basketball's glory days!,8,27 April 2005,"When I heard that a movie was being made about Milan (Indiana) High School's improbable 1954 boys' basketball state championship54, I was excited. Not only because I, like most Hoosiers, love basketball but also because of my family connection to ""The Milan Miracle,"" as it's widely known. One of my uncles, Bob Wichmann, was a member of that team. MHS was by far the smallest school to win the championship in Indiana's 87 years of single class basketball. I was really looking forward to see who they were going to choose to play Uncle Bob!When I learned around the time of the movie's release that it wasn't going to be be an actual biography but merely inspired by the Milan 1954 team, I was disappointed. Shortly afterward, on my 16th birthday, my maternal grandparents - Uncle Bob's parents - took me to see the movie at a theater. I didn't dislike it but I had a hard time being objective about it because it was something other than what hoped it would be.But I recently gave ""Hoosiers"" another shot. I bought its two DVD collector's edition - largely for the bonus features - and saw the movie for only the second time ever and the first time in 18 years, a little over half of my life. The second time, I managed to view it simply as it is as opposed to my original expectations and I enjoyed it much more.""Hoosiers"" in a fictional story about the 1951-52 Hickory High School team. The Huskers are coming off a solid 15-10 season but are now in disarray following the death of their coach and the subsequent departure of their best player, the painfully quiet Jimmy Chitwood (played by Maris Valainis).Their new coach, Norman Dale (Gene Hackman), arrives after practice for the new season has already begun. Dale is a former college coach who has spent the last 10 years in the Navy and his tenure with the Huskers gets off to a bad start. Two of the team's seven remaining players quit during his first practice - though both end up returning - and he alienates much of the town with his dogmatic philosophy and sometimes abrasive style.Among those not pleased with Dale is fellow teacher Myra Fleener (Barbara Hershey) who thinks that basketball is over emphasized and academics are under emphasized. She and Dale clash a few times early on, which means, of course, that they end up falling in love.The season starts off badly for the Huskers and a town meeting is soon scheduled to decide whether to fire Dale of keep him. Fleener has discovered that he was fired from his college coaching job for hitting one of his players but doesn't reveal that information and speaks on his behalf. Still, the audience seems largely unmoved.It looks like Dale is about to be fired but Chitwood enters like the calvary and, speaking for one of the few times in the movie, says that he is ready to return to playing but will do so only if the coach stays. Dale's job is saved and from there, the team improves greatly and becomes a state championship contender.You can probably figure out what happens in the end, but the movie works the underdog formula to perfection without being overly cliché.The performances in ""Hoosiers"" are great, particularly Dennis Hopper's best supporting actor Oscar nominated role as Shooter, the father of one of the players. Hopper does a phenomenal job of acting like a basketball crazed drunk, though I thought it was a bit much for Dale to make him an assistant coach. That is one of a few cases of over Hollywoodization in this movie.And where I think the movie succeeds the most is in portraying Indiana's unique love for high school basketball. Many non-Hoosiers who see the movie probably think that the residents criticizing the coach on the street, the caravan of cars traveling to away games, the emotional town meeting on the coach's fate and the general hysteria are an exaggeration. That is not the case.High school basketball in Indiana was an obsession for several decades and still is, though to a lesser extent. Many small towns passionately embraced the local high school team, which was often a point of unity, identity and pride.One other strong point about the movie, the late, great Jerry Goldsmith's adrenaline pumping music heightens the emotion of the game scenes down the stretch.The collector's edition DVD set also contains three bonus features that I think are worthy of mention here:*A 29 minute documentary about the making of the movie, the Milan '54 story and Indiana's love for basketball.*The 1954 state championship game between Milan and Muncie Central. I'm almost 100% sure that the commentary is done by Tom Carnegie, who was been the voice of the Indianapolis 500 since 1946. Tom was the commentator on the ESPN broadcast of the game last year.The game footage is far from great but it's not bad and it's good to have any at all. The audio quality is shaky. But it's great to finally have this monumentally historic game easily available.*Several deleted scenes, introduced by director David Anspaugh and writer Angelo Pizzo. In my opinion, a few of the scenes were unnecessary but many should have been included. One of those scenes gives insight in Buddy Walker's (Brad Long) return to the team and several others give deeper insight into the romantic relationship that developed between Dale and Fleener. Pizzo and Anspaugh said they wanted to include some of those scenes but were told by the movie company to make the movie under two hours.In conclusion, I now greatly enjoy ""Hoosiers"" as fiction and its new collector's edition DVD set is a great buy for any sports movie fan! 8/10.",Hoosiers
71,zwrite2,Too formulaic to be great,7,24 July 2008,"If ""Hoosiers"" was the first movie I'd ever seen, I'd give it a 10.This movie has all the elements of a great story. It's, on the surface, an exciting movie depicting a shorthanded boys basketball team from a tiny high school that is inspired to overachieve by a middle-aged coach seeking redemption. Most viewers surely root for the players and coach.In addition, ""Hoosiers"" has, on the surface, many very interesting external and internal character conflicts. The coach, played by Gene Hackman, battles the town's old-timers, who are resistant to outsiders and anyone with new ideas and methods. The coach also battles players unaccustomed to working hard on defense and passing as well as a teacher/assistant principal who is more interested in academics than sports.The stories of a drunk ex-basketball star being given a chance to be an assistant coach and a star player who won't join the team until he respects the coach are also, on the surface, compelling.""Hoosiers,"" though, is not the first movie I've seen. In fact, I've watched plenty of movies that have excellent stories like ""Hoosiers"" does, but also have way more depth beneath the surface. In short, this movie is way too formulaic and unsurprising to be great.How was ""Hoosiers"" unsurprising? As I watched Hackman's character meet and argue with the teacher played by Barbara Hershey, I jotted down a prediction that they would have a romance. Check. As I watched the principal tell Hackman that Jimmy, who was not on the team, was a great player, I predicted that he would return to the squad and lead it to the championship. Check. And, obviously, I knew Hackman would win over his players and the town.Nevertheless, ""Hoosiers"" would have been outstanding if it had depth and more interesting characters. ""Rocky"" was formulaic in many ways, but it had quirky characters who were developed, surprising and compelling scenes, and passionate dialogue.""Hoosiers,"" though, didn't thoroughly develop characters like Jimmy and the assistant coach played by Dennis Hopper, dealt superficially with subplots, and had dialogue that had the feel of trite coach sportspeak rather than moving in-depth conversations.Defending the film's formulaic nature by saying it's based on a true story just doesn't cut it because it is NOT close to being non-fiction. In fact, I wonder how people came to believe the movie was based on reality.Wikipedia's list of differences between reality and ""Hoosiers"" is very long. This might be typical, but the movie's two major premises differ from reality. The real coach was not a hotheaded middle-aged single guy and Milan High was a preseason favorite, not an underdog.I know my review focuses on the negative. This is because I am trying to make the point that ""Hoosiers"" had a chance for greatness, but came up short.The truth is that ""Hoosiers"" is still a pretty good movie. I give it a 7.ZWrite",Hoosiers
72,brittonwayne-287-425268,One of the best sports films ever,10,30 June 2020,This movie is very inspirational and has been used for years by coaches to inspire their players if they ever find themselves in an important game or match in which the odds are stacked against them in a contest where the opponent is superior and has every advantage.

73,jsataluri,Greatest Sports Movie Ever!,10,29 December 2005,"I've been a huge fan of Sports movies, but Hoosiers tops them all! This is the greatest sports movie ever, with a spectacular performance by Gene Hackman who plays a coach with a troubled past that transforms an average looking high school basketball team from Indiana into state champions. And to do this, he makes them work really hard. At first they are all frustrated but once a kid named Jimmy Chitwood joins the team, they start winning games and reaches the state playoffs and defeat an all black- team to become Indiana State Champs! Other noteworthy performances are by Barbara Hershey as a teacher who can't stand basketball and won't let Jimmy play; but eventually Jimmy joins and she falls for Hackman, and Dennis Hopper as one of the players' drunken father who knows a lot about basketball and becomes an assistant coach. This is probably Hopper's best performance and I think he should have definitely won the Oscar for best supporting actor.Let me say that this is definitely one great movie that families should watch. My advice to athletes whether in high school or college should believe in themselves. Good luck will never come your way unless you believe that you're good and you're willing to give it your all to win it all.10 out of 10! Must see!",Hoosiers

75,Vash_ebas,A movie about leadership and teamwork,8,24 December 2010,"If not for a Leadership workshop, I would not have known about this movie. About 10 years ago I went to a one week leadership workshop. The instructor showed us half of this movie as an example of a leadership style (Coach Norman Dale's). It was so interesting that we asked to see the rest of the movie. It did not disappoint. Recently I watched the DVD, and paid attention to other aspects of the movie- like acting, which was superb. Cinematography, score all very good. Since this is an old movie (1986, but seems older), you don't see some of the technical advances in movie making, but the story is straightforward, and the movie focuses on the story and the characters. Gene Hackman is great as the coach. Others support him well. The sound is not very good, and the DVD did not have the English subtitles (only French and Spanish, which did not help, obviously). It was hard to hear the dialog clearly at times. I had to watch the movie for the second time on the DVD to fully understand it. Other than that, this is a very good sports movie about small town folks in Indiana in the 1950s, and their kids in high school, with their dreams of winning basketball games. If you don't expect to see some fancy technical things that are now being used in movie making, this is definitely worth seeing if you enjoy sports, and stories focused on characters.",Hoosiers
76,hartig,A stunning portrait of Indiana basketball...,10,14 August 1999,"Growing up in Indiana, I've had the pleasure to experience ""Hoosier Hysteria"" my entire life.  High School basketball is something special around here - much like High School football in Texas.  In addition to being a heart-warming film about second chances and overcoming staunch adversity, ""Hoosiers"" gives the rest of the world a glimpse into the treasured tradition of Indiana hoops.The two main characters pay homage to this tradition.  Norman Dale - standing outside a raucous arena and about to enter his first game as an Indiana HS basketball coach - sighs quietly ""Welcome to Indiana Basketball."" Myra Fleener (Barbara Hershey) gives a nail-on-the-head speech about star basketball players in Indiana.  They are indeed treated like gods.  Old stars like Bobby Plump, Oscar Robertson, Larry Bird, Rick Mount, Steve Alford, Glenn Robinson, and Damon Bailey were (and still are) at god status in Indiana.  As you travel into the smaller towns in the state, you find that each one has their own local hoop heroes from days past.One other interesting tidbit about this film were the casting choices of Hackman and Hopper - both of whom were at relative low points in their careers upon embarking on this project.  The film's obvious themes of redemption are lived out by these two Hollywood icons as they both found resurgence in their careers after ""Hoosiers.""Yes, I loved the film for its story and uplifting themes.  But I also love the representation of the greatest basketball state in the country.Note:  In 1997, the Indiana High School Athletic Association convened to decide the future of single-class sports (including basketball).  Milan High School's former star Bobby Plump, the inspiration for Hickory's Jimmy Chitwood, became a vocal critic of the IHSAA's decision to move to multi-class basketball.  The move was mostly championed by small schools like Milan.  In the end, the small schools won the fight and ""Hoosier Hysteria"" as we've come to know it died the following year.",Hoosiers

78,MrBallroom,A Basketball CLASSIC for the Ages!!!,10,23 August 2005,"If ever there was a basketball film that made you stand up and cheer, this one is it! Gene Hackman was simply brilliant in his portrayal of Norman Dale, the once failed college coach who gets another chance to make a mark for good. This is a film about redemption, about second chances and about coming together. It is a film about life itself. Perhaps this is why writer Angelo Pizzo said emphatically, ""This is NOT a sports movie!"" It all begins when Norman Dale is hired as a replacement for the previous coach who had died, and the blatant hostility that small town Hickory, Indiana gives him as part of his welcome. The locals complain that he has 'unconventional' coaching methods; he has closed practices in that the local townspeople are not allowed to attend; he has a specified regimen he expects his players to adhere to; and his word is law on matters pertaining to the team. All of this while the best player sits out because Norman is not ""the old coach"".Keep in mind that Norman has been out of coaching for a while and has learned some life's lessons along the way. He's smart enough to learn  as I did  that athletics for almost all of us is a means to an end, and that most of use basketball or other sports either for increasing skill, or learning lessons that will help us in our lives after high school or college, and that we are not going into the NBA upon graduation.The townspeople get restless and want results, and as Coach gets results, the tide begins to turn and the locals begin to see the long-range vision of what Coach had in mind all along.Co-starring with Hackman is Dennis Hopper (in an Oscar®-nominated role) and Barbara Hershey as one of the teachers/vice-principal who learns there is another side to the coach, and in the process we see all the things that make this not a sports movie.HOOSIERS is indeed a modern American classic that will be more and more treasured over time. It is well worth the purchase price and a welcome addition to any film library.On a scale of 1 to 10, I give this film a 10/10. ***",Hoosiers

Within the classic, all-American story-line of the underdog overcoming incredible odds to achieve greatness through hard work and sacrifice, Hoosiers gives the audience a unique inside look at the game of basketball as well as a glimpse of  small-town life in the early '50's. Beautifully written and scored by the same team that brought us ""Rudy"", well cast and acted from top to bottom featuring, perhaps, Dennis Hopper's finest performance, I feel Hoosiers will continue to delight and inspire for long time to come.

This movie is a great example, of what some college and high school coaches go through today. College coaches often take a year or two to implement their system and style of coaching. It oftentimes does not lead to wins right away, but building a winning culture takes time and this was on display in the movie. Gene hackman was sensational and really captured the adversity his character went through as the head coach of Hickory. The whole town was against his vision for the game and how he wanted the team to play. Even his team did not buy in until their best player returned to the team. This is another example of an excellent underdog story based on true events. While this movie does not have the fanfare of other excellent sports movies such as Remember the Titans, Bull Durham, Field of Dreams, Rocky, or Rudy, it deserves it. All of the movies listed above I have seen and I loved all of them, but there is something about Hoosiers that resonated with me on a personal level.

It makes for a great matinee.The story was very basic: small town basketball team begins rising through the ranks with a shot at the state championship.

Even though I watched it on a small black and white TV, remember this was 1954, the heart stopping, pulse pounding suspense was almost unbearable.  The movie follows the game fairly well, but there are some inaccuracies.  The school was named Milan, not Hickory, and they played Muncie Central, not South Bend Central.  The name of the hero was Bobby Plump.  I will never forget Plump holding the ball at the center of the court for over 4 minutes with the score tied, and then with 18 seconds left he worked the clock down to five seconds, and then made the shot ""heard round the world.""  Butler Fieldhouse held around 15,000 people, but there are several million Hoosiers who claim to have been there that night. Hackman and Hopper were marvelous in their respective roles, but they really don't represent the real coaches at Milan.

91,zackbutson,A solid sports film,8,5 June 2010,"Let me start by saying the best aspect of this movie besides it's factual basis is the acting. Gene Hackman was a great choice to lead the film, but the star of the show was Dennis Hopper. He was perfectly casted as an alcoholic sports fanatic, who later became the team's assistant coach. Nothing he does is surprising because everything fits to a tee exactly what he brought to the role. Hopper really brings emotion out of you and gives you a character you think of as a proud father, rather than an alcoholic bum. See this for the late Dennis Hopper alone.Hoosiers is far from perfect. I didn't enjoy the soundtrack at all. Most of it seemed like it was taken right from Rocky IV or A Nightmare of Elm Street sequel. While the story line is a goodie, it seems to just focus on B-ball. They only go briefly through Hackman's background while also ignoring all the kids except Jimmy and Hopper's son. I believe the film would of benefited by being a little longer.It was a powerful film that has may moments that are sure to always be in your memory.

The story begins with a man whose fallen from grace as a high school basketball coach who we later learn had lost his job years before for getting physical with one of his players. Now his second chance will come into play in Hickory, Indiana he will have to coach a team of 6 kids and with unfriendly folk who just want to get rid of him before he even begins coaching the team. Gene Hackman is incredible as a distant, yet dedicated to what he is doing athletic coach. Barbara Hershey turns in a great performance as a villain in the first half and an unlikely love interest towards the second half of the film. That second part is probably the film's only flaw I thought it would've just been more believable the two become great friends until maybe the last scene. Don't be mistaken this is a feeble section of an amazing movie about redemption, the glory of high school sports some say -God. I haven't even mentioned the sub-plot involving the late great Dennis Hopper who should've gotten that Oscar for his nomination as an alcoholic father of one of boys on the team. This one would have ganered the Best Picture Oscar night that year had it not been for another small but powerful movie named ""Platoon.""

Yet, its scenes are presented with a wholesome authenticity that somehow makes its message seem fresh, despite all the formulatic elements.  This is achieved predominantly through the incredible screen prescence of Hackman and Hopper.  Especially poignant is the scene in which Hackman intentionally gets himself thrown out in order to force Hopper to pull himself together and take responsibility.  In this part and others, Hackman's dry wit and Hopper's nervousness remain fully convincing.  This is one of those movies that will keep its ""magic"" even if you have - like me - been watching it an average of 3 times a year since you were six years old...even to the extent that I'll still get a little teary-eyed in the last scene.",Hoosiers

It's what life looked like when I myself ""came down to this planet"" in the late 1940's and experienced my teens in the 60's.The old school with high ceilings and gleaming wooden floors, the gyms with the gold-toned wall-tiles, even the hospital scene with the nurse in her starched white uniform -- all evoke a peculiar beauty that you no longer find today.There is even a scene where a young teen girl yells ""NO!"" to an unjust referee call, and her pointy glasses and pony tail look so much like me back then, it feels like a glimpse into a parallel dimension.I'd say this is a must-see experience for people my age -- although all ages can thoroughly enjoy the basketball action.I'm glad for the social progress since then.

Having grown up in Indiana, and having been part of more than one caravan to watch a high school basketball game, I know of no film that captures the heart and spirit of the Midwest -- let alone Hoosier basketball -- like Hoosiers. One sign of a great film is the ability to drop in at any time and be absorbed in the film. This is such a film. And yes, it's about a lot more than basketball. It's about new beginnings and overcoming hardship and adversity and second chances -- and in that respect it is a quintessentially American film. It's worth revisiting every NCAA season.",Hoosiers

101,Hades06,One of my all time favorites...,10,2 June 1999,"Hoosiers is not only the best sports-oriented movie ever, it is a great movie on its own merits. It really began the ""underdog sports team overcomes the odds to become champions"" genre that is recycled all too often. The genius of the film is simple: it's not about basketball, or sports, or coaching; it's about standing up for what you believe in. It's about personal convictions that cannot be sacrificed due to pressure from others. It's about redemption (both Coach Dale's and Shooter's) and forgiveness. These themes are universal and transcend the vehicle used to perpetuate them, that of a basketball team. The individual aspects of the film itself are equally impressive. The performances by Hackman and Hopper are second-to-none. Jerry Goldsmith's score is rousing, memorable, and catchy. The game scenes are shot and edited with masterful precision. And the players are all likable, memorable personalities (despite their short screen time). All in all, a great film that should be added to all personal libraries.",Hoosiers

Based in part of the story of how tiny Milan upset mighty Muncie Central in the 1954 Indiana state championship game, the movie is inspirational.  Hackman and Hopper give great performance as a coach looking for redemption, and his drunken assistant looking to do the same.  There's also sweet-shooting Jimmy Chitwood (a thinly veiled nod to Plump) who ever good ole Indiana boy like myself wanted to be.At it's heart this is a movie about David overcoming Goliath, and of characters redeeming themselves in the face of incredible odds.  It's your classic inspirational sports movie that also manages to capture the feel of small-town Indiana incredibly well.  A darn good flick.",Hoosiers
105,antlop628,Brings back memories,10,8 April 2002,"Okay, maybe I'm biased, having played basketball at a school barely larger than Hickory High (their enrollment was 64, mine was 82) but Hoosiers is one of the best sports movies I've seen in years.  So what if it's obvious how it's going to end? Or whether the events seem improbable?  Whoever wrote the screenplay knows life in a town like Hickory - how everyone wants to meddle in the team's affairs, how high school basketball is everything to such a town in the winter, and how kids grow up idolizing the local varsity and hoping that one day they will lead the team, and therefore the town, to glory.  The reporters, the cameras, the crowds all lend an Indiana flavor to high school basketball that isn't found outside the rural midwest.  Folks growing up in California or Massachusetts can't imagine the attention the general public and media give to high school basketball but, believe me: in the midwest, it's real.The story is based loosely on the 1954 Milan Indians, who knocked off Muncie Central 32-30 in the final.  The similarities end there.  Milan was small - around 150 students - but they were supposed to go far in the '54 tournament, having advanced to the state semifinals the previous year (losing to South Bend Central) and bringing back much of that team for the '54 run.  Along the way they beat Oscar Robertson's Crispus Attucks team, which won the final the following year.Hackman is terrific as a coach seeking redemption, teaching his wayward pupils discipline and strategy.  Hopper deserved his Academy nomination in his role of the town's wayward soul, also seeking redemption but having no idea how to achieve it.  Hershey gives a good performance as the teacher suspicious of the outsider like most of us small-town folk appear to be at first.Not every high school has two thousand pupils, and many public high schools like Hickory still exist; although they seem to have vanished from Indiana (Milan consolidated and now enrolls over 300) there are plenty in the northern Great Lakes and the Great Plains. Hollywood seems to have forgotten the small high school and rural life in general.Every March, this movie still inspires countless players and coaches to rise to the challenge while all around them think they're overmatched and outgunned.  That is the legacy of ""Hoosiers.""",Hoosiers
106,HarveyBerger,More than just a sports movie,10,27 November 2005,"Yes, it's VERY loosely based on fact. Yes, there are a few errors in continuity. But this is less of a sports movie than a people movie. There is a central challenge that the characters revolve around and forces all involved to a triumphant conclusion. Remember that despite the basis in history, the basketball is more metaphor than fact. It's really about be better side of human nature. This is one not to be missed. There is no disappointment here. Gene Hackman turns in a solid, understated performance that shows why this Oscar winner continues to excel in his profession. Dennis Hopper (as an alcoholic basketball fanatic) brings both humor and pathos to a fan and father who has lost his anchor. The emotional side to this film could be overwhelming if not for the central story, that of a very small basketball team as David in the drama. Coupled with beautiful but understated cinematography this film will still stand above the crowd for many years to come.",Hoosiers

It's hard to see a flaw in this film, i was amazed at the dimension of u.s school basketball culture, and how it's importance in people life is displayed in the movie with absolute credibility.I also got to see a couple clichés during the movie (but the movie turned out to be so good that i actually think it may very well be the one movie that started them) and a couple scenes that should be a cliché in today's movie-making. Probably what i loved the most about the movie was that it's not pretentious at all, and these days that's so common that it's a relief to see a great movie not relying on forcing the movie in any way (music, nudity,violence,drugs,etc) and been as powerful as this one is.

109,stacieb75,Perfect 10!,10,31 January 2005,"This film is a classic! What more can you say about Gene Hackman but pure brilliance in ""Hoosiers."" The story line is one that perfectly depicts not only small-town and rural life, but small-town and rural attitudes. Having grown up in a rural area near a town of 300 people, I can tell you that this movie accurately depicts life in a small-town even in 2005! Sure, the cars and buildings have changed since the story of ""Hoosiers"" took place, but the values and the sense of community have not. Perhaps that is the greatest lesson in this movie - that community is something to be proud of and participate in. Having moved to a large city, I miss the Friday nights where the entire town shuts down to go to the high school ball games, I miss the Saturday mornings spent discussing the games, and the rest of the week preparing for the next game. I miss the anticipation of meeting up with friends, young and old, over a good game on the hardwood while cheering on the hometown team. But I also can tell you that the way Norman Dale was treated as an outsider is absolutely true. If you are not from a small-town or born and raised there, prepare to spend a considerable amount of time proving yourself. While the sense of community is bold, breaking into that community isn't as easy. It takes someone of bold character, thick skin and determination to break into that community - but like Norman Dale, once you do, you too can become the hometown hero!",Hoosiers
110,IronHillbilly,Another Great Underdog Team Finds Success Movie!,8,15 April 2005,"After watching Coach Carter and reading many reviews that make a comparison between that movie and Hoosiers, I decided I wanted to take a look. What I found was pretty much what I have read elsewhere. Coach Carter is pretty much the same story as Hoosiers. I am not sure if Hoosiers was adapted from a true story or not, as Carter was, but never the less, the movies are very similar.Norman Dale (Gene Hackman) is the new coach hired by an old friend to give him a second chance. Dale has been banned from coaching college basketball due to slugging out one of his own team member (apparently, one he liked). Of course, his past comes back to haunt him but not before he can get his players to trust him and inevitably help him not to lose his job.Dale was doing a good job getting his team ready, going back to the basics and working on the fundamentals of basketball but his team was not enjoying much success in the beginning. After the town's star player, Jimmy (Maris Valainis), comes to play for him, the final piece of the puzzle falls into place.For the record, I hate basketball. Can't stand it but something about sports movies, whether or not I like the sport, I just can not get enough of. I could watch a badminton movie if it was done well. I guess I like the whole underdog thing. I liked Hoosiers enough to give it a good review despite what I feel about watching the game itself. Coach Carter was good, too, but not as good as Hoosiers and to be honest, I would never have thought of seeing Hoosiers if I did not see Coach Carter first.

The progression of life was as unique to the town as a constellation is to the sky.  The past was never really the past in this town, for it was always living in the present along with it's future, which caused time to balance in it's own blissful state-no care, no need to care.  Time knew that the town would grow on it's own watch.  It was the type of town where thoughts were lost, but memories lived on forever.  Confusion to an outside force or idea was the very organized way to the town. When somebody would come to the town of Hickory, Indiana, they would simply be in awe of how the town could function on such a simple level.  The town folk who saw this knew what the outsider was thinking, but would just kindly simile and not bring news to the thought that maybe life here is not the same life everywhere else.

The coach wasn't a washed up middle aged man, but a handsome young married man with a strong faith in God.The best part of the true story was that 9 out of the 12 players on the team did graduate from college and that probably had a lot to do with the esteem gained from winning the State Championship.

That is actually the front of the Artcraft Theater in Franklin, Indiana. There was also a gym in Franklin they used.

You owe it to yourself to watch it.A bit of trivia: Watching it just now, I noticed that in the locker room before the 'big game' the coach is discussing the opposing players names, which are written on a blackboard.

The basketball scenes are realistic, the characters are compelling, and the music is the best accompanying score of any movie in its genre. Hoosiers is truly #1.In my spare time, I'm a basketball coach, and I always use Hoosiers as a way to get psyched up for the season, or for a big game.

Gene Hackman is just phenomenal in this film. Coach Norman Dale does everything he can to develop his team HIS way. He takes a semi-decent to poor team in high school and turns them into winners.

It has an excellent cast. The characters are, for the most part, very believable. The setting seemed authentic for the fifties period; although the gymnasium was too small and the home basketball court was way too short (the half court line was only a few steps from the foul lines).

This movie left me feeling that I wanted to watch it again (I've already seen it five times). That's what great movies do to you, they force you to keep coming back. For me, Patton and The Sting were like that. I've seen Patton 15 times and The Sting at least 10. That's why I purchased Hoosiers instead of renting it. I've recommended it to my friends so they can derive the same satisfaction from it that I did. It helps to be a sports fan but not necessarily because this movie was a metaphor for life.

124,panchito-1,Hoosiers is misunderstood,8,26 March 2005,"I have been reading, and summing up comments about this movie. I can't believe how misunderstood this movie is. First and foremost this is not a movie about the Milan team's championship, and Bobby Plump's winning shot. The Milan game is the most famous, and storied game in Indiana and is only used as the quientessential example.The movie is a collection of typical things that happen in Indiana High School basketball which is known as ""Hoosier Hysteria"". The locker room scenes are typical, found each year at tournament time. The small town involvement is typical. Players deciding if they want to succumb to the social pressures of the sport, or dreaming of winning is typical. Teacher nudging is typical. The appearance of religious faith is also typical in small town Indiana. It's right in the bible belt.Smaller, less talented underdog teams are the life-blood of passion about playing, and winning. Winning systems, coaching tactics, fundamentals, and character-building are staples of the Hoosier H.S. game. Read John Wooden's books and you'll see them clearly. (John Wooden-Martinsville, IN; Purdue, and UCLA).The character played by Dennis Hopper is underscored, not by his drunken state and redemption, but by his basketball knowledge. In Indiana, everyone from every walk of life knows more about the history of the game, and how to win the game than the coach. There are walking, talking Hoosier basketball historians in every small town.Another Hoosier staple is the sequence of the tournament. Every march since the 1920's the Indiana H.S. tournament starts with a sectional, regional, sweetsixteen, and final four state championship. Hence, all games and scores that were shown in the movie. Although, Hickory H.S. is fictictious, the opposing team names were real Indiana schools in the western part of the state: Jasper, Linton, Logootee, etc.The movie actually tried, but fell short in my opinion of the excitement at tournament time. The noise level, and absolute excitement of the H.S. tournaments is something you have to experience. Just walking into the gyms gives you chill bumps. Being the local game night hero is paramount, (but it creates it's own special problems.) I firmly feel, having experienced it myself, that the movie makers were trying to capture a unique phenomenon in sports using typical events. They displayed the key aspects of Indiana H.S. basketball in film to communicate the experience to the rest of the world.I was pleased, and excited to see how many reviewers were inspired by the film. Many who lived these events over the years are similarly motivated.P.S. Coaches do not kiss teachers except in Hollywood.",Hoosiers

There is no sex no violence and no foul language and it gives everyone a great warm feeling. The actors do a great job of making you feel like it really was filmed in the 1950's.

126,rpeck-68440,Living The Dream!,8,4 December 2015,"David Anspaugh's Hooisers is a classic, despite the predictability of the film. It illustrates the concept of the underdog dream by showing not only what is seen in successful teams from the outside, but what also happens behind the scenes. Using a high school basketball team to focus this discussion of the underdog story, the film expresses how difficult the obstacles are to achieve such a feat, as some people could possibly see it just as a lucky miracle. At the end of the day, the film hopes to show what must happen to accomplish such a hard goal, and also to show what the key to success is in order to achieve that certain goal.The movie successfully demonstrates teamwork as the moral. Teamwork was simply the result from the support that they gave to each other which resulted in their championship season. This team could not win for the life of them before that crucial emergency meeting, in which the support from the community finally came out for the head coach. Look where that got them! They became champions. This film is a perfect guide on how to accomplish that mindset of teamwork by connecting all the tiny details into our daily lives.

He had read about it and seen the trailer on TV, and wouldn't take ""no"" for an answer. So, I relented, took that Friday afternoon off, and we went to the theater for the first showing.Just as the title credits started to roll, with Gene Hackman driving through the early autumn Indiana countryside toward his date with Destiny, Jeff laid his head on my shoulder and promptly went to sleep -- and slept throughout the entire film. He had apparently gotten so excited over the prospect of seeing the movie that exhaustion overcame him, as it will with children. I didn't have the heart to wake him up, since I knew we could come back again -- and by the time the movie was over, I knew that I would indeed be seeing it again...and again, because it was plainly one of the all-time greats. It was the best sports movie I had seen up until that time, and it still is. In fact, it has legitimate claim as the best American movie ever. It incorporates all that is unique and good in American culture, and does it better than any other film has ever done. It is a magnificent artistic achievement, quintessentially American and an inspiration to everyone who sees it.Jeff forgave me for not waking him up -- but not before we went back the very next day. He immediately agreed with me on its greatness. Every time he comes home now, we watch it together, and marvel at its perfection.
