0,SnoopyStyle,Nice actresses in coming of age movie,6,8 June 2014,"Tibby (Amber Tamblyn), Lena (Alexis Bledel), Carmen (America Ferrera), and Bridget (Blake Lively) are lifelong friends from birth. They find a second-hand pair of jeans that magically fit them all. They are separating for the summer but vows to stay connected by sharing the magic pants. Lena has a Greek holiday with her Greek relatives. Bridget misses her dead mom and is away at soccer camp. Carmen is meeting up with her dad (Bradley Whitford) but he surprises her with a wedding to girlfriend (Nancy Travis). Tibby is stuck working the summer and finds Bailey (Jenna Boyd) passed out in the aisle.The biggest fundamental problem for this movie is that the girls spend most of the movie apart. The point of these types of movies is for the group to develop chemistry together. This one assumes the chemistry and split the girls up. There is a reason why the best story is Tibby and Bailey. They are actually allowed to build up a relationship. Lena's story probably the weakest. It's way too light like a frivolous Greek holiday movie. The biggest asset in the movie are the four girls plus Jenna Boyd. They are all charming. They are all compelling actresses. Each one has something to contribute to the movie. The best scenes occur when the girls have a heart felt one on one. All in all, this is a sweet melodrama.",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants
1,claudio_carvalho,"A Sweet Tale of Friendship, Love and Loss",8,21 December 2008,"Tibby Tomko-Rollins (Amber Tamblyn), Lena Kaligaris (Alexis Bledel), Carmen Lowell (America Ferrera) and Bridget Vreeland (Blake Lively) are best friends since they were children. In the beginning of their summer vacations, they find a pair of jeans that fits each one of them perfectly; they decide to share the pants as a magic symbol of their friendship and form a sisterhood with a manifesto of ten rules. Bridget travels to a soccer camp in Mexico and she has a crush on the coach Eric (Mike Vogel), who is older than she. Lena visits her family in Greece and has a crush on the local fisherman Kostas (Michael Rady) and finds that there is a feud between their families. Carmen travels to South Caroline to spend the vacation with her father and she finds that he will marry the divorced Lydia Rodman (Nancy Travis). Tibby stays in town working in a department store to raise money to buy new equipment for her documentary and is befriended by the twelve year old Bailey (Jenna Boyd) that is very ill. After their vacations, they grow-up and their friendship remains solid as never.""The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants"" is a sweet tale of friendship, love and loss of four girlfriends. I saw the good sequel in a flight two days ago, and both movies are great. The chemistry among Amber Tamblyn, Alexis Bledel, America Ferrera and Blake Lively is amazing and they really seem to be close friends. The movie is delightful, the performances of the actresses are fantastic, but I particularly liked the dramatic and never corny relationship between Tibby and Bailey. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Quatro Amigas e um Jeans Viajante"" (""Four Friends and a Traveling Jeans"")",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants
2,ComedyFan2010,A well done teen movie where pants don't matter all that much,8,18 April 2019,"Four friends find a pair of pants that magically fit them all and have them keep them in touch on the summer vacation.When it came out I read the premise and thought it was stupid. So I didn't watch it. But for the years after whenever I saw it I kept on wondering what is the deal with those pants. So when I saw it on Netflix I decided to watch it expecting something ridiculous.But I was pleasantly surprised. This is a better kind of teen movies. They show different issues one can face, really genuine characters, great acting and most importantly the value of friendship. The pants are not some crazy ""magic"" they just keep the stories together.I really liked the characters. Lena's story was pretty good, I loved the setting in Greece. Carmen's story with her father was so well done and acted it made me cry. Tibby's story was so well done. It also included another girl character, Bailey who I think was really well done. Acting itself was good but I also loved her dialogue. She seems too mature for her age and yet it fits so well.It is a chick flick and a teen movie but it is really well done. I think if I had watched it back then I may have liked it even more. Not surprisingly all the actresses had some good careers afterwards,",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants
3,Boba_Fett1138,"Be aware, it's a chick-flick!",6,5 August 2008,"It must be really hard to make a chick-flick. Take a couple of young female leads, some strong and some insecure characters, throw in a couple of love stories, preferably one about a forbidden and/or impossible love, some personal problems and death and you have basically all the ingredients you need. But then again, all genres are of course more or less like this. Throw in a couple of scares in a horror movie, some explosions in an action flick, etcetera. You just either dig a genre or you just don't. Chick-flicks are obviously just not my thing.Of course chick-flicks are more or less all the same, because they feature all of the usual ingredients, which I just mentioned. The movie also knows this, so it tries to throw in an original concept about a pair of pants that travels between 4 different befriended owners, who are spending their summer holiday for the first time away from each other. To me this whole pants thing just felt like an excuse to connect all of the 4 different stories within the movie, which are focusing on the 4 main characters.Basically when you put 4 episodes of a random similar American TV-series in a row, you'll have a movie just like this. The story features all of the- and as much drama as you could expect.Still the movie is not an horrible one and yet is also knows to become an original one with its approach and story, which in my opinion is mostly due to the leading actresses of the movie. They give the movie some life and emotion. It's also no coincidence that these actresses are leading ones in some successful TV-series, of which some got launched after this movie, while others already had a successful television career prior to this movie. They are also acting well with each other in this movie, which makes them look convincing as a group who has been friends since childhood. I especially liked Alexis Bledel very natural seeming acting style for this movie, even though normally I'm not a too big fan of her acting skills in many other things. Basically credit needs to go to all of the leading actresses but lets also not forget the young Jenna Boyd, who is a child-star that isn't annoying for a change and can also really act, as she proofs in this movie, with a very difficult and hard to play role at such a young age (She was only around 12 at the time of this movie.).Thing with chick-flicks or most romantic movies for that matter, is that they pretend to be just like life and realistic with its story and approach but of course life as portrayed in these sort of movies just isn't true. You could say that the movie are 'falsy-realistic'. But apparently this is just a thing to seems to attract (teenage)woman, making these sort of movies and this movie in particular also a perfectly watchable one for them.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants
4,neil-476,Teen chickflick with a lot more to it,8,19 July 2015,"After being together since they were kids, four teenage girls spend their first summer apart: Bridget (Blake Lively) goes off to summer soccer camp, Carmen (America Ferrera) goes to stay with her Dad and meets his new family, busy arranging his new marriage, Lena (alexis Bledel) goes to Santorini to stay with her grandparents and meets Costas without realising there is a Montague/Capulet relationship between their families, and misanthropic Tibby (Amber Tamblyn) stays at home working in the local store where she meets a younger girl who has a profound affect on her. The girls determine that a pair of jeans which mysteriously fits them all is a kind of magical link, and they mail them back and forth between each other.The jeans are no more than a fairly cheesy and obvious device, and are fairly irrelevant to the four threads, during which each of the young women discovers something about herself and moves forward.The four girls are all very good (Blake Lively is spectacularly beautiful), the scenery in the Greek and soccer camp sequences is gorgeous, and Nancy Travis (as Carmen's new stepmother-to-be) creates someone you can easily dislike and then turns you round with a single look.Although this is nominally a chickflick, there is plenty here to enjoy if you are (for instance) a Dad in his 60s.

5,anaconda-40658,Sisterhood Unite.,10,23 June 2015,"Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants (2005): Dir: Ken Kwapis / Cast: Alexis Bledel, Blake Lively, America Ferrera, Amber Tamblyn, Bradley Whitford: Extraordinary teen drama about the bonds of friendship. Four girls are about to go separate ways this summer yet during a shopping spree they discover that a single pair of pants fits them all so they decide to mail them to each other throughout the summer. Alexis Bledel visits grandparents in Greece and is romanced by a fisherman whose family name is cursed by her family. Amber Tamblyn remains home working at the supermarket where she hopes to establish herself as a documentary filmmaker. America Ferrera visits the father she only sees twice a year only to learn that he is engaged and hasn't time for her. Blake Lively goes to soccer camp and pursues the male coach. Bradley Whitford plays the absent father of one of the girls and he is getting married. His daughter becomes distant over the neglect. Directed by Ken Kwapis with great location shots in variety form depending upon where each girl has departed too. This is one of his very best films and an improvement over the likes of Dunston Checks In and The Beautician and the Beast. Easily one of the best teen oriented films of the year and a must-see for the intended audience. The pants represent the friendships that go through much and still survive the summer.

6,gradyharp,A Surprisingly Fine Little Film About Adolescent Growth,8,14 October 2005,"THE SISTERHOOD OF THE TRAVELING PANTS (if you haven't read the novel by Ann Brashares) sounds like another silly, goofy chick flick, a made for summer popcorn movie for teenage girls to love and teenage boys to tolerate. But the title should NOT prevent the general audience from experiencing a truly tender, warm, balanced film about four teenage girlfriends bonded by a magical pair of jeans.There are four stories here, each centered on the summer experiences of the four girls who go off in different directions and discover a lot about themselves and life: Lena (Alexis Bledel) follows family ties to Greece, encountering 'tradition vs love' with Kostas (Michael Rady, a newcomer whose looks and screen presence bode well for a fine career!); Bridget (Blake Lively) finds a balance of love and soccer in Mexico; Carmen (America Ferrera) explores family ties and body image in a new stepmother; Tibby (Amber Tamblyn) works the summer in 'Wallmans' and pursues her passion for documentary film-making which just happens to include a real life drama. So why do these simple tales make a movie? Each of the girls represents the delicate issues that teenagers encounter as they move into adulthood, and the manner in which director Ken Kwapis intertwines these stories through the common bond of the four girls' friendship works on every level.There is a sense of fresh talent, fresh writing, fresh direction, and sensitive acting that make this movie one to be recommended to a large audience. A fine little coming of age film. Grady Harp, October 05",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants
7,siderite,"If you are a man, don't watch it. Other than that, pretty good.",6,2 July 2005,"Don't get me wrong, this is a good movie. It portraits that period of adolescence towards adulthood that is so intense for all of us, female or not, without clichés like American high schools, evil women adversaries or sex-minded male fiends. This is based upon a book and, as it is norm in Hollywood, it shows by having a reasonable script. However it does show the lives and thoughts of four girls and this is clearly an audience splitter. So you would see it if you either are a woman, preferably with other women around you doing that female bonding thing, or a man that wants to make a nice surprise for his girl.The four entwined stories are interesting enough, well created characters and the whole movie is pretty well directed. You will not watch this for movie quality, though, so I won't even pretend to analyze that. Now, at my age, I think that if I would have watched this (and understood it) at 16, maybe I would have known what women are about. So if you are a deep 16 year old, you might want to try it. Let me know :)",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants
8,Smells_Like_Cheese,A good coming of age film,8,16 May 2008,"The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants, what I expected to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen, I couldn't believe it, I'm going to be honest, a hater of chick flicks(I'm a girl by the way), I actually loved this movie. I was so shocked that I actually enjoyed this movie throughly. Scary enough, every girl I could relate too: the Greek boyfriend, the suicidal mother, loosing a close family member to leukemia, and the neglectful father. It was disturbingly psychic to my life, but I think that's why I enjoyed it so much is that this movie wasn't unbelievable in any manner. No, I haven't read the book, not sure if I would read it, but I do know that I would recommend this movie to my friends. It's funny, smart, realistic, cute, and just makes a great story for the harder times of growing up and becoming an adult.Tibby, Carmen, Lena, and Bridget are four friends who have grown up together, they call themselves the sisterhood who have found one pair of jeans that magically fits them all. Tibby spends her summer making a documentary and befriends a sick little girl who shows her that it's OK to care about people. Carmen spends the summer with her dad who has almost ""upgraded"" with his new marriage and shoving it in Carmen's face. Lena is spending the summer in Greece with her grandparents and has an unexpected forbidden romance with a cute guy. Bridget is going to camp practicing her non stop stardom in sports and chases after a coach which she's not supposed to do. But they mail the pants to each other and write letters in the summer that they have officially grown up.The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants was one of those pleasant surprises for me, because even though it is a very girly movie, it's very real and doesn't over do it. We haven't had a good coming of age movie in a while, so this is a perfect film for the family as well as teenagers. Will the guys enjoy this film? Not the action lovers at least, but I'm sure that any film buff could find the true heart of the film and just fall in love with The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants, it has good acting, great stories, and makes you remember the scary time of growing up. The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants is a recommendation for me, this is a non miss movie.8/10",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants
9,cherold,decent for a chick flick,6,22 June 2006,"I had zero interest in seeing this movie, but my girlfriend insisted. When I read a review long ago that said this movie was about magic pants that fit a bunch of different girls, I thought they were just making a joke at the movie's expense, but no, that's really what it's about, and that is about as chick flick a premise for a movie as you're likely to come across.The movie is rather slow and annoying in the set up, as you have to watch these four girls grow up and bond in a cloying manner. But things pick up once they begin to pursue their separate stories. The stories themselves are not fleshed out by any means, and it really feels like little bits of stories, but they are somewhat affecting. The one standout story is of Tibby and Bailey. It's the least clichéd, Jenna Boyd gives the best performance in the film, and the emotion is affecting without being too forced. The other stories are just decent. I like Alexis Bledel, and I thought she stood out a bit more than the other girls, but that may just be because I'm used to her from The Gilmore Girls.Overall I did actually enjoy this and don't regret seeing it, but it is about as chick flicky as you come (and this from a guy who always watching the Gilmore Girls, remember), although better than a typical one.My girlfriend loved it.",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants
10,MLDinTN,the movie for teenage girls,7,19 May 2006,"This movie was OK, but not a lot happens. It's target audience is for teen girls, so I might have liked it more if I fell into that demographic. It's about four girls who are best friends buy a pair of jeans that fits them all. They decide to mail each other jeans during the summer while they are apart. And to to send a letter telling the best thing that happened while wearing the jeans. Each girl has her own story and does her own thing from meeting a guy to making friends with a sick girl to dealing with parents.It's not a comedy, strictly drama. It would have been better if it had some funny moments.FINAL VERDICT: Decent for a serious teen movie. It'd probably be good to watch during a slumber party.",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants
11,callanvass,"Excellent coming of age film, Your able to care about each woman.",8,6 February 2010,"I actually enjoy chick flicks, and it's weird, because I'm a guy, but I just do. Sisterhood of the Travelling Pants is one I enjoyed immensely. It's main strength is the development of the characters. It stays true to the book, and wisely gives the movie enough time for us to see what each girl is all about. It takes the risk of throwing too much sappiness, but in the end it turned out to be just the right amount.I'll go over the characters, and what I thought of them.Amber Tamblyn-Tibby. Surprisingly is the one who I didn't relate to as much as the rest of them, not that I didn't care about her, just not as much as others. She kept to herself a lot, not showing much of her feelings. I really enjoyed the storyline between her and Bailey. It was cute and heartbreaking at the same time, and I enjoyed watching Bailey help her open up.Alexis Bledel-Lena. is cute as a button as Lena. It's kinda ironic how she was afraid to love, because that is how I am in many ways, so i could really relate to her. Her strict rules with Yia Yia and Papaou, made for an engaging storyline, and I really thought her and Kostas had a real, and engaging chemistry together.America Ferrera-Carmen. Is a talented Tennis player, who feels very Uncomfy with her dad's new family, and has to deal with her dad, neglecting her. She was pretty likable, and I felt bad for her, when she felt out-of-place with the family.Blake Lively-Bridget. She is quite the looker, but also a great actress, who manages to make Bridget likable, with a sense of sass. Trying to overcome the loss of her mom, while finding this cute soccer coach she likes, that is forbidden. I thought this made a great story, and I liked how Bridget's story turned out in the end.Jenna Boyd-Bailey. She's a mysterious at 1st, but once we find out the tragic events she's going through, you will feel for her. Her chemistry with Tabby, was undeniably cute.Michael Rady-Kostas. He's a likable gent, and managed to not be piggish like many fellow guys are.Familiar names such as Nancy Travis, Bradley Whitford,Rachel Ticotin, and Mike Vogel all do well.Bottom line. Sisterhood was a movie that really made me feel good, and that's surprising considering it's a chick film. It will make you laugh, smile, and even shed a tear or two. I'm really looking forward, to seeing what the sequel will do. Highly recommended8/10",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants
12,tabuno,Easily a Classic Juvenile Film Experience,9,23 January 2019,"5 June 2005. The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants may be one of the best young adult(particularly female-themed) movies of the past several years. It may rank with Stand By Me (1986), The Breakfast Club (1985) and can be considered at least along side The Cidar House Rules (1999), The Secret of Roan Inish (1995), Whale Rider (2002), Holes (2003) and even better than The Lizzie McGuire Movie (2003), Uptown Girls (2003), Seabiscuit (2003), The Ice Princess (2005).The openness and the emotional and psychological issues of growing up are exposed with sincere intensity in this movie about the four young girls' experience spent apart from each other (intercut), each to experience something intense. A remarkable, exhilarating and mature send up for the power of female bonding and making personal changes valuable for all who watch this movie.

14,noralee,Almost 3/4 Charming Contemporary-Feeling Teen Chick Flick,6,3 June 2005,"""The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants"" is, like, way above most teen girl movies in showing four strong-minded, heterosexual young women with divergent interests.While they are uniformly middle-class suburbanites, they are not in the usual high school bubble and have some life issues to face, like a somewhat more substantive version of the flashbacks in ""Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood."" The magic realism of the used jeans from a thrift shop (see, they aren't mall rats) that fit four girls with three different body types is a sweet way to link their ""what I did on my summer vacation"" as they are turning 17, since they can't I'm or e-mail or text to Baja California and a Greek isle.The film is only as strong as each girl's story, so it's almost three-quarters successful.As she was in ""Real Women Have Curves,"" America Ferrera, as the writer, is the stand out, physically (upfront in her voluptuousness), ethnically and linguistically (wielding her Spanish like a sword), and learning to channel her anger without compromising her spunk in dealing with her divorced dad.Blake Lively, a new actress closest in actual age to the characters, plays a type of young woman we are only beginning to see in TV and movies, a Title IX baby who is very much not a tomboy as she combines her awesome athletic prowess with her sexuality like a cruise missile, jail bait or not. So I was disappointed that the lesson she learns is that her single-minded competitiveness, in either field of action, is criticized like a boy's would never be in a film and is negatively attributed to her mother's suicide, as both a grief tool and anti-inherited depression insurance, as if endorphins rushes are, like, a bad thing. But isn't her behavior the exact kind that the experts say women need to develop in order to succeed? I wonder if it's screenwriters Delia Ephron and Elizabeth Chandler, regular chick flick writers, or original author Ann Brashares who so meanly would prevent this striking young woman from ever being a CEO? No wonder what she learns doesn't help her depressed dad at all.The other two are more conventional. Amber Tamblyn, sadly no longer to be ""Joan of Arcadia,"" doesn't quite cut it as a goth but her determination to make a ""suck-umentary"" video while she works at a Wal-Mart clone (a quirky take on ""The Good Girl"") at least looks very contemporary.Not surprisingly the tale that fans say has been changed the most from the book, ""Gilmore Girl"" Alexis Bleidel's portrait of the young artist is the weakest, the most conventional, the least interesting or even believable. Though it is nice to see on screen another girl who is at least supposed to be a hyphenated ethnic American, the ""Big Fat Greek Wedding"" clichés about such relatives are not avoided.The secondary characters are considerably weaker, except that it's nice to see Rachel Ticotin, even briefly as a down to earth mom. Bradley Whitford is just opaquely one-note as the neglectful dad, and poor Nancy Travis's stereotyped chirpy fiancée is just wince-able, even if her Southern accent weren't inconsistent.Another character has a groan-able case of Movie Star Disease that is eye-rollingly melodramatic, contradicting her character's sprightly storytelling abilities before vanishing like the Cheshire cat.Evidently it's the magic of the jeans that redeems the characters with Y chromosomes as these guys are extraordinarily gentlemanly, especially the college students, above and beyond their call (and evidently somewhat more so than they are in the book which fans are attributing to the PG rating). Only one gets to be more than a cardboard hunk, an amusing Asian video gamer who is quite charming on his passion.I did stay through enough of the credits to appreciate that three-quarters of the behind-the-camera workers were female, though Ken Kwapis was a surprising choice as director.The production design was appropriately suffocatingly pink and red, but that didn't explain why the cinematography had to look quite so sun-bleached to the point of whiting out - to recall distressed jeans perhaps? The song selections on the soundtrack are not particularly illuminating.I don't see why anyone who wasn't once or will be a 16 year old girl would go to see this movie, even with the usual end-of-date bribe.",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants
15,cultfilmfan,The Sisterhood Of The Traveling Pants,5,9 June 2005,"The Sisterhood Of The Traveling Pants, is based on the novel of the same name by Ann Brashares. The film is about four friends Tibby, Lena, Carmen and Bridget who will each be spending the summer away from each other so one day they are at a store and they find a pair of pants that fits all of them so they agree that these pants will keep each other close and that they will send it to one after the other in the mail to bring them good luck. Tibby stays home during the summer and works at a local department store. She is also filming a documentary featuring people she meets around the town. One day she meets a young girl named Bailey, who follows her around and tries to help Tibby with her documentary. Tibby at first finds Bailey very annoying but soon she grows on her and she likes her company. Lena, goes to Greece to spend the summer with her grandparents and while there she meets and falls in love with a guy who she soon finds out she is not supposed to see because her family had a fight with his family years ago. Carmen, goes to visit her dad and while there finds out he is living with another woman he plans on marrying soon and her children live with them. And, Bridget goes to Mexico for a soccer camp and while there falls in love with one of the instructors who she tries to show off in front of to get him to like her. All these stories are connected to each other and all the characters are connected through the summer by letters and the pair of pants. The Sisterhood Of The Traveling Pants, has good performances by all four actresses but I did not really like this movie. I didn't feel we got to know the characters well enough and would have liked a little bit more character development. I also really did not like the character of Bridget, and while she is walking around flirting and strutting her stuff I wanted to smack her. The film also got really sappy and tried to make the viewer cry and often but it did not work because it felt too forced and manipulated. The film's ending was also unrealistic and just felt like the filmmakers wanted to make everyone happy by making everything work out and everyone happy but it just didn't work and felt silly and unbelievable. This film may appeal to younger girls but it really didn't do anything for me and four good performances were wasted.",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants
16,fernandoschiavi,Its is not a movie for girls only. Because it addresses issues that it is difficult not to identify with the questions and situations that the protagonists go through,7,6 February 2021,"Who directs this teen drama is Ken Kwapis, known for the TV series ""Grounded for Life"" and ""Malcolm"", and for the films ""He's Just Not That Into You"" and ""License to Wed"". Scripted by Delia Ephron (Nora's sister and co-writer of Message for You) and Elizabeth Chandler, the film does exactly what it promises: an almost televised version of prosaic youth situations. Four womb friends are spending the summer apart for the first time in seventeen years. While Lena (Alexis Bledel) will visit her grandparents in Greece, Carmen (America Ferrera) plans to spend the entire summer with her father for the first time since the divorce. Bridget (Blake Lively), on the other hand, will go to a girls-only soccer camp in Mexico and Tibby (Amber Tamblyn) will remain in her hometown working in a supermarket chain and recording her documentary. On the eve of the separation, they discover in a store a pair of jeans that in a strange way fits all of them, with their different physical types. Fascinated by the possible magic, the four friends decide to form a brotherhood around the pair of pants and share it during the holidays. Each, then, would be entitled to a week with the jeans in the hope that good things would happen when they used it. It does not take long for this period to take a course very different from what they imagined and that will lead them to take actions that will strengthen their faith and friendship.The script, just like in the book, ends up interspersing each individual sub-plot in an interesting way without letting the film get lost or making one of the side stories less interesting. As soon as one of the stories starts to get boring, it is cut to a new point in the adventure of another of the friends. This editing, although conventional and a predictable solution for the script, gives energy to the film and makes its duration above average not a negative point. The film starts off absolutely disastrous by showing a totally mushy story of friendship in adolescence, but soon gains quality when knowing how to dose clichés with fun scenes in the right measure. Both Ken Kwapis and the writers are measured, direct and succinct. There lies the strength of the film, which miraculously escapes the histrionic stereotypes for teenagers. Without aiming to give moral lessons, the film only follows the rhythm of four lives still in formation and their natural confusions.On these trips, the girls discover some values, like that of first love, the lack that a mother makes in the formation of a girl, friendship and family. The main cast, formed by young and talented actresses, helps to enhance the production. The argument, simple and banal, is developed in a sensitive way, making Quatro Amigas and a Traveling Jeans exciting in the right measure, passing away cheap sentimentality most of the time. Without underestimating its target audience, the production works as a clever portrait of women's afflictions during their most confused period. Summer marks, for the protagonists, a time of radical transformations and the film manages to honestly pass on these conflicting feelings to the viewer. Jeans - which, mysteriously, fits all - are a metaphor for the self-confidence shared by all. When wearing the piece, these friends feel each other's support and manage to overcome some decisive obstacles in their training.Although the fact that friends, so different in character and taste, is inseparable, is forced to create four distinct worlds and four unequally interesting stories. The truth is that two of the four stories (Lena's and Bridget's) are far less interesting. Lena is a closed girl who will evidently find love and in the background we still have the story of rival families and forbidden love, in the best Romeo and Juliet style. Bridget, on the other hand, limits herself to trying to win over another boy and when she succeeds, she starts to feel empty and goes into a semi-depressive state for trying to fill the space that her mother had left, but having failed despite trying not to remember her so much during the holidays. These two plots are limited to getting a new boyfriend or not (although there is a bad existentialist disguise in all of this). Certainly, the most interesting stories are those of Tibby, who seems not to care much about things, but who finds the girl Bailey, who has leukemia, an important life lesson and an unexpected friendship, and Carmen, who has to get used to your father's new family. These two stories are more complex and demanded much more from their interpreters, who responded well at all times.Delia Ephron and Elizabeth Chandler write a direct script and are very pleasing. Behind a silly script and a teenage film, he brings dramas worthy of great people. It is clear the target audience that director Ken Kwapis aims to reach. From the casting of the cast (two of the protagonists came out of famous young American TV series and another would become the biggest Latin hit in the United States last season) to the soundtrack, everything is there to please teens. I am not surprised, however, that a portion of the adult audience is charmed by the amusing characters. Unfortunately, towards the end the solutions become too obvious, as well as irritatingly despicable (like the dog that Bridget's boyfriend - Blake Lively - feels - arrives and hands him jeans in the middle of the street, almost magically), in a attempt to satisfy its obvious target audience: teenage girls. Or else Lena's already predictable ending with Kostas. It is true that the intentions were good, but the film is so manipulative that it cannot be ignored as a negative part. On the other hand, Ohn Bailey's photography explores the beauty of Greece, the beach in Mexico and mixes the many daytime scenes with some night scenes. Cliff Eidelman does sensational work on the soundtrack, knowing how to provoke smiles and especially tears in the most opportune situations.Terminal illness, loss of a parent, forbidden romance and absent parents after divorce are difficulties that a young person can face and have been facing in recent years. In the current generation, for example, problems are increasingly common. Despite the treatment given to the film, the seriousness of the subjects remains and it is precisely this certain dosage of lightness and drama that makes this a captivating film. All this with pants as a metaphor for self-confidence shared by all friends. They are all relevant topics and increasingly current or possible to occur, especially with teenagers. Knowing how to move without inducing the viewer is one of the merits of Ken Kwapis, who delivers to the public as a portrait of the concerns and afflictions of girls in their most troubled period throughout life. Although it is a film about women and it may appear only for women, especially teenagers, due to its pertinent and current themes, it ends up reaching the largest number of people possible, generating in the viewer a strong and sincere identification with at least one of the girls. However, all the messages and lessons that Quatro Amigas tries to convey have already been posted so many times, in better, worse, or even the same ways, that it is also difficult to ignore the film's lack of courage to go one step further. The film creates an air of self-importance in trying to deal with issues such as death and separation, but the solutions are, as already mentioned, obvious or magical, that it is impossible not to undercut your intentions.The cast is great and handpicked. Coming from or later to become hits on American TV shows whose target audience are the same as the feature, Amber Tamblyn, who has already been nominated for a Golden Globe and Emmy for her work on the Joan of Arcadia series is excellent on the scene, as well as Alexis Bledel, the eternal Rory Gimore of the Gilmore Girls series who lends her beauty and talent to compose Lena. America Ferrera is fun and capable in dramatic scenes to perfection. She would soon do the series Ugly Betty, and Blake Lively would also soon emerge for success as the Serena of ""Gossip Girl"". In the support cast we have Michael Rady as Kostas, Mike Vogel as Eric and the great Jenna Boyd as Bailey, as the ones that stand out the most. A curiosity is Ernie Lively, Blake Lively's real father, who also plays his father in the feature.The film shows significant changes in the lives of four young people at a difficult stage in their lives, facing new friendships, new loves, accepting facts from the present and the past and learning to move on, being sure of one thing: they will always have each other there whatever. Composed of several beautiful and touching scenes, which move and give us great life lessons and teach us to value other things and understand others more. It comes very close to the level of other classics of the genre and for those who liked the film, you cannot miss the fantastic ""Stand By Me"" and ""Now And Then"".The Sisterhood of the Travelling Pants not a movie for girls only. Because it addresses these issues present in everyday life and in the formation of anyone so sincerely, it is difficult not to identify with the questions and situations that the protagonists go through. The characters are so different from each other and so well constructed that this identification happens naturally, involving the viewer, regardless of age or sex. The work is of these films that are based on the script, albeit with its limitations. The most notable is perhaps not to please all types of audiences, but those who are able to see the delicacy and innocence of the plot, such striking characteristics of youth, will have fun and exciting moments.",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants
17,jpschapira,To change or not to change...,6,9 December 2008,"I don't know why, and many may not approve, but ""Now and then"" has always represented the ultimate girl 'life changing experience' movie, and ""Stand by me"" the same but with boys. I talk about boys and girls, not adolescents. Maybe I missed many movies, and maybe I watch ""Now and then"" today and my impression is completely different, but somehow a big change when being a kid strikes me harder than one when being a teenager; even more if the women those kids became are there to look back on it. In ""The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants"", a 'feel good movie' based on a popular novel, director Ken Kwapis has the intention of making the viewer believe that what his characters go through is sort of life changing. Four friends (there were four also in ""Now and then""), after being their whole lives together, separate for one summer, and decide that a pair of pants that magically fits all of them, travels one week with each, carrying the experiences lived by everyone while having them. Carmen (America Ferrera) is kind of our official narrator, and she introduces us to her best friends, in something like this: ""The shy and beautiful Lena (Alexis Bledel), the strong and overwhelming Bridget (Blake Lively), the unique Tibby (Amber Tamblyn), and me, the writer"". These ARE stereotypes, the movie admits them and tries to take them as it can. In fact, this is what saves 'Sisterhood' from being a complete disaster.The girls go separate ways, they don't stick together; therefore, each of them 'grows' and 'changes' on their own. By having four different plot-lines to work, Kwapis and writers Delia Ephron (""You've Got Mail"") and Elizabeth Chandler (the masterful ""A little princess"") are able to take a big breath. Since they don't have the four girls together (in fact, when they do cheesiness is extreme, unreal and sometimes unbearable), they work with their individual journeys.This is the saving grace of the movie precisely because we get to watch different aspects of it. If it weren't for the unquestionable excess of light, I could risk to tell you that the four stories are completely different. They are differently shot, written, acted and the only thing that unites them is the obligatory presence of the pants. Carmen goes through a family drama, with a dad that apparently doesn't care for her; Bridget lives a typical teenage forbidden romance; Lena does also, but her story is individually more complex; and Tibby continues to experience life as it is, shooting it for a documentary with the help of an unexpected friend played marvelously by Jenna Boyd. Some of the stories have nice moments (I liked Tibby's story the most because of its ordinary quality, free from any big or spectacular characteristic), or nice shots (Lena travels to Greece), even unexpected resolutions, but ultimately the problem of the film is that everything is automatic, with a predictable outcome. The tagline reads ""Cry. Laugh. Share the pants"". Kwapis is so immerse in making us believe that these girls go through a big change that this affects the whole movie. The score by Cliff Eidelman (he also did the score of ""Now and then""; oh coincidence!) is unnecessarily moving and the performances are affected by this obligatory 'change' factor, that the movie reaffirms in the end by relieving the pants-only element that connected everything-of any responsibility. If anything, ""The Sisterhood of the traveling Pants"" is useful to reaffirm other things, whether good or bad. That Amber Tamblyn is more than Joan (""Joan of Arcadia"") and Alexis Bledel is not more than Rory (""Gilmore Girls""); that America Ferrera is truly powerful and deserves the best, and Blake Lively is truly overwhelming and has versatility. There are fine male actors too, but this time it was about the girls. Oh, and they deserve that I watch the film's second part.",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants

If you enjoyed the old Australian movies about adultery, you'll probably like this one. The people who put this one together really knew what they were doing. It's one of those films for which I could guess the plot exactly before I saw it. You could say that the film is built on a firm base, but it's also one big pile of self-obsession.

But when come to the movie (maybe I have a high hope for it) I don't quite get anything from it. I don't quite want to say this since it got good casting of my favorite actors in it but this movie is a let down.I know the story is really hard to write and especially the shooting and editing since it is 4 different locations but the film look too hectic and brief and also not really that emotional. No character is concentrated, but at least Amber's character - Tibby is the closes to the book. Where as Lena is completely change. I like changes between book and film but this change doesn't really fit the character. And Carmen here is full of anger and no softer side were shown especially with her and her dad also no relationship between her and Paul at all? And Bridget is, there hardly any Bridget.The whole movie is isn't that bad especially the cast of the girls, but the whole outcome is not as good great as it should be. I'm not really sure about the sequel; cause they really didn't left any opening like the book does.

20,doctorsmoothlove,Sisterhood of a movie you've seen a million times,5,27 August 2008,"In anticipation for the sequel, I decided to review the original Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants film. It has a 77% rating on Rottentomatoes.com and is frequently unavailable at my university movie center, so I predicted that I would enjoy it (despite my not being a typical audience). After viewing it, I can't recommend it. It's simply too generic. The film offers nothing that isn't widely present on Hallmark Channel or any generic female buddy movie. Though one of the four micro-stories presented is entertaining and somewhat original, the other three are clichéd and boring.The film's protagonists are four young women who are ""BFF's"" in contemporary vernacular. They engage in pre-sorority bonding activities and giggle profusely. In one of their bonding sessions, they wander into a store and discover a pair of pants which ""magically fits all of us."" They attribute this uncanny ability to the pants' inherent magical properties. The group decides to mail the pants to each other for a week at a time to share their magical power. The story then splits into four narratives. The first girl, Lena, travels to Greece to spend a summer with her grandparents. The second, Bridget, goes to a Mexican soccer camp. The first two girls meet a boy and fall in love. In Lena's story, there is a Romeo and Juliet backdrop to her doomed romance. She falls for fisherman Kostas whose grandfather lied to Lena's ""papi."" They are together at the end, but not after much parental berating. Strangely, Kostas parents don't seem to care about his relationship with Lena (they have no screen presence, so I guess they don't mind). Bridget becomes infatuated with a camp counselor and it is implied that they have sex (on a beach of all places). Of course, by the film's end, the counselor is in love with Bridget but she has lost interest in him.The remaining two stories are not romances, but save the last one, the third story is as predictable as the approaching night. Carmen is a Puerto Rican girl who lives with her mother. She has a loving but distant relationship with her father. She decides to visit him over the summer and is surprised to discover that he has a new family. His wife-to-be is overbearing and stereotypically spoiled. The children are interchangeable and unimportant to the story. Can you guess what's going to happen to Carmen? Yea, it isn't hard to realize how this story unravels. The final story is the much better than the previous three. It involves the tomboy Tibby as she attempts to film a documentary and survive her summer job. One day at work she meets a young girl named Bailey who becomes her producer, much to Tibby's dismay. Bailey and Tibby interview several people about their happiness in their current lives. The most prominent person interviewed is a Dungeons and Dragons arcade player, Brian, they meet at a gas station. Brian tells them about the game's goals and programming. It's interesting. I was aware that it operated using laser disc technology (for the in-game movies called FMVs) but I never got a chance to play the game. Brian and Tibby bond in their shared ""nerd"" status. Director Ken Kwapis and screenwriter Delia Ephron tie all stories with Carmen's father's wedding. All the girls return home and help Carmen overcome her bitterness and attend the ceremony. The other method of story-sewing is Bailey's convenient illness which brings the other girls to Tibby's side. Each culminating scene in the stories occurs when the character is wearing the pants or involved with them in some way. There aren't many problems with the first Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants movie save its tired plot. You won't hate this film because there is no reason to specifically hate it. Watching the movie is like the same cup of coffee you order every morning. You don't give it additional thought because it's become perfunctory to drink it. The pants don't ameliorate this problem either. They don't' seem to possess any other-worldly power. The film presents them as a good-luck charm rather than a genuinely important item. They function as a silent protagonist, like the hero of many role-playing video games. Like an RPG hero, the pants resolve other's conflicts than experiencing any developments themselves. By the way, silent protagonists aren't popular anymore.The film looks very good. The backgrounds are scenic and offer something to admire when you become of the film's deliberate attempt to produce tears. Lena's vacation in Greece is quite memorable. Bridget's Mexican trip also looks nice. Many scenes occur during sunset and the lighting embeds the image into your mind. I remember these images more than the story, which is unfortunate. I wish the good cinematography would have accented the character's situation but it didn't. I've seen the romantic sunset image too many times, I guess.The movie isn't worth a viewing if you don't have plans to see its (better) sequel. There's nothing new here. If you've read a drug-store romance novel or been around middle school (usually female) drama, then you've watched it. If you don't have any experiences like that, check the IMDb.com profile.

21,ruby_fff,Endearing accounts of four girl friends - how their friendships endured and enriched one memorable summer by the sharing of a pair of jeans,8,4 July 2005,"Besides the fascinating documentary ""Mad Hot Ballroom,"" another worthy attraction that probably got 'buried' by the Hollywood summer blockbusters is director Ken Kwapis film, ""The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants,"" based on the novel by Ann Brashares.It is a cleverly edited, heart-warming travelogue/diary of four good friends during their first summer apart after graduation. America Ferrera (fantastic in ""Real Women Have Curves"" 2002) as Carmen, Alexis Bledel as Lena, Blake Lively as Bridget, Amber Tamblyn as Tibby, who ran into young Bailey - portrayed by Jenna Boyd (brilliant in director Ron Howard's ""The Missing"" 2003 opposite Cate Blanchett, Evan Rachel Wood and Tommy Lee Jones). There are life lessons from watching the different experiences each of them goes through - new places, new faces, new emotions that each of them encounters/discovers in their segments. The link between each of their summer adventures/activities is a pair of jeans they 'sworn' to share.What a novel idea to present the various aspects of growing young women: Lena's Greek adventure spending with distant relatives and meeting Kostos, turned into a mini-version of Romeo and Juliet with family feud (verbal/non-verbal arguments vs. physical conflicts). Blake's energetic sporting camp environment with new companions eventually forces her to break out of her 'façade' of bravado behavior and the truth of parental longing surfaces. Carmen's journey raises emotional havoc as she struggles with the unexpected event of her father re-marrying, having to deal with new family members vs. her wish of spending quality time alone with Dad. Tibby may be doing nothing exotic or literal travels, but staying in hometown, working at the Mart, with the surprised 'intrusion' by Bailey the precocious 12 year old becoming her self-invited video assistant, somehow provided enriched life lessons. Unanticipated, the four friends bonded deeper and helped each other through stumbling hurdles, maturing expansively this one memorable summer.I enjoyed this film better than the 1995 ""Now and Then,"" a movie also about four girlfriends, with two sets of known actresses: Christina Ricci, Thora Birch, Gaby Hoffmann and Ashleigh Aston Moore as the young Rosie O'Donnell, Melanie Griffith, Demi Moore and Rita Wilson. ""Traveling Pants,"" even though with budding young actresses, provided more in-depth emotional journeys, life wisdom, and picturesque romantic Greece for added value. This may be more of a 'girly' film, but certainly a family entertainment (likened to Disney quality productions like ""The Parent Trap"").Also highly recommend a similar theme of five girlfriends (actually three plus a pair of twin sisters) film in Korean, written-directed by Jae-Eun Jeong, ""Take Care of My Cat"" 2001. It has a more gritty approach, included tough scenarios/facts of life to each girl's family background influences, the trials and tribulations of keeping up friendships fresh out of school. Heart-wrenching at times yet the youthful energy retained, the hopes and dreams, little romances and arguments, along with their (pager/email) cell phones constantly ringing/reaching for 'connections.'",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants
22,departed07,A guilty pleasure,9,12 January 2008,"I've never been a fan of chick flicks or a fan of the teen economy until 2005 when I asked people how they felt if Daniel Radcliffe and Hilary Duff got together; it obviously led me to care of psychology, writing fanfics, interested in websites from myspace to youtube, finding out what goes on in teenagers lives, caring of other cultures and making desktop wallpapers.To get back to my review, I've never been a fan of chick flicks since the majority of them seem to have happy endings or characters in goofy situations where love conquers all, but that's not the case with Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants since there is so much to the film than the ads leaning women and female teenagers to see this movie.Based on the series of novels, the film concentrates on four teenage girls from Carmen (America Ferrera from Real Women Have Curves), Lena (Alexis Bledel of Sin City), Tibby (Amber Tamblyn from Joan of Arcadia) and Bridget (newcomer Blake Lively). I'm gonna go out on a limb to compare these four ladies to the four leading male actors in the first American Graffiti movie since it's a coming of age with lives being questioned.It's the summer where things start with a sad beginning after the death of Bridget's mother which leads Carmen, Lena and Tibby to cheer her up by shopping at a store where they try on a pair of pants which fits all four women and later after purchasing the jeans, the leading ladies head off to an abandon building and give their rules on how to use the pants before they lead off to different paths including mailing them to the location of each friend from the sisterhood at the end of each week.Carmen (American Ferrera) decides to visit her father (Bradley Whitford) in North Carolina where she thinks that things will go well between them until all the unhidden pieces of the puzzle are revealed that he's engaged to a southern woman (Nancy Travis) who already has two previous kids from a bad marriage.Bridget (Blake Lively) goes to Mexico as part of soccer training where she proves to most of the athletes on the trip that not only does she kick ass on the field, but at the same time wants the hot male couch as a way of assuring herself that everything will be okay once she goes back home.Lena (Alexis Bledel) heads to Greece to visit her relatives and is culture shock once she arrives not knowing a single word of Greek while falling in love with a man who saves her live before realizing that her family has a grudge against the man's family and ruining the only thing that will maker her summer great.Tibby (Amber Tamblyn) is the only member of the group left behind in which she works at Wall-Man's (A cheap version of Wal-Mart) as a way to shoot her documentary. She befriends a young girl played by Jenna Boyd after an accident that took place at the store and they go through the city interviewing different people from young kids wanting to go in business to a video arcade lover leaving both girls to learn more about each other.Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants is not a typical chick flick, but it's certainly a movie that both genders could enjoy without anybody moaning or arguing to see another movie filled with goofiness or violence.",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants

24,ScottDMenzel,"Sweet, Funny, and touching",8,9 July 2005,"I never wanted to see this film because the title turned me off. What the hell type of title is that? I always asked myself. But you know what I guess this is where it goes back to the old saying never judge a book by its cover and for this movie I guess you can say never judge a movie by it's title. So after delaying it for a very long time, I finally sat down and watched ""The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants"" ""The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants"" is about four friends Tibby, Lena, Carmen, and Bridget who are just about to go their separate ways for the first time ever. The day before they leave for the summer, they decide to go shopping together and they come across this pair of jeans that fits them all perfectly. How? None of the girls understand it but decide that along with sending a letter off every week letting each other know how the summer is going they will also send the pair of pants along with it. And so the four stories of the four girls summer vacation begins.Let me first start off by staying hands down, I thought this movie was going to suck. I saw the trailers and the commercials and I was like that is the lamest excuse for a movie but you know what I was wrong and I will admit that. The movie is extremely real and touching. The movie tells the story of 4 different people as they all separate and grow up over one summer. Tibby (Amber Tamblyn) was my favorite character and my favorite storyline. Next was Lena (The beautiful and sweet Alexis Bledel) who's story I liked 2nd best. As for the other two stories, my 3rd favorite was Carmen's (America Ferrera) and the story I didn't like that much was Bridget's (Blake Lively.) This movie told four stories and three of them were told perfectly. On top of it, the film's performances were well acted and believable. The characters were real. I felt that I met these people in life at one time or another. Their problems are real and you really feel for the characters. I actually cried during this film which doesn't happen that often when I watch movies. I cried because the film shows the importance of having friends and the affects that they have on your life. Not to mention dealing with life's problems alone and growing as a person.I also have to mention Jenna Boyd (""Dickie Roberts"" & ""The Missing"") in this review. She was hands down my favorite character in the movie. She played this little girl named Bailey who kept following Tibby around and wanted to help her out make her documentary. Bailey also wanted to make a friend as well. I felt so touched by the character because you know this little girl saw so much good in the world despite what she was going though in the film. She managed to make Tibby, a better person and that really just blew me away. There is one scene in the movie where the two are talking and it made me break down and cry because it was so touching.I don't really have anything negative to say about this movie, yes it's a chick flick but if a guy dared to use his heart like I do when I watch these types of flicks I think he would enjoy it. It's an above average chick flick mainly because the characters are real and have real problems. The only real complaint I have with the film was that Bridget's storyline was not as powerful as the rest. And on top of it I didn't care that much about her character. Everyone else you felt sorry for and understood what they were going through. It wasn't really until the end that you got her story and her problem but it seemed so minor compared to everyone else's. All I am saying is they should have spent a little more time developing her character and her problem.So in the end, yes I really enjoyed ""The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants."" It was funny, touching, emotional and most importantly real. It's not every day that a chick flick comes along that isn't about finding Mr. Right or actually tells a story about something that can really happen in life. This is where this movie succeeds! I thought the story was great for the most part and the acting was great as well. It's definitely one I will be adding to the DVD collection when it comes available. So if you haven't seen ""The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants"" yet, go see it. It's well worth it.MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants"" is an 8/10.

30,samseescinema,The stories are told with such sincerity and heart that it's difficult to find fault in them.,8,5 June 2005,"The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants Reviewed by Sam Osborn of www.samseescinema.comRating: 3 out of 4Director: Ken Kwapis Cast: Amber Tamblyn, Alexis Bledel, America Ferrera, Blake Lively, Jenna Boyd Screenplay: Delia Ephron, Elizabeth Chandler (based on the novel by Ann Brashares) MPAA Classification: PG (thematic elements, some sensuality and language)The best films about teenagers are, of course, the ones that tell it straight. When we're made to dance around the facts and ignore reality, a film leaves us unsatisfied. The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants, for the most part, avoids this fault. And although it may sometimes sweeten the image up a bit, its stories touch on topics that may be taboo in an adolescent's household and give them the reality they deserve, making the hormonally rampant teenager that's hidden in every single one of us leap for joy. The film follows the travels of a very special pair of blue jeans. Four friends, Carmen, Lena, Bridget, and Tibby, who've been inseparable since their simultaneous births, are hanging out one day in the beginning of their Summer vacation when they stumble upon a pair of pants that miraculously fit every single one of them despite their varying body types. Seeing this as a sign, the four decide to create a sisterhood surrounding the jeans, agreeing to allow each member one week in the pants before sending it off to occupy the life of the next sister in queue. You see, the four are separating for the Summer. Bridget, the wildly confident and beautiful soccer player, is heading off to Mexico for a ""campo del futbol."" Carmen, also the narrator of the film, is traveling to South Carolina to visit her father who left her when she was ten. Lena, the shy sister, is flying to Greece to stay with family, and finally, Tibby, the rebel, is stuck at home, wasting her days working in a Wal-Mart knock-off store Wallmans and making what she calls a ""suckumentary"", documenting the desperate lives of the store's employees. As in all sisterhoods, a manifesto of rules goes along with the pants. For instance, one of the ten rules is ""do not wash the jeans, for the magic may be washed away with it."" Another is ""do not let anybody but the wearer of the jeans remove the jeans (meaning boys)."" You get the idea. And as each of these 16-17 year old young women live out their adventures at their respective locales, we're made witness to their happenings by way of the traveling pants. Sisterhood is based off of a wildly popular line of books of the same title by Anne Brashares. Having never read the books (surprise, surprise) I can't really say how accurate this adaptation is. However, I can infer that most, if not all, of the young teenage girls that were fans of the books will undoubtedly be fans of the movie. It's simply ""that sort of film."" I predict that Sisterhood will be 2005's Mean Girls.Also interesting about the film is its array of young actresses. All of them, excluding Alexis Bledel whose stardom has just recently begun with Gilmore Girls, are relative unknowns. That doesn't mean, however, that their performances will also go unknown. Each of the leads in Sisterhood play their parts tremendously well. They honor the impressive screenplay by giving it the bouncy youthfulness that it needs. But why is it that the most affective and realistic of films about teenagers are so explicit that teenagers aren't actually allowed to see them? Is that telling parents something? For instance, my absolute favorite teenage drama is 2003's Sundance hit Thirteen. Starring Evan Rachel Wood and Holly Hunter, Thirteen chronicled the spiraled downfall of a thirteen year old girl who experienced what many teenagers actually experience in the real world. So why is it that Thirteen was rated R? If the reality of teenagers is too explicit for a rating fit for teenagers, then where's the problem? What I'm getting at is that teenagers are crazy. I would know, I happen to be one at the moment. For a film about teenager-hood to succeed, it needs to capture this craziness. Sisterhood essentially does well at this, but admittedly pulls some punches. This conservative aspect can be primarily blamed on the fact that the target demographic for Sisterhood isn't the age of the characters in the story. The target demographic is the12-14 year old adolescent girl who will soon be faced with the challenges presented in Sisterhood's story. This is essentially where the film fails and, at the same time, where it succeeds. Its success lies in its courage to focus the stories of the characters on problems that many teenagers experience. Sisterhood touches on split families, first love, virginity, vanity, finding an identity, and the dilemma of life and death, to name a few. It fails in that the material surrounding these problems must be fit for what the MPAA believes 12-14 year old girls should see. And along with the rating limits, the stories must also play out simplistically, adhering to formula so the common 12-14 year old girl will feel right at home. So what we get are heartfelt but slightly conservative and formulaic stories about the real issues of teenage girls. But what saves Sisterhood from only appealing to its target demographic is its unbelievable sweetness. The stories are told with such sincerity and heart that it's difficult to find fault in them. -Sam Osborn of www.samseescinema.com",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants
31,bjones,Delivers entertainment,7,27 June 2005,"The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants I only went to see this to please a female in my life. Guys like me aren't exactly seen in theaters with films like this. In fact, I think I was the only male in the theater at the time. I'm glad I went. I have to admit that I found it very entertaining. The story line was especially refreshing. Not the usual sort of thing at all but very imaginative. Being the father of grown daughters I have to say that one of the best parts of that has been to experience the world anew through their eyes. This movie is an extension of that feeling.The movie was really 4 vignettes in the lives of four teenage girlfriends during their sixteenth summer. The four stories were different enough to hold interest and each well told and brought together in the end. The sets and costumes were genuine enough not to raise notice, something hard to do in modern times. I especially enjoyed the one shot on Santorini in Greece. The place is charmingly beautiful. The main interest in the other stories was only the girls themselves but their characters were full enough to satisfy.The real standout here is the ensemble of young actresses cast for this film. I think their choices were outstanding. One real standout among the teenagers was America Ferrera as Carmen. She is an engaging actress with style and real talent, not that the others aren't so endowed. Blake Lively as Bridget was a standout in that she made her character genuine by not over playing her too obvious good looks. She has a different enough face to be memorable and a range of expression to play to the emotions she was called for. Alexis Bledel as Lena is a stunning beauty with incredible eyes that capture your attention when she's on screen. She also had what it took to carry off her part and make it very real and believable. It's hard to believe she's that same girl who's in Sin City. In fact, probably the best known of them is Amber Tamblyn as Tibby (what kind of a name is Tibby anyway). Ms. Tamblyn is known for her TV show, but here she plays a slightly left of center teen looking for some meaning to life. She surprisingly finds it in the person of Bailey, played to a ""T"" by Jenna Boyd. Ms. Boyd reminds me of a young Jody Foster or Helen Hunt. If she's not careful she will have a long and successful career. For a girl so young she had surprising presence and range.All in all it past the entertainment test here and was well worth the price of admission.",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants
32,leilapostgrad,"Why, as a 24 year old girl, I LOVED this film...",10,4 June 2005,"Please don't let this horribly cheesy title keep you away from this cinematic treasure! Writing this review two days after see the movie, and I'm still crying. The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants is the kind of title that evokes Disney Channel movies staring Mickey Mouse Club members (or worse, Hillary Duff), but I swear to you that this movie is so much more. I was in tears from beginning to end as I saw my own insecurities and fears addressed in each one of these characters.First, there\'s CARMEN (America Ferrera), the writer, the Puerto Rican, the ""curvey"" one (I HATE that word), and the one who spends the summer with her father and his new family. Carmen's weight issues and ""absentee father"" issues hit home to me. In fact, the first tears I shed in this movie came at the moment that Carmen drives up to her father's house and learns that he is getting remarried... to a women he lives with... whom Carmen had never met, nor even heard of before. I learned only a few months ago, over the phone no less, that my father was remarried, and it's still not something he's talked to me about. Carmen uses the magical ""traveling pants"" to get the courage to finally tell her father how sad she is and how much he's hurt her, and this was the point in the movie that had me BALLING.Lena (Alexis Bledel) is the soft-spoken and shy beauty who spends the summer with her grandparents in Greece. I definitely relate to Lena in her what's the word modesty. She doesn't wear revealing clothes, she's not open to new love, and she has an overall fear of intimacy. With the help of \""the pants\"", she meets a beautiful Greek man named Kostas (Michael Rady) and learns to let love it.Bridget (Blake Lively) is the tall, blond, and extremely confidant soccer star who spends the summer in Baja California, Mexico, at a soccer camp, where she spends most of her time trying to seduce her soccer coach Eric (Mike Vogel). She's also still grieving the loss of her mother who killed herself. For most of the film, I felt no connection to Bridget at all (tall, blond, and athletic, I am not). But it eventually hit me. Bridget's persistent pursuit of Eric and her determination to excel at soccer are her means of hiding from her pain. Her main motivation in life is to numb the pain of her mother's death. Who can't relate to that? Tibby's (Amber Tamblyn) storyline is the most surprising. I didn't expect to be so moved. Tibby is stuck at home for the summer, working at a Walgreens-like drugstore, filming a documentary (or as she calls it, a ""suckumentary""), and generally hating life and humanity while her friends travel around the world. The traveling pants are accidentally sent to the wrong address, and a little girl named Bailey (Jenna Boyd) finds them and returns them to Tibby. Bailey is intrigued by Tibby's ""suckumentary"" and volunteers to help with the film. Though she annoys Tibby at first, Bailey turns out to be extremely soulful and has a real gift for discovering each person's humanity and connecting to anyone. This little girl single-handedly steals the movie, and Jenna Boyd is gifted beyond her years.This is NOT a chick flick, this isn't a teeny-pop film, and there's NO Hillary Duff or Lindsay Lohan anywhere in sight. The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants is about the fears and insecurities that all young people feel as they enter adulthood, boys and girls. We all have to deal with our bodies, with our parents, with love, and with death, and this film deals with all of these issues with honesty, sensitivity, and maturity. And most importantly, this movie reinstates the fact that none of us has to deal with these issues alone.",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants
33,sjmcollins-1,"4 stories--1 good, 1 OK, 2 pretty bad",5,21 June 2005,"Sisterhood Of The Traveling Pants was made for young girls, and admittedly , I don't fall into that category, but I found myself in the theater nonetheless. This film is basically broken into 4 stories, and I enjoyed America Ferrera's performance as Carmen, the looked-over daughter of a guy starting over with a trophy family. Ferrera has a great emotional scene where she calls her father out for his neglect, and it showcases her as the most talented of the lot, and definitely one of the most talented young actresses today. Amber Tamblyn has her part taken out from under her by the charming Jenna Boyd, who becomes the focus of the documentary Tamblyn's Tibby is shooting while being the only one of the girls actually having to work for the summer. This part is OK due to Boyd, who wins you over with her inquisitive nature. The other two stories are mindless teen-girl fantasy stuff, especially the Greece story with Alexis Bledel, which encompasses so many clichés I lost count. Almost as bad is the story involving Blake Lively as soccer star Bridget. Lively seems to be a little better than the material here (shows a lot of life), but doesn't really convince me as an athlete, and the story doesn't allow her to solve her real problem--her distance from her father. The teen girl set will probably eat this up, but one quarter of a good movie isn't enough for me.",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants

I loved this movie even if it is for teens and it is a chick flick I enjoyed it. Sad and excellent but issues true friends could relate to and cry about it in this movie. Some minor differences from the movie and from the book like for example: Lena's little sister Effie was not featured and some problems got reversed but not too much.For Example: SPOILERS HERE!! and DOWN """""""""""""""""" Book and Movie Differences 1. In the book Lena's grandmother bragged about Kostos and later in the book Lena's grandfather got into a fight with Kostos's grandfather thinking Kostos had hurt Lena in the movie both Grandparent got into a fight years ago because of fish and Lena hated Kostos cause he spied on Lena in the book but never happened in the movie.2. Bridget liked Eric but she never dated him or anything just followed him. In the movie Bridget dated him and Eric liked her. Never happened in the book.3.

35,SajeevaS,A truly remarkable chick flick,10,28 June 2005,"This feel good effect of a chick flick, is barely brought on screen in a sensible way. Sisterhood manages to achieve and capture both the fun side and the bitter moments with such reality, that you would feel for each character. With too much of movies circling around sci-fi, animation, comic book characters and thrillers this year, Sisterhood is undoubtedly the chick flick of 2005.Though been mildly blessed with the fairy tale charm,the sisterhood never steps out of reality. Though the cast is relatively unknown it does not cause a lesser liking to the movie cause each the actresses sink into each of their respective characters so well, you'll forget who plays them, and think of who they are playing instead. Amber Tamblyn impressed me the most, her character had the most amount of changes, and each of her emotions from the sarcasm to the sadness was portrayed to perfection. America Ferrera, gave the most emotional performance out of all, and it is this character of Carmen that you would really feel for the most. Alexis Bledel who plays Lena is always welcomed on the big screen, eversince ""Gilmore Girls"" became a hit. In conclusion - I'd have to make a confession - I am a 19 goingon 20 year old guy-young adult, and this was the first movie which made me tear. So as the tag line says ""Laugh, Cry, Share the pants"" - you'll find yourself doing just that....!",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants
36,bhattrell,"A good, emotive reality adventure film in need of a little pacing up and soundtrack tweaking",7,17 April 2017,"Sisterhood of the traveling pants. Stepping outside your front door to bird song, Sun and the slight chill of an early morning awakens like nothing else, a sense of adventure for the experiences to be invoked by the day and those around you. This film genre in my opinion therefore is ""reality adventure"".Setting the scene The introduction to the film clearly lays out what is expected with the plot. This makes the film relaxing to follow and your interest focus centralised on the characters themselves and their lives rather than understanding the story-line. This in my opinion enables sufficient emotional engagement for a relaxing, yet entertaining film thereby reducing boredom. Main body The spirit of adventure is integral to the fascinating story-line of this film. Friendship Unites the experiences encountered by the characters over summer. The setting is varied to match the myriad of scenes and environments explored. Intrigue is present from the slightly comical and light hearted title which captures the essence of what is truly important. When exploring the characters lives, great emphasis is placed on a key character introduced from the get-go which slows the pace of the movie a little too much, creating a slightly laborious lull in the films' midpoint. Things are soon picked up however, and keep you entertained till the conclusion. This is due to an emotional roller-coaster of sadness and love which keeps the scene progression dynamic. Music The soundtrack whilst cheesy at times, has quite a few non-mainstream tunes which are pleasant and relaxing to listen to. EndingI guess the diverse relationships, friendships and interaction of all characters, the materialistic nature of clothing and the shared experiences in many locations challenges the notion of happiness. A well thought out conclusion of what this truly means provides a punchy ending. Summary A good emotive reality adventure film in need of a little pacing up and soundtrack tweaking. Actors and actresses play emotions and roles well and there are the right number of characters for viewer engagement and empathy.",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants
37,tollini,a Truly Moving Picture,10,31 May 2005,"I saw this film in Indianapolis in early May before the official theatrical release. I am one of the judges for the Heartland Film Festival that screens films for their Truly Moving Picture Award. A Truly Moving Picture ""...explores the human journey by artistically expressing hope and respect for the positive values of life."" Heartland gave that award to this film.The sisterhood consists of four teenage girls. And each of the girls are special. They are each intelligent and introspective. And they take the important things in their lives in a mature, serious way. These important things include their personal lives, their personal development, their families, and the history of their families.And the sisterhood is special too. Not because of the ""trick"" of the one pair of pants fitting four physically different girls, but because the girls care for each other and supply support for each other in a mature way that takes most of us decades to learn. They are there for each other for no ulterior motive. They help each other because there is a goodness and wisdom and healthiness in helping another human being.The four girls are equals in this movie. Not only are they equal in terms of their importance to each other, but also in time in front of the camera. This is not a star vehicle for one of these young actresses. Their relationship is the star of this movie.FYI - There is a Truly Moving Picture web site where there is a listing of past winners going back 70 years.",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants

But it's totally unfair to limit it by labeling it that way; it's far, far better than any other movie of any kind I've looked at so far this year.What we have here is a phenomenal ensemble cast of young actors, each of whom is capable of rich, multi-leveled performance, a first-rate director who makes time absolutely fly, gorgeous locations and a stunningly moving series of stories that is never once mawkish or overly sentimental. It has been years since I saw a film that makes me recalibrate my own definition of ""good."" This one does it; right now I find it hard to believe that I actually wrote nice things about ""Mean Girls.""The humanity of this film is nothing less than astonishing; there is much for anyone of any age to savor here.

39,astro_92,I am crazy over this movie!,10,16 October 2005,"I am so glad that I took a chance on this motion picture! The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants has proved to be a monster hit with me. The film is extremely entertaining and the four lead girls are all so sweet and lovable. The whole show here made me smile very big as I was very impressed with what was presented throughout. These girls here have some talent! The central characters in this fabulous picture are four girls who have been friends since they were all little. Bridget, Carmen, Lena, and Tibby are the names of the group's members here. Each girl has a very unique personality that lights a spark with the rest of the gang. I really love all four of them very much. If I had to choose a favorite here it would probably have to be Lena. Lena is the girl that has Greek grandparents living in their native country. From the way I look at Lena, she's the sweetest and most carefree girl in the group. Her adorable giggle makes me glow with happiness. She also has a very strong way with affection, which is something that I admire tremendously. Tibby appeals to me just as much as Lena because she has a way with making the lives of other people seem more interesting. Bridget and Carmen, too, are very charming and are greatly dedicated to their favorite leisure time activities. Once more, these four girls are all so loyal to one another. Who would have ever thought that a simple pair of young women's jeans would fit all four of them just right? The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants is such a delightful movie! I think that this picture deserves to be honored and crowned! This film is sure to captivate anybody that views it.

40,BrigitteD,These Pants Are A Perfect Fit!,8,6 June 2005,"This movie is highly engaging, even if you're not a part of the targeted demographic age group, or a loyal reader of the book series of the same name. Rather, most anyone who has ever experienced the elements of friendship, death, first love, family conflict and self-esteem issues will find themselves relating to this film in some way or another.Unlike most other films depicting teenagers, the characters here are three-dimensional, and are faced with realistic issues and insecurities, rather than with the standard concerns over becoming prom queen or losing their virginity.The premise of the film is quite simple. We have four 16 year old friends, whose connection, we find out, originated even before birth, as their mothers were all members of the same prenatal classes. They are about to face their first summer apart, and so, we see them shopping at a thrift store before they are to go their separate ways. There, they come across a seemingly normal pair of jeans which takes on ""magical"" proportions in the way it amazingly fits perfectly on each girl, this despite their varying body types.After purchasing the jeans, the girls perform an official ""ceremony"" in which rules are established, and which are to be followed while the jeans are in their individual weekly ownership. And so begins each girl's summer expeditions...Lena (Alexis Bledel), a budding artist, and both a physically and emotionally guarded person, travels to Greece to visit her grandparents. Upon her arrival, she meets a boy, and is soon embroiled in a repressed and forbidden romance, this being due to a long-running feud between their respective families.Bridget (Blake Lively) is the more outgoing and sexually confident girl of the group. Having recently dealt with the loss of her mother, she spends her summer at a Mexican soccer camp where she becomes infatuated with one of the coaches, and soon becomes determined to get him to notice her. Yet, in the end, she comes to realize that she was attracted to him for all the ""wrong"" reasons.Carmen (America Ferrera), who suffers from a poor perception of self-image, is a Puerto Rican who goes to visit her American father, but has a lot of trouble adapting to his new girlfriend and ""suburban"" lifestyle. She must also deal with feelings of exclusion as the family busies itself with their upcoming wedding plans, meanwhile, barely acknowledging her presence.Tibby (Amber Tamblyn), an aspiring filmmaker, with her somewhat Goth persona and bleak outlook on life, has been left behind on the home front to work at the local department store, where she also plans to film her first documentary. Despite her reluctance, she is soon befriended by Bailey, an optimistic young girl who carries a tragic secret. With time, Tibby's negative and cold disposition is transformed by Bailey's warm, enthusiastic and accepting nature in the face of her unfortunate circumstances.Tibby and Carmen's stories were the most emotionally impacting, while the picturesque scenery and romantic escapades offered in Bridget and Lena's ""vignettes"" almost served as a secondary backdrop and diversion from the ""heavier"" material. Needless to say, I was more involved with these latter depictions, which stood out in starker contrast against the lighter ""fluff"". And of course, the jeans served as an ever-present witness throughout each situation, intended to serve as some kind of good luck charm during challenging moments.The four main actresses, some of which already have extensive experience, mostly in television-based projects, all shine within the roles they portray, each bringing a unique trait to their characters. The supporting cast is also quite solid, especially from Jenna Boyd, who as Bailey, conveys both precocious nonchalance and innocent fragility at the same time. Also, this movie is not a showcase of celebrity status, as each actress is given equal opportunity to display their talents.Overall, this is a great film to consider if you're looking to escape the overwhelming influx of testosterone-driven summer blockbusters. So give this film a look, and allow the force of the Sisterhood to be with you.",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants

They did leave a few parts out and modify a few things, but that's okay. It was still a pretty good adaptation of a great book. Ebert and Roeper gave it two thumbs up. I have to say I agree with them. The actresses all stand out, and newcomer Blake Lively is especially good as Bridget. She reminds me of me a little bit. I'm not sporty, but I'm flirty, kind of the same way she was with Eric. I went to camp this summer, was the same age as Bridget was in the book, and met a counselor the same age as Eric in the book. But I never went too far with him, and we were just best friends. America Ferrera is great as the fun Carmen Lowell, and she even sticks up a little for her shape. She starred in ""Real Women Have Curves"", and that's the truth. All in all, this is a great movie.

43,gaeanprayer,How can you not love this movie?,10,4 July 2006,"When I think of going to the movies, I think action, or horror, or whatever has a woman in leather with guns/swords/pointy shooty things. I would have never gone to the movies for a movie like this.I totally missed out.First off, you have to understand that, despite the title, this is not a movie about magical pants, or anything along that whimsy. The movie is about 4 girls played by young and incredibly talented actresses (who have since faded into relative obscurity, God knows why) who all, over a Summer's vacation, find themselves in uncomfortable situations that force them to grow as people. I'll break it down a bit.First we have Tibby, played by Amber Tamblyn, probably known as Joan from Joan of Arcadia, who takes on the stereotypical role of a rebellious and apathetic teenager. She is fixated on her camera and spends her summer working to afford better equipment. Along the way, she meets a little girl that, from then on, proceeds to act as a zit upon the chin of our dear Tibby. Said girl, however, eventually ends up changing Tibby for the better in a predictable, yet still heart-warming way.Next is Lena, played by Gilmore Girl Alexis Bledel, who is an almost complete introvert and artist to boot. Her vacation is spent in Greece with her grandparents and about 100 cousins. Lena has a hard time taking chances, and finds herself pleasantly thrust into a situation that forces her to let loose, greatly motivated by a major Greek hotty.Then we have Carmen, played by America, who is desperately seeking a relationship with her father who, after leaving Carmen's mother, has found a new family. Carmen spends some of her summer with her father, trying to build a bond, before giving up. She later comes to a realization that the problem isn't only her father.Last but not least is Bridget, played by Blake Lively who, far as I know, is pretty new to the scene. Her issues center around her mother, who was mentally ill and committed suicide, and her father who has a hard time showing affection, thus leading her down a sad path of seeking out men for the wrong reasons. Her role in the story is the most adult and probably why this scored a PG rating.So there you have it. A movie based almost entirely around stereotypes and clichés yet still manages to work oh so well! I not only enjoyed this movie as a rental, I'll be purchasing it for future viewing as well.Oh, and you can't forget America's wonderful line: ""They're like the sunshine twins on uppers!"" buahaha...",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants
44,petereviews,Where's the Pants?,4,1 September 2019,"DISCLAIMER: While it is a fact that a movie can be for anyone, this movie was definitely not made for me. If you are asking why I decided to review this movie knowing that I am not the intended audience, the answer, dear reader, is that I want to keep my mind open to all kind of movies, even under the ""BFF Slumber Party"" genre (also I made a promise I would watch this movie to a friend, and I sadly keep my promises). Nevertheless, I am going to try and judge this movie on its own merits and not have any pre-notions bias my judgement.THE GOOD: Not knowing what the movie is about (besides 4 friends being bonded by pants). I was surprised by the movie splitting up the four friends and saying 4 short stories. This structure was interesting and the way the friends interacted between each other was touching at times. The most crucial thing for this movie to achieve is believing in the bond of these friends and overall it was charming enough.Carmen's story was the most human and she actually came across as likeable in her story. While some moments of her story were a bit forced (see the bad), her character had understandable reactions and was realistic in the context of feeling angered that her dad moved on. This story had realistic stakes and a sweet ending.Tibby had a few interesting scenes shooting the documentary, particularly the scene where Bailey introduces her to the subject playing Dragon's Lair. These little moments actually seemed to be rooted in slice-of-life reality, and were charming to watch. While Tibby's storyline was a mess, the conclusion was still touching overall.If you are Greek, the ridiculousness of some of Lena's scenes would make you smile.THE BAD: Oh dear. Now, I am still going to be professional talking about this movie, but... it just didn't click. First, while the pants were an interesting conceit and linkage to the movie, they were hardly ever mentioned. At the very least, the pants could be with whoever's story we are seeing, but the writers could not even manage this, which raises the question of why these pants were important at all.Looking at Lena's thread, almost every scene strained with any source of reality. While on a Greek island with her family, Lena interacts with virtually no one other than Kostas, which has a lack of world-building. Meanwhile, ignoring the ridicilousness of how Lena and Kostas met (how did she fall in the water exactly?), Kostas comes across as unlikeable. He pressures Lena constantly to have a relationship with him (despite him being in university and her in high school) and constantly stalks her around the island, appearing out of nowhere or sneaking up behind her. Yet somehow, the movie keeps trying to convince the viewer that Kostas is loveable and swoon worthy, such as in a scene where he sadistically forces Lena to touch fish despite her being clearly uncomfortable that made me question what I was watching.Meanwhile, Bridget's storyline is this horrible scenario, but reversed, as she keeps forcing herself on her coach (who professionally turns down her advances), despite not even considering the implication that she is a teenager and he is a young adult. Her horny attempts at seducing him are mainly played for laughs, but I have seen Tolstoy films with more comedy in them. Also, that thing where the soccer players worship her after she scores is SO stupid.While Tibby's character is better by virtue of not being reprehensible, her storyline suffers one thing... a lack of stakes and conflict. In her entire storyline, there is only incident happening to her, but she is never really challenged. Everything in her storyline randomly happens, from Bailey's random appearance to the documentary that gets dropped for learning about Bailey's leukemia and it is never exactly clear what lesson was learned.Finally, while Carmen's storyline is serviceable, it should be mentioned that the film goes out of its way to make her father and stepmother to be a bit too negligent. Also, Paul's dad being an alcoholic is introduced for no reason before the character is promptly dropped.HIGHLIGHT: Slim pickings but I did smile at Tibby and Bailey interview the subject at the convenience store. Some rare jokes that actually landed and the interactions did feel natural for this one scene.CONCLUSION: Do your research for this movie, but you will know if you will love or hate this movie even before seeing it (if you hate-watch it though, make sure to watch it with others so you can joke around and keep your sanity).",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants

47,elispaul,"Smart, funny and real...",9,2 June 2005,"I went to see this movie with my wife and, upon entering the theater, immediately became uncomfortable. There was only one other man at the screening and he was obviously feeling a little out of place as well (although he seemed relieved to see me walk in). I was expecting a teen soap opera, but what the movie delivered was quite different. This movie is more like a modern-times ""Little Women"" or a teen girl version of ""Dead Poets Society"". In other words, it's something that I haven't seen any sign of for decades....an intelligent drama aimed at teenage girls. My response to seeing this movie was similar to how i felt after seeing ""Babe"". I know this is an odd comparison, but both were thoughtful, intelligent movies aimed at a target audience that is usually fed cinematic rubbish. The elements of good film-making are on full display here. Strong acting, sure-handled directing, terrific writing....everything that makes a movie great. If you are a teenage girl or have one in your life, this is an absolutely must-see movie. If you don't, you'll still have a good time.",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants
48,PBXBear,Brilliant - Perfect - Funny - Touching - Emotional,10,4 July 2005,"Surprisingly, I throughly loved this movie. It was not at all what I expected. Not your typical teen movie. There is something for everyone in this film. The acting of the young ladies is beyond brilliant. The film writing was fantastic. It was funny, touching, emotional and a well rounded film. I can only imagine how great the book is.What I loved most about the film was the different direction it takes with each of girls. The joys, the pains, the struggles, the strength. Lessons for each of us to learn.10 stars out of 10 - it's beyond perfect. I highly recommend this movie to everyone.

49,sbsyd207,Taveling Pants Unifies,9,4 June 2005,"The loyal readers of a series called Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants called on a similar sisterhood when they gathered at the movies to support the beloved series. To the rest of the audience: it was a bad day to go see this movie. Five 14 year-old girls sit in a row and watch as their lives unfold before them. Frequent whispering down the isle and shouts of laughter only lighten the experience for these five soon-to-be 9th graders. Each one seemed to learn about her own experiences through the character, specifically relating to each one. Laughter and chatter soon turned to silence and tears as each one of us sitting in that row realized how alike, and different, we are. And how we've gotten through so much with each other. We soon realized how much we loved each other and how, no matter how different we seem, we are still together. We are still a sisterhood, even if it's not official. So it seems clique, that we in fact, are the sisterhood. But they got through it didn't they? They got through the hard times with each other. We had gotten through hard times with each other too. So things may get a little harder? We have each other. That's all that matters. Go I guess in a way...Rule #10 was correct: ""Pants = love. Love the Pants. Love Yourself. Together and apart.""",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants
50,marugorlero2,Really Good Movie,9,15 October 2005,"First of all let me start by saying it is extremely well casted. The four girls do a great job and when I read the books I imagined them pretty much like that. Alexis Bledel who plays ""Lena"" is the pretty but shy one. Amber Tymberlin ""Tibby"" the rebel one. America Ferrera ""Carmen"" the one with a strong personality and Blake Lively ""Bridget"" the athletic, outgoing one. It is the story of four best friends who are going their different ways during the summer of the sophomore year. To keep them together they have a pair of pants which, despite of their different figures, fits them all well. So they decide they are going to send each other the pants in hope that it will bring them a part of each other while they are separated. During the summer they all learn things about love, friendship, being different, death. But despite everything they go through they know they will always have each other. I love this movie because it is not your typical teenage movie where at the end everyone learns a lesson and lives happily ever after. In this movie they all do learn a lesson but they don't have a happily ever after. They are still growing and therefore still learning things about love, friendship, being different, death... It is a really good movie that many people are definitely going to be able to relate to. Nobody should miss it!",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants

Alexis bledel character was very good and America ferrari was a shock. i thought im not going to like this girl but she was excellent. i never had herd of her but she had proved that she should be able to be in many more movies.Blake lively is so good and Amber tamblyn had probably the most moving story line.

53,dumassays,Pants Don't Fit,2,21 June 2005,"Being a woman you would think that I would not only flock to this movie, but come bearing a box of tissue, loads of chocolate and three of my closest girlfriends for this anticipated tear fest. While I did manage to sneak some chocolate in, and a McDonald's Big Extra (modified into a quarter pounder), and my closest girlfriend, the tissues were in absentia.The movie starts out with some heart felt moments, albeit a bit cliché, between 4 teenage girlfriends setting out for the summer with the magic of the mysterious lyrca-laden jeans unbeknownst to them. While the storyline is moving, the on screen ""action"" is slow and at times tedious enough to be begging for the next scene to begin. The characters are portrayed as your typical middle-American highschool girl squad, with the blonde bombshell, Bridget, the misunderstood artistic genius, Tibby, the shy but beautiful searching-for-herself, Lena, and last but certainly not least, the recipient of the most magic from the jeans (as it is baffling to the mind that she fit into them as readily as the other three remarkably more petite characters) Carmen, who is struggling with the realities of divorce and the loss of attention from a distant father. The storyline does away with the pulling at the heartstrings approach to drama and inserts a vicious attack by adding a dying child to ensure tears are shed by viewers.While I left this movie with a streak of emotion on my cheek, I do not feel that it was given the justice that the readers of Ann Brashares' book would have wanted based on their reviews. Unless you're desperate to see a chick flick, save your money and rent this one.Warning!! For the men: under no circumstances should you punish yourself with this movie... even to impress a potential girlfriend or gain brownie points from an existing one.For the ladies: asking a man to see this movie with you is the relationship kiss of death.

54,daviddavidlim86,one of the surprises of 2005,8,7 February 2006,"when i first borrowed the DVD, i thought ""hmm, chic flick"" and i only borrowed this movie because there was nothing else on the shelf really worth watching and i thought rather watch a chic flick which everyone raved about than another average thriller or miserable attempt at the Marvel comic empire..i still think it is a chic flick, but it turned out to be far better than i thought.. in fact i've kinda fallen for the movie, which for a guy may be a bit ""un-male"".. the acting from the sisterhood - plus Jenna Boyd who i reckon is as good as Dakota Fanning - and storyline was superb from start to finish.. the characters were wonderfully thought of.. i'm sure this movie was based on a book, esp with that sort of title.. even so, it's an excellent adaptation of the book..it's p hard to choose my favourite girl, although Libby takes it out coz her character was the most interesting and wittiest.. but it's just too close.. u just have to love all of them regardless of their flaws because they're all quite bright and unique in different ways.. it's such a human movie, which is why it's so great.. i can say though that from this movie, i've kinda got a big crush now on Blake Lively who played Bridget because she's so beautiful..i'm tempted to buy the DVD when it's much more affordable in the future now.. never said that before about a ""chic flick""",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants
55,barbt1956,True to the Feel of the Book,7,9 June 2005,"We often have expectations that a movie will follow a book to the letter. Due to time limitations, creative ideas, etc. the film makers often need to adjust the story from the book to fit the film. As a lover of both books and film I ask that those who turn a book into a film follow the spirit and the feeling of the book. I believe the Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants director and screenwriters did just that.Basically the book tells the story of 4 teenage girls who are experiencing their first summer apart ever, since they have known each other since birth. Unbelievably, they find a pair of jeans which fits each girl amazingly well, although they have very different body shapes. They take this to mean the pants hold some sort of magic, so promise to send the pants to each other throughout the summer and use it as a way of keeping in touch with each other (thus - the traveling pants). The pants are sent from Tibby (staying at home) to Bridget (in Baja California, Mexico at Soccer camp) to Carmen (with her father in North Carolina) to Lena (visiting her grandparents in Greece).Three of the story lines are very true to the book, although with slight variations. Tibby's storyline is almost a perfect match to the book, Bridget's is close, and Carmen's is slightly varied showing her in a less mature light than in the book. Lena's story, on the other hand, is told completely in reverse of the book. However, I can understand the need to make this change, as the twists and turns of Lena's story in the book would have been difficult to project onto film. The end result: the girls experience the same issues in the movie as they did in the book, and they change in the way the book indicated. The ""feel"" of the movie is the same as that in the book.This film is truly a coming of age story about young high school girls. It is beautifully filmed with lovely scenery from both Greece and Mexico. The actors portraying the young girls are very well cast and match the descriptions from the book. As a librarian, I can tell you that no movie can ever equal the movie you make in your head while you are reading a book. But, this movie is beautiful in its own right, and a lovely story of growing up female and experiencing love, passion, death, and disappointment. The girls learn that the love and friendship they share will help them to get through all the issues of growing up.",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants

I also love Alexis Bledel, America Ferrera and Amer Tamblyn! It was more dramatic then I thought it would be, (in a good way!) but then again, teens are dramatic! There were even older (50-60) year old women that were also seeing the movie, and one of them had even read all the books, too! Watching this movie was a wonderful experience and it taught be that I should ALWAYS be grateful for what I have.

57,burney-imdb,Inappropriate Rating,7,22 July 2006,"I just wanted to warn other parents considering letting their young daughters watch this film. A PG rating generally implies that the movie is appropriate for anyone under 13. However, I believe the rating for this movie should be at least a PG-13. At one point, the flirtatious girl loses her virginity to a boy she has been chasing. That's not something most parents would want a child under 13 to see.Besides that, the rest of the movie itself wasn't too bad. The stories of the other girls were strong, especially the one who was interested in making films. The one about the girl going to Greece was also good in a Romeo and Juliet way. The movie as a whole was a bit overly long, coming in at just about two hours.

Well, Lena's story was screwed up completely. I was highly disappointed in that. Tibby's story remained true for the most part. Amber Tamblyn did a wonderful job and she is a very talented actress. She lightened up this film. America Ferrerra is an awesome actress too, but I don't think she was made to be Carmen. When she played her, She came off as mean and sort of temperamental. Blake Lively is a interesting newcomer. She did a well job of portraying Bridget. I was disappointed to see the portrayal of Carmen though. In the book, She was far more likable. In the movie, She's loud and rash and very annoying. Basically, the book is much better.",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants
59,roxygirlblue01,Unconditional Friendship,10,1 December 2006,"Sisterhood of the Traveling pants was an unforgettable movie about unbreakable friendship. How friends can be there for each other. To give and take. When summer time comes they must part and go on their separate destinations until they come back when summer is nearly over. Yet they find away to stay close by even though their many miles away from each other. By sharing a pair of pants throughout the summer that mysteriously fit them all perfectly, they are still able to stay close. Each sister(not really relatives) learns her own lesson, experiences her own things, and find out how friendship can come at any level. Whether it's love, depressions, helping with the problems you don't want to face alone etc... Even though each sisters life is really different they still hold a deep bond together. But they try to help each other at their highest of effort. Thats what true friendship is. Because it would be the rarest thing to find sometime just like you, and even if you did, you probably wouldn't be very good friends with her/him. Different people with different lives can still have an unbreakable bond. Different people are a major part of how the world is an exciting and interesting place to live in.

Actually all the girls were great, Amber Tamblyn, Blake Lively, Alexis Bledel - especially Alexis - and America were amazing. The other cast was cool too. Bradley Whitford (Carmen's dad), Jenna Boyd (Bailey Graffman), Nancy Travis (Lydia), and people like Krista, Paul, Brian, Lena's grandparents, Kostos, the soccer coach that Bridget liked, and everyone else.

Blake Lively gives an amazing performance as Bridget, Amber Tamblyn is completely heart warming and identifiable as Tibby, Alexis Bledel is so charming and endearing as Lena, and America Ferrara is the quintessential Carmen who delivers a stunning performance. Every emotion is felt in this movie and it is because of the remarkable performances made by these actresses that really makes the movie a hit.

I had already watched the other two movies that came in the box because they were already on cable so I thought I might watch the other movie (which was of course The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants). When it started out at the very beginning I thought I would not like the movie, but when it got to the part where they start talking about the girls relationship together I then on knew I would like the movie.

68,leahwhittingham,Surprisingly heartbreaking,8,6 October 2020,I've been waiting to watch this movie for years. Ever since my obsession with Blake Lively started in 2015 and it finally came on Netflix. I put it on expecting it to be funny and weird. You would expect that when a movie is about a pair of jeans.

69,Sunshineyness,Bad... but darnet if I didn't cry.,6,14 October 2005,"Okay. Is the movie good? God no. It's cheap, overly sentimental to the point of sapification, and full of all that ""OMG! Bset friends 4EVA!"" crap. But dammit to heck, if I didn't cry like a baby.And by the way, I am a girl.And I have read all three books.Wow. Amber Tamblyn can't act. No, seriously. She is one of those girls who has the air that they can act (as if they were sent to acting classes all their life and groomed for that life by a parent) but if you really watch her she is just doing an imitation of someone who can act. Like, you never get real emotion from her. It's hard to explain. I just don't like her. I dunno. And her story is the biggest provider of the maudlin over the top sap, ever. But I still cried. I'm an easy mark.The girl who played Bridget seemed more fixated on her hair and her mouth doing weird things than her part... And, holy crap, could they have cast a worse looking dude to play Eric?! The whole time in the film I was screaming ""Bridge! No! Can't you see his tips?!?! EWWW!"" But, oh well. I'm sure the 12 year old girls thought he was a hottie. Her plot was always the best to me. The only one that seemed truly real. And the movie had it play out really good. I give them props for that. Only the book actually gave a description of Eric that actually made me understand WHY she wanted him, but... oh well. Just thinking of Eric's blond tips and LA Paul Walker-ish loser type makes me cringe even now.Alexis Bledel was all right, as per usual. Nothing stellar, but it's nice to see her trying to do something non-Gilmore Girl-ish. And I will admit it, the dude who played Kostos was a hottie. And I liked how their plot (the biggest change from the books) actually played out a lot better than in the book. There. I said it. Really, and seemed a bit more real than in the book too. (I mean, explain to me how in the book it REALLY MAKES it seem like they're in love? She barely spoke a word to him, and spent all of two seconds with him. But, I digress) I loved the girl who played Carmen in ""Real Women Have Curves"" and she was pretty good in this too... although I have NEVER cared for the way her plot ends. *SPOILER* I know it was in the book too, but COME ON! She did NOT have to go to her father's wedding, and how lame was it that in the end he ""really did love her"" when his fiancée didn't even know what she looked like. You know what that implies? He doesn't even have a pic of her in his home/wallet. That's not a good dad. And I thought it would've been a less predictable and more realistic story to have him really just abandon her for a new family. Cuz, guess what, sometimes parents really DO do that. I know a lot of kids whose parents did that. Abandon them for a new family. I just thought it was a crap way out, that's all. Too perfect of an ending for me. But... oh well.Okay, I admit it. There's something odd about these books and movie. I DON'T KNOW WHY BUT I CRIED! And as me and my female friend left the theater (both of us crying, even though we both thought it was a bad movie) we cooed, ""oh my God. We need to share pants!!"" There's something odd about it that it can make a girl do that. Because, it's bad, yet it hits you. Which is why I can't REALLY say I hate the movie/books. Because there IS something guttural and emotional that'll hit you in it, even though it's poorly written and the plots can anger you over how they turn out (meaning not deserved, not that it ended sad and you wanted happy. I'm saying the ones that ended too perfect. Like Carmen's) I dunno. It's bad... but goshdarnet I cried my eyes out. Haven't got a clue why though, lol.",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants

I'm completely biased here  I've loved ensemble movies all my life. From St. Elmo's Fire that I watched a half a dozen times at least, obsessively, at the MAD (Movie A Day) Club at my alma mater more than a dozen years ago, to Indian Summer, one of my favorite movies of all time, to Peter's Friends, I've seen a good many of them, more than I can remember now. The two big ones I haven't seen (yet, that's going to change soon) are The Big Chill and The Breakfast Club.Anyway back to Sisterhood. This is a very very sweet movie, that touched me in all the right places, cute without being cutesy. B, Carmen, Ilena & Tibby, four 17 year old 'young women' who have been inseparable best friends their 'whole life', on the verge of a summer vacation when they will be separated for the first time, discover a pair of jeans that miraculously (considering they are built sufficiently differently) fit all of them perfectly, and that they decide to share (by using in turns and mailing to the next in line) over the summer. A simple enough device to keep us engaged while the film charts the separate stories of the girls as they learn about Life and Love, it eventually does all come together as we see that the stories are not all that distinct. This is what makes this ensemble movie distinct from previous ones, here the four girls' stories develop separately, as they struggle with their issues which actually form a neat set, the discernment of which is the fulfillment of the experience of this film. This is a story of Trust and Judgement, of Self and the Other, very unassuming and pretentiously done. And beautiful. Very beautiful. Each of the girls is vulnerable and attractive and very easy to like. The film itself is visually a delight, with a lovely soundtrack to match, and I found myself feeling happy just with the images and sounds. At the start, one of the girls narrating the stories says 'It was as though we were all parts of the same person'. It is this magical sense of partness and wholeness and togetherness and distinctness and connectedness that makes this such a lovely film. Not a great film by any means, but a really lovely one.",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants
72,lovely1249,Great,9,13 June 2005,"I liked The Sisterhood Of the Traveling pants because it showed four different women going through four different situations. I liked Lena because she brought out the conservative side in you. She was nice and sweet and it was good to see her have fun. I really liked the guy Costas,he was so cute. The writers wrote something good with her because she finally came out of her shell and had a good time. I think it was Greece and it looked great. Carmen I really liked though the step son was perfect for her so i wished that she could have gone through that with her dad and meet a cute boy maybe so she could have had a love interest too. So maybe I wish he wasn't her dad's step son but someone she meets while playing tennis. Tibby's was great I would not have changed anything. It made me cry and I loved every minute of it. Bridgette's was OK. I guess I really can not say anything because I do not know what would have changed it. But when they were together it was magical.

75,laske2,If you look hard enough.....,6,23 June 2005,"If you look hard enough you just might see that this movie was originally a book, and therefore has some pseudo-intellectual aspects to it. For starters, I have read a few comments that said that the acting is actually quite good. Personally I would have to disagree. The best actor in the whole movie is the little girl who plays Tibby's assistant (She's 12). The rest is average, but it works because this movie is not trying to win an Academy Award. Back to the good points, if you cut out the cheese and padding (often of the actresses bras), you can see the movie has a message. It's about exceptin the time you have as good, busting through the bad, and trying your hardest to find yourself. For a movie made for teenagers, and being a teenager, I can't think of a more appropriate set of messages.",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants

My mom and i went to see the movie and we enjoyed it than any movie than we have ever seen before. the cast was the best choices of all Amber Tamblyn, Blake Lively, Alexis Beldel, and America Ferrera. from the previous movies i have seen with all of these actresses this is their best performance ever. this movie is truly a 10/10 and in my book on a scale of 1 -10 this movie is a 20.

77,nextbyandlarge,The very first love for English-speaking culture,10,9 June 2019,"Each character's story has a highlight. And the pants connect four girls as they are growing separately in their own place. The film depicts what only teenagers can do and describe their freewheeling spirits vividly.
After I watched this film, I became interested in the lifestyle in English speaking country. This urges my desire to visit the US and it actually made me fly to California (this film is set in Maryland tho).
Although the story doesn't always take place in the US, I could tell how American girls behave as a normal girl. Bridget, especially, is the one who impressed me and I thought she's similar to me if I'd say. The audience surely can enjoy which character is the one you have something in common with.",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants
78,BiblicalPerspective,Better Than the Book,8,26 April 2019,"This movie made me cry, and I appreciated it. (Now, I will not watch sad movies just to cry; this movie was not a downer, it was whimsical and sweet as well.) But sometimes crying is a good thing, and it means I've connected well with the characters. I enjoyed watching the girls develop throughout the film, and found myself empathizing with them through their tears and heartache. I didn't like one plot more than the others, though I do have to say Brigitte's point of view was a little less stimulating for me. I understand her motives, however, and was pleased that she came to understand them as well.It's a sign you have a good movie on your hands when you feel a little lonely afterwards. As if you truly believed in the story, and wanted to continue believing that it was happening still, at the very same moment. Of course, you know, there are many friendships out there like this, and that makes my heart happy and satisfied. We need more movies about friendship that tie in real life-hardships as well! It doesn't have to always be about romance, it can be about daily life and the struggles of just being a teenager, too.",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants

When I turned on the TV to HBO, they were already like, almost halfway thru the movie, but I really liked it. This is a touching movie and I cried in the part wherein Tibby visited her little girl friend who's in the hospital. I thought I was just being too emotional and I'm the only one who cried but when I read some of the reviews, I found out lots of people cried too. That says something . A movie which can move emotions and make people cry is almost always a good movie.All of the girls played their part really well. And the soundtrack is really good and fits the theme of the movie well.",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants
80,super_smiley89,Pants=Love. Love the pants. Love this movie!,9,31 May 2005,"People of all ages will be touched by this cheerful story of love and friendship focused around four teens who are spending their first summer apart. Based on the first book in the hit trilogy by Ann Brashares, ""The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants"" is a joy from the opening sequence to the closing credits. The film starts out with four girls, very different in personality and shape, finding a pair of pants that fits them all despite their physical variations. Seeing the rarity of this event, they decide to send the pants back and forth through the summer.Lena is in Santorini, Greece, and she gets the pants first. Then they progress to Tibby, stuck working at home. Next is Carmen, using the pants to help her through her dad's new engagement in South Carolina. The final 'sister' to receive the jeans is Bridget, at an exclusive soccer camp in Baja California. The pants help the girls through rough times and support them when things go well, representing everything that they need while they are separated.Everybody has known one of these girls at some point in their life. Bridget is an intense go-getter and athletic superstar, Lena is a shy, conservative beauty. Tibby is sarcastic and cynical, but always there for her friends, and Carmen is a loving, warm person who struggles to find out where she fits in. Audiences will identify right away with the girls and recognize the others from their own experiences. We've all got sides that mirror each of them, and that is what ties the audience to the actors.Serious fans of the book will notice that some details have been changed for the film- but don't be discouraged, none of them detract in any way from its quality. The actresses and the supporting cast are convincing and easy to like, and the settings are amazing. From the beaches of Baja California to the stone cliffs of Santorini, it's all gorgeous. The progression is logical and brings you along to feel what all the characters are feeling and to see their interaction. Those expecting a fluffy chick-flick will be surprised. Though some of the content has been toned down for younger audiences, ""The Sisterhood"" is not a superficial movie. It deals with appearances, prejudice, rules, death, and various other topics that provoke thought about what it is that society feels, and what it is that the viewer feels. To keep the tone up, comedy and lighthearted witticisms are interspersed with the deeper topics.The part that people will enjoy most about this movie is its sense of family. The pants represent the friendship that stays strong despite separation, and allows some comfort. The girls are always there for each other, understanding what and when help is needed. Even in the family arguments that inevitably arise, the ties are strong between all the characters. At the end of the movie, you will feel like everything is all right in the world and no matter what difficulties arise, you will overcome them.",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants

Great movie to take young girls to.Story of four thoroughly lovable young women who truly care about each other and the way they find to stay connected during a summer apart. I haven't read the books, but would like to now.A few moments of Hollywood cliché and/or predictability, but largely avoids these and those it does contain do nothing to spoil the experience - and that's the worst I can say about this movie. Warm, fuzzy, refreshing,fun. No good guys or bad guys or judgements; just people getting on w/ their lives and doing the best they can w/ what they have.

82,peeweek9,A Movie You Shouldn't See Unless You Like Horrible Movies,1,7 June 2005,"This Movie, ""The Sisterhood of The Traveling Pants,"" is an unbelievable disappointment. I have read the books, and not only do they Completely change Lenas' summer, but they make drastic changes to all of the characters, which makes them two-dimensional. I say the following not jokingly, the only good part of the movie is when it ends. It is also, depressing, which the books aren't. In conclusion, the only way I would see this movie again is if I were payed an obscene amount of money. The only thing I took away from this film is to NEVER EVER see its leading actresses in any-other film. Long Story Short?: A bad movie with bad actresses, cheap sets, and a waste of $7.00",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants
83,surobhideb,Sweet movie,4,12 April 2016,The story line behind the movie was not that very exciting and the movie lost its way multiple times. I wish there were 3 girls instead of 4 as it really got difficult to keep track of each of them unless you are totally hooked to the movie. None of the characters had an interesting personality that one could make a favorite of. There are not many movies about female bonding and in that respect it does a quiet okay job. Overall its just so so. I watched it on television and I guess that's the best way to be watching. I could not feel the emotions that the characters went through and found the same to be very cold at all the times. The only thing that kept me sitting was to learn what was going to occur at the end and if there were any exciting twists. Unfortunately the only twist i had was not to have one.,The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants
84,childoasis,"Comment on ""Traveling Pants""",10,13 June 2005,"I wait years for a movie like this to come along. This is a classic. It is better than any of the ""coming of age"" movies from my generation and the last several. The characters are a true rendering of the cultural soul of the times. The plot is revelatory of deep meaning in life. The theme is seated in love. The performances are exquisite. The production quality is superb. I expect this movie to get Best Picture, which would be a first for this genre. There is a ten line minimum, and I have said what I have to say. So the reader may stop at any time from here on; I'm just filling up space. The psychology of each character is sound, but that's just good writing anyway.",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants

Can't wait for the second movie to come out. Great song, ""Be,Be Your Love"" by Rachel Yamagata. Best parts: When Tibby and Bailey are laying in the grass talking.

86,tiffytaffy14,Truly Refreshing!!,10,15 July 2005,"In a world where it's so hard to find a good friend...it was quite refreshing to see a group of girls who embody the true meaning of friends...sisters. Another unfortunate occurrence in today's world, is the disembowelment of a wonderful novel, with such a powerful meaning and sense of direction. Unlike most, this movie kept close to it's original form...the novel. I laughed...I cried...and marveled at the honest and upfront depiction of these four young women, that I could relate so closely to myself. I felt for each one of them, as I watched the roller coaster of emotions that each girl succumbed to. The feeling of losing a parent..whether to death or to marriage...the feeling of losing that one thing that means the most to our self-worth...the feeling of losing the greatest person you know..and waking up the next day, and realizing the only way to deal with it...is to be strong..even if it is through a pair of pants. How funny..a pair of pants were truly the threads of the sisterhood..keeping everything so tightly woven together..while the world was falling apart. A truly magical story...meant for everyone to enjoy. I give this one two thumbs up!!!",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants
87,katryna111,"Great Acting, Good Storyline, Great Message!",9,5 June 2005,"*Warning: Possible Spoilers!* In an industry where teenage girls are portrayed far too stereotypically, it's nice to see a movie that portrays ACCURATE representations of 4 adolescent girls- 4 girls with differing sizes, personalities and priorities, but all with the commonality of their deep friendship for one another. I was so happy to watch a movie that didn't show teenage girls partying and drinking, among other things, but being focused, and questioning their decisions and future. Alleuia to the fact that Carmen was a bit on the heavy side, that Lena was beautiful without loads of makeup, and that Bridget's ploy to seduce Eric wasn't completely his fault. I also enjoyed that the film addressed (fairly accurately, might I add) issues that regular teenage girls face everyday- issues like suicide of a parent, feelings of loss from divorced parents, the whirlwind of emotions after losing your virginity, the loss of a friend, and the trials and tribulations of maturing into a woman.America Ferrera (Carmen), Alexis Bledel (Lena), Amber Tamblyn (Tibby), and Blake Lively (Bridget) gave amazing performances as each of their respective characters, and the acting didn't seem forced or rehearsed, but fairly simultaneous. In my opinion, America and Amber stole the show, but Alexis and Blake were extremely good as well.The reason why this movie works is because the themes are universal for it's target age group, and because it makes you hope that maybe, just maybe, it's possible in some shape or form for every teenage girl to have the kind of bond which the pants' four ""sisters"" share.9/10, because some things were a tiny bit cliché, although it still worked for the movie.",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants
88,Livana,"Good movie, didn't stray far from book.",8,9 May 2005,"I saw this movie at a screening way back in November, in Phoenix, with my mother. I had gotten her to read the book before we saw it, and we both enjoyed it, so when we heard about the screening, we jumped at the chance to go.The movie is about four friends: Carmen, Tibby, Lena, and Bridget. They've been friends since even before birth, as their mothers took Lamaze classes or something like that together. Throughout the movie, there are flashbacks to when they were little kids. The movie takes place in the summer, the first one they've really spent apart. Before they take off in different directions, they discover a pair of jeans that magically fit each of them perfectly. They decide to send the pants to each other on and off throughout the summer. Carmen goes to visit her divorced (or so she thinks) father, Tibby makes a documentary, Lena visits her family in Greece, and Bridget goes to a soccer camp in Mexico.Big things happen to each of them over the summer. Carmen finds out that her dad is engaged a woman with two kids who's opposite to her mom: white, southern, and kinda bland. After spending some time with them, she freaks out and leaves. Tibby thinks she's going to be bored to death working at Walmans, even if she does film everything, but when she meets a dying girl, her summer isn't so boring after all. Lena almost drowns while sketching on the docks in Greece, but then she falls in love with her savior, who unfortunately her family hates. Bridget makes a big mistake at her soccer camp when she goes after a coach too strongly, and he responds, leaving her to regret her decision. But by the end of the movie, everything is all right, and the girls have come together again at Carmen's father's wedding.All of the acting in this movie was great. Some of the story lines and characters in the book were changed, sometimes actually making the movie better. I would recommend this to a friend.8 out of 10 stars.",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants

It is sure to satisfy those interested in all the excitement that the book has generated. I'm not so sure it will be found truly satisfying by those of us who read the delightful book. My complaint lies in the changes in the writing. Most of the characters' story lines are similar to those in the book, however, I'm disappointed in the alteration of one of the main character's ""adventure."" It is retold with in a simpler, more traditional romantic style. It lacks the quirky and edgy style the author brought to us in her telling. Real life is like that whether you are 15 or 50.

91,sparkleallie,i LOVED this movie,8,24 June 2005,"Being a HUGE fan of the novel, i was almost scared to see how the movie would be made. I was scared that screenwriters would try to make it too ""hollywood"". after seeing a late showing of the movie, i know i had nothing to worry about. the movie follows the basic storyline of the book, four best friends find a pair of pants that fit all of them terrific. This is the first summer that all four best friends are spending it apart. Tibby, the rebel, is staying home for the summer and is the only one of the four to do so. she is working at the local Wallman's and is making a ""suck-umentary"" over the summer. Lena, the quiet one, is going to Greece over the summer. although in the book she has a sister, there are no siblings in the movie. Carmen, the ""genius who just doesn't know it"", is going to visit her dad in south Carolina for the first time in forever and is TOTALLY excited about it. Bridget, the outgoing one, is off to Baja for a soccer camp. the four friends are completely different and the pants fit all of them differently. the summer starts out with the four girls creating a ritual and making rules for the pants over the summer, some of which include no washing the pants and no double cuffing the pant legs. : ). When Lena gets to Greece, she meets a boy, Kostas. (spelled and pronounced differently in the actual book)...she is told their families are enemies and that she must never see him again. of course this doesn't happen and she falls in love. Carmen, when she reaches South Carolina, finds her father is getting married and she must accept three new people into her family, much to her dismay. Tibby meets a girl named Bailey. A 12 year old girl with a big heart, and cancer. During the course of the movie, Bailey's cancer gets worse and there is a heart-wrenching scene towards the end of the film involving Amber Tamblyn and Jenna Boyd which proves that these two actresses are both able to act WELL. Bridget, my favorite character, when in Baja meets a guy. well, a coach, who she falls for. Eric. she stops at nothing to get what she wants, and when she finally she gets it, she wasn't sure it was what she wanted after all. Of course all four best friends come back together in the end, to share their stories and to help one another through hard times. This movie wasn't just for girls like me, who read and loved the book, but for people who have a strong value of friendship. who have a few friends they would do anything for. the traveling pants aren't just for them to admire how one pair of pants fit all four of them amazingly, but how strong their friendship really is. so what if the movie isn't EXACTLY like the book. the same message flows strongly through both, PANTS=LOVE. LOVE YOUR PALS, LOVE YOURSELF. Love this movie because it will be one of the sweetest ones you'll see for a while. i swear it.",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants

The movie was slightly different from the books but so are all movies.This movie was about friendships, love, and family.

93,scheller_2003,A rarity indeed! A teen movie with brain and heart,8,25 January 2006,"It is sometimes pretty difficult to differentiate good and bad movies. I like to believe any kind of movie can be good -- horror films, art films, chick flicks, action etc. This is a teen movie -- and a damn good one. It is what I like to call ""a teen movie with brain and heart"". The story revolves around four best friends which are going to spend summer apart for the first time. Miraculously, they find a pair of pants that fit all of them (despite their different body features) perfectly. (It is a teen movie, and one has to accept its premise in order to like it) Once apart, the pair of pants bring the four separate stories together. In common, the four girls will have growing experience, often revolving around losses and new beginnings. The cast incredibly strong for such kind of movie. Amber Tamblyn (from ""Joan of Arcadia"") and Jenna Boyd are good as the authors of a ""suckmentary"" about their hometown as standouts. America Ferrara (from the independent ""Real Women Have Curves""), playing the Latin girl trying to get to terms with her uptown dad, shows incredible range and vitality and almost steels the film away. However, director Ken Kwapis has a firm hand and make all the stories interesting - the plot is completed by Alexis Bledel (""Gilmore Girls"") involved in a light ""Romeo and Juliet"" story in Greece, and Blake Lively is a soccer player trying to lose her virginity in Mexico. Kwapis never loses focus and the film ends up being a satisfying experience: none of the stories is left without conclusion, but the script leaves the most interesting of them to the last minute. ""Siterhood of the Travelling Pants"" is not ashamed to be what it is: a very well-made commercial fare.",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants

I actually cried this time both when Bailey dies and when Carmen is telling her dad, how she feels on the phone.

What starts as a light comedy about four friends who find a pair of yes, magic jeans, turns out to be the most heartfelt, heartbreaking movie so far this year. Whoever you are -- man, woman, child, hardened criminal -- get ready to weep. THE WRITE STUFF: Based on Ann Brashares' best-selling 2001 novel, Sisterhood is about four teenage girls spending their first summer apart -- and experiencing the joy and terror of growing up. The actresses are astonishing, bringing the right balance of toughness and vulnerability to their roles. Like a female-friendly Stand By Me, Sisterhood captures adolescent friendship with remarkable realism, and presents some of the richest, fullest characters in memory. Like Stand By Me, it deserves to be a modern classic. THE VERDICT: Join the sisterhood! 4 stars (out of 4)",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants

So i got really excited about seeing the movie and honestly i don't think it was as great because it didn't really follow the book and excluded one of the main characters sister who was an important part of the book+it didn't show the real relationship of these girls and what kept them friends for all these long years.On the other hand it had some humor parts and actually made me cry when Tibbys(one of the main characters)friend died because she had leukemia at th age of 10...:(I hope you agree with me and my comments for this movie,The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants
106,Josh_Molinero,Breaking the trend.,8,21 May 2005,"Originally I had to read this book as part of my job reviewing fiction that is aimed at teens through young adults. The most recent trend I've noticed is the current uprise in books that talk about the real B****es of the high school world. The sex scandals, the drug busts, the foul mouthed youth...I'm only twenty and books like these have me saying ""What's with those kids today"" This book wasn't about that. It was about something really admirable that I would hope to read more of, an honest friendship. Plus it was well written to the point I was *EAGER* to finish it. (A note to those who haven't read...the audio book is one of the best read I've heard in ages and is worse the listen, it has the same actress as the initial trailer announcer) So I became a fan of the book and have been following this movie ever since, and as a fan I have to say that their are elements I would have liked to see in the movie, but the cut (or at least the cut at the screening) was lengthy but appropriate and did the best I think they could have to capture the book.The real heart of this movie though is between the chemistry of the main actresses. Most of them are playing parts a good five to six years under their actual age, and yes they don't all fit the images I had in the book...but it's what they present that shows off. I think it's the added and personal experience these girls have had to go through in real life, mostly from age and experience that helps them to really develop these characters. I admire these girls friendships and connections, and at the same time I envy them...and even further on, it's seems a little too hopeful for it's own good. The world would be a better place if people could hold on like these girls do, through thick and thin, death and marriage.Still, this movie is an excellent movie for teen audiences, and it has a lot more depth than recent fluffbits based on novels and old stories (See Ice Princess, A Cinderella Story, Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen, etc.) It also has enough older audience humor to relate to all ages, but not to the dark (albeit funny...in a twisted sort of way) point of popular hits such as Meangirls. Personally I think it would have done better to have been released around mothers day as it's a movie definitely targeted at the female group. Mom's...you'll like this, because it's not quite to the sappy point of the notebook and retains a lot of good-natured humor. (at the same time you may not because it does discuss some teen issues...and it might insight conversations with the offspring) As a guy though...I still think it was pretty damn funny, in a heartfelt sort of way.",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants
107,sealbeachfun,Cute chick flick,5,20 June 2005,"I saw this movie weeks after it came out. I wanted to see another movie, but it was sold out, so I saw this one instead, mainly, because it started at nearly the same time as the other one.This movie is about 4 best friends who are separated for the summer. To keep them together, they agree to share a pair of pants that magically, despite their body shape differences, fits each one of them perfectly.Shy Lena (Alexis Bledel, Gilmore Girls' Rory) goes off to Greece and is the first person to wear the pants. While wearing them, she meets a handsome Greek man who saves her life.The pants are then forwarded to Tibby (Amber Tamblyn, ""Joan of Arcadia"")who is spending the summer working at a make Wal-Mart knock off store, stocking shelves. Her real passion is film making. She plans to make a documentary of her summer, which she predicts will be a ""suckumentary"". During work she finds a small girl named Bailey who has passed out on the floor (with no parent in sight) and has her rushed to the hospital. Bailey returns to the store and becomes Tibby's assistant, helping her interview, and actually, doing a better job than Tibby.The pants are forwarded to Carmen (America Ferrera, ""Real Women Have Curves""), who is spending the summer with her father. She states she hasn't spent four consecutive days with him in her whole life. When she arrives at his house, she is surprised to find that he has a new family living with him and is in the process of marrying a woman. The children are Carmen's age, but are one of the ""pretty people"", while Carmen is an overweight Puerto Rican.Carmen is immediately jealous of that her father has taken the role of father to this new woman's children since he was never really a father to her.The pants are then forwarded to Bridget(newcomer Blake Lively) who is away at Soccer Camp. She is an all-star soccer player who lives alone with her father, after her mother passed away. Her father has absolutely no personality and no communication skills, which leaves Bridget looking for love. This movie was a good movie--enjoyable and watchable, but not an Oscar contender. It is a sweet sleeper or chick flick at best. A good movie for young girls.",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants
108,gift_lady,Four Friends Find Magic in a Pair of Jeans,7,14 August 2005,"I was finally able to see this movie and enjoyed it very much. The first few minutes of the movie seemed a bit stilted, especially when the 4 girls were outlining the rules of the pants. But when they got off on their own and really hit their groove the characters flourished and they stopped sounding like they were reading cue cards. All four of the actresses - five if you count the girl playing Bailey - did a wonderful job showing the friendship that can exist between very different people. I wondered why the entire cast didn't do more to promote the movie. Even though Alexis Bledel and Amber Tamblyn are more well known, the movie may have achieved more of a fan base if all of the girls promoted it together.",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants
109,ohhssweetheart,"Brilliant, although not exactly like the book",10,26 July 2005,"This film is one of the best films of recent times. I have read the books, and although the film is not exactly like the book, with the entire storyline of Lena changed a LOT, the film is good in it's own right. It made me, and many of the people in the cinema cry, and laugh, and by the end, you really feel for the characters. Hopefully this film will do well enough for a sequel to be made, to show what happens to the girls, and to show just how brilliant Ann Brashares is as a writer. The soundtrack of this film is very good, with all of the songs being appropriate. Chantal Kreviazuk, Natasha Bedingfield, Alana Grace, The Faders and many others provide fantastic songs, keeping with the tones and story lines of the book and film. I would really recommend that you see this. Excellent!",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants
110,socalledboothy,Love the Sisterhood!,10,1 June 2005,"This was an excellent movie. I found every aspect of it really well done. The acting was excellent, the cinematography was amazing, and the music soundtrack was great too! The four actresses were really good and fit their characters really well.I have read all three books and I'm a 19 year old guy. The books were amazing, just like this movie was. The movie held true to the book's spirit and message and helped the movie become the great film it is. I heard that if this does well, they may do movies of the next two books, which would be awesome, in my opinion. After leaving the movie, it made me want to see more. I can't wait to get the DVD; it's gonna be so awesome!!",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants
111,Katealyna,Tearjerker if there ever was one.,10,16 January 2006,"This film is amazing. The four young women are incredible and are very talented actors. When I first heard they were doing a film version of the books I had my doubts. When I saw this film (on the last day of school with, as it were, three of my girlfriends) everyone in the movie theater was crying. This movie touches you in a way you would not think a ""kids"" movie would. You can relate to at least one of these characters because each is so different. Even now about seven-eight months later, we are still talking about this film. The only time I ever cried in a movie before was at the end of Armageddon. Now I can add a second film to that. I recommend this film for any group of young women who want to life and cry together. This film has no age range. Anyone can relate to it.",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants
112,Whats_Updog,"Great book, but the movie left out/changed important plot points.",7,4 June 2005,"'The Sisterhood of the Travelling Pants' is a great book. In the movie, Lena is portrayed by Alexis Bledel (of 'Gilmore Girls'), Carmen by America Ferrera (of 'Real Women Have Curves'), Tibby by Amber Tamblyn (of 'Joan of Arcadia') and Bridget by newcomer Blake Lively. These four girls have been best friends since before they were born and have never been apart, until the summer after their sophomore year of high school, when they're 15 going on 16. Carmen, expecting to have a great summer with her dad, begins to feel invisible when she finds out that he's engaged to a rich woman with two perfect blonde children. Lena goes to Greece and meets a boy. Bridget goes to an all-girls summer soccer camp and seduces one of the male coaches. And Tibby, left at home, gets a job and meets a girl who teaches her a valuable lesson.The reason I give the movie a 7 is because they changed too much of the plot for my liking. First of all, Bridget has a twin brother named Perry. Lena was born first of them all, not Bridget. Lena's grandparents try to set Lena up with Kostos, but in the movie, Lena's family and Kostos's family hate each other, making Lena's love a forbidden one. Lena also has a sister named Effie. A minor thing is that Tibby has a two-year-old brother and a one-year-old sister in the book, not a four-year-old sister and a one-year-old brother. However, the one that gets me the most of the storyline for Lena.7/10.",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants
113,Natwin-1,Awesome!,10,21 June 2006,"I cannot tell you how long it's been since I cried seeing a movie. I think this is a movie that teenage girls can really relate to. It made me warm and fuzzy and also broke my heart. It was one of the best I have seen in years and has instantly become one of my favorites; most definitely in my top 10. The characters seem like real people. I could nearly see myself in any of those situations. Furthermore, I found this film inspirational. When you finish viewing it, it leaves with a good feeling inside, like you can do or accomplish anything. I also think the film was filmed most exquisitely. The scenery was breath taking. I highly recommend this film!!!!!",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants
114,possibility-girl,Perfect! - But only if you haven't read the book,7,21 July 2006,"I read the book long time ago - 1 or 2 years ago I think - but I rent this movie before month. I was really looking forward to seeing it, especially I forgot all about book. But, even I that forgot all, saw it was changed from book. Like first, whole think with Lena and Kostas was changed! They families argued on end and where are all those scenes in hill by lake? It's all moved to the dock. Thats stupid, since hill would make it look more romantic. I think Alexis done fine job in Lena's role, I liked her, but I didn't like guy who played Kostas - although his acting is fin he should be more attractive. And where is Lena's little sister??? Brigit wasn't so proud or quick. Although it's OK all with her scenes and actress that plays her is really good, I think people who hasn't read the book might not see what happened between her and Eric.Carmen was great in acting, but most of people hasn't seen her so fat. Her lines and moves were close to book, girls didn't went with her on her father's wedding.Tibby was best played and her story is closes to book. I loved girl who played Baily - she's so cute! And you really DO see change in Tibby on end of film! Tibby's my favorite character in book, and so does go with film. Too bad they didn't put her hamster in film too.Things I liked about movie are simple: I liked acting in main roles - Alexis, Amber, America and Blake did great job, they really look like care-free 15-year-old girl. I liked emotions. I liked friendship between the girls! I liked Baily! I liked pants! Even if movie doesn't follow book, it is good, it makes you really think about girls. It's really warm movie and it does show connection between the girls and pants.",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants
115,lannychuck,a good little movie,7,9 June 2005,"Saw this movie with wife and two grand daughters. I was the only male in the audience--but, hey, there were only four people in the theater. And I think this is too bad. While I suppose this is a teenage chick flick, I thought it transcended most of that genre in that the main characters were intelligent, genuine human beings and not MTV stereotypes. The four actresses were up to the material and were able to convey their characters' strengths and weaknesses effectively. I also appreciated (as a male) that the young men in the film were shown as caring and decent--not just ""dreamboats"", funny sidekicks, or sex-crazed drunken frat boys--the other male stereotypes in so many films aimed at teens. This is a movie I think most females can relate to and that most mature viewers could enjoy except, maybe, for the guys who are still in arrested development and think that the only good movie is one where people and things get blown up or otherwise destroyed. And, hey, I like those movies too when they have a good script and good direction.",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants
116,charlweb-1,So-so adaptation,5,26 August 2005,"***Spoilers*** As an avid fan of the Sisterhood of the Travelling Pants novels, I was more than a bit disappointed by the movie. While the casting was good, I especially enjoyed the acting of America Ferrara (Carmen) and Amber Tamblyn (Tibby), I was confused as to why the stories of Bridget and Lena were changed so drastically. To me, the way the book dealt with Bridget and Eric was much more realistic than the way it was handled at the end of the movie. This was made, no doubt, to appeal to a younger audience.I think that the books dealt with some complex teen problems quite well, whereas the movie seemed to gloss over them. The distributors of the movie seemed to be pressing for a PG-rating, which really doesn't do the books justice. while the movie did have some positive points, namely the character Bailey (Jenna Boyd), as well as the stories of Tibby and Carmen, overall I think that the adaptation was lackluster. I would rent this movie- not buy it.",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants
117,jedigollum,So... Which Girl Are you?,5,14 June 2005,"I am not one to like these types of ""girly"" movies -- I spend all my cash on Nirvana and other rock bands, movies about skaters and fighters, and definitely not on looks unless it be a concert T-Shirt. This movie I was forced to come and watch with my mother and sister and I dreaded the long boredom that awaited me.Since there are four girls, you really have to find which you most are like. There is one who is very creative, making movies and being herself. She knows who she is, and is very smart even if she thinks life totally sucks -- that's normal for a teenager. Another is much louder, she is fatter than the others and she can get angry very quickly, but she is also kind and very talkative, though self-conscious. One of the four is a blonde, a sporty, thin, pretty blonde who is just interested in boys and lives happy no matter what, though inside she misses her mother badly. The last of the four is shy, she is quiet and embarrassed. She doesn't want to show off, nor to show her body. Not a bikini for her and even she finds jeans are too revealing. If none of these are anything like you or interest you, you will not really enjoy it -- You really have to find which is like you, or which two of them. You could even be like all of them - I am both creative and shy, for example.Looking at this from the eyes of a girl who would like such a movie, perhaps this would be enjoyable. Perhaps a girl who loved movies about all kinds of different girls that involves some romance will be in love with this movie -- Not me, for sure.At the start, things are very, very, very slow and dull yet at the same time, too too fast. It's hard to get facts straight like whose mother died and whose father left, it took me until half the movie to finally understand that part, and then they also make you guess some things until the end of the movie - For example, a girl passes out in the store, but not until the near-end will you learn why. And, the mother of Bridgette dies, but if it WAS mentioned why, it was not clear enough for me to understand.Nearer to the end, when the girls are separated, things are somewhat more of interest. You can see more emotion and things when they are gone, but still, some of the girls had more interesting stories to tell than others, and some can be very boring or some very sad.Overall, it wasn't my favorite and I think it is okay to see, but maybe renting it is cheaper, or even better yet, read the book beforehand to know if this is the type that you think will be for you. I would only give it a 5/10... Could have been better!",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants
118,GusterKat,"it was pretty good, however did have some MAJOR book differences",7,9 June 2005,"The acting in the movie was enjoyable, and they all did an excellent job of portraying their character as was int he book. However, there were several MAJOR things that bothered me about the movie in relation to the book. First off, they cut Bridgets twin (perry) , and Effie Lenas sister who plays a very important role in understanding the dynamics of the second and third books (as well as the first). There didn't seem to be a real reason as to why they did this.Also, and i may have just forgotten this from the book, they had Eric stop by Bridget's house after camp. I don't remember this happening, but i did read the book almost 3 years ago.one REALLY big thing that i don't understand why they did at ALL, was make Kostos' family and Lena's family not like each other. in the book their grandparents were forcing them together (more her then him *wink*) in the movie, they have the grandparents hating each other. Why?over all it was enjoyable, and the girls were cast very well. if you haven't seen the movie you'll probably enjoy it more, but it was enjoyable either way.",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants
119,katia_iz_here,Long Live The Sisterhood.,9,8 June 2005,"I am 16 years old and a huge fan of Ann Brashares 'Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants' books. Although i am upset that some of the story lines have been changed (For example: Tibby's guinea pig Mimi missing and how she is introduced to Bailey, Lena's story which has been completely changed and Bridgets non-existent twin brother Perry as so with Lena's sister Effie...etc, etc) ,realistically these small things had to be changed for a feature film. If Lena's story was left the way it was in the book her part would have dragged out making it even more boring than it was. So i accepted these changes and thoroughly enjoyed the film. I'm not going to lie i was so excited to see this movie. I have been waiting for it's release for months, and i wasn't disappointed.I'm pretty sure everyone knows the plot for this movie so i will give a vague outline of it. Four teenage friends who are inseparable find a pair of pants that all fits them perfectly despite their different shapes and sizes. They then make a sisterhood with the pants and Fed Ex them off to each other after having them for a week to keep in touch over their first summer apart.All four actresses were great. My favourite out of the lot was Amber Tamblyn (Tibby). I was a fan of hers before i went into this movie but came out a bigger fan. She is excellent at playing the sullen Tibby. She will make you laugh she will make you cry. Tibby's storyline is the most emotional and moving of the four. Just the way Tamblyn brings emotion into her acting makes it obvious she is one of the biggest rising stars at the moment that we can expect big things from.America Ferrera (Carmen) was also a standout and her storyline is also quite emotional, although I do find her character Carmen a little whiney and annoying at times.Blake Lively (Bridget) did well for her first acting gig, although she doesn't have as much to work with and her character isn't painted as likable as the other girls are.Alexis Bledel (Lena) has been getting the most slack for her portrayal of Lena. If you can get around the fact that she isn't 'Greek' she doesn't do that bad a job. With Alexis Bledel she has a very mono type voice which doesn't give you a long attention span watching her. But since she is very gorgeous and has a presence on the screen she keeps you glued.As always book adaptations are changed for a movie and there is nothing we can do about it. If you go in the theatre after reading the books and expect what you read you would indeed be disappointed. But then again you shouldn't be ignorant enough to actually think it would be exactly the same. But hey, if you haven't read the books you will absolutely love it!The Sisterhood... is one of the best teen films of the noughties and of recent years and doesn't rely on the common clichés of late i.e girl meets boy, they fall in love and live happily ever after, etc. Only Bridget's story falls into that category but doesn't end in the same way. All the other girls stories tackle deeper issues that aren't usually mentioned or realistically portrayed in teen films. I.e Death, suicide and divorce.The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants has been labelled as a chick flick but it has more depth than that to be labelled as a teen fluff comedy/drama. I loved this movie and want to saw it with my friends who now want to start a Sisterhood. I am even going to see it again with my mum. If you have no reason to see this movie at least go and see it for the four rising talented actresses who give outstanding performances. Hilary and Lindsay eat your heart out there is four young women on your tails. Little Tip: Bring a box of tissues, because i guarantee YOU WILL cry.",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants

It is exactly like the book except really for Lena's story line and for a few exceptions but it was still very very good I swear that in the book where Bailey dies I got a little teary eyed but in the movie I mean actually seeing it happen really made me so sad I swear I was weeping actually crying my eyes out and in some other parts I laughed so hard I loved this book and the movie. It was really great. I highly recommend this book to viewers of all ages because it is really a fabulous film and as soon as the movie comes out on DVD I will be one of the first ones to get it.

121,lannparrish,My sisterhood life.,10,7 April 2006,"Well when the movie comes on it shows a background on their life and its really cool how they show everything back to when they were babies. then in the second book they describe them like cars. and of course their are big waves. then in the third book the summer before college they prepare themselves for the biggest summer of their lives. Well at the end of the book it describes them on the beach giving each other gifts, they didn't plan it that way it just sorta fell into place like when they found each other on the beach in the middle of the night. Well at the end of the book Tibby said this. The last one was a long shot, taken when we were seven it was taken at Rehobeth beach, about a mile from this very place.the camera showed the four of us holding hand in the rough surf, jumping waves, shouting and screaming.it was just like now exactly as we had done the afternoon before and early that morning.The image stayed on the screen and we all watched it even as it went still.Back then it was exactly the same as now. To brave the undertow we had learned to hold hands. Me and my three best friends are very close when I watch this movie and I see my friends I see them all like characters in the movie. My friend Rebecca like Tibby, My friend Bonnie like Lena, My friend Sam like Carmen, And me like Bridget.

Also, Tibby finds out that Bailey has leukemia before she goes to the hospital. Also, the girls are all 15 not 16. Like I said before it was very disappointing. One last thing, Bridget and her twin brother came first. Anyway the movie definitely includes some of the same parts as the book, such as Paul visiting his father, and them signing the Pants.

And in the movie he was American this really disappointed me. I have read all of the books and loved them!! I got my teachers hooked on them to! (my women teachers not the male ones!) I hope that they make another movie but add more people to it and make it like the second book that would be really cool!!All in all this movie was pretty great!!!!Me and my friend Michelle went to go see it together and we both thought that one of the parts were really sad!,The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants

When Lena (alexis bledel) is standing on the dock thing and its commentary from Lena to Carmen (America Ferrera)about how she really feels about Kostos it gives a sense of vulnerability from the actress about how she feels about this guy.The roles of each girl is amazingly close to the book in which this movie was based upon.it is an amazing movie i would insist on it being your next movie choice,The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants

Me and three of my best girlfriends are practically sisters and we all went and saw it together. Looking at us, you could see the resemblance between us and the characters on the screen. My friends Ashli(Carmen)the writer, Katie(Bridget) completely Wild and Unstobable not to mention very sporty, and Briana(Lena) Shy but gorgeous in every way. And of course me. Sarah(Tibby) the out there rebel girl with a video camera. When watching the movie we laugh and we cried. We literally sat there all holding hands in a chain. Seeing the Sisterhood, we formed our own. This summer I get my video camera and I'm going to start my own Suckumentary. Not to mention I have a job this summer... at Walmart.... (lol Walmans...) which I swear was a coincidence. Overall this movie was very good. It brings out what it really means to be best friends, to be sisters. Move out of the way Ya-ya sisters!

This movie provides, laughs, cries and much more depth then a lot of movies out there. It really is great for any age, but the older ones may understand some of the hidden plots. For anyone that says that this was a horrible book to movie remake because of the plot changes.... clearly they have never seen other book to movie remakes because almost all are changed! Even though the plot changes did leave the movie more interesting all the way through, the book provides a certain long term aspect which was carried out in the other 2 books. These changes possible have cut off the hope of another movie but hopefully the screenplay writers will be able to work around that.",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants
130,bohl01,A tale of true friends,8,11 July 2006,"Can miles truly separate us from friends?  Richard Bach The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants is a story about a four teenage girls who have been lifelong friends and never spent a day apart. That's all about to change as they head in different directions for the summer. Lena (played by Alexis Bledel) travels to Greece to visit her grandparents, Bridget (played by Blake Lively) will travel to Mexico for a soccer camp, Carmen (played by America Ferrera) will travel to South Carolina to visit her father, and Tibby (played by Amber Tamblyn) will stay behind to work at a local discount super store and work on her documentary.Unlike many films about teenagers such as American Pie, The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants shows teenage life in a different manner. This film does not trivialize the life of a teenager, but instead shows that there's more to the life of a teenager than parties, pizza, and pimples. There are many emotional challenges that people have to face throughout their lives. These challenges can be difficult to face alone, but The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants shows that we can face, overcome, and learn from these challenges with the love and support of friends.Before the friends depart on their adventures for the summer, they come across a pair of jeans in a local boutique that mysteriously fit all four girls' different body types and personalities. They come to the conclusion that these must be magical and decide to share them for the summer. The pants symbolize the love and connection that Bledel, Lively, Ferrera, and Tamblyn's characters share and that they will always be connected whether they are together or apart.Screenwriters Delia Ephron and Elizabeth Chandler have brought this story to life in this film and director Ken Kwapis expresses the symbolism of the pants through the dialogue between Bledel, Lively, Ferrera, and Tamblyn as well as the voice over by Ferrera. Most viewers (adolescent or adult) will be able to relate to at least one of these characters in the film and the timeless idea that we can get face anything with the help of our friends.",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants

Now don't get me wrong the movie was great and ya i know the movie wasn't going to be like the book cuz it would be to long. but ya know, you didn't have to totally change it. In the beginning they were suppose to be at Carmens cuz they were all getting ready to leave for the summer. and second when Carmen goes to he dads it is suppose to rain... and Lidia wasn't suppose to come out. they were suppose to walk up to the house and he dad was suppose to say something like honey we are home.. and then... Lenas grandparents are suppose to Love Kostos, not hate him. he was suppose to be like a grandson to them.... god... it made me so0o0o0o mad. but it was good. i watch it all the time.. but you totally ruined the whole point of the book.. it just bothered me thats all...

132,laughingjellybean,The movie for everyone.,10,21 August 2006,"First, if you haven't read these books, then I highly recommend them. But mostly, this movie is good to watch with just about any female friend you could possibly have. There is really something in this movie that touches and reaches everyone, no matter who they may be. For tomboys and outgoing wild children, there's Bridget, the athletic flirt. For shy, sensitive, starving artist-types, there's Lena. For angsty, bored ones, there's Tibby, and for the loving friend with a hateful temper, there's Carmen. The thing is, everybody learns a lesson. And though you're probably thinking, ""oh, lesson=kiddie movie,"" ""Sisterhood"" is far from it. Poighant, heart-wrenching, and deep, this movie will, true to its tag line, make you laugh, cry, and grab whoever's next to you for a big hug. In short, have some tissues ready and brace yourself for what has to be one of my top 15 favorite movies ever.",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants

I really enjoy this movie since I am a very romantic person and I love drama movies. This movie shows you how four girls learn to stand on their own. It showed us that your friends can't make every decision for you. You have to learn how to make your own decision and maybe some of them are not good but, you will learn from your mistakes. Because of the decision they made each one of them found them self and answer their own questions they about them self.One of my favorite things about this movie is the scenery of Greece. I fell in love with Greece I wish I could go. I love how they capture the beauty of the village it was magical. I also love how a father and her daughter got back the relationship they once had. I do recommend this movie however, the book it a little bit better because it tells you how things really happen. This movie it's great if you want to hang with your girlfriends.

I had never heard of this movie and I thought it would be OK at best but it was wonderful.I have chosen quite a few 'friendship' movies to watch with my niece and they often let me down with content that either isn't suitable or is too young, but this handled issues that she and I could relate to restfully. For example, who knows what exactly happened with Bridgette on the beach, I was happy that my niece supposed that they 'french kissed' and it was left as if this is all that may have happened.A beautiful movie well worth watching!",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants

Kostos is meant to be some sort of Greek god, Eric is meant to be a hispanic, also brian surprised me and don't get me wrong i love alexis bledel but lena's meant to be Greek with black straight hair and olive skin.Expect changes to the story of Lena and Kostos in Greece,but i loved Tibby and Bailey, Bridget's hair,America Ferrera as Carmen and lena's drawing. through the movie i had tears in my eyes,laughed, loved and got an urge to go running(thanks to bridget). so if your a huge fan of the books you have to be ready to expect changes from the sisterhood that you know and love, but if you are an old friend of the sisterhood or a new one you will still enjoy it, so go ahead and see the sisterhood in a new & different way!!!",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants
137,ninamvermillion,Some movies warm your heart and stir your soul,7,23 April 2007,"Some movies warm your heart and stir your soulAs I sat there all by myself, all I could think was that, yes, these girls dealt with typical teenage problems that our society understands, but this movie pushed all kinds of buttons for me emotionally and from the sound of the tears flowing like fountains, it did others as well. With the tag line being ""Laugh. Cry. Share the pants,"" this movie can be classified as ""chick-flick"" or a ""tear-jerker,"" and should be. Though dreaded by men, women tend to flock to them as some sort of distorted therapy. Everyone or at least women know the phrase ""a good cry helps sometimes,"" and cry I did. I had been told that this was an adapted screenplay from a book and so therefore I could not help my desire to analysis it. The teenagers are going through major changes in their lives and this pair of ""magical"" pants connects them and fosters a sense of security for each of the girls. Whether movies or novels people tend to bring ""baggage"" to the table and they tend to connect with the characters or issues of the story in some fashion. For me it was the ""I'm angry at my father arc."" My father passed away last year at this time and the father-daughter relationship in this movie reminded me very much of mine with my father. These overly emotional movies that trash your heart and rebuild it at the same time, can be contrived as my therapy because the mere fact that a writer has developed these concepts that I and many others can relate to means that someone somewhere has dealt with the same tribulations. Upon researching into ""emotional"" movies, I found that of course the intention of the creators of ""The Sisterhood of Traveling Pants"" could be to obtain an emotional connection with the audience because others have intended the same. Writer-director Todd Haynes once said in an interview about his movie ""Far from Heaven:""that his ""hope was that ultimately you wouldn't be watching the form anymore, but would find yourself entering it and engaging it and bringing it to life with your own memories of movies like it, your connection to the content of the film -- that combination of things we all bring to movie experience. We hoped that the form wouldn't stay materially present in your mind's eye but that it would come and it would go.""Overall, I believe what makes a movie memorable is the effect it has on you. People idolize movies for many different reasons but I also believe that everyone has to make a connection in some way to enjoy the film.",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants

Despite a few changes that always occur when a movie is adapted from a book, the movie follows the first book of the series extremely well. All four girls play excellent characters and depict Lena, Carmen, Bee, and Tibby extremely well. I loved the movie for the message that is portrays. Every girl or every person can find attributes in themself that is somewhat like one of the four girls. We see ourselves in them and thus get lost in the movie. We become a part of the film and find ourselves going through the same good and bad times. We laugh, cry, and celebrate along with them. Please give this movie a chance and go with an open heart. It will touch you, I promise! Plus, the scenery of the different settings are gorgeous.",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants
139,bluemidnight,Interesting adaptation,6,13 May 2005,"For starters, i have to admit that i'm 21 and really enjoy the books (all 3 of them). Because of that i was pretty excited to see the film, even though i know it couldn't live up to the book. Sadly, i was correct.The acting was actually quite good, as was the casting. The only character i didn't like the casting choice, regardless of the fact that she did a fine job, was Tibby. Tibby, in the book, is described as small, meek, and undeveloped. She didn't look/act that way, really.The stories themselves were decent. Carmen and Bridget's were almost dead on (minus the fact that they left out a vital scene in the end of Bridget's). Tibby's pretty accurate, but they left out a whole lot. Lena's was completely changed, which i didn't understand why they did.It's a teen chick flick so you expect insane cheesy moments. And the film is full of them. The soundtrack was horrible, in my opinion, making the film even more ridiculous at times. There were laugh out loud parts that probably shouldn't have been that funny.I think if you're a 12-15 year old girl, this movie is great for you (or if you like teen chick flicks). It covers the crucial topics addressed in the book, but lacks the depth Brashares originally had. I suggest seeing it just to see it, but don't expect too much.Also, if you're a guy, stay away. There were maximum 10 guys in the theatre when i saw it and each one looked 1/2 dead in the end.",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants

It reinforces the idea that everything will work out for every teenage girl, if only they can find a pair of jeans that makes their ass look good. I almost can't believe the materialistic nature and despicable social values portrayed in this movie. The producers, director, and entire cast should be publicly lynched and have their corpses used to fill in speed bumps. Furthermore, I am disgusted at the overwhelming popularity this movie has seen at the box office and since. I suppose over all, this is about the worst movie I can ever imagine being made, the biggest problem is that you can tell that people who like it and the people who made it, honestly believe this kind of garbage. This kind of movie is what drives young girls to become anorexic and cut themselves every time a new ""Teen People"" comes out. Shame.",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants

The great part of the film is that it can be enjoyed by people of all ages. When I saw it on May 3 the theater had people of every age group in it, and everyone seemed to love the movie.The actors in this movie make there roles come to life unlike most teen movies, that are full of dumb plot lines and are horrible to watch more that once or twice. Sisterhood is a movie that you will want to see over and over again.I never read the books, but from what i have heard, the movie is mostly based on the second book. I say that because Lena's grandparents hate Kostas in the movie and in the second book. The chemistry between Libby and Bailey is wonderful, and so sad. In my opinion all five girls deserve awards for acting a beautiful movie. Keep a look out for Lena riding the donkey in Santorini, it is the funnest thing on earth.I cant end this without talking about the locations of this film. They are great, every scene in Santorini is breath taking. and the beach in Mexico comes out nicely on the film.This is a great movie SO GO SEE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants
142,tatin17,My stomach just turned,2,13 March 2010,"I had the fortune of watching the movie at home, this movie is embarrassing. The script is simple and predictable. The acting was extremely poor I guess that these actors will have a great future in the TV's soup operas. Apart from that, it is extremely cheap to use the clichés and topics of a romance in Greece, the cancer girl, the dead mother, the divorced parents... and everything for one purpose: tears... I am sorry, the effect in me was the opposite, and I just wanted to sleep... I hope that the books are better because the movie is terribly bad...

143,jonnybe123,The ovaryfest,1,8 February 2011,"I watched this movie with my girlfriend who was forced to see it for a class. This terrible piece of film will make any overly sensitive, overly privileged, idiotic woman ovaries fill up with estrogen but anyone with real taste in movies will think its a joke. The movie follows four talentless women who are apparently friends but don't seem to be. This is because there character were simply not developed. This could have been because the movie was ripped from a book or it could have been because the story terrible. Who know.... Each girl represents some cliché stereotype of a young girl. You have the angsty teen girl, you have the minority, you have the prude and last but not least the slut. fascinating stuff. The movie revolves around how two of the girls story's end up with them meeting guys and falling ""in love"". The other one deals with an overly soppy story about the angsty teen starting care again because of a cancer girl. The final story that should have been far more developed was of the minority girls problems with her father. Overall you get a movie with four poorly written, predictable stories that are simply crammed into one movie. The stories should have been far more developed with the director expecting us to care about character we hardly know. Oh and the pants ... these magical pants that fit skinny and fat alike ... the WORST magical object in any movie I've EVER SEEN. I've got a magical shirt that fits anyone and changes colour .... well I've beat the pants already.STUPID MOVIE!

144,trtaylor,"Good, even if it wasn't true to the book",9,23 September 2005,"I admit it, I cried during the movie. I think a lot of people did. While the movie was not true to the book, it was a great movie. Cutting out Lena sister and Bridget's twin brother wasn't crucial to the plot, but having Lena's grandparents hate Kostos' family was crucial. In the book their grandparents are best friends and are constantly trying to throw them together, while Lena resists and gets thoughtful talks from her sister about Kostos. In the book Lena also is very sensitive about her body. In the movie she strips to her underwear to go swimming and doesn't mind Kostos seeing her. In the book she finds a secluded pond where she's drawing and decides to go skinny dipping and Kostos catches her, as it's his special spot. Lena goes nuts and if I remember rightly she won't tell her grandmother what's wrong when she shows up home upset and only says Kostos' name and that's what causes the riff between her grandparents and his. Another crucial part that was changed was Bridget's relationship with Eric, the coach. In the book she told her teammates about him and how she was going to go for it. When she came back the next morning they were asking all sorts of questions, most of which she didn't answer, but it was stated that she didn't have sex. The book didn't say what did happen, only she and Eric didn't go ""all the way."" I think that by having them have sex in the movie totally changed that part of the plot. So, I like the movie and would recommend it, but be warned if you read the book first...there are some MAJOR plot changes.",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants

Tibby was perfect, Carmen was perfect, Bee was perfect (until the end) and Bailey was perfect but they screwed up Lena's story completely. They mutilated it in fact. And whats with the happy ending??? I know its Hollywood and all but the ending needed to be sad. A summer like that can't have a happy ending fro anyone but Lena and that still needs to be partially sad. There is now absolutely no chance of them doing a sequel without having to rewrite half of the second book. I officially hate the person who wrote the screenplay for this movie.

Its about 4 best friends about to spend their first summer apart. They find a pair of pants that magically fit all of them even though they are all different sizes. To keep in touch, they pass the pants to each other to have for their adventures. Tibby (Tamblyn) gets left at home to work and make a documentary but ends up becoming friends with a young girl named Bailey(Jenna Boyd). Carmen (Ferrera) is going to South Carolina to visit her dad who has surprised her by introduce Carmen to his new finance. Bridget (Lively) is at a soccer camp in Mexico and falls in love with Eric (Mike Vogal, Grind) who is also off-limits because he's a coach. And finally, shy Lena (Blendel) is in Greece for the summer visiting relative and finds herself falling in love with Kostos (Michael Rady).I thought I would have enjoyed this movie more. Some of the parts were very well acted but others were not. In lots of parts I found myself bursting out laughing because the lines were so corny.The screenplay not only changed on of the big stories in the movie (Lena) but it also changed her personality. Also, I thought they could have done a better job casting, like I don't think Alexis Blendel was a good choice for Lena or the actor that played Kostos . I understand that they had to cut some people out of this movie but they cut out most of the Brian scenes and there was no Effie  which in the book is how they found the pants.I also felt it moved too fast and they didn't show enough of Bridget's story and almost too much of Lena's. In some cases, it would skip to a different girl stories when it had only been less than a minute on another's. It moved really fast and so I thought it was hard to see the character development.**1/2 stars out of 5.",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants

Luckily, it was completely worth it, but it certainly wasn't flawless and it could've been a much better film.When we enter the first scenes of the film, we see our heroes; Tibby, Lena, and Bridget, entering a thrift store and happening upon a pair of pants. I didn't really buy the whole 'picking up the pants for no reason whatsoever', and I thought the book's rendering was much, much better. But, anyway, after finding that these pants somehow, defying the laws of science and pant tailoring, fit the girls' bodies perfectly. And so, our story begins...I cannot express how much I loved Tibby and Carmen's story lines. Maybe it's because I can identify with the anger and conflict within and outside of the characters more so than Lena and Bridget... but, they acting was beautiful, and--it was just really, really great. Amber Tamblyn, who happens to be one of my favorite actresses, portrayed the broad range of Tibby's emotions during her experiences with Bailey (who I was a little concerned about--Jenna Boyd didn't exactly look how I pictured Bailey, but she did a fantastic job. I mean, the star and hospital scenes had almost everybody in the audience in tears, including myself). Carmen was also fantastically done by America Ferrera. I don't think anyone else could've done it.On the other hand, I got a little bored with the Lena and Bridget story lines. The acting was great, it was just that, for Lena's, it was almost completely altered from the book, and for Bridget's, she was a lot more of self-centered egomaniac than she was in the book, and the vulnerability didn't really expose itself until the end of the movie.What was great about this film in general was the character development so often overlooked in the chick flick department. Each of the girls comes out of the summer better than they were before; Tibby's less whiny, Lena comes out of her shell, Bridget comes to terms with her mother's suicide, and Carmen tells her father how she really feels and maybe even forgives him.This movie is really great, please, even if you hate the so-called evil, sappy genre of chick flicks, maybe you should give this great piece of work a chance.8/10 pairs of pants.",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants

And the courage that Lena had to confront her grandfather was a real inspiration and the message of the movie is pretty clear to most people so I definitely give it a 10/10. I also think that the fact that Carmen was honest with her father was very real. America Ferrara's performance was very intense and believable. Bridget and her outgoing and sometimes slutty self turns out to be this great person who has real depth.

You won't find those things here. Just a wholesome, uplifting story of 4 young woman during one long summer.It's the poignant story of 4 young woman who grew up next to each other and became lasting best friends. As teens they discover a pair of pants that seems to magically fit them all and decide to form a sisterhood around the pants and share the pants among each other. During the following summer they are separated from each other, but ship the pants to each other far and wide. But the pants become less of the main focus of the story and more of a metaphor for the hope and concern that they share for each other as the movie splits into four separate stories, weaving in and out of each girls experiences during that long summer of flowering female teen-hood.Get ready for lots of growing up humor, a smattering of teenage first experiences, a full helping of parent-teen angst and a couple of doses of very tearful awakenings. The soundtrack is very nice; not just a set of familiar pop tunes sprinkled here and there, but a very well done interweaving of very nicely chosen, very soulful songs that will have you looking at buying the soundtrack.",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants
158,lostindreams1001,Worth the price of admission!,10,5 June 2005,"As a fan of the books, I dragged my mom to see the Sisterhood with me (she read the first one, too). We had to go to a more expensive theater than usual, but it was worth it! At first I was a little upset, like most book fans, that it was a little different than the book. But as it went on, I became more accepting. When I wasn't crying (it's a bit of a tearjerker at moments) or drooling over Kostas and Eric, I was thinking about how similar my friends and I were to the girls, and how important having close friends is. After it ended, other than thinking ""I'm bringing my friends to see this!"", I was a little upset- the way they ended it left little room for them to make ""The Second Summer of the Sisterhood"". But, I was also happy- there's finally a teen girl movie that doesn't revolve around the dork getting the hot guy, or the beauty queen that feels ugly on the inside. It was truly a great movie, and well worth the money you spend on the ticket.",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants
159,whitney_eeckhout,Lena,10,30 August 2005,I especially love Alexis Bledel her part Lena; she goes to Greece. With the beautiful sights and becomes a whole new person. She gets to know a cute boy and even tough in the beginning her family doesn't approve of their relationship they still try to make it work. But I have a question does anyone know what it is that she says to herself before she jumps in the water and then Kostos arrived. I was really touched by it but I can't completely remember it.I also adore the fact that they put a girl in the film who doesn't have the perfect size. America Ferrera is a wonderful actress I was really touched by her part of the story.And of course now-one would want to have leukemia or know someone with leukemia.And for the part of Blake Lively I shouldn't say this because I myself am a girl but she 's really pretty and the way that she met Eric. I LOVED the fact that she was so confident of herself.What I do find a bit stupid is that 3 of them are aged around 21-24 and only Blake Lovely plays her own age. Although that's actually a compliment because the other three can still look 17. And I have to admit I thought Blake was a bit older like 19-20 or so.,The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants
160,Book_Worm92,I loved it!!!!!!!,9,4 June 2005,"I think the Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants movie was awesome. It was a bit different than the book, but that is to be expected. I am a total drama queen, so all of the emotional spots were great to me. I cried 4 times in that movie there, and laughed more times than I can count! I loved the romance, although it was scaled down much compared to what the books are. If they make the sequel anything like the book, it will definitely have to be PG-13! The movie actually shows real life type people. They all have tough times, but in the end, it's the love of friends that helps them through it. I know I could never make it without my friends, the exact ones who I went to see the movie with. It is a very down to earth and down to heart story.",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants
161,OotPfan89,The Sisterhood,10,11 June 2005,"My three friends and I went to see the movie on Friday, and we all LOVED IT! It's about four friends who are very different in body shape and size. Three of the girls, Carmen, Bridget, and Lina, are going on vacation. The 4th girl, Tibby, has to stay at home and work at a boring store called Wallman's. They're spending their last few days together shopping. They go into a second-hand store and try to stop Tibby from complaining about how bored she's going to be and how she's going to create her own film genre called a ""Suckumentary"". Bridget sees a pair of jeans on a table, picks them up, gives them to Tibby, and pushes her into the dressing room. Tibby comes out looking great. She takes them off and throws them to Lina. She tries them on and are amazed by what they see. Lina hardly wore pants, and they see that she actually ""has a body"". Lina gives them to Bridget, saying how it was weird that they could fit Tibby and herself. Bridget points out that the pants probably won't fit her because she's 3 inches taller and much more slim than Tibby and Lina. But the pants still fit her perfectly. They're convinced that the pants are magic, but they need to make sure they fit Carmen. Carmen is Puerto Rican, and inherited the large backside and body from her mother. Well, Carmen isn't convinced that they will fit her, but they do.My friends and I all laughed when Lina fell into the harbor, but then realizing The Pants were caught on wire, gasped as she struggled to free herself. We watched Bridget work to get Eric's attention by freeing The Hair every time she passed him. We cried when Carmen was yelling at her dad over the phone for getting a new family, after she had run away from their perfect blond world. We cried uncontrollably Tibby was with her new, but dieing, friend, Bailey.It's a great movie to see with your friends, and it makes you realize how close you are to them. And how much they mean to you. After the movie, my friends and I went shopping, and we walked in a line side-by-side, laughing, and treasuring the last 2 days we had together before we all go our own separate ways.",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants
162,lilee-flower,One of the best teen movies I've ever seen,9,5 June 2005,"This film was amazing. It's as true to the book as possible, without being five or six hours long (even though, as a fan of the books I am MORE than willing to sit through that). The relationships between the girls is amazing. They help each other when it's really needed. There was no back-stabbing, or cat-fighting (*cough* Mean Girls *cough*). It was about true, heart-felt friendship. I have to admit I cried a lot, I could relate to these girls, feel their pain. I think this is a sign of a great film. I don't usually cry during films. I've seen many teen films, being seventeen myself, and found most of them to be rentals. This one, however, is most definitely NOT a rental. I went on opening night, and have agreed to attend again with my friends. I thinks it's worth my eight dollars",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants

If you like movies that show the way true friendships work i recommend that you go see the sisterhood of the traveling pants. also this probably has to be one of the best drama/comedy movie I've seen in my 16 years of existence. not only is it deep, emotional, but some parts are really really funny.

Well, I have read the books - all of them - and there were some key moments in the first book (which is what this movie is based on) that were left out or changed very much from how they happened in the book. One of the biggest is how Lena met Kostos - she didn't fall in the water and almost drown, she went to a little grove to sketch and he found her there skinny dipping - and their relationship. Oh, and why the grandparents were mad at each other. Or how Bridget was depressed at camp, so Lena changed her flight to go to Mexico to be with her. And what happened to Lena and Bridget's siblings? Lena had a sister, and Bridget had a TWIN BROTHER, and neither of them is in this movie at all! I guess the movie isn't bad, it just is lacking some key moments that, had I made it, I would not have left out or changed.",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants

When we arrived at the theater I was briefed on which movie we were going to see, without a doubt thinking it would be some new action packed thriller that my dad, always forced my mom and sister to. I had no clue that we were going to see the Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants. The worst part of the movie was forcing myself into a theater where I was one of about 6 guys. The rest of the seats were packed with girls of all ages, older women, teens, mothers, college grads, you name it. One would have thought Brad Pitt was making announcement before the show began. In case you didn't know all girls are obsessed with him, especially the ones who deny it. Anyways the movie began and before I knew it my eyes were glued to the screen. Next thing I knew I was crying, my mom was crying, my sister was crying, and even my dad was crying. I looked around the room and noticed that every girl was sobbing, and of course you know when your watching an amazing movie when it causes such emotion. When it changes the way you feel and enlightens you in unbelievable ways.So the moral of the story: All the women out there grab your girlfriends, or better yet your husbands, boyfriends, or whomever and drag them to this film, they will say they'll hate it, but they will love it!",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants

They are all totally different mentally and physically. For the first summer in their lives they are going to be separated. So right before Lena goes to Greece, Carmen visits her dad, Bridget goes to Mexico, and Tibby stays home; they find a pair of jeans that fits all of them perfectly even though they are all different heights and sizes. This movie shows the girls go through their first summer away from each other. And by the end some of them might be hoping that they spent their summer together because of good and bad things that are wanted to be shared. An amazing story of four friends who grew in a summer away from each other, full of fun, adventure, and sadness. So it's like they say Laugh. Cry.

169,ylimesch,Great movie,8,24 May 2005,"I'm 15 and a big fan of the books. I just saw the movie at a special sneak preview. Now, I definitely went in with low expectations, because as far as I am concerned, a movie can never be as good as a book.Well in this case, I still believe that. However, I found this to be a truly well done movie. It just was not similar to the book in my opinion. Characters were left out or changed, and some of the plot was altered (although parts were dead on).This however, does not make the movie bad. I found myself laughing as well as tearing up throughout the movie. The actresses were amazingly talented, although not exactly how I pictured. What happened to Lena being the beautiful Greek? Bridget was dead on (although this was probably not hard) and Tibby was similar to my mind picture (although not quite as ""weak"" looking) Carmen was not quite how I imagined her although the actress's great acting made up for it.I definitely recommend it as a feel good movie, but I also suggest you don't go in hoping to see your mind's picture of the book played out on the big screen.",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants

There should be more movies out there like this, that show that no matter what, your friends truly matter.

172,Girlinthewild,"Poor Casting, Poor Adaptation",1,4 June 2005,"I have read all three of the Sisterhood books by Ann Brashares. I loved them all (she is a great writer). Therefore, I was excited about seeing the movie and I was really disappointed. The casting is mostly, in my opinion, poor. Lena (played by Alexis Bledel) is supposedly Greek but she is so pale and freckled. She doesn't look Greek at all. In the books, she also has green eyes (they are blue in the movie). Bridget (Blake Lively) had blondish-brown hair in the movie. In the books she had shocking banana-light hair. It was such a key part of her appearance, I was surprised that it was left out. Tibby (Amber Tamblyn) was tall and curvy. In the books she was small and frail (built stick-like). Carmen (America Ferrera) was a really great casting job, but she was the only one. The adaptation left out many characters. Lena's sister, Effie, and Bridget's twin brother, Perry, were mysteriously absent. I thought Effie was too important a character to be left out. The adaptation also twisted many of the story lines. In the book, Lena's grandparents attempt to set her up with a boy, Kostos. They adore Kostos and want him to be with Lena. In the movie, they despise Kostos and forbid Lena from seeing him. Bridget is a soccer star that falls for her coach, Eric, during soccer camp. In both the book and movie she loses her virginity to Eric. In the book, she suffers a lot after this and can't get over it (she dyes her hair, gains weight, and quits soccer). In the movie, she flops around for a little while and then sees Eric walking around her neighborhood. He says some tacky things, they hug, and it is all better. This movie was a poor adaptation. I recommend that you read the books (they are fantastic). This movie isn't worth seeing unless you have NOTHING else to do.",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants
173,specs_88,"Good, but with some major unnecessary plot-editing.",7,8 June 2005,"Warning: Contains spoilers.Let's begin with the Bad News, shall we? While Sisterhood was fresh and heartfelt, nothing could have prepared me for the atrocity that was Lena's Storyline. Bledel as Lena was shoddy and silly, not at all as she's meant to be, and Effie, Lena's main confidante in Greece, was completely erased. And while I understand that some characters have to be removed for running time, etc, that doesn't excuse the fact that the entire Lena/Kostos storyline was hacked into unrecognizability.I'm sure we all remember that part in the book where Lena almost drowns and Kostos saves her, right? Wait, what? And there's also that family feud between the Dounas' and the Kaligaris', of course. Hold up! Obviously, the producers wanted some more drama, a Romeo and Juliet angle, but for those of us wanting the films to stay true to the literature, this was sorely disappointing. Valia was a nut-ball, and not at all as sweet as she should be, plus there were three obnoxious and slutty cousins of Lena who were around to gossip consistently, perhaps as comic relief, but were truly annoying.Despite this chunk of disappointment, however, the other three girls were very enjoyable, Blake Lively as Bee, especially. Lively, although a newcomer, was fantastic. She channeled Bee perfectly, and was confident, sexy, and funny, but when it really counted, was very convincing when sad and fearful. She and Eric's chemistry was fabulous as well.The only issue I had with Bee's storyline was the random meeting between Eric and herself in Bethesda in the end of the film, thanks to the magic of the Pants. Bee was just too content with their agreement to be ""just friends"", even though (once again) the book says otherwise.The Tibby-Bailey dynamic was also very sweet, if not a little stiff at some points. Brian was almost nowhere to be found, oddly enough. Hopefully they'll make more room for him in the next film.America Ferrera was also luminous, funny, and angry. And she actually knew how to cry, despite her Greek counterpart. Al, her dad, was a little stiff, too. Actually, the entire step-family was under-represented, including Paul, whose bleach-blondness was unnatural and really took away from the character for me.All in all, though, Sisterhood was a sweet, sad, and real story that's definitely worth watching. Just watch out if your a lit-to-film-nit-picker like myself. :)",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants
174,swimmerfan1985,Movie review,8,1 June 2005,The movie was good although I wish they didn't change Lena plot so much. Some people are complaining that the guys aren't good looking but once you see the movie you will disagree!!! I really think that they screenwriters should kept a bit more things that had to do with Lena. Her and Kostos' families are fighting so they aren't supposed to be with each other. That was definitely not in the book. They also forgot about Tibby's hamster which to me sort of defined her. Other than that the movie was good and they kept with the book. I read the book a while ago but I do believe they changed Bridget's story the smallest bit. They actresses played very well. Each actress did put parts of herself in but it worked very well.,The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants

As I sat watching the movie I found myself relating to many of the the things said. The tag line for this movie could be no better in describing my feelings....I laughed, cried, and shared the story of the pants with many.

All of them learn from their summer experiences and a little part in each of them changes for the better.There are 4 story lines: Conservative Lena who spends the summer in Greece with her grandparents and finds herself discovering love and turning into a whole different person, spunky Carmen, who spends the summer with her father and his new family which she didn't know existed, blonde bombshell Bridget, who spends the summer in soccer camp and has her eye on one of the hot camp counselors, and angry/ rebellious Tibby, who stays home to work and befriends a little girl who teaches her a very important lesson about life. Before they separate for the summer, the girls buy a pair of pants which miraculously fits all 4 of them. They agree to each keep the pants for 1 week and then mail them to the next girl, and each time one of them receives the pants, magic happens.This movie will move you.

She obviously doesn't love her characters as much as JK Rowling or Rebecca (forgot her last name) Ya-Ya author. They made sure the essence of their story was not lost by Hollywood. Ann didn't do that. I felt tricked when I was sitting there watching this. If you loved these books beware you may not love the movie.

Since when does a pg film include a 16 year old girl sleeping with her 20 something year old soccer coach? There will be many young girls going to this film with their mothers & many mothers being blindsided by this part of the movie. Couldn't she have just had a crush on him, been rejected & been devastated? I think the rating board made a big mistake here. This would be a great film for young teenagers to see with their moms. A pg rating generally leads parents to believe that it's a safe film for children under 13 to see. Definitely not so in this case.

183,puddie7777,"Sappy, Sad, and Socially Barren",1,6 June 2005,"*May contain spoilers.* As I watched this movie, all I kept thinking was, ""Is this what our culture has come to?"" This movie is not an enjoyable experience, in the first place, and secondly, does not portray positive role models for young girls. The Sisterhood Of The Traveling Pants has some good points: four talented and pleasant young actresses, pretty scenery and fun visuals, and a great performance by Jenna Boyd--actually great performances by all the girls. However, for me, the good points don't even begin to outweigh the bad. This movie, most of all, is a painful experience. Geared toward young preteen girls, one would expect a light, fun movie, like the one depicted in the trailer. Instead, sorrow is approached from nearly every angle possible. Death, cancer, loss of virginity, divorce, suicide, and alienation are all tackled, brought to a boiling point, and then, cried over. Sure am glad I experienced all that! Such fun. Further, the resolutions to each of four story lines and the answers that the girls come up with are based on the sappy, 'feel good', consequence-ignoring, selfish, spiritually dead precepts of an emotional society. This movie intentionally draws the audience into a shallowly glittering story only to pull them under in a series of painful stories (3 of the 4 subplots). One of the subplots, involving a summer trip to Greece, tells the story of a first love. This part of the plot is generally pleasant (and a needed respite from the other tormenting scenes-- I found myself breathing a sigh of relief when the narrative returned to the scenes in Greece). However, even this story has our girl ignoring her grandparents' authority and sneaking off with a veritable stranger. Other scenes show a seventeen year old girl seducing a twenty-something camp coach, a girl lashing out in anger by throwing a rock at a window, and a young friend die of leukemia. This movie wants to be a carefree, fun time but ends up being much darker than suspected. I realize that some moviegoers enjoy a tear jerker, but I certainly don't...if you want to feel increasingly more unhappy while you sit in a movie that you paid for, this is the movie for you!",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants

I read the books and thought the movie flowed very easily. The movie was different, I have to say. I was disappointed in some parts, but overall I think they did a great job turning the books into the movie. It had the same effect on me as the books did and expressed the same thoughts and feelings. Each of the actresses were casted exactly as they were in the books and I thought they were awesome! It was wonderful! My mother loved the movie 20 minutes into it and had already said it was a buyer! I think that every girl will love this movie and should go see it. It the best! Go see it as soon as possible!",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants

It went along much with the book, but when I read the book, I would have never pictured any of them that way.And ya, there were girls from the age of 8 to 20 in my theater.BOTH TIMES! I saw it twice, because I liked it so much! Very good!I just wished that it would have gone more on like the book did, what the book was picturing. And if you're a guy -- This probably isn't the movie for you.

I could relate to each girl in a different way. from falling in love, to a fight, to being left behind. it was a movie that was life changing and just as good as the book. I'd recommend every person to go to this movie who wants to laugh, cry and just sit back and smile, and you can't forget about the very attractive boy in the movie...if you go to it i'm sure you'll know who i'm talking about right away, and if you have i'm sure you already know!! This is a movie you go to with a bunch of Girlfriends, and all cry, laugh and smile together...its a movie about change and everyone has been through change at some point in their lives, so its easy to understand and easy to relate to.

I read all three books, and cannot wait for the fourth one (which is being written now). Yes, they changed the story line for some characters a little, but that is understandable. The movie was funny at some points and sad at others. I would say it is more of a girls movie but it was amazing. I loved it and have seen it twice. I do not understand the former comment about the soundtrack, I thought it was great!! Fit perfect with the movie.

I think this movie is fantastic! its so well written, and the acting is inspirational. when i saw it in the theaters everyone else there was crying. thats how good a movie it is. it may look like just another chick flick, but its not! when you think about the tings that are said in the movie, its actually quite deep. its a movie that everyone can enjoy, if you just let them. your boyfriend to your best friend. the plot stays to the storyline of the books, but not enough to make it predictable. some people might complain about the differences between book and movie, but i didn't really seem to notice that much of a difference. Small things were left out because of time, and content. I think this movie is amazing! a definite must see this summer. so stop reading this review, and go out and watch it yourself. you be the judge. :)",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants

Though I was a little annoyed at the whole ""Romeo and Juliet"" rehash with Lena and Kostos.Blake Lively is introduced as a young fresh face with a lot of potential in the acting business. You also see America Ferrera, from Disney Channel's ""Gotta Kick it Up"", Alexis Bledel, from ""Tuck Everlasting"" and ""Gilmore Girls"", and Amber Tamblyn, from the TV show, ""Joan of Arcadia."" These girls are quite talented.One of the other reasons I was upset at this movie, was that they portrayed Bridget (Lively)as a not very deep, emotional person as in the books. Other than that, this movie left me with a fuzzy feeling inside. I recommend it for girls 10+.",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants
192,cj_2005,This movie lets you connect with each character on some level...amazing,10,20 June 2005,This movie was amazing even though it didn't go exactly like the book. I thought all the actors and actresses did great!! It really pulled you in during the emotional parts...i loved that!! :) I thought that the parts with Bridget and Eric were so cute. I liked all the romance with them and the mystery too. Mike Vogel played Eric very well with what he was give. I hope if they make the other movies that he is still going to be Eric like in the third book when he meet Bridget again. He is sooooo cute and a good actor!!! I liked Lena and Kostos in Greece. They make a cute couple and you see Lena grow into a woman more than a child. I thought it was really sad when Bailey died in the movie. I cried during that part. Carmen with her dad issues and how they turned out was good. I cant wait till the other movies come out on the other two books!!! This movie is my favorite!!!,The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants

I was not at all disappointed as we left the theater. This movie will leave everyone with something special and keep them delighted by four girls' different stories you'll never forget. This really brings together and shows a sisterly bond that friends share. I encourage you to check out this movie soon. It is a great delight!

194,rainbowbrite123,"I loved this movie. It was very realistic to teenage girl's lives. It dealt with death, love, suicide, and divorce. It was funny, heartfelt, sad, and had a terrific cast.",10,27 June 2005,"My favorite story of the 4 girls was Tibby and Bailey's. It was like Tibby was coming out of her shell of hatred and learning to love even the ones she didn't think she loved. The best part is when they're sitting outside admiring the stars. Tibby just found out about Bailey's leukemia. TIBBY: Are you scared? BAILEY: Of dying no. But I am scared of not having enough time to find out who I am and my place in the world.The thing I loved about Lena's story was Greece. It was so beautiful! And just the message of hiding your feelings I could really relate to. It was so sweet when Lena and Kostos are on his boat at night. It's like a Romeo and Juliet relationship.KOSTOS: Some girls like to show their beauty because they want the whole world to see it, but others hide their beauty because they want the world to see something else. LENA: Which do you see in me? KOSTOS: BothCarmen's was like a fish out of water thing. Her dad was marrying a family of skinny sunshine and she was kinda big and actually real. I don't remember any quotes, but the best part is when she's still a kid and she sees her dad leave and she's on the phone with either Tibby or Lena and she's telling her to stay on the phone until she falls asleep.Actually, I didn't like Briget's that much until the end. I liked how they brought back her mom's suicide and related it to the whole thing with her and the camp counselor. When she get's back home Carmen and Tibby are so nice to her. Briget admits that she only acts so happy all the time so people don't think she'll take the same fate as her mother. The sisterhood comforts her by telling her that the huge difference between her and her mom is that she has the sisterhood.Over all it was a great movie. It was really sad though!",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants
195,GwendolynMacDunn,Sadly disappointing,1,3 July 2005,Bledel did a good job but Tamblyn's acting left much to be desired. Tamblyn's arrogant and conceit detracts from any role she is in. Casting a less arrogant actress in the role of Tobby would have made this movie far better. Thankfully Bledel added some color to the bleakness displayed by Tamblyn.This movie is based on an excellent and heartwarming book but I found myself extremely disappointed by Tamblyn's performance. She's a young women who has let her fame go to her head. I certainly hope that if more movies are based on the books. better casting choices will be made.,The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants
196,sweetangel898299,Best teen chick flick ever!,10,6 July 2005,"This movie touched me very deeply. I went to see it at the theaters with my 2 best friends and we had a blast. I had all ready read the book and had been looking forward to seeing the movie ever since I first saw the trailer for it on-line. Even though I knew what was going to happen in the movie I still cried me eyes out. I started to cry I think half way through the movie. I just sat there between my friends with tears streaming down my face. I think my friends stated crying to around 3 quarters of the way through the movie. I became hysterical at the part with Bee feeling upset and depressed and at the part where Bailey died I cried so hard. This book and movie let's you feel the pain these girls carried but also let's you feel their strong friendship which is why this movie and book are so amazing! My friends and I have even decided which of the girls we are; I am Bridget, my friend J is Lena, my friend C is Tibby and my friend A is Carmen.

Then Lena, the hopeless romantic, too scared to fall in love. Next there is Bridget, the beautiful sports junkie who wont give up on the one thing she wants. Last but not least, there is Tibby the rebel who ends up finding that life is too precious to waste.

199,mrtw08,I thought the movie was okay.,6,15 August 2005,"The four main characters did not develop as well as they did in the book; all of their stories were drastically shortened & changed, so that I think it would be hard for someone who hasn't already read the books to really embrace & understand each girls' story. I know it would be hard to make the movie as good as the book, but I think they could have done a better job. I thought that Lena was casted terribly... Alexis Bledel does not look Greek in any way, and does not have the goddess-like beauty that Lena is described as having. She's pretty, just not in the way that Lena is supposed to be, in my opinion. Also, Carmen's mom doesn't look very Hispanic, and doesn't have any sort of Spanish accent. Bridget's love-interest is supposed to be part Hispanic too.. AND the character Effie was completely left out.In all though, it wasn't terrible, just not as good as it could've been & not nearly as good as the book.",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants

201,m_v03,Four best friends are away for the summer and have magical pants they trade around to keep in touch.,6,17 December 2005,"In The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants the magic pants were a symbol of how close all the four girls were with each other. All of their experiences and feelings will be remembered when seeing/wearing the pants. This is because their most memorable experiences happened when wearing the pants so they will always be remembered. Also because they all grew and matured from this experience so they have become better people. Therefore, they will always be connected with the pants and remember their love for each other and have those experiences to share.I chose The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants because I had recently read the book and I wanted to watch the movie and see what was the same and different. Also for my final semester project I am doing a comparison between the book and movie. So I figured I would kill two birds with one stone and view the movie for my MMR and notice the contrasts and differences between the book and movie. I viewed this film the 1st time on November 28, 2005 with my boyfriend and my oldest brother. We only got to chapter 16 and it started skipping and then it said ""Unable to read disc"". So we had to stop it and then on the 29th I went to Safeway and got a new copy. I then completed the film on the 29th in my living room with my mom. The pants were a symbol of how close the 4 friends were because they all are experiencing the magic and they are never washing them so their 'spirits' are still with them when it's the new persons turn. Also they are all going though life changing events that will help them grow as a person.The girls' most memorable experiences happened while wearing the pants, because of this they will never be forgotten. Most likely if it were just and ordinary summer and didn't have the pants to help them remember the events they could have been forgotten. Having the pants as a part of their adventures that particular summer made their experiences easier to remember. This is because they had to write down everything that happened to them while wearing the pants and then send it to the next girl. Writing down all of their fun while getting to have the pants made it interesting to see what happened to the previous friend. This can give you high spirits if something lucky happened to the other girl. Or even something bad or unlucky might happen, not every girl had the best time. Carmen wasn't happy with her Dad; but then Lena had a heavenly get a way with Kostos. All experiences were helpful in life weather they were enjoyable or not.While wearing the pants they experienced some life changing events, because of this they have grown and matured into better people. Tibby had the experience of a friend dying and not being able to understand why this happens to perfectly nice people. And it helps her to understand what's really important in her life and what are bigger problems than others. Both Lena and Bridget went through relationships and love but Bridget got hurt and Lena didn't. Bridget felt the pain of a bad relationship and wanted it so bad it moved faster than it should of and it ended up horrible. Lena fell in love with a perfectly nice boy but then was forbidden to see him because of a family feud. She never thought that this kind of experience would happen to her. Last, Carmen, she experienced getting a new family and learning to cope with it and feeling like she isn't loved anymore and is all-alone. Through all of the experiences they grew into better mature young adults. Even though some of the adventures the four best friends went through weren't the most enjoyable, they were still helpful in life.Therefore, they will always remember each other and all the adventures that happened with the pants. They will never be forgotten and their love for each other will go on forever, even in years to come.All the girls had different experiences with the pants but yet they were all closely together because of their strong friendship/sister bond to each other.",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants

I enjoyed the movie, and it even stuck to the storyline for most of it! But whats the point of making a movie that changes one of the biggest bits of the story??? It made me cry and it made me laugh, definitely a chick flick and there was only one guy in the cinema, (maybe he got the wrong screen...) It would have been much better if they had kept Kostos as the nice guy who Lena was supposed to like instead of the guy she wasn't allowed to like! The girls seemed to have a really good chemistry, like they did in the book which was nice, and Eric was a total hottie!! The acting was good and overall it was a happy and upbeat film.

I was very disappointed, because of the extreme amount of important plot events that were not included that will ruin the story of the second and third stories. Also, some of the events that were discussed in the book were poorly described in the movie, and did not cover nearly enough details. The importance of the missed events are extreme. For example, the movie did not mention Brian, which will have a HUGE effect on the quality of the second and third movies, if they have them.

It brought back old memories of us together and how she left so suddenly. I think everyone should see it because it's a movie about true love, friendship, strength, and in general, just standing up for what you believe in. I strongly recommend it.

Nevertheless, I tell you folks, it is a great movie to watch!

210,catyw,Four ordinary girls. One extraordinary pair of parents. One unforgettable summer.,8,11 December 2005,"I cannot tell you how excited I was to hear that one of my favorite books of all time was going to become movie. I wondered for weeks who they would be played by- would Bridget have the goddess-like hair she had in the books? And how would they pronounce the name 'Lena'? And as I stepped into the movie theater, my heart began to pound. Of course I had mentally prepared myself for a letdown- there were always books turned into movies that were horrid. But the Sisterhood was stunning. All four leading actresses were phenomenal- they all played their parts exceptionally. Sometimes actors and actresses will be in a movie, but you know them so well from somewhere else, it's hard to picture them in this roll. Not so with these ladies. Although I do watch Gilmore Girls, used to watch Joan of Arcadia, and has a brother who would loves Lords Of Dogtown, I never once thought of them in those pictures. The best supporting actor/actress? Jenna Boyd, a.k.a. Bailey, who had me laugh and cry. All in all, a fantastic, fun-loving film.",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants

We all loved it. I thought the casting could not have been more dead-on. I didn't mind the changes to Lena's storyline, as they were appropriate to the movie. The one thing I did miss was Lena's little sister, who was one of my favorite characters in the books; she's hilarious! I really wish they'd put her in the movie. I thought the actresses who played Bridget and Carmen were fantastic (if you liked America Ferrara, please watch ""Real Women Have Curves - also a great movie) I agree with the above comment that Tibby was not at all like the character in the book, but again, I think it works for the movie.

212,geebster08,Follows the book pretty well...,8,6 December 2005,"Before the movie came out, I'd read the books a few times each. Basically, they're just really great. If you haven't read them, stop reading this, and do so right now. Of course, I was thrilled when I heard there was going to be a movie, and when it came out, a few of my girl friends and I went to see it...and then I went to see it with my mom, and then I went to see it with my friends again. Yeah, I saw it in the theater three times, because it was just that good.I was only disappointed about two things. 1) Lena's part of the story - In the book, Lena's whole family goes to Greece and her grandparents are trying to set her up with the boy, Kostos. In the movie, Lena goes alone, and her grandparents hate Kostos. I can see why it needed to be changed for the movie, though. It would probably be kind of complicated to film it the way the story in the book goes. 2)The pants - The pants didn't have as big of a role as I thought they would. They seemed to just be a simple addition to the movie to make it a little different. In the book, they played a bigger part.But, despite those two things. This movie stayed true to the book. Something I especially liked, about the book and the movie, was the difference between it, and other chick-flicks/lit. Most stories about girls are all drama. This story has real problems that real teens go through, besides boy-related issues.Great movie! If you haven't seen it, you should go watch it. Now.",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants

And it makes us to think about things we've done and we would like to be done!! I loved that the events were played in different places and through these places they showed us the personalities of these young girls who changed a lot during this summer.

I have to say Bridget is my favorite character. she is awesome. I kind of feel like were a like. I love the books. Though they changed Lena so much. I was shocked. I think they should make all three movies because there just such good book. The song unwritten which they play in the movie is awesome so check it out. This movie was the BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I wonder if the will make the other two movies? They have to i think we can all agree that if they wont it will suck. The movie isn't really i guy movie. SO guys don't bother going. Go only if you like though kind of movies which i doubt most guys so. hahahah. I hope you guys really liked the movie like i did.

I really love this movie because it is ultimately about friendship and how it can withstand what ever gets thrown at it. Make sure you have a tissue ready when watching it! I think that all four actresses did an excellent job at their characters. In the end the Traveling Pants aren't actually the main thing in the movie and book, it is more about how they made the four girls communicate through out the summer. I really liked that they braught one new actress into the movie (Blake Lively). She is an amazing actress and I see her becoming very famous someday. My favourite character is Bridget. She is wild and strong, but on the inside she just wants someone to love her. I think that Alexas Bladel (Gilmore Girls) did an amazing job playing Lena. She was exactly how I pictured her in the book. It is definitely a must see movie for any teenage girl!",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants
217,sagar1681,Good Acting,8,3 March 2006,"All people acted very very good. Wondering if they came out of an acting school or may be director Kwen Kapis was good. Every second of focus on anyone's faces (the 4 girls) showed their emotions at the time. Carmen's father's second family was shown to be very forgiving. No matter how she behaved her step mother forgave her and welcomed her to the altar. Even Blake Lively did a good job acting. Greece was depicted correctly. Not too much, not too less. Just about appropriate. Viewer gets a quick hang of it. Music was very good. Good compilation of songs. Timely and necessary.Only cons, some parts of the movie were cut. Sometimes you had to ""think"" to make sense out of the movie.",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants
218,breakingfree16,Touching and has heart,9,27 March 2006,"This movie is so strong and touching that anyone would love especially young women.This movie doesn't focus on sex, drugs, and rock-n- roll but something real and deep... a powerful friendship. Today it is rare to find a movie that doesn't only focus on a friendship or sisterhood but also focuses on real issues girls are going through. I had a sleepover with my 2 best friends for my 16th birthday and we watched this together and cried and laughed together. After seeing this movie my friends and I have been closer and more understanding of each other. This movie has heart and teaches girls that's it's OK to be flawed. This movie is one that has broken through the stereotypical ways that movies have in them now a days. I loved how this movie didn't force you to pay attention or learn about the consequence of this or that action. This has got to be one of the best, newest movies about friendship and love and how the sisterhood is so much more than just about pants.",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants
219,callytuzyk,Intelligent female-driven film,8,8 February 2019,"Sisterhood is a prime example of a film that contained two themes that were, especially fifteen years ago, immensely lacking in mainstream Hollywood: intimacy and strength of female friendships and the vital importance self-love (remember: rule #10 of the pants was ""Love your sisters and love yourself."") I think we forget that having four female protagonists in a mainstream production was less common than one might think, and the journeys of the each of the sisterhood contain coming-of-age moments and moments of self-discovery. As a fan of the books, I can state with certainty that the characters written by Ann Brashares are much more fleshed out and complex (as several plotlines are twisted up slightly), but also, fitting in this kind of character development and introspection for all four girls in a film under two hours in length is decidedly much more difficult. The film might be simple and unambitious, but it is always genuine and touching, and does not try to manipulate the audience or (as many films are prone to doing) sexualize the female characters. It touched on very serious topics other than just romance, which was a good change for women who want some diversity in their viewing experience. It may not be particularly ground breaking, but it is an exemplary film in terms of portraying a more realistic teenage female experience.",The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants
