0,Leofwine_draca,Bonafide '80s classic,7,10 March 2015,"Having never watched WARGAMES, I feared that it would be one of those bloated, overrated, downright silly '80s movies, hardly deserving of its classic status. Well, it isn't. In fact, it turns out to be a great film, one that remains endlessly enjoyable despite the leaps and bounds that computer technology has made since this movie came out.Matthew Broderick stars as the likable lead, a teenage computer genius who accidentally hacks into a NORAD computer and all but brings about nuclear war. Yes, this is a film in that '80s 'nuke' cycle, and it's one that brings the palm-sweating seriousness of the situation to life, while at the same time providing plenty of entertainment value along the way. Watching the narrative unfold is a delight, and it's one of those rare beasts that manages to keep the momentum going right up until the closing credits. Great fun indeed.",WarGames
1,SnoopyStyle,Granddaddy of computer hacking,8,17 November 2013,"Young computer hacker David (Matthew Broderick) accesses a top secret supercomputer which controls US nuclear missiles. He sets out to play a game only to discover that it actually set in motion thermal nuclear war. He and new girlfriend Jennifer (Ally Sheedy) must stop the march to nuclear warfare.This is the granddaddy of computer hacking movies. For such an early computer movie, it's relatively reasonable. However the escape from NORAD detention seems way too easy. That and other simplifications could be overlooked. This remains the best of early computer hacking movies.Broderick and Sheedy have an easy chemistry. They work well together as a teen couple. They were tops of the teen brat pack. Then they put a couple of veteran actors Dabney Coleman and Barry Corbin to anchor the other side. With the good acting and the realistic hacking, it is not only groundbreaking but a really fun watch.",WarGames
2,claudio_carvalho,The Only Winning Move Is not to Play,8,29 January 2012,"In Seattle, the teenager David (Matthew Broderick) is a lazy but bright student that prefers to hack and change his grades in the high-school computer than study. One day, David's best friend Jennifer (Ally Sheedy) is with him and he decides to hack the toy company Protovision seeking new games and he accidentally connects the War Operation Plan Response system in a computer located at the North American Aerospace (NORAD) at Birmingham using the password Joshua that was the name of the son of its creator, the deceased scientist Stephen Falken (John Wood). David challenges the computer to play a Global Thermonuclear War game between USA and the Soviet Union. Sooner he realizes that the computer is playing for real and the United States of America is changing its condition to DEFCON 1 in a game with no winners. ""Wargames"" is one of my favorite films of the 80's and despite the Cold War, it is nostalgic to watch again a period with little violence in the world and how life was easier, flying in a plane is just as one good example that we can see in this film. Hollywood still was able to make good movies based on great original stories. Matthew Broderick was an amazing promising actor with ""Ladyhawke"" and ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" and the hacker David is ahead of time. Ally Sheedy shows her charm, lovely smile and a great chemistry with Broderick. ""Wargame"" has a witty and funny story with a magnificent message in times of Cold War that is highlighted in the very end: ""The Only Winning Move (in a nuclear war) Is not to Play"". Fortunately most of the Powers that Be of the world has finally understood this message with the end of the Cold War. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Jogos de Guerra"" (""War Games"")",WarGames
3,nogodnomasters,HOW ABOUT A GAME OF CHESS?,10,25 June 2019,"This is a pop culture classic film. It's aim was to demonstrate there are no winners in a global thermal nuclear war during the Reagan years when everyone was sure he was going to launch missiles. The final scene has become a motion picture classic as Matthew Broderick saves the planet. The scene often appears in movie parodies, or references are made to it.This production is also credited with coining the phrase ""firewall."" Nominated for 3 Oscars, you can't help but marvel at how young Ally Sheedy looks. It is one of those films that when it comes on TV, I am drawn back into watching it again just to catch the ending. The film is an amazing entertaining thriller that has stood the test of time...at least a few decades.",WarGames
4,lee_eisenberg,"Not quite ""Dr. Strangelove"", but still...",8,10 August 2005,"In the early '80s, the possibility of a nuclear holocaust was in full swing once again, so it makes sense that they had to make a movie about it. David Lightman (Matthew Broderick) is a Seattle high school student who prefers playing computer games to doing his homework. Then, one day he accidentally hacks into a government program that lets him pretend to be the Soviet Union launching an attack. As you might imagine, once the US government finds the ""USSR"" hacking into their system, they think that it's a real attack. It's now up to David to set everything straight.""WarGames"" is no masterpiece the way ""Dr. Strangelove"" was, but it's still really good. If nothing else, it reminds us of the insanity of war. And it's also got the most unusual cast: aside from Matthew Broderick, there's also Dabney (""9 to 5"") Coleman, Ally (""The Breakfast Club"") Sheedy, and Eddie (""I Wanna Hold Your Hand"") Deezen. Well...",WarGames
5,jboothmillard,WarGames,7,31 December 2008,"In only his second film role, and before his rise to stardom with Ferris Bueller's Day Off, young Matthew Broderick starred in this tense thriller from director John Badham (Saturday Night Fever). Basically computer whizz, video game fan and hacker David Lightman (Broderick) is on the lookout for the coolest, and after connecting every phone number in his area to his computer, he comes across what seems to be a new games system. What he has actually come across is a top secret super-computer at the Pentagon, and what he believes is a fictional war between America and Russia, called ""Global Thermonuclear War"", could actually be real, and the countdown to World War III has started. Soon the authorities catch up to his activities, which he did find out he is responsible for, and they are convinced he wants to destroy the world with the War Operations Plan Response (W.O.P.R.) software. David is trying to do everything he can think of to both stay away from the authorities, or cancel the game, along with girlfriend Jennifer Mack (The Breakfast Club's Ally Sheedy) and eventually the software's creator Professor Falken (John Wood). In the end, David is back at the Pentagon, and John McKittrick (Dabney Coleman) does let him try to confuse the computer, and thank goodness, the missiles turn out to be just screen explosions, and the world is safe. Also starring Barry Corbin as General Jack Beringer, Juanin Clay as Pat Healy, Dennis Lipscomb as Lyle Watson, Kent Williams as Arthur Cabot, Joe Dorsey as Colonel Joe Conley, Irving Metzman as Paul Richter, Michael Ensign as Beringer's Aide, William Bogert as Mr. Lightman, Susan Davis as Mrs. Lightman, James Tolkan as FBI Agent Nigan and Dexter's Laboratory's Eddie Deezen as Malvin. Broderick is a great young lead, there are some good tense moments, e.g. escaping the Pentagon, even with dated looking technology on screen, it is a great edge-of-seat thriller film. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Cinematography, Best Sound and Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, and it won the BAFTA for Best Sound, and it was nominated for Best Production Design/Art Direction and Best Special Visual Effects. Very good!",WarGames
6,Woodyanders,Smartly done thriller,8,5 July 2018,"Crafty and resourceful teenage computer whiz David (a fine and likeable performance by Matthew Broderick) hacks into a top secret government super computer that has complete control of America's nuclear arsenal. David inadvertently sets in motion a series of escalating events that could possibly trigger a third world war. Director John Badham keeps the ingenious and absorbing story zipping along at a brisk pace, maintains a generally serious tone throughout, and adroitly builds a tremendous amount of nerve-rattling tension. The clever script by Lawrence Lasker and Walter F. Parkes not only makes a valid and provocative point on how a nuclear war is an unwinnable proposition, but also delivers an equally sharp and incisive commentary on the potential perils inherent in mankind's foolhardy desire to abdicate certain heavy responsibilities to machines under the frail hope that they will handle them better than we can. Ally Sheedy provides sturdy support as David's sweet girlfriend Jennifer. Moreover, this film further benefits from a terrific cast of top character actors: Dabney Coleman as arrogant jerk McKittrick, John Wood as bitter recluse creator Falken, Barry Corbin as the excitable General Berringer, Dennis Lipscomb as the starchy Watson, James Tolkan as hardnosed fed Wigen, and Michael Ensign as Berringer's dutiful aide. Juanin Clay also makes a favorable impression as McKittrick's feisty assistant Pat Healy while Eddie Deezen and Maury Chaykin have funny bits as a pair of wildly contrasting computer geeks. Arthur B. Rubinstein's spirited score hits the stirring spot. William A. Fraker's slick cinematography gives this picture a pleasing polished look. An excellent nail-biter.",WarGames
7,rmax304823,Toys Can Be Hazardous To Children.,6,4 July 2010,"Enjoyable thriller about a whiz kid (Broderick) who hacks into a NORAD computer thinking it's a game site and almost starts World War III by accident.It's a non-computer-user friendly movie. The time is, after all, the early 80s when home PCs were expensive, uncommon, and crude. Yet the writers are faced with telling us the story of a nerd who knows his way around the worldwide web, the phone company, the inner workings of various technological devices like door locks, and all manner of other stuff liable to be confusing to the audience.They solve this problem by having Broderick meet another teenager, Sheedy, and explain it all to her, one detail at a time. He tells her only as much as the audience needs to know. By the end, when things have gotten completely out of hand and the President of the United States is tearing his hair out and General Barry Corbin orders, ""Bring her up to Defcon One,"" and the obliteration of all living things seems impossible to stop, the script moves into science fiction. There are multiple ""big boards"" allowing for dazzling electronic displays of radar images, MIRV trajectories, nuclear detonations, and fountains of sparks. Here we are, almost thirty years later, and I still don't get the logic behind the shutting down of the monster machine called Joshua. Apparently it blows a fuse. The north wall of my house does that sometimes when I use the electric heater.Mathew Broderick is a great high schooler, as he was a great college student later, in ""The Freshman."" He has a pathetically handsome, neotenic face that bespeaks innocence, and a voice that fits his features. He seems always to be on the verge of imploring, of begging somebody for something, often forgiveness. Ally Sheedy is cute but she's just along to provide a proxy for the audience. Barry Corbin as the general isn't good at projecting anxiety but he's fine when he phlegmatically goes about the business of destroying the earth. John Wood is okay as the disillusioned scientist behind the madness.The writer have hyped everything up so that the kids won't be too bored. (Here's how you can change your grade in high-school biology!) And you get two climaxes for the price of one. In the nick of time it's discovered by the military that all the Soviet missiles are tricks of the computer, so we don't launch the missiles we had prepared. Everyone celebrates. But then it's discovered that the launch order has been locked into the computer and can't be countermanded. The computer is searching frantically for the launch codes. Everyone is running around screaming. A woman's voice is counting down the seconds until launch -- ""Launch minus ten...minus nine..."" Finally, in a scene that is so quickly propelled that it left me in the dust, the computer is simultaneously given an order to play tic tac toe. Everybody gets to celebrate all over again.The computer has the final tag line. ""It is a strange game, professor. No one wins."" The computer is talking about war, and it is either trying to kid us or we're all pretty stupid.",WarGames
8,Tweekums,Dr. Strangelove for '80s teens,7,31 December 2012,"As the film opens we see two men turning for duty at a US missile silo; shortly afterwards the order comes through telling them to launch their missiles at the Soviet Union... one of them refuses to turn his key. It was just a drill to test how many of the operatives would actually go through with such an order. As a significant number refused it is decided that the men should be replaced by a computerised system... nothing can go wrong with that!We then cut to a school in Seattle where students David Lightman and Jennifer Mack have just failed a history exam; David doesn't see the problem though; he just connects to the school computer and changes their grades. Having established his computer prowess we see him trying to hack into a games software company's system; he thinks he has found the site but he has unwittingly found the computer that runs war simulations for the US Air Force. Once in he decides to play a game of 'Global Thermonuclear War' not realising that the computer will act as if a real attack was underway. Not surprisingly he is arrested and is taken to NORAD headquarters where he learns that the program is still running; if all out nuclear war is to be averted he will have to escape and, along with Jennifer, find the computer's creator before time runs out.When I first watched this as a teen in the 1980s it was fairly exciting and seemed very modern with the way he had a computer at home and could connect to others over the telephone... now that aspect of the film seems very dated. The story itself is enjoyable though largely because Matthew Broderick and Ally Sheedy are likable leads as David and Jennifer. It is clear that this was aimed at a teen audience as we see the adults behave as idiots while the problem is solved by the youngsters. The idea of an 'unauthorised' nuclear war has been done before; most notably in 'Dr, Strangelove' although this isn't played for laughs like that film nor strangely enough is it anywhere near as bleak. I'm not sure that this would appeal to modern teens as it is dated and the Soviet threat has long gone; however if you were a teen in the eighties it is nostalgic fun.",WarGames
9,ma-cortes,A young computer whizz kid accidentally taps into a top secret super-computer and nearly starts WW3,7,26 July 2013,"A rogue young man named David (Matthew Broderick) along with his best friend Jennifer (Ally Sheedy) hack into their high school's computer to change his grade and later on , find a back door into a military central computer in which reality is confused with game-playing, possibly starting World War III . As the United State's Department of Homeland Security is led to believe an American teen hacker playing a terrorist-attack simulator game online is a real terrorist out to destroy the U.S . The system is called the War Operation Plan Response, or WOPR for short, developed by brilliant but now deceased scientist Stephen Falken (John Wood), who programmed the system to learn continually through game simulations . At the end , a message : The only winning move is not to play.This is an entertaining film of the 80s ; it was way ahead of its time and it stills grips the spectator . A popular flick in which a young computer whiz hooks into a game manufacturer's computer and accidentally starts WWII when he decides to play a selection titled ¨Global Thermonuclear Warfare¨ . The picture contains almost no violence , nor murders or any other sensationalistic content . Interesting as well as amusing screenplay by writers Lawrence Lasker and Walter F. Parkes who during their extensive research for the film, made friends with many 'hackers' and security experts. They later wrote ¨Sneakers¨ another film featuring 'hackers' and security experts. Likable starring couple , Matthew Broderick and Ally Sheedy , both of whom hold a great chemistry . Large support cast such as Barry Corbin , Dabney Coleman , Dennis Lipscomb and many of them uncredited as Michael Madsen , Eddie Deezen , James Tolkan , ArtLeFleur , William H. Macy , Maury Chaykin and John Spencer . Special mention to John Wood as Professor Stephen Falken ; main inspiration for this character was Cambridge Professor Stephen Hawking ; he was originally approached to appear in the movie, but he declined because he didn't want the producers exploiting his disability . Adequate musical score accompanying the action by Arthur B. Rubinstein and inventively photographed by classic cameraman William A Fraker . The film was part of a 1980s cycle of films about atomic bombs and nuclear warfare which had started in 1979 with ¨The China syndrome¨. The films included ¨Silkwood¨, ¨Testament¨, ¨Threads¨, ¨The day after¨ , ¨The Atomic Cafe¨, ¨Ground zero¨,¨Special Bulletin¨ , ¨Barefoot Gen¨, ¨Rules of Engagement¨, ¨Letters from a Dead Man¨ , ¨The chain reaction¨, among others . Followed by an inferior remake titled ¨ WarGames: The Dead Code (2008)¨ by Stuart Gillard with Matt Lanter as Will Farmer , Amanda Walsh as Annie D'Mateo , Colm Feore as Joshua and Chuck Shamata as Bill Carter .The motion picture was professionally directed by John Badham , though the original director was Martin Brest, and several of the scenes he shot are still in the movie , but he was fired as filmmaker a short while into production due to creative differences . Badham's breakthrough credit was the box office smash Fever Saturday night (1977) ; other hits on his resume include The Blue Thunder (1983), War games (1983), and Shortcircuit (1986). He's a nice director who achieved his greatest success in the 80s and 90s . He directed several hits (Drop zone , Nick of time , Skateout ,Point of No Return , Bird on a wire) , though today making TV movies (Jack Bull , Floating away) and television episodes (Crossing Jordan, Psych, Las Vegas, Standoff , Heroes).",WarGames
10,moonspinner55,Frisky performances help disguise the fact it is already clunky and outmoded...,5,5 April 2008,"Movies made for the here-and-now (instead of for all-time) date far worse than the average film, and movies dealing with modern-day technology are apt to look junk heap-worthy in just a few short years. The Tracy & Hepburn comedy ""Desk Set"" is one such example (where a know-it-all computer was brought in to an information office, taking up half the room). The scenario of ""WarGames"" centers on a boy's home computer, decked out with dashboard graphics, a black background, and a blinking cursor. It also has a stubborn agenda of its own, but this no ""2001"". There's a fresh angle to the screenplay: a goof-off high schooler (Matthew Broderick) manages to tap the Pentagon's computer system while playing a world-annihilation game from his bedroom, nearly causing World War III. He and his girlfriend (Ally Sheedy) have a devil-may-care relationship which makes the first-half of the picture breezy and appealing (and his semi-clueless parents are fun, too). But eventually, they--and we--have to be taught a lesson about the evils inherent in the misuse of technology, and the film comes to a virtual stand-still as a professor soap-boxes to the audience about such depressing matters as the end of civilization as we know it. Barry Corbin's salty U.S. General puts that into more succinct, layman's terms when he says, ""I'd p*ss on a sparkplug if I thought it'd do any good."" ** from ****",WarGames
11,BandSAboutMovies,Fun,6,17 April 2021,"Let me tell you, eleven-year-old me thought WarGames was awesome.Written by future Sneakers co-writers Lawrence Lasker and Walter F. Parkes and directed by John Badham*, who would gift us with the ancient future movies Blue Thunder and Short Circuit, is about a young hacker (Matthew Broderick) who unwittingly logs on to a server that allows him to simulate wargames with a computer called WOPR that really thinks that it's time to start a nuclear war.For many, WarGames was their first mainstream exposure** to hacking and formed the idea that one lone kid in his bedroom could take over so many major computer systems. That may be fantasy, but the real dream here is that someone that's on his computers for weeks at a time without leaving his bedroom could score Ally Sheedy.Shout out to Dabney Coleman in this, who continually raised the bar when it came to playing, well, Dabney Coleman roles in a variety of 80's films. He's one of the first actors I remember consciously thinking, ""This is that guy."" Between 9 to 5, Cloak and Dagger and Tootsie, he's always dependable.The tunnel to NORAD in this movie may seem familiar. That's because it shows up at the end of Back to the Future Part II and is the entrance to Toontown in Who Framed Roger Rabbit?The funniest thing to me is that they made a music video for a Crosby, Stills and Nash song made for the movie but edited out. That's what kids in 1983 wanted to see, right?*Martin Brest was the original director for all of 12 days. His next three films - Beverly Hills Cop, Midnight Run and Scent of a Woman - probably erased the pain of this movie. Then he got stuck making Meet Joe Black and Gigli.**It's the reason for the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1984. Representative Dan Glickman opened the legislation by saying, ""We are gonna show about four minutes from the movie WarGames, which outlines the problem fairly clearly."" The ensuing House committee report claimed WarGames showed a realistic representation of the automatic dialing and access capabilities of the personal computer.""",WarGames

13,hitchcockthelegend,Wanna play Global Thermonuclear War?,7,4 March 2008,"It was with much interest to me to revisit this early 80s hacker piece armed with the knowledge of just how the advent of change in the computer world had evolved. With that in mind the film could quite easily be classed as a bit clunky due to the now almost Neanderthal toys, games and computers used in the movie, but casting aside the nostalgia feelings I had with it, it still hits the spot as both a poignant piece of interest, and a damn good thriller as well.Matthew Broderick is David Lightman, a young computer gamer geek who is something of a whizz kid on the PC. He can change his school grades and hack into various sites he shouldn't be even looking at. During one eventful sitting he hacks into a computer called Joshua and plays a game called Global Thermonuclear War, he harmlessly chooses to be The Soviet Union and proceeds to launch a nuclear attack on his own country, the U.S.A. Trouble is, is that the game is for real and the wheels are in motion for World War III!.It helps to remember the time this film was made (for those old enough of course), for it was the time of the ever worrying cloud of the Cold War, a time when nuclear war was more than a hearsay threat. I really think that in this day and age where computers literally do run our lives, this film stands up really well not only as a warning piece about messing with technology, but also as a gentle poke in the ribs about defence systems and the people we trust to run them. Though the film is a kind of watered down and accessible 2001: A Space Odyssey for the 80s set, it impacts well and only really suffers from a pointless romantic plot strand involving the sprightly Ally Sheedy (could they not just have been pals?) and the aforementioned dated gadgets. The ending to the film is excellent as the tension builds up nicely and we are left chewing our nails watching a game of Tic-Tac-Toe, sounds simple doesn't it? Not so.Good honest and intelligent entertainment. 7.5/10",WarGames
14,Theo Robertson,Great Premise . Not A Great Movie,5,3 October 2004,"Remember the mid 1980s ? This was the era of hair , shoulder pads and rather crap music which a lot of people are still trying to forget . What everyone seems to have forgotten is the nuclear paranoia of the time , how can anyone forget 99 Red Balloon's by Nina I ask you ? . This was the era of THE DAY AFTER , TESTAMENT , THREADS and WHEN THE WIND BLOWS where thermo-nuclear war was just around the corner . WAR GAMES predates these unbearable nuclear dramas and shockingly WAR GAMES is the only one that can still be classed as being topical since the central plot revolves around a computer hacker who can gain access to the Pentagon's nuclear codes , a plot that is based in reality even today Scary huh ? Unfortunately after getting off to a good start where the audience think the balloon has gone up big time the movie fails to make the most of the premise as we're shown young hacker David Lightman being given a stern talking to by Pentagon staff that he's been a very naughty boy in almost starting WW3 and he's going to get into trouble . It's not all that exciting and I can't help feeling that the rather poor development is done on purpose . Remember what the artistic zenith of James Cameron career was ? The scene in THE TERMINATOR where Kyle walks along a nuclear shelter in a post apocalypse world where children stare at burning TV screens and people scavenge for rats as a food source , a brilliant haunting sequence but a very distressing one , so I guess that a movie made in 1983 for a family audience didn't really want to hammer the point home that if war did break out then the survivors would envy the dead . That said the film is decidedly unthrilling and has all the production values of a TVM . It could have been worse though because if it was made in 1985 brat pack stars Matthew Broderick and Ally Sheedy would have been compelled to take part in a groovy song and dance number",WarGames
15,preppy-3,Badly dated--and totally unbelievable,3,10 October 2003,"A computer geek, teenager David Lightman (Matthew Broderick) inadverdantly breaks into a ""secure"" government database and almost starts WWIII!
Matthew Broderick is SO young in this movie--it's almost incredible to see him.  Unfortunately his acting isn't that good--he seems ill at ease most of the time.  However Ally Sheedy (as his girlfriend) is fun, appealing and full of life.  Too bad the movie is such a mess.This movie was made when nuclear war was a real threat and the Soviets were considered totally evil.  It touched a nerve back then--today it comes across as a period piece.  Also the computer graphics are laughably dated...and I LOVED the dial telephones!The real problem with this movie is the script. It starts off OK but, about halfway through, starts getting stupider and more unbelievable as it goes on.  The ending particularly is drawn out.  Also I find something wrong in any movie where a kid almost starting a world war is seen as being cute and clever for doing it!  In real life this kid would still be in jail.This was a huge hit with kids.  It's easy to see why--as most critics have pointed out, all the adults come across as total idiots.  Broderick and Sheedy are ALWAYS more intelligent than them.  Also the adults act like obnoxious little kids when things get bad--a particularly bad one is General Jack Beringer played by Barry Corbin.  He's always swearing and saying stupid things which are guaranteed to get huge laughs from kids.  Also he's Southern and you know--all Southerners are stupid.  And he's fat too. 
I'm giving this a 3 only for Sheedy and some nice direction by John Badham. Otherwise it's a dated, silly and stupid little movie.  Also I love the part at the end when the computer actually gives a little lecture to the audience!  However, it does provide the movie with two great lines: ""A strange game.  The only winning move is not to play.""",WarGames

It Transcends its Place in Time and Has Become a Minor Classic Dealing With Hackers, Computers, and Cold War Paranoia. The Two Lead Teens Matthew Broderick and Ally Sheedy are Superb and Lead the Viewer Through This Troubling Scenario and Charm just Enough to Take the Edge Off the World On the ""Eve of Destruction"" Story and Make it Entertaining Enough, and the Film Becomes Fantasy.

18,view_and_review,War is no Game,7,11 July 2019,"When 20% of U.S. military soldiers in charge of launching ICBMs (Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles) fail to do so it is suggested that those duties be handed over to a computer named WOPR (War Operation Plan Response). Even though the soldiers were told to launch under simulated conditions, they weren't aware of that and their conscience wouldn't allow them to deploy such a destructive weapon.WOPR, on the other hand, would presumably run every conceivable scenario in the case of an attack and choose the right course of action (i.e. what missiles to launch). This would take the decision making out of the hands of conflicted human beings and put it into the hands of a logical unemotional computer. What could go wrong?Of course, something goes wrong. Using a rudimentary dial-up modem, some 8"" floppy disks, and his home computer, David (Matthew Broderick) hacked WOPR thinking he was hacking a computer company. When he hacked WOPR he initiated a war game that he thought was just that: a game. Turns out that the military didn't think it was a game at all and were ready to launch a full-scale attack on Russia.This movie was very advanced and technologically sophisticated for 1983. I don't think I'd even seen a computer back then (although I was only five years old). The talk of algorithms and back doors, I personally wouldn't hear such words until the 2000's.It was a high stakes movie when we're talking about a potential World War III. Of course, evil/malfunctioning computers are always the culprit. It's like, the more we move forward and come to rely on computers, the more movies and shows come out to depict computers and tech as wicked.

19,evanston_dad,Let's Play Global Thermonuclear War,8,25 December 2014,"My wife and I are having a ""we can't believe we never saw that movie"" marathon. We're focusing mostly on fantasy/sci-fi movies from the 1980s (though ""The Blues Brothers"" is on the list, my own most egregious omission; ""The Karate Kid"" was my wife's), and ""WarGames"" was part of that project. I expected to have fun making fun of most of the movies on the list (""Krull"" anyone?) but was surprised to find that ""WarGames"" is a damn fine movie. Well scripted, well directed, expertly shot by six- time Academy Award nominee William A. Fraker, and well acted by a young Matthew Broderick and Ally Sheedy, it's a film that came out at a time when America (and by extension Hollywood) was obsessed with the idea of nuclear carnage, and while some movies used that premise for devastating emotional drama -- ""The Day After,"" ""Testament,"" to a certain extent ""Silkwood"" -- ""WarGames"" uses it to build an exciting, crafty adventure/suspense film, more Steven Spielberg than docu-drama. Less responsible, perhaps, but a hell of a lot more fun.And could any 80s actor do smarmy corporate villain better than Dabney Coleman?Fraker was nominated for his cinematography, and the film scored two other Oscar noms, one for its original screenplay (written by Lawrence Lasker and Walter F. Parkes) and the other for its sound.Grade: A",WarGames
20,AlsExGal,How much things change and how much they stay the same,7,13 December 2009,"In 1983, a very intelligent but socially isolated teenager programs his computer to dial up a large series of telephone numbers in search of game programs. He finally gets a hit - unfortunately it happens to be a military computer that is programmed to constantly play war games. The teenager decides to play the most interesting looking game on the roster - global thermonuclear war. He thinks it is a game, but the computer is actually looking to ""win the game"" and launch an attack on Russia. After 27 years this film shows how much things change and how much things stay the same.What is the same? There will always be some country or some group from which the U.S. fears an imminent attack. Teenagers will always feel a disconnect between their own generation and that of their parents. Younger people will always be quicker with new technology than older generations. However, they'll continue to fail to see the far-reaching implications of their more creative uses of that new technology until often it is too late.What is different? The Russian empire as it existed in 1983 is no longer the threat it once was. At this time in history, people were genuinely scared of a nuclear war breaking out between the U.S. and Russia since Reagan had upped the ante via defense spending and rhetoric during his first term.What is really different? In retrospect, it is obvious that neither the U.S. nor Russia actually intended to use their stockpile. Both sides were just using their arms as part of a joint bluff. Although the Russians have a history very different from the U.S., we were basically dealing with a group of people (the Soviet leaders) who had a good thing going and, in the end, did value their own skins above all else, just as most Americans do. Thus the real concern was that some mistake would set off some perfect storm of events in which both sides would end up launching all of these weapons that were never intended to be used. That is the subject of this movie.Today our enemy wears no uniform, has nothing to lose, is not centrally organized so that we can negotiate, and doesn't mind losing their own lives in the quest to end those of many others. That is really really different from 25 years ago.Don't let my serious review make you think that this film is all dark and fatalistic. It has lots of fun parts to it to contrast with the serious parts. For you computer geeks out there - like myself - you'll really get a kick out of the Heathkit style humor. Highly recommended.",WarGames
21,AaronCapenBanner,A Dangerous Game,6,27 November 2013,"John Badham directed this computer-gone-mad picture that stars Mathew Broderick as David, a rebellious teenager and computer whiz who likes to hack into his high school computer system to change his grades to an ""A"", or insult his science teacher. Things take a serious turn when he accidentally hacks into the Pentagon's computer that controls the missiles aimed at Russia. David and the computer think it is a game, but it turns out to be frighteningly real, as David finds himself targeted by the military, forcing him and his girlfriend Jennifer(played by Ally Sheedy) to go on the run... Entertaining film may have a most unlikely premise(one would hope!) but is well cast and directed. Dabney Coleman is quite good as David's chief ""nemesis"".",WarGames
22,Aaron1375,"Interesting movie, starts out like a comedy and then turns more toward thriller.",8,20 April 2010,"I enjoyed this film back in the day, even as a kid I watched it and could take in the rather interesting story. Granted, it is probably because I play video games so I loved the concept of playing these awesome games that the character Matthew Broderick played got when he hacked into the mainframe of the defense computer. The movie does though kind of change focus throughout the movie as it does start out as almost a comedy as the Broderick character starts out showing his computer hacking skills by changing his grades in the computer. Though how he gets away with this is beyond me as I would think that someone would go over the grades before they are actually printed on a report card. Still, it was funny as he and the character Ally Sheedy played became friends. Then he finds a computer mainframe that seems to have a lot of war type games in it and he decides that he really wants to play these games. Well he does a lot of research to find the password to enter the back door as it were to this computer and then all heck breaks loose as he plays a game that sends the United States military in a frenzy. He ends up getting arrested and taken into military custody, but that is not the end as the computer is still going to play the game and set things in motion for a full out assault. After a certain point after Broderick gets free of military control the movie gets more serious and becomes more of a thriller and the comedy takes a backseat, however it still maintains its entertainment level.",WarGames
23,Wuchakk,Solid teen adventure...,6,13 September 2013,"...not that it's just for kids.Released in 1983, ""War Games"" is about a computer whiz (Matthew Broderick) who accidentally hacks into a super computer that controls the US nuclear arsenal. Innocently thinking he's playing a game, he chooses to be the Soviet Union and, suddenly, we're on the verge of World War III! ""War Games"" combines the malevolent computer theme of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" with the mountain military base shenanigans of ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" to produce what is essentially a teen adventure a la Scooby Doo, but without the cartoony horror trappings and the dog. Broderick and his sidekick, Ally Sheedy, were both 20 at the time of filming, but look around 15-16.Although overrated in some quarters (Roger Ebert, for instance, gives it a perfect rating), ""War Games"" is a fun, entertaining youth adventure with some good suspense here and there. It's like young Indiana Jones in the modern day, but with toned-down action. Broderick is a worthy protagonist with his doe eyes & smarts and Sheedy is a quality female sidekick, beautiful too, in a girl-next-door type of way (the best kind).The film runs 114 minutes and was mostly shot in Washington (state), but also California and Colorado.GRADE: B",WarGames

Duh, that is quite obvious! The storyline itself is interesting. The maker of the computer created a back door to the system for the dumb reason of starting over. His belief was that Man is evil, etc. Funny how times have changed due to terrorism where such characters are given little sympathy. The kid who figures out the problems creates an interesting story. The movie steals a few scenes from Doctor strange glove in the defence room. Okay. I think it is funny how Matthew Broderick has not really aged if you see him now.",WarGames

Broderick's and Sheedy's winning performances also help. Fortunately, the movie doesn't contain too much technical ""jargon"": it is more interested in its clearly stated anti-war message, while at the same time it works as suspenseful entertainment. It may be a little far-fetched sometimes, but when that final moment arrives when the computer realizes that ""the only winning move is not to play"", be prepared to feel a genuine chill.",WarGames
28,paul2001sw-1,Priescient and fun,7,14 June 2005,"John Badham's film 'War Games' epitomises the era of its making (and not just because of the awful mid-80s teeny-pop on the soundtrack); it looks back, to the era of the cold war, and forward, to the era of popular computing. Indeed, in some sense, the film seems positively prescient: how many people were worried about computer hackers in 1983? It's also quite perceptive on both hacker psychology and the perils of mutually assured destruction, and also more realistic about artificial intelligence than earlier movies such as '2001'. What it isn't is especially deep: the plot is a variant of a corny old theme (pesky kids try to foil a plan to destroy the world), and no-one's acting really convinces that their characters believe that the world is truly on the brink. Nonetheless, it remains a distinctive and entertaining film.",WarGames
29,g-bodyl,A Movie That Is Ahead Of It's Time!,9,18 July 2014,"WarGames is your typical 80's action/teen angst flick on one hand, but on the other hand it is a very intelligent film that seems to be ahead of it's time, or rather a type of film that wouldn't be made on a regular basis for another decade. I like how the film doesn't overstuff us with computer terminology, but it also doesn't think it's audience is dumb. It's filled with good special effects, an intelligent story (involving supercomputers), good acting, and is practically your perfect 80's film.John Badham's film is about a young computer whiz named David Lightman who hacks into the government computer system and he begins to play a game with the computer. But little did he know that he just started the process of a World War Three.The acting is rather good, though one could say this film is more about the computers, rather than the human characters. Matthew Broderick was a special actor in the 1980's and was one of the better teen actors. we might remember Ally Sheedy from her role in ""The Breakfast Club,"" but she does good for the most part. We also get some quality supporting turns from Dabney Coleman and John Wood.Overall, WarGames is a movie that is ahead of it's time and it should be every computer hacker's dream movie. This is another film that has computers too smart for it's own good, and I was reminded very much of 2001: A Space Odyssey. Both of these films are very smart sci-fi movies. This movie is also realistic and pushes across the thought on what would happen if technology took over the world. I rate this film 9/10.",WarGames
30,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews,7,29 November 2013,"WarGames If the future of warfare is to be fought via computers, does that include gay computers?Unfortunately, this cyber-thriller doesn't ask or tell.Scouring phone lines to find new video games, computer whiz David Lightman (Matthew Broderick) comes across a game titled Falken's Maze, which he inevitably hacks.Unbeknownst to him, the digital diversion is actually a NORAD defense operating system that simulates war scenarios.Engaged, the supercomputer enacts a missile attack from the Soviets that puts a NORAD engineer (Dabney Coleman) on the defensive.To impede the processor from instigating a nuclear war, David must locate its creator (John Wood) and convince him to hit control-alt-delete.Dated by today's standards, WarGames is still an entertaining blend of Cold War espionage and early-1980s computer hacking that was years ahead of its time - and created a new sub-genre.Thankfully, the only combat computers accommodate these days are vapid celebrity Twitter wars.Green Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca",WarGames

It's a more modern version of ""Failsafe"", with a significant message about human hubris and the fallacy of faultless artificial intelligence, a message that is even more important todayThe story is a fun ride, primarily because the protagonist is a teen.

32,tabuno,Evolving Into An Even Better Film Experience With Age,9,21 January 2019,"Matthew Broderik along with Ally Sheedy had the good fortune to star in the young adult techno-drama WarGames. The year 1983 apparently was the year of rotary telephones and phone booths, video arcades, large floppy disk drives, dial up modems, and dot-matrix printers. These by now anachronistic devices on display in WarGames after 35 years have actually become more intriguing and charming of a time gone by making this techno-drama more compelling and engrossing than when it was first released on June 5, 1983. This movie along with the adult version of WarGames known as Fail Safe (1964) about a potential nuclear war with Russia and the science fiction classic The Andromeda Strain (1971) about a potential alien biological infestation offer up intensively emotional cataclysmic scenarios to our planet's very existence. These earlier movies focused little on physical action and focused more on the geo-political, human and scientific responses to global catastrophes. WarGames' techno-obsolescence apparently has not diminished the overall cinematic experience and drama of this movie and in fact has evolved into an even more curious and entertaining film than when it was originally released. Interestingly, WarGames at the time was nominated for three Oscars for Best Writing/Screenplay, Best Cinematography, and Best Sound as well as winning best director from the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films, USA for John Badham (better known from directing Saturday Night Fever, Dracula, Short Circuit, Stakeout, and Point of No Return and later television episodes to this day). Except for a pretty poor musical selection near the beginning of the movie, WarGames later with its haunting strains of harmonic music and good screenplay is definitely worth watching for those who missed out on seeing this movie these past 35 years for its continuing emotive resonance and global message of human survival.",WarGames
33,The-Sarkologist,A Classic Hacking Film,9,28 June 2020,"I'm rather surprised that I hadn't gotten around to reviewing this film either, particularly since it is one of those films that I believe that I have seen countless number of times. In fact, this is one of those films that I have literally grown up with, and the saying 'do you want to play a game' as one of those sayings that resonated through us as kids of the 80s. In fact, in a way this film seems to not only be one of those must see films from the era, but it is still referenced today, and is also considered to be one of not only the quintissential hacking films, but one that is literally true to form.Okay, the film doesn't necessarily tell you how things are done, such as the idea of phone phreaking, a way in which to make countless numbers of phone calls without having to pay a cent for them (and it doesn't really work these days anyway). It is also interesting how the film focuses a lot of how he located the password to the system, which literally seemed to be an early form of social engineering, but then again, this was back in the days where you could literally get away with having 'password' as your password.So, this film is about this teenager who is a bit of a computer geek, noting once again that this is in an era before they even taught computing in schools. So, while he might be pretty smart, school does tend to be rather boring. Then again, one might argue that he actually gets in trouble on purpose because, well, he sort of knows were the school keeps their passwords to the computer system (another form of social engineering before it was even a thing).Anyway, he accidentally hacks into a US military computer and begins to play a game with it, however what he doesn't realise is that the game that this computer plays, he plays it with Centcom's computers, so when he plays the Russians, and launches the missiles, this is displayed on their main computers. The problem is that once he has started playing the game, the computer continues playing it until its completion. The problem is that the staff at Centcom don't actually realise that this is a game, and that the computer is running a simulation.There is so much in this film that makes a lot more sense after having studied computer science, and it really goes to show how much thought they had put into making it. Like, we have these primitive versions of machine learning, and computers playing games so as to learn about strategy. Like, they relate tic-tac-toe to nuclear war in that it is impossible to win, or lose, a game of tic-tac-toe because most of the time it ends in a draw (which it not strictly true, but it is still relevant).Yeah, this movie is actually pretty awesome, though I do find it interesting how they referred to this kid as being a loner and all that, when it isn't actually quite true - he like has a girlfriend. Yeah, he certainly didn't come across about being one of those social recluses that they claim that he is, especially since the girl actually travelled to meet him as well, which I must admit is pretty noble of her. Still, that aside, it is pretty cool.",WarGames
34,tomgillespie2002,Exciting and well-researched thriller,7,11 January 2012,"In the 1980's, the realisation that computers will soon play an extremely important role in everyday life was becoming more and more evident. This idea was treated with excitement, curiosity, and fear - people genuinely did not know how powerful they would become, but they were certainly fearful of it. Cinema explored this fear in successful films such as The Terminator (1984), which depicted a future where humans were locked into a battle with robots, and Tron (1982), in which a character is sucked into a game where he is forced to battle with the computer to survive. Never had the capabilities of computers been so realistically portrayed than in WarGames, a film that introduced the world to home computers, hacking, and how humanity can be replaced by machines (as well as the idea that nuclear destruction is still a threat).When two missile controllers fail to launch a missile during a test launch due to uncertainty, government bigwig McKittrick (Dabney Coleman) introduces his superiors to WOPR (War Operation Plan Response), a giant super-computer that repeatedly plays games with itself to generate stats and results of possible nuclear war outcomes. The operation is given the go-ahead, and workers find themselves replaced by this metallic super- brain, that will deal with any potential nuclear threat to the US. High school punk David (Matthew Broderick) is a highly intelligent computer- obsessive who uses his hacking skills to change his grades on his high school system. When he learns that a company is releasing new breakthrough games in California, he scans the area for computers in order to hack into their mainframe. He stumbles upon a computer that lists many strange war games, including 'Global Thermonuclear War'. He begins a game, choosing to be Russia, but unbeknownst to him, he is actually playing WOPR who is playing the game for real. Soon David is brought in by the FBI who suspect him of working with the Russians, while the threat of global nuclear destruction lingers as WOPR carries on playing the 'game'.I viewed this film quite often when I was a child as I owned the VHS, but admittedly the film went over my head somewhat and I found it quite boring. Watching it now, I was shocked to find out this is a very good film, and it makes for a gripping adult thriller, while maintaining that 1980's kids-film-feel. The technical aspects shown on screen are extremely well-researched, and David's hacking activities make for exciting and interesting viewing. It's also fascinating to see the early giant, clunky computers of the 1980's and an early portrayal of the Internet. Overall, this is a highly entertaining thriller that is well acted, scripted and filmed (and even received three Academy Award nominations), and has plenty of those nostalgic qualities for us children of the 80's.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",WarGames
35,Dr_Coulardeau,War is absurd and machines must remain toys,10,29 December 2008,"Remember Ronald Reagan, the actor-president, the acting president, the president-actor, we will never know. Was he serious about his empire of evil or was he joking one of these good words produced by black humor, or at least very dark grey humor? No one will even know, because Reagan himself did probably not know. The film is a direct reflection on that period from that period. If we entrust our own security to machines what would happen? Machines have no sense of life and death and for them everything is nothing but an exercise, a game, a playground dare or challenge or discussion because they have no ethical sense at all. The film, or rather this question is at the basis of the Terminator series too. Machines, if we let them develop too much, will take over and destroy or try to destroy the human species that would stand in their way. We also remember it is the fundamental element of the Dune series and that the survival of the human species was due to the Butlerian revolution that banned all intelligent machines and made it a crime to develop such machines. What is the originality of this film then that goes back to the command-line computers that no one knows how to use any more. That was the good old time before the invention of the GUI (Graphical User's Interface). That was a beautiful time when computers were an elite tool and when the Internet was still nothing but an intranet of the military establishment. That was then a field of mystery that we were just discovering and it took little imagination to understand that it could only be child play to penetrate such a system because it was only based on declarative identities and passwords and human beings are very simple-minded as for passwords since they want THE password they will never forget, as if it were possible. So it is simple to think of birth dates, death dates of close relatives, names of one's children, etc. That's exactly what a 17 year old teenager does: he penetrates the computer that governs the whole defense of the USA in case of a thermo-nuclear war and finds out that the computer considers it is a game, a game he is willing to play but he plays it for real and he can absolutely fool all commanding levels of the security system because they trust the machines and do not even ask their own eyes to check what is happening. The worst point about this film is that security rules make the commanding chain decide at one point to lock the system so that no change can be introduced that could change the management of the situation, or the orders given to the military by anyone in the chain of command. But the film remains entertaining and yet very moralistic indeed. So the game cannot be stopped but the military commander can be persuaded that it is a game played by the machine, but, and then it becomes rather sickening, the machine can by-pass that human chain of command and give the orders itself. At this moment there is no way to escape the apocalypse, except by playing another game the machine accepts as the key to make it think, if it can think, in the right direction. So why not try tic-tac-toe, a game that cannot be won at all. And that leads the dear machine of ours to the conclusion that, after examining all scenarios, a thermo nuclear war cannot be won except by not engaging in one. And we can only wonder why human beings are dumb enough to start wars all the time if there is no winner in present day war. McCain who knew how to win a war lost the election that should have been his major battle. Bush who was not prepared for a war, got into one desperately and stubbornly, and even into two for good measure. If he had been prepared he definitely would not even have hesitated with Iran or North Korea and maybe two or three more. Is a machine more intelligent than the human species? Probably. At least this film is trying to tell us so.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines",WarGames
36,zkonedog,An Engaging Little Tale About Nuclear War,8,11 March 2017,"In this quintessentially 1980s movie (it co-stars Dabney Coleman, so that pretty much qualifies it right there), a young computer-hacker (played by a very young Matthew Broderick) accidentally hacks into the U.S. defense missile control center (while trying to forge his high school grades!) and initiates a game of ""war"" with a supercomputer that is used to formulate possible outcomes of thermonuclear war with Russia. Broderick's character initially plays the ""side"" of Russia, prompting the computer to be the U.S. and eventually push the real military generals to the brink of starting an actual war based on the faulty information the computer is giving them.I won't spoil the end of the film here, but suffice it to say that it is, at the very least, an interesting little morality lesson on nuclear proliferation and mutually-assured destruction. I began watching this movie at home on my couch one morning I was off from work and got hooked, ending up watching it to its conclusion. It just has that perfect mix of playfulness (you really can't get too serious with Broderick as your star) and serious issues that plague our current world.Surprisingly, this is probably the best film I have ever seen that deals with very serious, terrible issues (like nuclear weapons) in a dramatic format. Rocky IV was a little too weepy, and Star Trek: The Undiscovered Country was a bit too political (both in their takes on U.S./Soviet relations), but this film had the right blend of entertaining scenarios and moments that really made me think.I would recommend this movie to two types of people: 1. Those who grew up in the 80s and still love the styles/themes/films of that decade and either want to re-live them or experience this one for the first time; and 2. Children with an interest in history or politics, as they will love the simplistic messages inherent in the film's conclusion.

38,digitalbeachbum,Good for the 80's but fails the test of time,1,11 August 2016,"I really liked this movie when it was released and I remember watching it in the theater, however now that I can stream it and binge watch it over and over again I have found the plot is full of holes and there are plenty of technical goofs in the movie. Enough so that it is no longer a movie that I like to watch.It will be good enough for people who have not seen it as often as I have watched. It has drama, suspense, young love interests, humor and insight to the idea that war is a worthless endeavor. No one really wins even if you think you are the winner.The actors and the direction are acceptable and I'd wish it didn't have the spotty bad language through out the movie. It doesn't have any violence nor does it have any sex scenes, so you might find it acceptable for the younger members of your family.However that is where I end my favorable review. (spoilers)The entire movie hinges on the idea that this computer system takes over a game being played and then decides that it needs to launch real missiles in order to complete the game. While this idea is interesting the entire logic behind the system is stupid.I noted that the main characters talk about 'Joshua' who hasn't learned a lesson yet but it is implied that tic-tac-toe was one of the games it needed to play in order to learn that global thermonuclear war was a waste of time.Am I supposed to believe that no one on the team or Prof Falken let the computer run the tic tac toe game against itself previously? I find that a flaw because as a computer person I know I let the computer play against itself many, many times when I had the opportunity to let it do so. Games like chess, TTT or Colonial Conquest.I also find it ridiculous that the entire 'hacking' aspect of the movie is flawed and I'm assuming at this time in our society things were so new that the director didn't have many experts to rely on for facts. The movie is riddled with mistakes on networking and computer logic.The list goes on and on. It is really a terrible script.I can only give 1/10 stars now, but if you would have asked me twenty years ago I would have given 10/10 stars.",WarGames
39,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Best for those who fondly remember 80s computers,5,15 February 2009,"Cold War paranoia meets 80s computer geekdom in ""War Games,"" a story about a high school boy named David Lightman (Matthew Broderick in his first major film) who unknowingly hacks into a computer that simulates possible nuclear war strategies with Russia and appears to have actually convinced the US military that an attack is imminent. While it might be dated ""War Games"" struggles with its preposterous premise and execution of suspense that borders on laughable. At the same time it's a light, easy movie (a rarity as far as Cold War dramas go) and for those who remember their 5 and 1/2 floppy days it's a nostalgic one.The movie should be commended most for putting the young Broderick in the spotlight. He's a protagonist that's easy to love with his goofy disposition and devious ways. This is without a doubt the film that landed him his career-soaring role in ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" a few years later. His co-star and eventual ""Breakfast Club"" star Ally Sheedy plays Jennifer, the friend-turned-love-interest that gets caught up in what happens because she and David hacked into the school computer to change their biology grades. Silly is the best way to describe what Sheedy makes her character and maybe that's why she and Broderick have good chemistry.The film's biggest problem is the other end with the military/nuclear war side. The adult characters aren't particularly likable and the actors play their roles pretty seriously. If the premise were more believable, maybe their performances would be more convincing, but instead it just looks like there's something off. The movie also starts for a good 15 or so minutes focusing just on the military side. We don't even meet David first. That doesn't make sense. If a kid gets-in-too-deep story is going to work, we need to identify with the kid first.It seems then that the computer gadget factor was what the creators relied on with this movie, which doesn't really work outside of the 80s. There's only so much excitement a giant white box with a black screen and white writing can bring to a movie after the mid-90s. While hacking is still a prevalent thriller movie tactic, finding passwords like David does is unimpressive. The nostalgic factor is there for a few laughs, but it's not attention-getting like it might have been.""War Games'"" success today is merely because of cult status.

Kind of like The Goonies, it is a movie that finds a young kid in an extraordinary situation, except that rather than the Indiana Jones type adventure that the Goonies go on, David (a young Matthew Broderick) has inadvertently come frighteningly close to starting a massive nuclear war between the United States and Russia.We meet David early in the film after a tense missile launch training sequence (in which the men on hand do not realize that they are only participating in a training drill). David is a typical high school boy, bored to death by school but fascinated to no end by computers, even the now-prehistoric dinosaur that he had operating at home. One of the things that I liked about this movie, in fact, was that it made my computer look so high tech! Obviously, any movie that deals with computers is going to be outdated in a few years, and Wargames is certainly no exception. Consider, for example, the fact that David's girlfriend was so fascinated by the concept of a speaker that she picked it up and looked at it from all angles, completely amazed. You can see this in any number of movies, such as the similarly ancient computers in Weird Science and, probably the most amusing, the massive, brick-sized cellular telephone that Wesley Snipes used in true gangster style in New Jack City. Technology is an amusing thing, especially when it's taken so seriously in the movies and then is so completely obsolete a decade or so later.Wargames, however, despite being jam-packed with outdated machinery and computer technology, is no less potent as a military thriller, because the technology is not the point of the film. Instead, the movie tells the story of how David goes searching for video games on the 1983 version of the Internet, only to accidentally stumble upon a top-secret military database, WOPR (endearingly referred to as `Whopper') that runs hypothetical sequences of what World War III would look like, including how the Russians would react to American reactions to their actions, and so forth. The process by which this machine can do this is one of the few things that's left relatively unclear in the movie, which is probably a good thing, because it sounds suspiciously like something that a computer even today would have a hard time doing. Imagine the staggering amount of information that would have to be entered into a computer for it to achieve that level of intelligence. At any rate, wanting nothing but some new video games and to impress a girl, David searches for video games on what appears to be the web's only search engine (and, indeed, it's only feature at all), and stumbles onto such titles as Backgammon, Chess, Guerrilla Warfare and, of course, Global Thermonuclear War. Naturally, being a high school kid, he's fascinated and wants to play the biggest baddest one. Probably the most hair-raising scene in the film is when David's mother calls him downstairs and congratulates him on passing his classes (which he had changed by hacking into the school's computer system), by which he is thrilled until he turns to look at the TV, where the news is reporting the war that has been set in motion because of his tinkering on the computer.  Wargames requires a substantial suspension of disbelief because of such things like the United States military's inability to tell whether or not those blips coming from Russia on their screens are real weapons of mass destruction of if they're just a computer game, but the fact that the world is tottering so lightly on the edge of Global Thermonuclear War, even if only because of the very presence of these types of weapons, is the frightening concept that the movie tries to get across. It focuses on the possibility that something like that could have happened, and it rings chillingly true to this day, no matter how much more advanced our technology is. Sure, it's not likely that the governments of the United States and of Russia or any other countries are likely to launch weapons that will kill millions of people simply based on a few lights that have lighted up on their switchboard, but the weapons are there, and someone paid a lot of money for them. Wargames is an enormously entertaining thriller that poses a question about humanity, with the answer from WOPR that, like Tic Tac Toe, there is no winning move in war. We see it playing through World War III on the military intelligence screens near the end of the film (during which it evidently has a field day messing with the lighting in the room) showing missiles coming from every direction and destroying everything on the map.`This is a strange game,' it says. `The only winning move is not to play. How about a nice game of chess?'",WarGames

This factual event is the origin of the film "" War Games."" Herein we have a high school computer whiz kid named David Lightman (Matthew Broderick) who is seeking to play advance computer games. What he does instead is to hack into a sophisticate military computer. This machine turns out to be the controlling brain behind America's nuclear defense missile deterrent. Once in, Lightman decides to play end world games, initiating World War III. When his super secret war computer actually begins to threaten the soviet union with a real war, its designer Dr. Stephen Falken (John Wood in one of his most impressive roles) is summoned to stop it, while it's comptroller Dr. John McKittrick (Dabney Coleman) tried to convince NORAD General Beringer (Barry Corbin) that there really is a war and he should let the computer retaliate against the Russians. The film begins slowly enough, with the late John Spencer, playing a missile silo officer, but then launches the audience through a heart-pounding scenario which is frighteningly real.

There's still a lot to enjoy in this slightly Disney version of an end-of-the-world thriller. There's a lot of clever twists in the plot, some lovely performances, some real tension. But it also all feels a bit light and softened to make it more audience friendly. That was probably the right decision commercially, but maybe not artistically. If original director Martin Brest had been allowed to finish the film, with the somewhat darker original script I read back then, I wonder if this could have been a bit of a minor classic, in the family of great nuclear war films like Dr. Strangelove and Fail Safe, instead of an entertaining, intelligent thrill ride.

50,barnabyrudge,Thoroughly exciting and enjoyable thriller.,8,15 January 2006,"An exhilarating and rather disturbing story dealing with the potential of computer technology to over-rule humans in a nuclear crisis, ""Wargames"" is a memorable thriller which made stars of Matthew Broderick and Ally Sheedy. Directed with real chutzpah by John Badham, working from an eventful and Oscar-nominated script by Lawrence Lasker and Walter F. Parkes, the film is an exercise in suspense which cleverly caters for a target audience of both kids and adults. Part of the film's appeal is that the script manoeuvres a smart-ass teenager into becoming the one character capable of saving the world from a holocaust; another part of its appeal is that the plot doesn't retreat into the realms of ludicrous fantasy like so many films of this kind. Consequently, the suspense in this 1980s film is very real and urgent, as opposed to the more artificial kind of suspense that has weakened the soulless thrillers of recent years.The U.S. Defence Department design a huge computer called the WOPR which plays out various war game scenarios. Following recent human errors, it is felt that in the event of a real nuclear strike it would be better if the computer could take control, eliminating the costly factor of human hesitation or crises of conscience. Meanwhile in Seattle, a brilliant young computer genius, David Lightman (Matthew Broderick), hacks into the Defence Department's computer. He mistakenly believes he is checking out some as-yet-unreleased computer games, but in reality he is about to set into motion a chain of events that could lead to worldwide destruction. David chooses to play a game entitled Global Thermonuclear War. He elects to play for the Russian side, and sets Seattle and Las Vegas as nuclear missile targets. Little does he David realise that the WOPR has logged his instructions and believes a real nuclear strike to be imminent. The computer over-rules everyone - including the top brass of the American military - and prepares to launch a counterstrike against Russia. In a race against time, David and his girlfriend Jennifer (Ally Sheedy) try to track down the brilliant but reclusive programmer, Professor Falken (John Wood), who designed Global Thermonuclear War, in the hope that he may know how to stop the computer as it prepares to wipe out mankind.It's a simple but thoroughly exciting premise, played out with maximum intensity. Broderick and Sheedy make likable young heroes, and are well supported by their adult co-stars. One flaw with the film is that the grown-up characters are generally rather dim (you'd think all these computer specialists and decorated soldiers would be a bit more competent, for example, at holding David in custody after arresting him for breaching their technology). In spite of the implausibilities in their characters, though, the adult actors still turn in good performances. The score by Arthur B. Rubinstein is suitably exciting and adds to the urgency of the action on-screen, especially in the film's taut last-gasp climax. Wargames is a thoroughly enjoyable thriller which resists the urge to preach about the man .vs. machine climate in which we all exist, and instead concentrates on pure suspense.... and is all the better for it.",WarGames

Both sides are eager to play war games, the difference being that the young hacker can only conceive of ""war games"" in terms of games, while the supercomputer can only conceive of ""war games"" in terms of war...""Wargames"" is quite a good science fiction movie, with a charming performance by a young Matthew Broderick as the impish hacker who bites off more, much more, than he can chew. It's based on a remarkably intelligent screenplay, which succeeds in being both entertaining and chilling. (The movie is often called ""family friendly"", but I'd be more inclined to recommend it only to older adolescents and adults.) In the movie, a bold young hacker meddles and intrudes where he shouldn't have, but the problem runs deeper than that. The intelligence of Man is age-old, versatile, layered and linked to qualities like instinct, experience, imagination and feeling ; the intelligence of a computer is.. well, just the intelligence of an expensive machine. Both kinds of intelligence are separated by a broad river ; and it is very easy, for the unwary, to fall into this river and drown. All of which might be an academical question, were it not for the fact that the governments of many a nation have gifted computers with fearsome powers of destruction, including global destruction by nuclear annihilation.If you like the movie you may want to take a look at another cautionary fable which has lost none of its pertinence, to wit ""Colossus: The Forbin Project"", 1970.

54,slokes,Shall We Play A Game?,8,4 May 2004,"Cyberthrillers may not have started with ""WarGames,"" but it was here the form achieved an early peak. As more filmmakers follow its example of portraying a high-tech faceoff between man and machine, ""WarGames"" remains a standard to be measured against. While it's not a film classic, it's a very, very good popcorn thriller of uncommon craft, charm, and humanity.Seattle high schooler David Lightman (Matthew Broderick) has only a few hours to undo what he thought was a sneak preview of an upcoming computer game but what instead got him tinkering with the U.S. Air Force's WOPR (War Operation Planned Response) computer system in such a way as to trigger a countdown to World War III. The FBI thinks he's a Soviet spy, while classmate Jennifer Mack (Ally Sheedy) is wondering if this isn't all really about a rejiggered biology grade.Broderick is solid, and Sheedy even better, but what really sells this film is everything else. Start with the excellent supporting performances. John Wood as a reclusive professor and Barry Corbin as a tobacco-chewing general get much of the kudos, and rightly, but there's a whole deep bench of quality work beyond that, like Kent Williams as a curt White House advisor, William Bogert and Susan Davis as David's out-of-it parents, Alan Blumenfeld as the swaggering bully of a biology teacher, and Juanin Clay as a beautiful but underappreciated assistant (even by herself as she uses her own mouth as an ashcan for her boss's discarded gum.) You know the casting people behind this movie were on the ball when the opening sequence features two very recognizable faces, those of Michael Madsen and John Spencer, in what were film debuts for both.That sequence with Madsen and Spencer as missile men point up another quality of ""WarGames,"" the way the movie works in terms of setting up expectations and developing pace. The harrowing business between the two of them is mercilessly presented (""Turn your key, sir!"") and then effectively abandoned so as to work in the central storyline, the replacement of these men with computers. We get a macro-view where Dabney Coleman as a tunnel-visioned warroom executive effectively makes the case for ""taking the men out of the loop"" and then zoom back into what seems a totally unrelated story, that of slacker teen David Lightman and his high school travails.The film could have just started with Lightman, and worked its way out to the business with the WOPR. But the early peek behind the curtain is a clever way of raising the stakes with the audience before the protagonist realizes what's up.The set design, cinematography, lighting, and editing all work wonders as well. The NORAD warroom is really a character onto itself, the ultimate source of reality in this film (and better for my money than the warroom in `Dr. Strangelove,' an obvious inspiration.) The way the cameras dart around from terminal to terminal as uniformed USAF technicians follow the progress of an apparent Soviet attack, lighting onto one of them just before he or she relays an important piece of information, is highly addictive and entertaining.There's some sloppiness in the movie. Madsen and Spencer's talk about this great pot Spencer's character has scored strains credulity in the high-security setting they are in, and its blindingly obvious that the two men we see exiting a helicopter and entering a jeep during the credits are not the same two men getting out of the jeep moments later. The musical score is terrible, except for the elegiac tune at the end by which time it's too late. And there's no real examination of the morality of Lightman's serial lawbreaking.But this is a funny, exciting, consciousness-raising movie that is as entertaining now with the Cold War more than a decade behind us as it was all those years ago. For all the technical innovation on display, it's ironically appropriate we remember it for showing us how to butter an ear of corn, because it's the human side of the equation `WarGames' keeps in its sights at all times.[The DVD features a terrific, candid commentary from director John Badham and writers Lawrence Lasker and Walter Parkes that gives one a real appreciation for the value of creative license as well as factual diligence in making a film of this kind work.]",WarGames

'The Day After Tomorrow' and 'The Manhattan Project' were others that I can immediately think of that urged immediate caution and much needed rationality. Movies that came from this decade expressed irritation with the persistence of the Cold War, but would also derive from a decade which would soon see its end (1989) (although, we're right back where we started with all of our paranoia).The story concerns a teen who's clever computer hacking skills and passion for video games have come in handy in obtaining a new computer game. However, what seems like an innocent game of world domination (something like Risk) turns out to actually be reality when the game permits the teen to access the entire nuclear armament unit of the United States military. But, to the guys in National Security, it actually looks like the Russians (and soon many other countries) are ready to launch weapons against the states to which they have to react. So, the military pursues the teen, fingering him as an agitator rather than someone who accidentally got into a BIG mess, and he must escape and find the game's creator to figure out how to stop the game.80s teen regulars, Matthew Broderick and Alley Sheedy, head up the cast, supported primarily by Dabney Coleman (always a fine actor).

When it was first released in the theater back in 1983, I was only a small boy at 6 years old. And even though I wasn't the owner of a computer until 1994, for sure, ""WarGames"" truly was inspiration of things to come in the always evolving world of modern technology. Sure the 1970's and 1980's had some creative juices going for them at the time like ""Superman"", ""Star Wars"", ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" to name a few, but this creative story also leans more to a realistic as our technology keeps getting stronger as we speak. Even after 28 years, ""WarGames"" may have out-dated dinosaur technology in its arsenal, the ideology of a potential technological revolution is still to this day not an exaggeration. I'm not hoping that it will ever happen, but not saying there will ever be one. There might not be one right around the corner, but it would be ignorant to assume there will never be one. Sure it takes a while for Matthew Broderick to make his inaugural appearance, but one he does, he just nails his role to perfection. Things get so interesting when Professor Falken (John Wood) shows up near the end. From the outskirts of a suburban town in the Seattle area to the paranoid threat of a possible World War III, they successfully executed each scene without a single hint of dramatic tensions that could've dragged the movie down. And though I didn't find any real necessity to the genre of this movie, the love story was quite charming. Ally Sheedy was wonderful in her rather meagre role and even to this day I wished her potential would've caught on knowing what potential she had when she graced the screen in the 1980's. The DVD special additions had some points of interest, but what really stands out with the DVD feature is the poignant commentary of director John Badham as it clarifies the exactly what makes this movie an original classic in filmmaking. Sure it's clear that Badham reveals the comical factors of the movie, and the dramatic features are of notable interests too as well. The feeling I get is that Badham and company must've had a ball when they made ""WarGamwes"". ""WarGames"" was one of the earliest films that focuses on the many dangers computers can be when you abuse the systems. Sure it can be a helpful guiding hand to get messages across at a more rapid rate than snail mail and sure it is an endless array of information that covers just about every topic that you want to know something about.

63,blott2319-1,"Holds up, except for all the outdated technology",8,9 July 2020,"Seeing WarGames now is a pure overdose of nostalgia. The entire movie is like you're freebasing the 1980s. It's not just the film itself that I'm nostalgic for, but all the things depicted in it which no longer exist in the form we see here. From rotary dialing pay-phones to old school dial-up internet, I can't imagine anyone under the age of 20 would have any idea what's going on in this movie. The funny part is, back in 1983, these were amazing technological advances. The mere idea of having a computer take over some key functions in the military was seen as radical or crazy. Despite all of the outdated things in the movie, I still think the story holds up quite well. It has an exciting pace to it that takes some time to ramp up, but when things get going the film can really get your heart racing. The most famous scene of the movie, the big crescendo of drama at the end, still manages to get me excited even though I've seen it countless times. The other nice thing about WarGames is that the moral of the story is still valid even to this day, and can teach people the costs and consequences of nuclear war.While I am an avid fan of Ferris Bueller's Day Off, I have always felt that Matthew Broderick is actually better suited for this kind of role. His demeanor comes off as more bookish and smart rather than bold and daring. I love him as David in WarGames, and I think he has some good chemistry with Ally Sheedy as well. Their conversations can sometimes sound a bit odd or stilted, but I feel like that's more a script problem than their acting. The rest of the cast is also good, and I have a particular fondness for what Barry Corbin brings to the war room. I do think there are some problems with the plot of WarGames, and I think that's what has always held me back from a deep abiding love for the film. The beginning of the movie can feel a little slow, before it starts accelerating the plot towards the finale. Some of the actions of Joshua make little to no sense based on the way the game was started. Also, the idea of putting a long timer before taking any action feels like it is purely for plot convenience, and a complete contradiction of what came before. Despite these problems, I can't deny that I have a great fondness for WarGames, and I think it holds up well.",WarGames
64,hall895,Let's play Global Thermonuclear War,7,2 July 2009,"WarGames is a film which in some ways seems hopelessly dated and in other ways seems to have been way ahead of its time. There's the Cold War angle, the United States and the Soviet Union gearing up for the seemingly inevitable World War III and the nuclear holocaust that would go along with it. It's a 1980s storyline which doesn't play as well all these years later with the Soviet Union long having been consigned to the dustbin of history. Nowadays the threat comes not from one communist superpower but from...well, pretty much anywhere it seems. But then again this movie, made in 1983, is at its heart really about a computer hacker. Who, in 1983, even knew there was such a thing as a computer hacker? Ahead of its time this movie is.While certain aspects of the story may seem less relevant today there is no denying that WarGames is an effective, entertaining thriller. There may be some flaws in the movie's logic now and again, not everything we see seems entirely plausible. But the movie works. The story centers around Seattle high school student David Lightman, who is not doing particularly well in school. But it's not because he isn't bright, he certainly is. He just seems unmotivated and perhaps distracted by his obsession with computers. That obsession plays itself out as he attempts to hack into a video game manufacturer's computer...and instead unknowingly hacks into a Defense Department computer. In playing the ""games"" on that computer he almost starts World War III. Whoops.Matthew Broderick plays David and his performance is excellent as he portrays a young teen who finds himself caught up in a situation beyond his imagination. Ally Sheedy plays his friend Jennifer, a character who seems a tad bit underdeveloped. It often seems that Jennifer's just along for the ride rather than having any real purpose in the plot. But Sheedy does well with what she has to work with. Our young hero and heroine are very much the focus of the story, at times to detrimental effect. All the adults in the story seem rather one-dimensional. Some of them have very important roles to play in the story yet we never know much of anything about them. Besides David and Jennifer there's really only one other character for whom there is any kind of character development going on and that character doesn't even show up until rather late in the proceedings. But this is a movie which will definitely hold your attention. It's a tense, taut thriller which also has some heart to it. And it often looks spectacular, most notably in the scenes which take place inside the NORAD war room, a movie set which was stunningly impressive for its time and actually would still be stunningly impressive today. All in all WarGames is a well-made, suspenseful, enjoyable film. It has its flaws but it is still a film well worth seeing.",WarGames
65,Stampsfightclub,Funny but unrealistic action drama,6,23 August 2009,"Intelligent teenager David (Broderick) stumbles across a computer programme that challenges him to a war game, only the actions carried out are happening in real life.Nominated for 3 Oscars War Games is an enjoyable, if quite unrealistic action drama with a cool Matthew Broderick in the central role.This begins with a very dull scene setting montage of officers carrying out a routine swift swap before they are commanded to launch missiles.The tension of pressing the launch builds and then the scene is over too quickly for any extra action or pressure. What follows is some boring looking officials looking over the training procedure and using frankly technical and boring dialogue to get the point across. Then we are introduced to the character who gets the film rolling, the character who is, a talking grey machine. One official talks of how implementing this machine into the service would be beneficial for humanity by letting the machine make tough decisions humans are apparently incapable of making. The idea alone is a bit of a stretch and before further development; we cut to the likable Matthew Broderick, who is thankfully on hand to deliver.Arriving late for school and receiving a fail grade on an important test, you may mistake the teenager for Ferris Bueller but on hand for David is his amazing computer knowledge whilst maintaining a wonderful cocky and clever teenage mind. Watching him skilfully look at the passwords under the desk is a highlight, as his stand up in class to protect Ally Sheedy's punishment.When David is on screen there are minimal dull moments as he brings the comedy and drama and when he discovers the Protovision add does the film start to gather some pace.With help from some stereotypical geeks and his beautiful friend Jennifer does he stumble across the military's secret new machine and he is soon involved in a political war game that turns out to be real. The conceptual reality of this ideology is far fetched, but there is no denying the likability factor of the proceedings after David's realization as to what is really happening. His initial attempt to hide the evidence is comic and when he eventually gets picked up by the FBI the film starts to gather some speed as Joshua starts to wind the clock down.There are heavy political issues encoded that generate a sense of purpose and meaning, but are often lost into technical boring dialogue but the reality really hits when we see the Defcon counting down. David's imprisonment is quite humorous and later on when he seeks help from the supposed creator does the film gather real meaning.However the eventual conclusion as to discover the meaning of real life is complete nonsense, lost in technicalities and insignificant timing in context, which practically destroys the meaning of this average, oddly funny action drama",WarGames
66,DarthBill,Matthew Broderick & Ally Sheedy VS The Government,7,23 February 2008,"Lovable high school slacker David Lightman (Matthew Broderick) who is actually a prodigiously gifted computer whiz stumbles into a back door of the US government's computer system and, playing what he believes are games, almost starts World War 3. Pretty soon, he's got the US government after him, thinking he's a spy, with his only immediate comrade being his wholesomely hot would be girlfriend Jennifer Katherine Mack (a much younger Ally Sheedy). They embark on a quest to find the guy who set up the original system (John Wood) in hopes that he can help set everything right and avert the end of the world.For the most part a well crafted thriller that offered an even earlier look than the 1994 film ""THE NET"" at the potential dangers of the all mighty computer and what could be brought for with them if not handled with care. Film suffers from over-length, with only Broderick's hang dog every guy vibe and Sheedy's earthy, wholesome beauty & charm (and leotards) to keep it going.Look for a much younger Michael Madsen in the opening.",WarGames
67,carbuff,An Surprisingly Strong Blast from the Past,9,28 December 2020,"""War Games"" and I are almost perfectly dated in terms of the time it was filmed and the ages of the two young protagonists. I saw it a long, long time ago, but I couldn't remember anymore than it's most basic outline. Sometimes when you re-watch a film you liked seemingly lifetimes ago, it just comes across as stupid and dated, while other times you're amazed at how well it holds up. ""War Games"" is in the latter category.This film also reminds me of how fresh and likeable Matthew Broderick used to be, since like so many other actors, success doesn't really become them in one way or another. Personally it almost always seems to me that an actor's best work is at the beginning of their career before they become a big, bankable name. I suspect that they're just trying harder and are more insecure, feelings that are likely hard to sustain after they've got many millions comfortably stashed away and everyone around them is falling at their feet.Overall, the general concept of this film stands up well, although it has some well-used contrived plot elements. The political and social points about nuclear war that was at the heart of this film are as relevant today as it was when this film was made. ""War Games"" manages to be a decent nail-biter to the end, at least for me, because I found it easy to suspend disbelief when necessary; however, given my natural susceptibility to this particular film, I may have been an easy mark.I just have to return to what struck me most is how stunningly innocent in so many ways life was back then compared to how jaded our society and I myself have become in the meantime. It's not just an illusion or nostalgia or rose-tinted glasses either, as is easily seen if one has enough exposure to kids today. It's just bizarre what the younger generation is completely used to in terms of fame, wealth, extreme sex and violence in entertainment, and so on. But then a fish isn't aware of the water it's swimming in. For this reason alone, I'd recommend this movie to many people. It really was a different world back then, and I kind of miss a lot of it, but I don't think there's anyway back to the better parts of it.",WarGames
68,gab-14712,Films Don't Get More Relevant Than This!,9,16 September 2019,"WarGames is a strange movie. It is clearly stuck in the 1980's, when computers were starting their rise to prevalence and the United States was still deadlocked in the Cold War with the Soviet Union. Yet, in the 2019 world, this film is still strangely relevant (which happens to be a frightening thought). This film is all about using technology to start World War III. Considering the state of our world today, this is the kind of plot that can be realistically plausible. Which is one of the many reasons why this movie is effective. Despite the charms of the 1980's, this film is a scary, but extremely effective thriller. Not only does it work as a thriller, it also works as an effective teen film thanks to the charming performances from Matthew Broderick and Ally Sheedy.When this original idea came to fruition in 1979, technology was not even involved. The whole concept was about ""a dying scientist with no one to understand him, except for one person- a rebellious kid who is too smart for his own good. Writers Walter F. Parkes and Lawrence Lasker were inspired from geniuses such as Stephen Hawking. The technology feature of the screenplay finally began to form when they visited Stanford and learned about NORAD and young computer hackers. This use of technology in the film was very influential. This is the first mass-consumed product that uses computers on such a high-scale and even mentions the Internet. President Reagan and his advisors even watched the film to come up with computer laws and regulations that would follow a year or so later.Enough about reality, let's focus on the meat of the film-the story itself. The United States Air Force decided to change their missile release program from human-based to computer-based. The idea behind this move is because human factor will come into play. There are supporters such as NORAD Chief John McKittrick (Dabney Coleman) and opponents such as Air Force General Beringer (Barry Corbin). The system, War Operation Plan Response, was created by deceased scientist, Stephen Falken (John Wood). Meanwhile, high school student David Lightman (Matthew Broderick) is a computer whiz, but extremely lazy when it comes to academics. He befriends Jennifer (Ally Sheedy), a similarly-unfocused person. David decides to hack into a video game company, and sees an interesting game called Global Thermonuclear War. Little does David know that he hacked into the wrong system and he might have started World War III.Both Matthew Broderick and Ally Sheedy would have a major presence in films during the 1980's, and this film is a huge reason why. Both actors are extremely charming and they excel in terms of chemistry with each other. Sheedy, who already appeared in 1983's Bad Boys, does have to work with an underwritten character-but she makes her character her own and saves it. Broderick is very amusing and makes his characters relatable. After all, wouldn't we all wish that we could hack into our high school's grading system and change our grades? That scene is a very well-done, charming sequence. As for the adult characters, they do come across as dumb sometimes which is odd because they work with such complicated technology that could save or destroy the world. Hmmmmm. Thankfully, Dabney Coleman and John Wood are solid character actors.WarGames is a great film that excels in two genres-techno thriller and coming-of-age. Even though the movie is some thirty-five years after its release date, it still holds a high degree of relevance. Given the hacking of recent elections or the threat of World War III occurring given our world issues, this film certainly can add to these scares. The film was released during the Cold War, so I know Americans were given frightening thoughts after watching this movie. Laugh all you want at the technology in this particular film, but the themes do remain the same. I loved how director John Badham (from Saturday Night Fever fame) created tension using these themes.Thanks to the winning performances of Ally Sheedy and Matthew Broderick, this movie is a thrill to watch. I consider it to be important and relevant in today's world but as a film itself, it is incredibly entertaining. The expertise that was put together to make this film as real as possible is fantastic, thanks to the taut direction of Badham and the excellent screenplay from Lasker/Parkes. Also, the film does have a cool musical score which fits well with the film's nature. Overall, a great recommend!My Grade: A-",WarGames
69,Angry_Arguer,Nuggets of Truth,10,9 July 2003,"WarGames remains the definitive ""hacker"" movie, surpassing the raunch of Swordfish and the idio-parody of AntiTrust.  Historically-speaking, there are two movies that have shaped public opinion about computers: 2001 and WarGames.  With 2001, there is the question of ""What happens when an automated computer system makes decisions on its own?""  In today's world of automatic Windows updates and random error messages for no reason, it seems very prophetic.  WarGames poses the question of ""Who uses the computer and what do they do?""  The consequences, as one can easily guess, are enormous. Even when hardware ages, the ethics remain.WarGames isn't perfect.  There are plenty of logic problems in the script, but it still presents its topic with a naive fascination.  What the writers don't know, they pretend they do.  Matthew Broederick is, once again, the nerdy teen with social problems (Ferris Bueller had a different problem, though).  Aside from Glory, he won't be able to shake that image even now in his 40s.I saw this movie when I was eight and had to admit that if someone didn't understand the 80s ""Red paranoia"", then the whole movie was a misfire.  I will admit, it fascinated me with computers and military hardware, changing my life forever in a subtle fashion.Overall, an interesting movie that becomes more real every year.  In today's world of identity theft, cyber-terrorism, MicroSoft, and broadband, some elements are undoubtedly lost on someone who can't remember or understand the Cold War.  3.5 out of 5 stars",WarGames

71,emm,Temptation is the only way to play this hi-tech thriller.,6,19 May 1999,"Is it a game or is it ""only a movie""? (Keep repeating!) WARGAMES is best classified as a cyber-espionage thriller that surrounds us with paranoia of the Cold War and World War III, tensions that flourished in the 80s. This is a very entertaining film that spawned the whiz-kid craze. Trouble kid Matthew Broderick hardly ever does enough acting, but when it comes down to his expertise of thinking with computers, we finally came and saw a new and talented star in movies who has charisma. The results are downright chilling and near-damaging as expected. Still, it isn't so different enough to have a plot that challenges everyone to save the universe. With its finest addition of high-tech vaporware, the movie has (or had) the appeal, but this display of classic teenage nostalgia only means that even the greatest of trends come and go. Above average 80s fodder.",WarGames
72,bigverybadtom,From Ferris Bueller To Tension Drama,5,11 August 2019,"The movie begins by military people about to launch nuclear missiles-but it turns out to merely be a psychological test. Then the story turns to a high school hacker and his girlfriend, his hacking into the school system to change their poor grades to good ones so they can graduate, and then the boy getting carried away by hacking into other systems-and inadvertently gets into contact with WOPR, a supercomputer in control of US military nuclear ICBM missiles. By the time the boy realizes what he has done, WOPR has started going haywire and the boy is unable to do anything, even after the federal government has found and arrested him. He and his girlfriend escape federal custody, but now what?The movie was not ahead of its time, but of its time; not only because of the Cold War, but because there was great fear of computer hackers as much in the early 1980's as nowadays, just as ships feared submarines during World War One as much as in later decades. Not that the movie was truly realistic; changing grades in a school's computer system would certainly be noticed by the school staff involved, especially by teachers who have all the paperwork showing how their students truly did, and the US military certainly had reason to protect against computer hackers decades before there were such things as home computers. The US military can be stupid, but not THAT stupid.Basically a 1980's period piece, just as ""I Love You, Alice B. Toklas!"" was a period piece for the hippie era.",WarGames
73,caa821,Now an interesting relic,7,18 July 2008,"I enjoyed this film in its earlier days, when I was a lot younger, and when everyone still operated on the basis that there were red buttons and like-colored telephones in Washington and Moscow, the use of which in a Cold War crisis could determine mankind's fate and survival.Viewing it now, with modems inserted with land line, full-size, rotary-dialing telephones, and computer hardware (both at the NORAD setting and in Matthew Broderick's bedroom) about a few hundred times heavier than than employed infinitely more efficiently today - it's analogous to watching John Wayne fire WWII bullets pressing the flight stick button on his aircraft, versus the missile launching supersonic planes today.Given the limitation of even the most advanced equipment a quarter century ago, the way that Dabney Coleman (the computer guru at NORAD), Barry Corbin (the 4-star A.F. general in charge of our nation's defense), and the actor playing the reclusive genius who had created the computer system, were unbelievable, even then, and certainly today.Ambitious civilians and military seniors - like Coleman and Corbin - would in real life undoubtedly often dislike one another, and likely both be self-centered egomaniacs, probably argue a lot and try to upstage each other. But there is no way they would do so in the childish manner scripted in this opus. But it was fun to watch these two gnaw the scenery like a couple of beavers. Dabney has played the smarmy, ego-maniacal, unctuous character as well as anyone in the history of stage or screen; and Barry Corbin, while having often played more likable characters, is a close runner-up in the ""unctuous/smarmy/egocentric"" area.) And the ""Falken"" character might be reclusive and depressed by his view of mankind's likely doom from the weaponry control systems he had helped create. But his diatribe delivered to Broderick and Sheedy, from his remote Oregon island retreat, while obviously meant to be a message of warning to the viewer, was simply banal and ludicrous.Also - again, whether viewed ""then or now"" - the efficiency with which Broderick and Sheedy, individually or together (as a pair of high-schoolers) traveled between their hometown, Colorado, Oregon and back-and-forth) was unbelievable, both in terms of the logistics and monetary costs which would have been involved.The ease with which Broderick extricated himself from military custody at NORAD (as secure as any facility on the planet) was equally unbelievable. And while we have plenty of evidence today that there are a lot of buffoons at the highest level of government - the personnel portrayed at NORAD were all such doophuses that this was beyond credibility.But even in 1983, this was more pure science fiction than a portrayal of possible world holocaust. Its enjoyment then was appropriate only on this basis, rather than as a dire warning to mankind. And today, it's solely a relic of a time past.***Possible spoiler at end***(At the end, where all of the civilians, military leaders - supposedly the absolutely best-informed, most brilliant in their fields, stood around while Broderick pounded on the NORAD keyboard, providing the expertise to avoid nuclear devastation of the entire planet -- this stretched credibility, even at the science-fiction level, beyond any possible belief.)And finally, at the very end, the two high-schoolers and all of the NORAD big shots exchange grins, handshakes and tousle one another's hair. This scene doesn't seem to portray what would occur just after (with seconds to spare) world annihilation had been avoided; it seems more like the reaction a bunch of fraternity and sorority members might exhibit after, say, having won the intramural Ultimate Frisbee tournament.",WarGames

75,Beejerman,CHEER! - (9 stars out of 10),9,4 March 2021,"The stage curtains open ...This is, hands down, one of my favorite 80's movies. It was also the first film that I can remember ever seeing Matthew Broderick in, and by the time ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" rolled around, I was already a fan. We are also treated to an early appearance by Ally Sheedy, who went on to star in some of my other favorite movies from the 80's. When ""WarGames"" came out, I was 15 years old, and a computer geek and gamer just like Broderick's character, David Lightman, was. Of course I loved this movie!With the government implementing control of missile launch centers through a computer at NORAD that they called WOPR (War Operation Plan Response), they became especially concerned when David Lightman, our teenage computer geek, hacks into the system in search of new and exciting games to play. Only, they don't realize it isn't a real threat, and Lightman doesn't realize it is a real government computer. Thinking it is a game, Lightman chooses to be the Russians and begins a missile strike, aimed at key cities in the United States. WOPR begins countermeasures, only for real - leading to the ultimate climax and film's conclusion.As a teen, watching this for the first time, I was completely enamored. I was hooked from the very beginning and glued to the screen until the very end. What a fun movie this was! The special effects for its time, was very good. The characters were all strong and believable. The plot engrossing, and the acting was excellent. I know this wouldn't happen, but what if? What if it did? I think this movie gave us a pretty good portrayal of what could happen, and just how important it is to be secure.I highly recommend this well-made film. I've seen it so many times, I can't even tell you. Even by today's standards, I think a teenager would enjoy watching this movie - even if for some of its nostalgic value.

I was much more of a kid then, too. As an old man, I just re-watched and saw it as a slick but middling production aimed at the rapidly computerizing masses back when hacking still seemed an intriguing novelty, not the constant nuisance it's become.
Scenery-chewing among actors is expected and acceptable to invigorate such am insubstantial, facile premise. A few stand-out moments in particular will hit you with the recognition that a third on a century has passed meantime: the crude, dim, block lettering on plain black screens, of course, but also the vulnerability of pre-digitalized security methods that could so easily be compromised by a paper clip or a credit card. And all those old removable can pop-tops look sharp, when you think how many of them were left lying about among young children back then. If you like Ally Sheedy, then you'll like the way she looks here, some compensation for her being cast in a love-interest straitjacket. which she actually does manage to wriggle about in enough to show some charm, in an otherwise thankless role..

78,DavidSim240183,"""Shall we play a game?""",9,11 May 2007,"That line spoken by Joshua, the defence computer at NORAD never fails to send shivers down my spine. Even though I've seen WarGames 500 times, its a classic line. Just as resonant as Gloria Swanson asking Mr De Mille for her closeup. Or John Candy's heartfelt ""I like me"" speech in Planes, Trains & Automobiles. The difference between Joshua and those people is Joshua is not a real person. Just a computer. But a computer that has a very difficult time distinguishing fantasy from reality. A computer with the same foibles as any flesh and blood person.WarGames was so ahead of its time in so many ways. The way it embraced modems, the use of computer jargon like firewalls. Commonplace things today but practically unheard of back in 1983. Granted some of the technology may have dated (you get to see an actual floppy disk) but the film's message hasn't faded. And nor has its power. They're just as strong as ever.David Lightman (Matthew Broderick) is the classic hi-tech nerd. He's a bright boy. He knows the ins and outs of all the computers. And he hacks into systems with all the skill of a safecracker. But he's an underachiever at school. Hasn't got many friends. And he gets on the wrong side of all the teachers. And his parents.David is far more interested in playing computer games. And when he learns a toy company is planning to release up to date ones in a few months, he wants the inside story. So he hacks into systems until he finds the right one. And he finds one alright. But not the system he thinks.When he taps into Joshua, David gets the chance to play Global ThermoNuclear War. And accidentally sets in motion the countdown to World War III.There is something almost blackly humorous to the way WarGames' screenplay turns. How through one innocent little action, David begins a chain reaction of increasingly dire circumstances. Although WarGames never gets as black as Dr Strangelove, its very effective in its first half, as the different steps David takes get more and more unnerving. Its all summed up perfectly at the halfway point with another classic line from Joshua, WarGames' answer to Hal 9000. When asked if Global ThermoNuclear War is a game or not, Joshua innocently replies ""What's the difference?""It does tend to get a bit bogged down in the second half with a lot of ethical debates over the futility of nuclear war. But that doesn't change the fact that WarGames has got an exceptional cast. Even at the start of his career, and only 21 at the time, Matthew Broderick gives an assured performance. And modulates his character accordingly when David gets in over his head.Ally Sheedy is sometimes a difficult actress to tune in to, but she gives Jennifer, David's only real friend a lot of life and spunk. John Wood is suitably flaky as Joshua's creator, Dabney Coleman perfectly obnoxious as the head of the computers David's messed with, and Barry Corbin's general more than just a one-dimensional caricature. Which would have been a lot easier to play.I didn't always buy into the technical somersaults that WarGames comes out with. David's method of escaping from NORAD is something that just doesn't ring true. And you have to suspend disbelief a little too much. All they're seeing on those big screens is false. And no one puts it together. But there is something frightening about the film's conceit all the same.The line that separates reality from fantasy becomes blurred. And when the subject in question is nuclear war, who wouldn't be carried along with that? It all works on the level of a paranoid nightmare that just keeps on going and refuses to stop.The final scenes though are quite philosophical. And again its Joshua who provides that unrelenting, implacable logic. Only this time tempered with common sense. WarGames is filled with many great characters, but its Joshua who is the film's heart. That final line at the end is a statement of such striking intelligence, its almost scary:""A strange game. The only winning move is not to play.""",WarGames
79,akcenat,A juvenile sci-fi adventure with many flaws,6,20 January 2021,"Movie starts very well, with a memorably tense scene featuring almost unrecognisably young Michael Madsen, but it is finishing with the use of 'Tic Tac Toe' which is juvenile, a bit infantile and simplistic (I get the point, but it's a bit corny). Basically, tech thrillers can so rapidly become dated and that is the main problem of ""WarGames"". Amusing as a document of its time, even though several characters are a bit too stupid to be believed while NORAD looks like a Bond villain's lair. Movie, also, repeatedly falls into cliché and it looks admittedly dated/unrealistic in 2021. It's a shame that film never really gets past the level of being just a good idea. With its longer runtime (114 minutes) film is perhaps more than this storyline can comfortably bear. In the end, film will probably resonate more with someone of 1970's generation, while modern audience may not get that same feeling.Ratung: 6-/5+",WarGames

A glitch in a computer security system allows a brilliant but erratic high school student to accidentally cause the military's war computer to begin a game which the military sees as real. Because of human errors in previous game scenarios, the human element was removed from the system and the computer given complete control. The mistakes begin to compound from there as the FBI decide that 16 year old David Lightman is a soviet agent. Meanwhile the command at NORAD is preparing for an inbound soviet missile attack that could come at any moment. Matthew Broderickis excellent in an all star cast including Dabney Coleman, Ally Sheedy, Barry Corbin and John Woods with direction by John Badham. An excellent film all round.",WarGames
83,TheHoodOfSwords,Fun Blast From The Past,7,15 May 2020,"I had seen so many clips of this movie but I couldn't ever find a copy anywhere. Until I finally found a copy on Amazon. I ordered it last year and saw it a few days after I got it. However, when making my watchlist this movie cropped up so I knew I had to put it on there. I finally got around to watching it again and my thoughts haven't really changed a whole lot. I like it, I enjoy the moral questions it asks about war and if anything is even worth fighting for. I'm making it out to seem like this film is super pessimistic but it's actually the opposite. It's pretty uplifting by the end of it. All this talk about 80's nostalgia makes me want to watch Space Camp. I obviously didn't grow up with the tech they show in the film, but there's still something about it that feels nostalgic and fun.",WarGames

Always on edge about when the other side was gonna come at us. Almost 30 years later it still does it to me.Watching this again recently and noticing one thing that I didn't as a kid...the ""anti-Nuclear"" subtext throughout the entire film. Reading the back story on this film and real life character it was based on, you'll see that most of what was in this film really happened except the one thing, the nuclear war almost happened stuff. This was just a Hollywood device to lure you into a ""No nukes"" mentality when you finish the end of the film. I really don't put too much seriousness into that aspect but for what it is, this film still feels the same to me as it did back then....very scary in thought only...but hopefully not in reality.",WarGames
85,jamesjustice-92,The only winning move is not to watch the movie,7,21 December 2018,"WarGames is a product of its time. Back in the 80s when there was a menace of a nuclear war between the two biggest countries in the world it was relevant. And still is. We are being taught that since day one: don't play with fire, you are going to burn your fingers. The end result of having lots of weaponry is the same, only much more fingers are in danger. That's what makes this movie a skippable one.
It's nothing extraordinary there, nothing that can shake your vision or change your way of thinking because we all already know the moral of the story.
Matthew Broderick gives a fine performance though. His realization that the world might be coming to an end any minute and his starting to regret all the things he wanted to do or hadn't done is priceless. Live in a moment, don't wait for too long before it's too late; that's the things you could have taken out of the movie but the thing is - we already know them too.
I enjoyed this movie. But sadly not as much as I could have enjoyed it if I didn't know the outcome from the very beginning.",WarGames
86,antagonist117,"""WarGames"" has every reason to be a dated 80s curiosity, but defies time and remains good entertainment today",8,20 September 2014,"""WarGames"" is so much more fun than it has a right to be. Being a 1983 movie that trades heavily in technical jargon and low-res computer readouts, it should feel hopelessly dated; it doesn't. As a movie that makes plucky teens its heroes, it should feel juvenile and frivolous; it doesn't. Since its plot is an explicit reaction to Cold War tensions, it should come across as heavy-handed and moralizing; it doesn't. Good acting, writing, and directing—the basics of movie-making—conspire to avoid these pitfalls, seemingly almost in spite of themselves.Matthew Broderick and Ally Sheedy were two of the most successful teen stars of the 80s for a reason. They look and talk like the kids next door. In this movie, both of their characters would be artificially, almost eerily normal, the Hollywood version of ""average"" kids, except that they're both just a little bit ""off"" in ways that aren't necessarily intended but are nevertheless endearing and refreshing. Broderick, probably by nature rather than decision, underplays everything even in the face of nuclear Armageddon, and this works because it keeps the tone light. Another way to balance the apocalyptic plot that places tens of millions of lives on the line would have been to make the acting comically over-the-top, but this would not have been as relatable and would quickly have become tiresome. As for Sheedy's character, she could easily have been just another movie girlfriend relegated to the sidelines, but the script adds idiosyncrasies and Sheedy brings a playfulness that keeps her sharing the spotlight for most of the film. She rides a motorcycle on which Broderick's character rides behind her, a fact that goes rightly unremarked in the movie but which I think deserves approbation from commenters, and she has a charismatic way of sauntering freely into places she isn't expected.The set design has the visual appeal of a Bond movie, with a huge, flashy command center, an underground bunker, and an antagonist's plush island retreat. The camera has lots of room to play among these sets, but the scenes in Broderick's prosaic classroom, closet-sized school office, and cluttered bedroom look small and cramped. His escape from them into the wider, more dangerous world of high-stakes espionage therefore feels like breaking free, and it is a journey we want to go on instead of nitpicking the nonsense of it all. The script gets away with a lot of loose logic because it moves so fast and keeps introducing new twists. Instead of just explaining himself to the authorities (who are doubly stupid here: they have the stupidity of military brass in an anti-war movie and the stupidity of adults in a teen movie), Broderick goes it alone. When the military is told they're playing a game, they persist in thinking it's real, and when Broderick is told early on that his ""game"" is ""definitely military"" software, he promptly ""plays"" it anyway. But the movie knows what it's doing, even if the characters don't, and makes a point of the lack of distinction between games and reality for the computers that we program to manage both. It sounds like a sci-fi premise, but in a rarity for sci-fi and ""hacker"" movies, the script gets a lot of the technical language right. Like, for example, the concept of ""computer learning,"" which in the movie and often in real life is explored through games of tic-tac- toe.Though in many ways a relic of the '80s, ""WarGames""'s smart decisions keep it entertaining for more than just the nostalgic.",WarGames

Combine that with many of my favorite arcade games... :D Then you get the Government on the other side, with their whole stereotype perfectly betrayed.The kid, who manages to get involved with the Government, tries his best to fix the mistakes he made. I love the spy feel that he has, as well as the discoveries and the computers.

88,David_Frames,This didn't come from Protovision...,8,12 June 2005,"Quite possibly Badham's best work. That's right, even better than Ingognito, ever slicker than Bird on a Wire - I know, you're not convinced, reading that sentence back I'M not convinced but Wargames is a throughly enjoyable celebration of Neclear War and deserves your sincere admiration. Wargames has always been a favourite of mine. As a proto-adult I got my first viewing in a Cornish holiday camp when this movie was being played on their internal video system along with a thriller called Cloak and Dagger. Cloak...wasn't very good but Wargames had and indeed has something - it provoked childhood fantasies of being able to look at things that were really rather secret and important using your ZX Spectrum 48k but no matter how much you banged those rubber keys you never could get anyone to offer you a nice game of chess. Most small boys, as Gary Glitter once observed, are enamoured by computers and the Games tapped into that at a time when the emerging home computer market was prepping a generation for the internet and the game playing possibilities it would allow, though many of us would be swapping missiles for breasts by that stage. Yes, this is a smart, cleverly written anti-war movie in which likable characters meet serious hardware and for a brief moment we all get to be Matthew Broderick and actually like the experience. He's a genial hero, a bit wet behind the ears and a wee bit of an underachiever which is good for the purposes of identification with this particular strand of the audience. Good support too from the ever reliable Dabney Coleman, the underrated John Wood as the wide eyed Professor Falken and Barry Corbin who as the put upon General Beringer almost steals the show. You'll say the technology has dated and you'd be right OBVIOUSLY but that million dollar NORAD set still looks like a mill-, well you know and I loved reading on this site that the real thing wasn't as sophisticated in appearance. Who'd have thought it? The only winning move is not to play? Not a bit of it, you should play this one immediately.",WarGames

Sure there are some issues with the plot including the what I usually hate where everything could be solved if they just listened to the main character but it was still entertaining nonetheless. The tech doesn't hold up in this movie or the way things are done, but other than that this is an entertaining film that will keep you in your seat throughout.",WarGames

91,chvylvr80,Great 80's movie and great cold war thriller,8,15 October 2003,"Ah Wargames. Wargames rules if you didn't know that already. I know that Joshua (the computer) is outdated by today's standards and David (Matthew Brodrick) never would have broken into NORAD but it's still the best hacker movie made and one of the best cold war thrillers. Now I was only 7 when this movie came out so I didn't understand the finer elements of the story and just thought that Joshua had a cool voice. As I got older though it all started to come together.Matthew Brodrick should have stopped acting after 1990 because he will always be the 80's teen star and hasn't done anything really good since Ferris Bueller. The same can go for Ally Sheedy. I mean really, did anyone need to see her after Short Circuit? The story rises above our youthful stars though and makes Wargames the classic that it is. There really is a sense of menace that World War III might actually start and that it might just be all David's fault. This should serve as a reminder to never play Global Thermonuclear War when your computer has tapped into the national defense network.
The NORAD sets are pretty damn cool and they manage to look quite authentic. The soundtrack also must be given special attention just because it has that special 80's flavor and they even made it electronic sounding for the movie. In the beginning you can find a young Michael Madsen in one of his first roles. Maybe even the first I'm not sure.Bottom Line: Wargames is a quality film that will take older moviegoers back to their childhood or young adulthood and will make younger viewers think ""they had computers back then?!""

95,metalrox_2000,Ahead of it's time,10,18 June 2005,"Wargames was a movie that was way ahead of its time. No one was making films about hacking into computer systems. The only computers used in movies were on space ships. No home computer has ever really been brought to the big screen. Wargames broke from the normal studio sci fi norm of either Earth being visited by aliens (E.T) or battles of Good and Evil in space (Star Wars, Star Trek). With the raise in hacker crime rate now, and seeing how Dependant we've become on computers, Wargames was a movie with it the eye on the future. Imaginative story, great cast (who, despite other reviews, do not phone it in) Wargames is a true gem, as it was recently listed by AFI as one of the top 100 sci fi movies of all time. Broderick was perfect as a slacker teen, and Ally Sheedy turns in one of her best performance, making the most of an under developed character. Dabney Coleman showed why he was one of the busiest actors in the 1980's (though he always better cast as a villain), and Barry Corbin could play almost anything convincingly. while the special effects may be dated by todays standard, Wargames helped shape the way people think and speak. Backdoors, hacking, were not common terms like they are today. Without a doubt, much in agreement with AFI, Wargames remains one of the most important films ever made.",WarGames
96,trevorwomble,A top notch classic from the 80s,8,12 December 2019,"A great cast, original story and (then) state of the art special effects make this exhilarating and intelligent family friendly thriller one of the most thought provoking films to come out of 1980s Hollywood.The plot concerns a teenage high school student accidentally hacks into a Nato supercomputer whilst looking for the latest video games he inadvertently triggers a countdown to WW3. However only himself, his girlfriend and a retired computer genius who designed the Nato computer believe the danger is real so the race is on to avert global nuclear war.This film had a chequered history getting to the screen (John Lennon was briefly attached to the project as far back as 1980) but it was worth the effort as this thriller /action /black comedy shows. Advances in home computer technology in those few short years really made this film resonate with an early computer generation who could see enough in it to engage with the story, for by this time many schools had started teaching computer science and early affordable home computers had just hit the market resulting in a technology boom.Both Matthew Broderick and Ally Sheedy are incredibly likeable, which helps, theiir nervous energy and naive charm making them relatable to audiences. However the cast in general all adds to the watchability of this intelligently written film and the nail biting ending is so taut you can see why it is so fondly remembered.Whilst some aspects of the film have inevitably dated, this is still a relatable film that packs a punch. A stone cold classic from the pre CGI days of Hollywood and should be on everyone's movie bucket list.",WarGames

The acting is only average, certainly not helped by odd dialogue and an illogical, somewhat hole ridden plot. The emotional depth is mostly negligible and character development is largely weak, especially seen in Broderick's character, whose tech-wiz persona feels forced at times. The storyline simply feels scripted, not living in actuality with how certain events would occur. Fear of another missile crisis does create an exciting plotline, yet the idea is overshadowed by the ridiculousness exhibited. The conclusion is particularly unconvincing and highly cringeworthy.

101,charlessmith702210,"Like ""The Day After"", but focuses on a computerized Armageddon",9,24 August 2007,"The movie has some of the things predicted in ""The Day After"", but it focuses on the computer side of what would happen if we were faced with a full-fledged nuclear war.There is Matthew Broderick, who plays Mr. Lightman, who loves to break the computer security codes, and is a high school semi-dropout, who teams up with Ally Sheedy, or Jennifer, to break into Protovision computer games. Through that, they find files on Stephen Falken, who was into computer games, and both execute a printout of his games. The first part of the printout was strategy games everyone plays, like chess; the other part was games reserved only for the military, such as global thermonuclear war. As both of them decide to play the nuclear war game, they go into a maze of problems. One of the problems was that Stephen Falken decided to play dead because he did not want the public to know that he was into mainly military computer games. Both do find Stephen Falken's home and almost get arrested for trespassing, but Mr. Lightman reveals his password and Stephen surrenders. But WarGames is not just about Stephen Falken. You hear all the tension about the word Defcon. Defcon 1 means were are in deep trouble; Defcon 5 means were are not at war.And you hear a lot of abbreviations in the movie. Here is a few of them.You hear a lot about the word ""SAC"". This means Strategic Air Command. Then there is that supercomputer that almost runs the whole movie--the WOPR--War Operations Plan Reponse. This monster computer would plan a series of simulated nuclear war games between the Soviets and the United States in a way no other computer could match.Defcon 2 is reached when two ""ghost bombers"" invade the Alaskan air space. NORAD detects that the planes are Soviet bombers which may fire nuclear missiles at the Northwestern United States. But soon, the enemy radar blips are gone....they were actually false radar images.As Defcon 1 is reached as Russian missiles and submarines start their first strike against the United States, a whole new world begins. World War III starts, and the NORAD system gets ready for nuclear war by closing off ventilation shafts and knocking out external power to its facility. Falken, Mr. Lightman and his girlfriend make it to the NORAD facility just in time before the NORAD main gate closes.A big relief came when word came that the missiles did not have any impact when the impact circles lighted up the NORAD computers. As the commander says ""Recall all the bombers!...Stand down the missiles!"" another problem came. A big one.The WOPR knocked out the password files for everything in NORAD, including Stephen Falken's password, because the launch code was frozen and all changes were locked out. Mr. Lightman was able to get to one of Falken's games, Tic-Tac-Toe, to break through the blocked system, and then let the game play itself. All of that led to the first loop when Falken's tic-tac-toe program speeded up as the launch code was finally done, and the second loop came when Falken's Global Thermonuclear War program learned itself! When that second loop got exhausted, Falken's computer program reached futility, and we realized that his password, Joshua, decided that there cannot be a winner in the nuclear war...which ended the nuclear threat after all and peace came back to the United States.But how can a computer start a nuclear war? This is almost like the explanation of the computer, Skynet, in ""Terminator 2"".",WarGames

Not to mention those horrific images on the NORAD screen of the bombs going off and those large white circles replacing cities, signifying that they have been nuked.

Ally Sheedy is effective as his would be girlfriend unwittingly along for the ride. But its really the supporting players that have the best roles in this film. Dabney Coleman and Barry Corbin wonderfully spar off one another as the Computer specialist and the skeptical General. However John Wood, as Steven Falcon, steals the show. Every time he speaks it is so insightful and intelligent you find yourself captivated. I loved his analogy of comparing nuclear war with playing Tic-Tac-Toe. To quote him. ""There is no way to win. The game itself is pointless."" Sheer Brilliance. He also delivers a great line to the General at NORAD.""Do you really believe that the enemy would attack without provocation? Using so many missiles, bombers, and subs that we would have no choice but to totally annihilate them?"". The man is so deep!

105,Vivkon,Tribute to Human Nature,10,27 September 2018,"This movie plays with the real threat of that time - nuclear war. Nuclear war warnings were dependent on artificial Intelligence, because people believed in the omnipotent computer ""Joshua."" A regular gamer starts a simulation game with potentially real outcomes. Those outcomes depend on machine learning algorithms. People teach the machine not to kill people, because, ""The only winning move is not to play."" It sounds similar to a familiar quote: ""There won't be any winners in a nuclear war."" The general frame of this movie is based on the 'combinatorial thinking' of one computer which is practicing in adaptive learning of games outcomes. It suggests that the machine with its computational ability cannot think outside the box. Here is a case where humans are best in the peacemaking process. The film ""WarGames"" shows the limits of computers: they cannot generate emotions. They can only recognize them. They cannot produce common sense. They just storage the pattern of 'common sense,' reflected in algorithms. In this movie we see a big demarcation line between the computer based and human decision making process. And so far, the computer is still based on only electrical interactions, while the human brain works on biochemical-electrical interactions, an absolutely different principle.

It's not a bad idea, and we do need to keep in mind that it was made in 1983. The music didn't help this movie at all. It was cliche and not hardly thrilling. Also, I can believe a computer being programmed to say things but 'Joshua' had a mind of it's own. He responded to questions he was probably not programmed to be asked.

I also quite liked the talking computer as well that WOPOR Computer was very huge and powerful and very noisy I also liked Melvin ""Mr.Potatoe head ""as Jim called him. mind you Melvin was right when he said you must play every game on the list, starting with falken's Maze so Melvin was not as daft as he looks was he? I also liked it when David's father called him down to fasten the lid on the garbage cans. all in all a good film I must now add this, I did not like it when Jenny Mack rode her moped without any head protection, I have just seen it on ITV 1 recently, and I still like this film, this film makes you think about being carefull on your P.C. I am always carefull with my P.C. So not to hack into any websites!",WarGames
111,k844140,Pleasant teenage movie from the 80's,8,24 July 2021,"WarGames is a very good teen movie from the 80's, which unlike others doesn't tell how they like to get laid with the first attractive person they see, or about anything typical for films of this kind. It tells us an original and interesting story which is still surprising in 2021. It is not a revelation in movie industry, but still a very good example. The film tells us about uselessness of war and combines it with a story about two high school students. You shouldn't expect a serious drama though, which some critics did. They tell ""The more seriously the movie takes itself the sillier it gets"", but don't listen to them. This film is light and pleasant, though it has some thrilling moments. It doesn't take itself too seriously. WarGames is straight and comprehensible movie which only tells about serious things, but doesn't become too serious itself. Apart from original story and topics represented in this movie, I liked the actors, especially young ones. They look lovely together and play well enough for a teen movie. So if you don't have wrong expectations, I think you'll like WarGames. It really worth watching.",WarGames
112,FloodClearwater,Like Finnegan's Wake (For Some of Us),8,1 September 2015,"For Generation X, Matthew Broderick is the eternal James Joyce character of American film. Ferris Bueller's Day Off is, obviously, our Ulysses. In this same regard, WarGames is our equivalent of Finnegan's Wake, a caged meditation on the riverine forms of time and reality which flings the audience through fantastic voyages of understanding only to deposit them back at their starting point, not mildly discomfited.One of the simple joys of this movie is watching John Wood as Falken, the cloistered computer science genius who develops JOSHUA, the artificial intelligence software at the heart of the plot. Wood's Falken is endlessly interesting to watch as the understated guru the protagonist journeys to seek enlightenment from. Wood was a lifelong Shakespearean when he signed on to the film, and his presence is judiciously carmelizing to the story and the rest of the troupe. Dabney Coleman gives a supple performance as McKittrick. McK is an is-he or isn't-he near-villain, a character with a point of view presaging everything officially sticky and tricky about the ends- means world of drones, waterboarding, and extraordinary rendition we find ourselves in.Ally Sheedy is elliptically interesting to follow as the protag's buddy Jennifer. Barry Corbin is perfectly cast as the blustering NORAD general, Beringer, an anti-Falken and the personification of why AI might be a tool worth having.Which brings us to Broderick himself, playing the lead role of David Lightman. Broderick's invention of his character goes beyond the 'Playbill' conception of him; a young, bored, 'but brilliant' computer hacker. As brought on screen by Broderick, David is both naive and worldly, baffled and mesmeric, Quixotic and cautious, in other words, he is a 360 degree person, spun and sewn by the sheer chi of Broderick's actorly brio (and also restraint). In this way, for American movie- going children of a certain vintage, Broderick's portrayal of David Lightman is every bit as canonical to the patina of generational and nationalistic shared-identity as his Ferris Bueller would be.A final celluloid bontemp WarGames delivers is the tiny, early-on role played by an undiscovered Michael Madsen as a junior NORAD launch officer. ""Turn your key, sir!"" And we watch and hope those keys don't turn, so that Matthew Broderick, JOSHUA, and the the rest can race disaster down the full lengths of the necessity of human prudence before depositing us back to the place we start their frantic meditation at, a blank, darkened screen with a waiting cursor.",WarGames

118,xenazues,Another case of an 80's director finding young talent and getting lucky,9,24 January 2017,"I was going to give this an 8. But then I just watched it again and I have to give it a 9. Would have gave it a 10 but there was some parts in the movie which even for the 80's could have had some better graphics. I have the blu ray version. And I just had to have this in my blu ray collection. So I will start off by saying I saw another reviewers comments about ""made stars out of ally Sheedy and Mathew Brodrick"" That could possibly be true but they were going to be stars either way. The director just lucked up and got them on his film. Ally Sheedy is beautiful and frankly remains in a category in the 80's with very few actresses of her time. Lea Thompson and Kim Catrall are the only two I can think of in her generation. 3 women that really made you feel like ""i want a crazy good looking girlfriend like that"". No matter what they played in. Ally was brilliant in this. Her character was not well defined. Her parts were not there. She played the most of them to be honest. Even the part where David changes her grade she even sells that. The part where she jogs up to his house, pets the dog. Everything she does makes you see it and say ""wow wish my girlfriend was like that in high school"". The writers of the movie didn't give her much to work with but facial expression and tone just make you fall in love with her. If she wasn't in the movie, forget about it, nobody would have seen it. Mathew's character was different. This is still a new ground and simply only character like this. He hacked in a government computer and was actually scared about it. But honestly had the know how to ask questions and thought he was innocent. But still didn't come off as arrogant. Most people who do those kind of things now don't think they will be caught. As a matter of fact it was his girlfriend who seemed more confident. Even the part about swimming she was like ""now who grows up in seattle and doesn't know how to swim"". Once again his character show humility. And there a shot of some great actors in this movie. Michael Madsen is in this movie and hes young. And hes no slouch at acting. As well as the general in this movie. I have a game called command and conquer and he is back at again playing a general in that short game series. He fits that part to the T. Now thats just for the acting but what this movie did for the generation was amazing to say the least. The term hacker was never even heard of. Back door? What is that? Heck in those dos system if you didn't have the password most people gave up. And nowadays people give up if their internet connection isn't working. Look at all the stuff he had to do to even get his computer to read other computers? Yeah simply crazy. This movie was definitely ahead of its time. First time the words firewall was used and judging by how people are so loose with security nowadays on their own computers I'm not sure if they still know what a firewall is. Hackers even today love this movie and its known by all. You mention this movie to a movie both and you get instant quotes about Joshua and so on. If you are wondering if you should watch this movie, then wonder no more. Its a must watch to be part of a generation. If you wondering what this movie is about just watch it. Personally I gave this a 9 but I loved ally in short circuit more cause her part was major and personally I loved Mathew in ferris Beullers day off. But this right here was great when both of them were in the same movie with a much better and original plot. One thing I miss about the 80's they had some original plots.",WarGames

120,thomas196x2000,It is interesting to watch the test of time here...,5,31 August 2021,"I saw this movie when it came out. I was a computer salesman at a computer store, and a guy I worked with was a slightly uglier version of Matthew Broderick and was a total whiz kid as well. He could have been his stand in, and likely given technical assistance to the film. So there was that point, and I did like the premise. I remember finding it mildly entertaining, and of course I liked ""the line"" about playing the game at the end.But, I just watched this again last night, or should I say, tried to.First, the David character is a dick. He is through the entire movie. We are supposed to root for him, but his hacking is causing a total disaster to start. And he never pays for it. He's a cheat in school, and he insults his well-meaning teacher for no reason.His parents are portrayed as disconnected fools...while their son is trying to scam companies out of their latest innovations by hacking into their systems, dad take 20 minutes to get the butter on his corn and mom is even more oblivious.There's supposed to be some sort of romance with the Ally Sheedy character, but she bounces around almost identically to the big mangy dog she likes to play with. I am surprised she didn't lick David upon seeing him.Then there is the parade of geeks and idiot government hacks. Of course, the main military guy is a fat blowhard. Did we miss any other stereotypes?Now watching over 30 years later!!!! I had to turn the thing off in the first hour, it was enough.

I always wondered why, if it is so great, I had never seen it. Well, tonight I took the time to 1) investigate it and 2) watch it. Seems it was a mystery to me because it was released the month I graduated from med school! I was busy preparing for both graduation and the onset of the dreaded internship. Over the subsequent years though, the title ""War Games"" came up again and again in media reviews and commentary as well as among my friends. I needed to see it and finally I have. It was well worth the wait. Only minimally dated by technology, the concepts are still entirely relevant. Acting, direction and plot are top shelf. The score is nothing special. Fascinating to see stars Matthew Broderick and Ally Sheedy so young and fresh, free of the Hollywood expectations of stardom. I wish I had watched it sooner.",WarGames

Enjoyable fun for kids.",WarGames
124,Aldri7,Vintage Broderick and more,7,18 August 2008,"War Games came along during a time (1983) when concerns over nuclear annihilation were very real and filled our newspapers daily. If you are not old enough to remember that era, though - don't worry. Like ""The China Syndrome"" (1979), War Games is not just a topical thriller, but an educational and entertaining drama as well. Is it dated now? Of course it is! What movie featuring computer technology is NOT dated within five years? 1983 was 25 years ago, which means its now older than your average film-goer. Plus, the cold war ended almost 20 years ago. But despite all this, War Games is still fun, and Mathew Broderick will forever be 18 in my mind thanks to this film and ""Ferris Bueler's Day Off"".OK, Mathew Broderick is David Lightman, a talented but alienated high school student from Seattle. His parents are middle class nobodies. His biology teacher delights in tormenting slackers like him and friend Jennifer Mack (Aly Sheedy). Luckily for David, though, the personal computer industry is just in its infancy, and so he is more than happy to barricade himself in his bedroom for long hours to tinker with his hi tech toys. Its the perfect escape, and also the perfect place to hatch a little mischief. David is really just a classic hacker, destined perhaps to become a scientist or researcher someday. But his activities, which begin in all innocence, soon raise the ire of the button down types in the War Planning Room at NORAD. Just what exactly does David do? How about inadvertently place the world on the brink of World War III, all from the comfort of his cozy bedroom? Its a little dizzying to contemplate, but such is the nature of David's precocious talent that suddenly puts him at the center of an international incident and manhunt.Soon, the action shifts to NORAD headquarters in Colorado. From the onset, NORAD appears to be run by a tin horn dictator and his feuding malcontents, but thats just Hollywood. Anyway, it amuses me that the least technical employee at NORAD is the General that runs it. Anyway, tensions surface immediately, then mount as David's mischief hatched in far away Seattle becomes apparent. And then once David himself becomes aware of what he has done, the movie really shifts into high gear. David is in trouble now, and friend Jennifer, who is about as cute as a high schooler can be, can only dish out the wisdom of a 16 year old (""just act natural and everything will be OK""). But how much trouble is David REALLY in? Did I mention that the Global Thermonuclear War game he started at NORAD, which NORAD cannot determine is real or imagined, can't be stopped until it reaches its monstrous conclusion? Such is the predicament that everyone now faces, and which fuels the tension that will grip the movie until its climax.Anyway, all of this is good storytelling up until this point. The logic and reasoning used by David and his cohorts to hack the WOPR computer at NORAD is inventive. Meanwhile, we also get a decent look inside a shadowy defense agency, and are introduced to Professer Falken and his nemesis, Dr. John McKittrick (Dabney Coleman). I enjoyed the contrasts between these two characters and the way that they embodied the hawk vs dove debate that one is asked to ponder throughout the film. How futile is Global Thermonuclear War? How sad is it that so many devoted their entire lives to contemplating or planning for this catastrophe? Professer Falken, who's JOSHUA program caused all the misery at NORAD to begin with, shares his thoughts on the matter before deciding whether or not to help David end the trouble that he began. And as for the ending - well, its quite good and a well conceived climax to the film.Through it all, War Games entertains, and treats us to some memorable characters. Broderick here is great as the precocious slacker we all have come to know and love. At times he crosses over into being arrogant and insulting though, like when he fails to show the proper deference towards the brilliant Falken. Dabney Coleman, John Wood and Alley Sheedy are also very good. High schooler Alley is wonderfully naive in a stubborn and demanding sort of way. Her innocence was well conceived and a nice contrast to the ultra seriousness of the defense establishment higher ups she and David do battle with throughout the film. There were a few curious plot inconsistencies, though- one in particular that occurred early on. For example, when it first surfaced at NORAD that WOPR had been compromised, the error was attributed to a phone company slip up. Yet soon after, David is accused of working with spies on the outside to purposely hack the WOPR. This is clearly inconsistent, as a phone company slip up should absolves David of any premeditated wrong doing.Halfway thru the film, the action shifts to an idyllic island retreat off of the coast of Oregon and introduces us to some unexpectedly relaxing and peaceful music. I loved this scene, and it brought a wonderful breath of fresh air (literally) to a movie that up until that point had all been technical or military related. The contrast here was no accident I am sure, and the peace and harmony represented by that island resurfaced again when the same tune was used to close the film. It was as if to say ""all's well that ends well; peace was preserved in the end"" I think that this brought a lot of depth to the film and was genuinely touching. The harmonica to me was meant to symbolize the peacefulness of the old west, or of ""Marlboro Country"". And it also served to highlight the contrast between the peaceful Falken and those that ran NORAD.Two thumbs up for War Games.",WarGames
125,wwefreakjon,This One Came Right on Time,10,25 June 2009,"I recently reviewed The American President and said that it was the right movie at the wrong time. Well unlike TAM, the movie War Games came out right when it was needed. Smack dab in the middle of the cold war. In 1983 John Badham's movie War Games was released. It tells the story of a slacker/computer genius high school student who almost causes world war three.In the middle of the highest state of tension in the Cold War the US military performs a fake nuclear launch simulation to see if the men in the missile silos are up to the job. When it is determined that they are not, Dr John Mckitrick comes forth with a revolutionary idea. Put the missiles into the control of a single computer (WOPR) that has already fought WW3 time and time again in a series of war games. They will retain control but it takes the human element out of the situation.In Seattle, David Lightman (Mathew Broderick), computer hacker extraordinaire is trying to find the computer system of a computer game company in California through a phone line. On his trek through digital space he comes across an unidentifiable system. Eventually he finds games on the system, not the games he was looking for but games none the less. When he finds his way into the system he begins a game of ""Global Thermonuclear War: with the computer. When he hears about a potential Russian missile threat on the news, he and Jennifer (the girl he was with playing the games) think that the games he was playing with the computer caused a real reaction. Things really get tight when the FBI comes and picks David up because of his little game.The writing in this film is some of the best you will find. Not only are there the great witty dramatic scenes but there is some excellent humor in it as well. Many people must have been surprised with the choice of Broderick in a serious role. Well to put it bluntly he did a spectacular job with the role. The other great roles in the movie were John Wood playing the enigmatic Dr Stephen Falken and Barry Corbin playing General Beringer.This film is one of my personal favorites and that is because of these two lines.Once upon a time, there lived a magnificent race of animals that dominated the world through age after age. They ran, they swam, and they fought and they flew, until suddenly, quite recently, they disappeared. Nature just gave up and started again. We weren't even apes then. We were just these smart little rodents hiding in the rocks. And when we go, nature will start over. With the bees, probably. Nature knows when to give up, David.and General, do you really believe that the enemy would attack without provocation, using so many missiles, bombers, and subs so that we would have no choice but to totally annihilate them?  General, you are listening to a machine! Do the world a favor and don't act like one.Those two lines show two things; 1, that as Dr Ian Malcolm said, ""Life will find a way,"" and two that the chances of sane people starting world war three are lower than the chances of the Stanley Cup being marched down Main St. We live in a world where we have multiple super powers who all know that the other superpowers have the same ability to blow each other to smithereens. No sane person will launch a full scale missile attack when their opponents can completely annihilate them.Those two lessons plus the great acting, writing, and directing make this the great film it is. A final thought, there is a great quote from the WOPR computer near the end of the film about nuclear war, ""A strange game. The only winning move is not to play."" Think about it. I give the movie 9.6 out of ten.",WarGames

It is interesting to note that the movie makers were not allowed into this facility to make this movie yet, it looks strangely real. Barry Corbin was perfect as General Jack Berenger. This movie really makes you think how easily a hacker can get into anyone's computer system.

130,William_E_Hunter,Fun film from the early days of computer hacking,9,19 August 1998,"WarGames, a sort of Dr. Strangelove for the Pac-Man generation, has been one of my favorite films since I first saw it at the theatre 15 years ago, not the least of reasons being that it was a movie way ahead of its time. Back when a modem was far from the standard computer component it is today, WarGames delves headlong into hacker culture, personified by the wily but naive ubergeek David Lightman, wonderfully played by an impossibly young Matthew Broderick. While trying to hack into a new computer games company, Lightman accidentally infiltrates the computers at NORAD and brings the world to the brink of nuclear war. With the government out to get him, Lightman must undo what he has unleashed before the missiles start flying. Broderick and a relentlessly perky Ally Sheedy deliver two great unaffected performances, surrounded by a rogue's gallery of supporting adults such as Dabney Coleman in full jerk mode as NORAD systems specialist John McKittrick, and Northern Exposure's Barry Corbin as the corn pone euphemism-prone General Beringer. Another must-mention performance comes from English actor John Wood, who's elusive Professor Stephen Falken speaks of the insanity of nuclear arms and the fallibility of the computers who watch over mankind. It certainly takes a stretch of the imagination to believe everything that Lightman gets away with, and you keep wondering during the final third why the people in charge keep falling for the same computerized chicanery. However, WarGames weaves its reality with a sense of wonder and fun, allowing us to happily overlook its technical and logical shortcomings. And no other movie made since has so realistically (and lovingly) portrayed computers and the people who love/hate them, allowing techies and people who mistake CD-ROM drives for cupholders alike to enjoy the proceedings. Occasionally, you'll hear talk about a WarGames II movie involving the original scriptwriting team of Lasker and Parkes...let's hope they can repeat the success in a v.2 .",WarGames
131,Audie-T,"Great, entertaining Cold War era movie!",8,25 January 2005,"Just some points that stick out: The missile men in the beginning sequence are talking about really good pot. Later on in the movie, the protagonist stumbles upon the tape recorder of a military medical doctor, who has diagnosed a patient with smoking pot. While this may seem like lefties trying to put a slur on the USA's beloved military, in reality it has at least once occurred that missile men were actually caught high on grass during their work shift (manning the ICBM control bunker...).As the tension rises and nuclear war seems to become a reality, we see the general threat indicator in the NORAD control center switch from DEFCON 4 to DEFCON 3, next to a portrait of smiling President Reagan!

Or how about Maury Chaykin saying to Eddie Deezen, ""Remember when you told me to tell you when you were acting rudely and insensitively?  Well, you're doing it now.""  Or this - BIOLOGY TEACHER: Who first suggested the idea of reproduction without sex?  DAVID: Your wife? Kudos to writers Lawrence Lasker and Walter Parkes (the latter of whom later became the head of Amblin Entertainment).  The story builds so flawlessly, starting with that killer opening sequence and pulling us right on the edge of our seats.  But there's also something very warm about this movie.  There are no real villains here - the story is about humanity coming to grips with the horror of nuclear weapons.  David Lightman is such a sympathetic hero - love the resourcefulness he shows.  Every character has something sympathetic about him or her - even McKittrick, the closest thing there is to a bad guy.  This movie is just pure entertainment, done with great understated style, warmth, and intelligence.By the way, I noticed that an earlier poster criticized the music.  I disagree.  The end-credits theme is just beautiful, and perfect for this film.",WarGames

139,jerome-23,Classic Computing Film (Clince),10,26 March 2006,"This is the classic computing film. It is seminally inspirational for a young gentleman with a good background and obvious potential yet little personal status and no profession to connect via the telecommunications network to a powerful, commercial and military computers, have friends and advisers in the computer industry, get into NORAD, etc..David tells Jennifer that NORAD does not identify itself, after redial ling it from his wardialling results. It does print to the screen, presumably to identify itself, although black on black. This is similar to the early webmaster trick to lure search engines to their site by including the common search words on their index page in the background color.It spawned the War series of activities, wardialling, war driving, war sailing (the hacking into a network from a narrow-boat, e. g. my acquaintance Vickie's Wi-Fi equipped Caffè Crema overlooking the canal in Camden West Yard, London).The UK version of 2600 (Milwaukee) being called 2280 after the op tone required to fool the phone system into thinking it was another op making the call and therefore not charging the line for the call. Digital filters remove this tone, that Captin Krunch the phreaker could whistle, from the line. Grounding the receiver, as David achieves in the film does not work. BT's multimedia UK phone boxes with Internet access were label led, probably by a staff with knowledge of the playful relevance of his choice, blue-boxes for a short period of time before being relabel led broadband. A blue box was the name for the electronic device used to dial the DTMF and op tone and DTMF fourth row tones to phreak. A black-box was the name for the device that lowered the line voltage of a received call just low enough using its own battery power for the exchange to stop charging for the call before raising it again to speak for free. A DTMF tone dialer works on home phones with no keypad, keypad locks, etc., as does tapping the pulses, e.g. one, two, three in the UK for the speaking clock.I was given a phone/phreaking tool around 1990 by a friend at the time who found it abandoned at a phone-box, a large, yellow bordered device with a black colored main panel. I inquired into getting the manual from BT and the manufacturers but they were not overly generous and I applied myself instead to computing.Notes -----Clince (kluhince) n. - a classic film - usage: Bambi is a clincher.

It achieves many things : it captures accurately the essence of being a teen in the eighties; it is a cautionary tale about the dangers of nuclear weapons and the careless use of computer technology; it is a thriller filled with witty lines and great actors's chemistry. Need more ? Well, with this movie, you kids borned after the eighties get a chance to see the monstrosities that were the first floppy disks ! Badham's abilities as a director are here fully revealed. The camera movements are expressive without being flashy and you really get the feeling that he loved working with the two teen actors ( Matthew Broderick is lovable here, not the annoying wise-ass ( still to great effect ! ) he is in Ferris Buellers's Day Off ). The pacing sags a bit in the middle part but it is compensated by the evident dedication displayed by every one involved in the project. Maybe the only problem with War Games is that it tries to be more than one movie in the same one but as it succeeds on almost every front it's not that much of a problem. Oh and don't expect a movie filled with video games action : you get one arcade scene ( ah Galaga ), some chess and tic-tac-toe But you also get the ultimate war game !",WarGames

C-64s and Atari boxes were the norm. The IBM PC was one year old.I believe PC-DOS was still on version 2.0 or something very close. Windows was something only viewed at the PARC on a XEROX. The original MAC OS was over a year away after viewing it there sometime before. (google 'fire in the valley' for background information)I guess you have to be old enough to know what a daisy wheel printer was to really appreciate what this film was when it was released.We have come a long way in many respects, but not too far in others with todays operating systems from what was the 'norm' in 1983. Anyone remember CP/M? In many respects, a very capable OS. It could load in only 4 KILOBYTES if I remember correctly...Today, in 2009 we now have 64-bit Operating Systems with the computational power of multi core CPUs that make the computers of 1983 seem laughable.

The casting of Matthew Broderick and Ally Sheedy, two of John Hughes's future stars, and the fact the missile-controlling robot, Joshua, has a cute face go against the more serious messages of the script as well. Its cartoonish structure of nerds/outcasts vs. the military-industrial complex makes the film feel like an episode of Captain Planet, with only the onscreen charm of Broderick and Sheedy holding the very simple plot together. John Badham would go on to direct Sheedy in SHORT CIRCUIT three years later, which does a much better job at combining a cute-faced robot and maniacal government officials. With one of the most intense missile-launch opening-scenes I've seen outside of a Tom Clancy or James Bond film, I felt disappointed the script didn't maintain that momentum.",WarGames

147,stevenackerman69,excellent film from my youth,10,11 January 2010,"I have a history with this film. When it came out in 1983 during the summer, I was in my last year of sleep away camp. It was visiting day and my dad came up on July 24 (yeah, for you Yankee fans-the Pine Tar game occurred that day) and wanted to take me to see it. I decided against that because my mother was also coming up separately (my parents were long divorced) and thought she might not want to go. We saw the film on video several months later and I remember being moved by two sequences: 1. David screaming as he is dragged down the stairs, ""No, it's Joshua! He's still playing the game! He's gonna start a war!!!!"" 2. Joshua's comment at the end of the film, which I won't mention here for anyone who hasn't yet seen this film. I later taped the film off of TV and when it came out on cable, I was surprised how much was edited out. I didn't remember the whole movie since it had been several years. I now have it in letterbox version which makes it even more like seeing it in the theater. One more thing: My dad's funeral was July 24, 1994, which was exactly 11 years after my dad wanted to take me to see this fine film. As to this film, it may not be accurate about computers, since they can't start wars, but it is convincing. Now the Cold War is a distant memory but I can remember the fear as to maybe having a nuclear war and the world ending. It is amazing how many actors in this film in small parts have gone on to other things: Jason Bernard, John Spencer, Maury Chakin, to name a few. And Matthew Broderick has certainly had a great career, in fact, at the time this film was playing, he was on Broadway in Brighton Beach Memoirs!!! Bet you all didn't know that. Also, doesn't Barry Corbin (Gen. Jack Berringer) look like Jackie Gleason? And yes, he and Gleason worked together on Nothing in Common, Gleason's last film.

On top of that, most of us worked at Wright-Patterson AFB, so the movie was even more relevant.The movie was intense and great, but the thing I will always remember most is what happened in the theater, not the movie.

150,abralive,"Wargames (1983) Matthew Broderick, Dabney Coleman",9,10 February 2005,"""Wargames"" is truly an astonishing motion picture for a myriad of reasons not the least of which have to do with both the plot and the superb dialog.David Lightman (Matthew Broderick) is a 17 year old truant case, undisciplined and lacking in academic interests whose only passion is video games. When he reads of a video company in California that promotes what he likes, he goes almost berserk, dialing numbers at random to reach the company. He inadvertently taps into a Sunnyvale phone line and pulls up a game list that amazes even him. With the help of a couple of computer whizzes, he learns the identity of the man who created the games. Stephen Falken (John Wood) was a government computer engineer that created the self-teaching games to provide the foundation for a new, highly sophisticated machine called WOPR located at Norads defense headquarters in the Colorado Rockies. WOPR's job was to perform functions that conscience-gifted human beings couldn't do: Launch a nuclear war and produce potential genocide. All David needs to do is find the ""password"" to get into the system and play the games.How David finds this password is the crucial element in the story line. When his friend (not girlfriend until later in the movie) Jennifer Mack (Ally Sheedy)reads an article to David on the fact that Falken is dead and the reasons why, David stares at the monitor screen. ""It can't be that simple"" he states. Well, it IS that simple, David discovers the password and from that time on, the sky begins to fall.With the discovery of Falken's password, David unknowingly taps into the central computer registry of WOPR, commanding it, again unknowingly to obey any command he gives it. This provides the basis for the rest of the movie.Dabney Coleman as the central system chief and Barry Corbin as the four star slack-jawed general portray their roles brilliantly and their characters are interwoven under the talent of director John Badham. The New York Times fell in love with this movie at first sight, calling it ""provocative"", in addition to many other flattering adjectives that they used. They were, of course, right. If only it could have had a stronger ending, I could have easily given this movie a ""10"". But what the heck, I know you'll fall in love with it anyway.",WarGames

So, when the movie came out, I rushed to the movie theater in no time.In that moment, the film impacted me as the coolest movie ever. I mean, we have this kid, David, who is a total computer nerd and spends his time playing games (know anyone like that?), hacks into an ultra sophisticated military mainframe, almost screws it up but ends up saving the world and getting the girl (the totally doable Ally Sheedy!). What else can we ask for?Ah, the plot thing. And the script, the acting and the technical aspects. Well, we have solid characters, supported by good acting; a credible storyline (for this kind of movie, of course; it's more credible than ""The Net"" or ""Hackers"", for instance) and good direction. No FX, no explosions, no bulls***. Filmmaking in its purest form.Yeah, the film is outdated nowadays... but so is my old and faithful ZX-81! And my C64! And my Amiga!

156,pvollan,"A movie of its time, mandatory viewing for hackers",9,31 January 2008,"One important piece of reality in this movie is when David Lightman looks for the computer game company, and stumbles across WOPR, by using a program that automatically calls every number in an area looking for a carrier. Such a program was called, after this movie came out, a ""Wargames dialer"" or a ""Wardialer"". And today, as well as old fashioned wardialing, we have wardriving, warstrolling, warchalking... war everything else, because of this movie. And have you heard of the annual hacker convention, held in Las Vegas, called.... Defcon? There are, of course, factual problems with this movie, some of which one just accepts as necessary to the ploy. When David plugs the speech synthesizer into his computer, he explains that the computer isn't really speaking, just interpreting the text that's coming in. We can't have an entire movie just looking at a video screen, so we accept that. But then at the end, Joshua speaks the climactic lines of the movie in the same voice, which makes no sense at all. The way that Joshua could find one character at a time of the password never did wash. And the paper clip method could only make a local call.The nuclear freeze movement was certainly quite strong in the '80s, more so than many today realize. I hope you understand what ""freeze"" means, because it's not the same as disarmament. It means: lets just stop throwing money down this black hole by stopping the nuclear arms race where it is. Who cares if they can reduce us fine powder and we can only reduce them to sand. Ronald Reagan outmaneuvered the freeze movement with all that SDI nonsense, which was just another excuse to waste money and extend the arms race into space. With Reagan, it's hard to tell, of course: maybe he really thought it was a ""purely defensive"" system, that could ""make nuclear weapons obsolete"". When the Soviet Union finally collapsed, there was talk of a ""peace dividend"", in which the obscene amount of money previously spent on the arms race could actually help people at home. There ain't too much talk about that now, with the ""War on Terror"", which is a war about as much as the War on Drugs or the War on Poverty, and just about as successful.",WarGames

Now in the 80's, computer security didn't exist. I stumbled across a few things that were classified that were out of my pay grade.First thing, we are now at DEFCON 3. That's the normal state of affairs. At one time we were at DEFCON 2, that was during the Cuban Missile Crisis back in the 60's. DEFCON refers to our ""Defense Condition."" If we see DEFCON 4, we really don't need a military. Maybe for ceremonial reasons or to guard the Tomb of the Unknowns. If we're at DEFCON 5, we don't need a military. There is world peace. Now DEFCON only relates to the continental United States or CONUS. Alaska and Hawaii are outside CONUS and would be in their own. Sorry guys.This kids is what we call an ""Ankle Bitter."" Just a kids who pisses off people. NORAD and our military defense systems are in a closed system. Which means there's no way any outside sources can break into our military.If you see the old school floppy disks are used ?? This is what the USAF still uses inside our missile silos. Because it's incorruptible. There is no computer that controls our defense system or our military. The screen where one of the officers questioned the validity of the USSR launching ICBM's at American soil ?? This happens. We always need to question why someone is trying to kill the USA.During this movie, we were still flying B-52's around the clock in and over the North Pole loaded with 30 - 50 megaton nuclear weapons.

Broderick, working in his text-only mode, using social-engineering and having good abilities handling primitive electric devices is nearest the real world's ""hacking"", at least in his period. As thought that the film sometimes lacks tension, especially in the middle, it has its very strong moments. To be honest, I got most excited on the very beginning, I really loved it. The performances are good, but I disliked and didn't believe the performance of the man, who should have played the wooden-head general. It seemed to be too overacted. He himself lowered my rating by one.

Obviously the onward march of technology has rendered several of the central plot devices redundant (although, to be honest, most modern techno-thriller entries are far less plausible) but the sheer tension of the story grabs you almost from the off and never lets go - there aren't many genre movies that got an Oscar-nomination for screenplay, which amply demonstrates its quality.And the last ten minutes or so are still jaw-dropping. That spectacular (if implausible) NORAD set is as astounding as ever, and the last line still deserves it's place in the pantheon.Laugh at the antiquated tech by all means, but be impressed by the effort taken to make it feel believable (cf. the sequence where Broderick's character gets the password for the school computer.) Hacker movies have rarely come this close to being real - and, as someone who had been there and done that at about that time, it was scarily right.In no way is this one of the greatest movies ever made.

When I rewatched it recently, having found it online, I was excited because I had found the original to be powerful. While the movie is full of stereotypical characters (geeks, would-be geek, army nut, high school girl, brainy soft-spoken Englishman), its beauty lies in the way it explores the relationship between people and computers, emotion and decision, and also pokes into the world of AI, which seems just as far away now as it did in 1983.I have no idea how much of that technology a kid would have possessed back in '83, but it was all possible in the early days of the Internet, and in its military forebear, ARPANET. Setting relative possibility aside, the interest of this film lies in considering the 'what if?' of human decisions, decisions that may deal out life and death...And what would happen if we let a computer have a shot at working them out. David Clark said, ""It is not proper to think of networks as connecting computers. Rather, they connect people using computers to mediate. The great success of the internet is not technical, but in human impact."" So imagine what it would be like if we removed the humans altogether?The reason this film excited me was the way the computer reached its decision. Coupled with three excellent high-tension scenes, and the simple eloquence of Tic Tac Toe (you perhaps have to code an algorithm to try and _win_ Tic Tac Toe to see what I mean...), I was delighted to find that this film kept me as engaged at 19 as it did at 9.",WarGames

The unrealistic part about that is not that the army would be stupid enough to do something like that (if you can pay 25 grand on a toilet seat, you couldn't have gotten too far in college), but that we are supposed to believe that the phone company actually would make the trip to a rural mountain to hook it up.  We all know that the phone company would never put in so much effort into actually serving their customers.

167,bodybagg,Still one of the best hacking/computer related movies.,8,23 May 2002,"Even though it is dated, Wargames is still one of the best hacking/computer related movies released to this day.  The movie is very fun to watch. It's great to see the old computers.  Although the idea of a young kid breaking into a military computer may have been farfetched during the time of the movie release, today it is possible, and has in fact happened.  A classic for computer geeks, and some non-computer geeks alike.

168,izulu123,A must-see movie,9,12 January 2012,"""War Games"" is one movie that doesn't seem to have the recognition it deserves. It should be heralded as a ""Classic."" So many great elements to the movie, with twists, turns and surprises, from suspense to comedic relief to a social message. (At the time, the technology was really something, too.) Oh, and it was all accomplished without gratuitous violence and foul language.While the entire movie is highly entertaining and there are many facets to the program, the message I took from it was the basic ""futility"" of war. Joshua, the computer created by Dr. Falken, was programmed to learn/teach itself, but as yet had not grasped the concept of futility (nobody wins in a war ""game""). The tic-tac-toe analogy was spot on. Of course at the end, Joshua finally learns that thermonuclear war is a ""strange game. The only way to win, is not to play."" Now, almost 30 years later, the technology in this movie may be laughable, but the storyline and acting are as entertaining and watchable as it was all those years ago. I still look for it on TV, and can watch it over and over and over again.",WarGames
169,rricci428,A fairly realistic look at computers and hacking at the time,8,10 June 2020,"I first watched this movie back in 1983. I have watched this movie numerous times since then, but this review is going to based on my 1st viewing. Having said that, I found it engrossing and highly entertaining (my personal interest in computers certainly didn't hurt). However, 2 things didn't sit right with me:***SPOILER ALERT***1. The line where Jennifer says to David ""Did this happen because you changed my grade>"" (I don't remember the exact quote, but it was something similar4). Two things wrong here: a) Jennifer already know it was because David broke into a military computer so that makes this joke lame and b) The feds wouldn't get involved in a grade changing ""scandal"". There are far too many thing going worldwide for them top deal with such trivial things.2. The scene where the tourists are at NORAD and the tour director tells the lady to push a button. No problem there, but what happened after felt wrong too. The siren goes off (nothing wrong there...yet) then the Galaga sound effect comes up. No way would that even be possible. Midway would have sued the U.S. Government for unauthorized use even back in 1983.***SPOILER ALERT OVER***Those 2 things spoiled what I thought was a perfect movie at the time. We now bring you ""Back To The Future"" (Get it? A reference to another movie....Ok, maybe not so funny. I tried).",WarGames

171,Fula5,Wargames,10,9 December 2005,"This film, initiated to me in the use of the computers. Before that, it attracted the electronics to me, but it was this film the one that made see that these machines me, were not science fiction, instead, a possible reality. For that reason, always I will keep east film, in a place of my history. During years, I wanted to be able to return to see the film, but in my country, it was very difficult to obtain, and the systems of video by cable, spent very rare time. At the moment there are many more resources to obtain a film, re-are even released in new format DVD.When seeing it, at the present time, the computers that appear in the film, no longer seemed to me impressive, but still I could be able to move to me, with many aspects of this film.Thanks FULA5",WarGames
172,rbtlf,Grab me an Academy Award,10,18 December 2005,"WAR GAMES is a excellent little Movie. I saw it first in 1985 - (1984?) in the Theater and it was -""wow"" then...............I loved it! It was a great Movie. Now, I see it was nominated for academy awards in various categorizes............and it should have won!Toady, for people like me who were in their ""golden"" youth in the 1980's its all about Nostalgia..................but watching it today is even better!!!!! I rented just last week at the local Video store.......and here it is in the ""Comedy section"" - War Games is more likely a Sci-Fi/Action/drama - Comedy with just great impact for people like me.................love it- watch it some time........its fun..........If you let be,.............",WarGames
173,thedave,An excellent bit of Nostalgia for us geeks.,9,11 September 1998,"I've loved this movie from day 1. Originally, it was because I was one of the few kids on the block playing with a modem and online with local boards. Later, as I entered the industry professionally (I'm an internetwork engineer), I loved it even more for the nostalgia it creates, reminding me of the simple days of computers, when the machines still held a certain charm and mystique. The story, though unlikely in the extreme, does bring back the days of building blue boxes, phreaking, and running the first brute-force hacking programs, usually typed in laboriously in the days preceding the event. It makes me sad that my children have missed the days when computers were special to the people who had them.",WarGames
174,Dutchman-4,"For 1983 is this a great shaped movie.../""War Games Remake""",10,31 October 1999,"I think this is a great movie, especially for 1983. They used the newest computers for that time, but they're old now (-when you make a movie with computers you'll always keep that-). They used a lot of fantasy, 'cause many things are normal now, but it wasn't then. Even the main computer was there a big iron ""house"". If you should make a ""War Games II""/remake of ""War Games"", and I hope that'll happen in the future, the main computer will be a micro-chip (I think) and they'll also use Internet, or something new, like a newer sort of Internet. I wonder: ""who'll make a remake?/ a 2nd ""War games?"" -Eddy-",WarGames
175,bubbarx,Awesome Movie,9,10 March 2019,"I was about 26 and working in a machine shop when I first saw this movie. I really didn't know anything about computers, but once I saw War Games I was hooked and wanted to connect online. I bought a basic computer I was in another world, I can still remember that awesome feeling when I first connected online. Long story short, I taught myself a lot about computers and was able to get my foot in the door of a major US company. Its been 24 years now and with a fortune 50 company all because of this movie. Thank you WarGames.",WarGames

177,Earle4115,A movie years ahead of its time.,10,29 December 2001,This was a film far ahead of its time.  It anticipated the internet and computer security problems.  It used tools available at the time to do a masterful simulation of the war room.  The characters in the movie all show real human qualities.  What a movie.,WarGames
178,glogmalblood,Great movie!!!,8,24 January 2008,"This was a great movie. I had to watch it for school, so I didn't expect much, but it was incredible. It was an edge of the seat film, though the suspense wasn't as well done as it could've been.Matthew Broderick played David Lightman, a young computer ""geek"" who thinks quickly, very well, but other than him I thought the acting was pretty bland (not bad, just not great).Although I'm sure that it would've been a better movie for me had I seen it around the time it came out, in the midst of the cold war when this was much more plausible then it is now, it still was well worth the 2 hours. The '80s computers also were quite funny to watch, and Norad (while being a pitiful design by today's standards) was extremely high-tech for the time.",WarGames
179,cally627,Broderick's best film,8,14 June 2005,"For an 80s film with old technology I was expecting this to be fairly boring when I saw it advertised, but when I watched it I actually found it an excellent film- Broderick and Sheedy give some great acting, it delivers a successful message about nuclear war, and it isn't hard to believe that Falken was based on John Lennon! Joshua's final message about nuclear war- 'the only winning move is not to play'- is chilling and Badham uses a simplistic but unpatronising analogy of 'tic-tac-toe' (noughts and crosses to the other English people out there!) to show that if both sides are playing properly there can be no winner. The build-up of the romance between David and Jennifer is realistic rather than Hollywood, and I think viewers will find the ways that David manages to get himself out of trouble (e.g. recording the door entry code and replaying it; creating a signal on the payphone with a ring pull) entertaining and interesting. Not one for younger kids with the relatively hard-to-understand science and the mild swearing, but other than that it's a pretty entertaining family film!",WarGames
180,kbirdsall8,Time to watch it again,8,24 August 2020,I saw War Games when it came out in the 80s and since 2017 I have encouraged my now adult children to watch it again. Doesn't anyone learn from history. When you understand the game of checkers as it applies to nuclear war. Very well written and profoundly acted. It is a head slapping ending.,WarGames

182,mark_k2,A strange film,6,30 December 2008,"Okay... firstly Broderick was a damn good lookin lad when he was younger, makes you wonder where it went wrong haha! Anyway... off topic - This is a strange film, while hacking films have always been hard to pull off without bright flashing colors, complex looking coding and fancy, seemingly dispensable equipment this film seems to manage to fit a tight sub-genre. 80's computer equipment wasn't anything special, remember, we're talking pre-Windows here, home computers that could play chess were pretty much the be and and end all, so bright sequences of colour and sub-levels and digital blueprints to hack into computer ""sub-systems"" are all pretty fancy, but that kind of coding/hacking doesn't even exist now, 25 years later. So the use of simple equipment, simple monochrome computers and coding was probably the best feature of this film - we had the futuristic ""fantasy"" added in the form of Joshua, the super-intelligent computer who has a mind of his own. Even this hasn't been pushed beyond reality in that the computer was only doing what it had been told in other words ""computer play game, computer complete game"" an thats what it did, it problem solved its way to winning a game by eradicating all other possibilities first which is still the basis of computers today. The story line is deep enough and there isn't any point you are confused, everything is explained by Brodericks character no matter how limited your computer knowledge. In saying that you may not enjoy this film if you aren't interested in computers. **SPOILER IN NEXT PARAGRAPH** The only thing that REALLY bugs me about this film is the ending, the whole film is based on Brodericks mistake of ""hacking"" into a military computer and put America and Soviet Union on the brink of WW3, but seems to get let off when he solves it at the end of the film. SURELY, he should be arrested because the whole situation and everything that happened was all his fault? Okay, he found a key weakness in the ""procedure"", but still... it was ALL HIS FAULT - silly boy!All in all an entertaining film but a bit too predictable. Some of the acting can be forgiven but the story could have been a little less a=b=c.",WarGames
183,rick1216,Hey! I like WarGames...,5,19 March 2006,"Yes I'm a geezer and personally I like this movie. Sure it has ancient computer hardware and the software is so out of date most of us don't remember what it was like. In 1983 the internet wasn't even close to being considered for what it is used for today. Few homes then had a personal computer they were to expensive for the ""casual"" user. Would love to see it updated. With the currently rash of remakes in Hollywood and all the dark times in current events it would be interesting to see a modern twist on this movies genre. We know there are still hackers out there and certainly film makers are more savvy to the computer age that a remake of this particular script could certainly turn out to be a better movie than the original.",WarGames
