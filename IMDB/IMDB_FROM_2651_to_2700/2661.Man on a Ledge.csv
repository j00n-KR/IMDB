0,Leofwine_draca,"Another ""single location"" movie",5,24 September 2013,"Okay, I'm predisposed to like such films, and I liked MAN ON A LEDGE. I liked it about the same as I liked BURIED, but it's not quite got the edge or intensity of PHONE BOOTH. The problem with this genre is that it's very easy to overdo things instead of keeping them simple, and MAN ON A LEDGE overdoes things.The easiest thing for me to do is point out all the problems I had with this movie. The rest of it I liked, apart from these points: 1) The film is horrible for the female characters. Elizabeth Banks just about scrapes through without being too irritating, but Genesis Rodriguez is reduced to the level of a piece of meat. And Kyra Sedgwick - why?! 2) The plot makes no sense about it of you think about it too much. The heist is nonsensical. It just wouldn't happen like that, there are too many coincidences, too much is left to chance, it's a joke.3) The sub-plot with Jamie Bell is silly and boring. Much better to have stuck with Sam Worthington on the ledge; that's where the interest lies, after all.Otherwise, there's quite a bit to retain the interest here. The first half hour is great stuff. Sam Worthington is a pleasant surprise; his acting skills have increased considerably since CLASH OF THE TITANS and AVATAR, and he actually held my attention here. The elder male cast members are also strong, and there's a good, if minor, role for Ed Harris. I liked the in-joke nod to DOG DAY AFTERNOON, and the cinematography is decent and set my fear of heights off admirably. Not a classic then, just a nearly decent film let down by some sloppy writing.",Man on a Ledge
1,SnoopyStyle,Twist too complicated,6,27 August 2013,"Nick Cassidy (Sam Worthington) is a man standing on the ledge of a building. Police psychologist Lydia Mercer (Elizabeth Banks) is trying to talk him down. Also staring are Jamie Belle and the hot Genesis Rodriguez.This is the simple compelling visual premise that could have led to an imaginative movie. Instead, it is a jumping off point to a twist that devolves into a convoluted story. Sadly the twists keep coming. If only it stayed a simple easily understood twist, that would actually be better. Simple is better than complicated in this case.",Man on a Ledge
2,boblipton,A Paint By Numbers Picture With No Paint,3,10 February 2012,"Do they still have paint-by-the-numbers kits? They came with an assortment of paints, a brush and a black-and-white reproduction of a classic painting with the areas marked with numbers. You filled in those areas with the corresponding paint and you have painted an exact replica of the Mona Lisa or Blue Boy or whatever it was. The trouble is that unless you're dealing with Mondrian, you've missed all the subtleties.That's the feeling I came away from MAN ON A LEDGE with. You have the outline of a story, but the characters that fill in the spaces are missing. We have the falsely accused cop, we have his gamecock brother and the brother's girlfriend who seems to have been a carney contortionist at some stage. Lucky him. You've got SOB real estate magnate Ed Harris and bluff Irish cop Ed Burns. Elizabeth Banks is the plucky young police negotiator who is desperate to redeem herself. That's where we start in terms of character and that's where we end. As these line paintings ran through the plot, I was left with a feeling of annoyance that the people in charge didn't even think it worthwhile to get their geography right; the Roosevelt Hotel is between Madison and Vanderbilt, not Madison and 5th.The cinematographer tries to get some interesting moving extreme point-of-view shots to deal with an essentially restricted field of movement. However, without a script that does more than offer a series of plot points and a director unwilling to let a talented supporting cast fill out the emptiness with some subtlety to let the audience care about the people in this movie, you've got a paint-by-numbers movie. It looks like he didn't and the actors were content to bank their salaries and move on.",Man on a Ledge
3,Prismark10,Ready to jump,5,29 November 2015,"Man on a Ledge wants to be high concept thriller mixing Inside Man with The Negotiator as the events you see are masking other events behind the scenes.Sam Worthington is Nick Cassidy, a former police officer now escaped convict for stealing a high value diamond from a Trump like business mogul(Ed Harris.)After his escape Cassidy checks into a hotel and then walks on to a window ledge, drawing the attention of crowds below who thinks he will jump.Cassidy demands to see disgraced negotiator Lydia Mercer (Elizabeth Banks.) At the same time Cassidy's father and brother are up to schemes of their own and then there is the case of Cassidy's former cop partner put out that he has escaped.The film is a predictable but enjoyable popcorn film with a cast that makes it hard to take things seriously. William Sadler pops up as a room service waiter, surely he is going to be more than that. Anthony Mackie, is the former partner still maintaining Cassidy's innocence but again not seemingly trying too hard to prove it. Harris is just too slimy, what did happen to that diamond?The film is rather derivative of elements from many other films ranging from The Fugitive, Dog Day Afternoon, Mission Impossible, The Italian Job as well as the films I mentioned earlier. It just about holds together.",Man on a Ledge
4,claudio_carvalho,Disregard the Bad Reviews and Enjoy this Entertaining Action-Thriller,7,17 June 2012,"In Sing Sing Correctional Facility, the ex-cop Nick Cassidy (Sam Worthington) is informed that his appeal was denied by the court. When his father dies, Nick has authorization to go to the funeral escorted by two policemen. However, he has a fight with his estranged brother Joey Cassidy (Jamie Bell) and Nick subdues the police officers and escape. Nick lodges at the 21st floor of the Roosevelt Hotel in New York and he goes to the ledge through the window and threatens to jump on the floor, attracting a crowd on the street. The negotiator Lydia Mercer (Elizabeth Banks) is assigned to convince the unknown jumper to give up of his intention. Meanwhile Joey and his girlfriend Angela Maria 'Angie' Lopez (Genesis Rodriguez) breaks in the jewelry owned by the powerful David Englander (Ed Harris). Nick claims innocence to Lydia and asks her to give more time to him since he will prove that he is innocent. Lydia believes that Nick is honest or lunatic and decides to investigate his information.""Man on a Ledge"" is an entertaining action-thriller with a great cast. The story has the usual plot holes and unrealistic situations, but that is the funniest part of this type of movie. The unknown Genesis Rodriguez is a very beautiful actress and my advice to the readers is to disregard the bad reviews and enjoy this good film. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""À Beira do Abismo"" (""On the Edge of the Abyss"")",Man on a Ledge
5,nogodnomasters,TODAY IS THE DAY,9,22 July 2018,"Sam Worthington is convicted of a crime he claims he did not commit. He goes out on the ledge of a building, in what we know early on is a diversionary tactic as he conspires with his brother (Jamie Bell) to prove his innocence. He requests Lydia ""Grim Reaper"" Mercer (Elizabeth Banks) to be the person to talk him down. By the nickname, her track record of talking people down has been less than desirable. She is hungry to save someone while fighting her hangover.The film uses a good intense sound track to raise the thriller level as Jamie and his girlfriend (Genesis Rodriguez) attempt to prove Worthington is innocent.Good intensity. Minor expected twists.F-bomb, no sex, no nudity, Genesis Rodriguez in bra/panties.",Man on a Ledge
6,kosmasp,Predictable fun,7,31 May 2012,"There was another man on a ledge situation recently (movie-wise that is), but you'd be better off comparing this to the Tower Heist. Actually I'd also say, if you liked the Rattner movie, you'll like this. And this does not even need that much time to kick off. Of course you'll have to first wait for a few character beats and other stuff to build up. Not everything seems plausible, but it's a movie and it's not supposed to (always) make sense (not this type of movie anyway). Not to mention those very convenient moments that just happen by accident, but we just love to watch (well some or most of us, anyway).Characters are very thin and as stated in my summary most of the things will be quite predictable (even some ""surprises"" along the road). But I had fun watching this and so did the actors.",Man on a Ledge
7,lee_eisenberg,hang/stand in there,8,29 July 2012,"If you only hear about ""Man on a Ledge"", it might sound like a typical action flick. However, it's nothing of the sort. There is limited action but a lot of suspense. Sam Worthington plays a man standing on the ledge of a New York hotel. It turns out that this action is related to his past, and that in another building, there is something equally important going on.The absence of explosions certainly strengthens the movie. Some of the neatest scenes are those in the ducts, many of them as tense as what's happening on the ledge. Overall, Ed Harris's character is the perfect representation of the sorts of people who crashed the economy four years ago. A really interesting movie. And if I may say so, Génesis Rodríguez is a REAL looker! Also starring Kyra Sedgwick, Elizabeth Banks and Jamie Bell (Tintin in ""The Adventures of Tintin"").",Man on a Ledge
8,jboothmillard,Man on a Ledge,4,16 September 2012,"Claudia Winkleman as the host of Film 2012 raved about this film quite a bit, saying that everyone should see it, and yet the critics reviewed it and gave it two stars out of five, so I was certainly intrigued to see which opinion I would agree with. Basically in Manhattan, New York City, ex-cop turned conman Nick Cassidy (Avatar's Sam Worthington) checks into the Roosevelt Hotel on the twenty first floor, under the false name Walker, orders some room service, a good meal, and then he steps out of the window onto the ledge of the building, and he starts to walk further away from the window. Eventually he is noticed below, and huge crowd gather below to see what he will do, and the police also show up with hundreds of officers and vehicles ready with a large inflatable cushion ready for if he jumps. Jack Dougherty (Edward Burns) goes up to the room and pokes his head through the window to talk to Nick, but he refuses to talk anyone unless they bring police negotiator Detective Lydia Mercer (The 40 Year Old Virgin's Elizabeth Banks), who is currently on leave after failing to stop a man from jumping from the Brooklyn Bridge. Eventually she shows up to talk to him and talk him round, but he is assuring her that he will jump and kill himself because he has nothing to live for, and while this is going on below the crowd and amounts of police and SWAT grow much bigger. What the authorities do not realise is that the man on a ledge is a distraction for all the people and police so that his brother Joey (Jamie Bell) and Joey's girlfriend Angie (Genesis Rodriguez), in the building next door, owned by ruthless businessman David Englander (Ed Harris) can carry out a very technical robbery of a very valuable diamond, worth $40 million, the one that Nick was framed for stealing, and Nick is listening and giving instructions with his hidden microphone. Elizabeth is not sure that her suicidal victim truly wants to kill him, and as she talks to him more and tries to understand his reasons for being on the ledge, she eventually finds out his true identity, and of course the diamond robbery, and he explains that he is on the ledge to prove himself innocent of the crime. Meanwhile Joey and Angie have managed to get past all the difficult security traps and alarms, including heat sensitive detectors, and they reach the safe where the diamond is supposedly hidden, but they cannot find it and have to tell Nick this as well. Elizabeth works out that something else may be going on, and eventually the ex-cop allows her to know that he was trying to steal the diamond again, but not to get the fortune from it, but show up Englander as the true thief, who eventually shows up and shows up his true side as a criminal willing to do anything to keep his empire. In the end Joey and Angie are saved by Nick, after he does jump from the ledge onto the inflatable cushion below in order to chase Englander and get him caught for the crime he set Nick up for, and we see some time later that Nick is proved innocent and hanging out with Elizabeth for a drink. Also starring The Adjustment Bureau's Anthony Mackie as Mike Ackerman and Phenomenon's Kyra Sedgwick as Suzie Morales. I agree Worthington isn't really convincing as the man on the ledge threatening suicide and with a secret agenda, Banks is a bit of a daft choice as the negotiator who is trying to talk him out of his threat, Bell is much more watchable as he attempts to steal the diamond, and Harris isn't on screen very long and doesn't really convince you as the villainous kind of character. The film could have been a bit more exciting if it was written and played out a little better, the premise sounds interesting, and obviously the title does sum one of the key parts of the plot, it is just wobbly and it probably would be really entertaining to see more jumping, an alright but uneven thriller. Okay!",Man on a Ledge
9,rmax304823,The Big Dive.,7,8 September 2013,"I was trying to think of all the other movies that the writer and director had seen. Let's see. There was ""Topkapi"", ""Dog Day Afternoon,"" ""The Negotiator"", ""Lethal Weapon,"" and the one with Denzel Washington who takes hostages in a hospital. Probably others, but not the original ledge story, ""Fourteen Hours."" I was surprised to find I enjoyed this as much as I did because it begins unpromisingly. In the first few minutes, there is a fist fight, a gun shot, a high speed pursuit, and a convicted felon makes the most improbable of escapes.The next thing we know, the felon (Worthington) is standing on the ledge of a hotel in New York City, threatening to jump unless they get a celebrated detective (Banks)to talk to him pronto. Everything is pronto. Hardly anyone walks. People end their imperative shouts with ""NOW!"" And time turns out to be of the essence. ""Fifteen minutes or I jump."" The electronic musical score sounds like ""The Flight of the Bumblebee"" without a melody.The initial confusion persists well into the movie. Gradually, we realize that Worthington is rigged up with a tiny receiver in his ear and a microphone hidden in his collars. He mumbles things to whomever is on the other end, but we can't quite make it out.There are no flashbacks -- and thank God for that, because they would only add to the murk -- but piece by piece the back story is filled in. I don't think I'll explain all of it, but Worthington was framed for a jewel robbery with the connivance of some fellow cops, and now Worthington's brother (Bell) and his girl friend Angie (Rodriguez) are trying to prove his innocence by executing one of those fashionable high-tech robberies in a jewelry shop across the street. Something like that. The turbidity was never entirely dispelled.At first, the murky plot seemed like a flaw in the structure. I thought it was accidental. But as the narrative's jigsaw puzzle added more pieces, the picture became clearer. Each new revelation brought with it a pleasant sense of satisfaction, because the new piece further shaped a good Gestalt. It was like watching a handful of scattered dots slowly form themselves into a circle.Still, there are innumerable holes and coincidences that you have to will yourself to disregard if you're going to get any kick out of the film. There is nothing much new in the direction. It's not innovative in any way. It's a routine thriller, not ""Citizen Kane"", and it ends the way most movies end, leaving the viewer with a sort of ruddy glow.I don't know why Ed Burns is so far down the cast list. Given a certain type of role, of which this is a good example, he brings a lot to the characterization. The same with Ed Harris, an amazingly versatile and accomplished actor, who can play screaming lunatics or contemplative introverts. Harris is older here than we're used to seeing him but he's delicious as the greedy, monomaniacal tycoon. He's one of the few actors who tries to put something into his body language. As John McCain in ""Recount,"" he hunched his shoulders forward a bit, the way his real-life counterpart does. Here, he holds himself stiffly erect, like a man made out of Tinker Toy parts.As the negotiator-in-chief, Elizabeth Banks is adequate, not more than that. As an accomplice in the ""good"" robbery taking place across the street, Genesis Rodriguez shows about the same level of talent, but the director must have realized that she has far more to contribute to the film that just a few lines of dialog and an ability to crawl through tight spaces. She looks a bit like Angie Harmon, late of ""Law and Order."" She's dark and sleek. Her bosoms look as if they were trying to elbow each other out of the way in a frantic attempt to escape from her form-fitting tank top or whatever it is. And the director, Asger Leth (can that be his real name?), has the good taste to have her strip down to her skivvies and change into a black leather outfit on screen. Later, she takes time out from this tense situation to change back to her original tank top and spandex bottom, but it takes place off screen. It's a little hard to understand why she might want to change outfits twice in the middle of a frantic robbery, but it's just as well. Enough is as good as a feast.",Man on a Ledge
10,Tweekums,A decent action movie,7,15 February 2013,The film opens with a man going into a hotel; ordering breakfast and a bottle of champagne before climbing onto the ledge of his room on the twenty first floor. We then see in flashback how he was a prisoner at Sing Sing until he escaped during a leave to attend a funeral. Rather than heading for the border he heads to a hotel belonging to the man he was accused of robbing. When the police come he says he will only talk to Officer Lydia Mercer; an officer who isn't held in high regard by her colleagues as the last person she tried to talk down jumped! At first the police have no idea who he is and just assume he is a desperate man wanting some attention before he kills himself; as time passes it becomes clear that he isn't suicidal; he is putting on a show so everybody watches him while his brother and his girlfriend break into the building opposite to find the evidence that will prove he was set up.This was a fairly solid thriller with some nice little twists and so good action; not only that but it is also a pretty good heist movie as the break in involves getting past numerous security systems and accessing a vault. The cast do a decent job; most notably Sam Worthington as protagonist Nick Cassidy and Elizabeth Banks as Mercer. Ed Harris also puts in a suitably unpleasant performance as the film's antagonist. If you are looking for a film with a decent amount of action and little to cause offence then you could do a lot worse than this.,Man on a Ledge
11,blanche-2,good fun,8,27 June 2013,"Sam Worthington is the ""Man on a Ledge"" in this 2012 film also starring Ed Harris, Edward Burns, Anthony Meckle and Elizabeth Banks, and directed by Asger Leth.Worthington is Nick Cassidy, an escaped convict and former police officer who was found guilty of stealing an enormous diamond from a businessman (Harris). Once he's escaped, he checks into a hotel, orders room service, and then walks out onto a window ledge, drawing the attention of crowds below. Though Jack Dougherty (Burns) tries to talk him down, Nick demands to see Lydia Mercer (Elizabeth Banks), a cop on leave after failing to stop a suicide attempt on the Brooklyn Bridge.Ultimately, Mercer begins to wonder what's really going on. Cassidy doesn't come in and doesn't jump; what she doesn't realize is that he is wearing an earpiece and communicating with his brother and his brother's girlfriend.Very entertaining film. I loved the story, though some of the characters, such as the Ed Harris role, were a little sketchy. I also found the acting good but not great, particularly Elizabeth Banks, whom I didn't find all that convincing.Suspenseful and intriguing, this is a great rental.",Man on a Ledge

Who did his hair for the film? He really looked terrible.Getting back to the picture, the plot is wonderful as the lady police officer, assigned to persuade our guy not to jump from the ledge, slowly begins to believe him.The plot twists are excellent as those you'd never expect to be the true culprits really are the villains.",Man on a Ledge
13,LeonLouisRicci,Artificial As An Additive,2,25 June 2012,"This is a pedestrian piece of fluff. Cardboard cutouts of central casting. The Director is certainly cashing in and delivering such an uninspired, unrealistic, vapid view of a crime thriller that it is mind boggling.The standards are so low here that one wonders; what's the purpose? This is supposed to be entertainment at the very least and it is less than that, in fact, it is a waste. The characters are dull, the plot has unrealized potential and the professionalism is proletarian.The contrivances are so consistent and the unbelievable skills of the protagonist and his allies are so ridiculous and the clichéd crowd so cartoonish that the whole thing is as artificial as an additive.This formulaic film is shamefully without any responsibility to the genre and all involved seem like it was all work for hire. If you take on an easy sell, that's OK, but that does not resolve you of any effort to work at your craft.",Man on a Ledge
14,Boba_Fett1138,Hollywood is really starting to run out of good ideas.,4,10 February 2012,"Really, I can take a lot and normally have a high sense of suspension of disbelief but this movie really pushes it and is just being too ridicules, even for my taste.To put it boldly; this movie is probably the dumbest heist movie I have ever seen. Really, the whole idea of the heist is already an extremely far fetched and just plain ridicules one but the execution of it also really can't make things interesting or credible enough.And even though it uses an unusual and also original concept, it still all eventually plays out as just another heist movie. There really isn't anything special or groundbreaking about this movie and I think even the lovers of the genre will be disappointed by the overall execution of this movie. The movie never really manages to become a tense or exciting one. It's really a movie by the numbers, which means that it's an incredibly predictable one, from basically start till finish. Really, if you were surprised by any of the 'twists' in this movie, you seriously need to start watching more movies.I just don't understand why this movie ever got made but the thing I even understand less is why it still has some pretty good and respectable actors in it. Ed Harris is, for instance, in it as the villain, even though well...he just isn't being much of a villain. He is heavily underused but he still gives the best performance out of the entire movie. I also do admit that Sam Worthington seems to be getting better and better as an actor. He isn't quite there yet but after seeing him in this movie I tend to think we still haven't seen the last or best from him. He'll probably stick around for a couple of more years, playing big roles, in some big blockbuster movies. But there are a whole lot of more actors in this movie that make you go; why are you in this? This also especially goes for Jamie Bell and Kyra Sedgwick, who plays a reporter on the street and gets absolutely nothing else than just that to do in this movie.I can take formulaic, I can take silly but I just can't take it when a movie is doing some incredibly stupid and non-creative, ridicules stuff with it all.4/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Man on a Ledge

But he is actually engaged in a distraction, buying time for his brother Joey (Jamie Bell) and girlfriend Angie (Genesis Rodrigues) to steal a diamond from high powered ruthless crook David Englander (Ed Harris) within a high-tech security system in a neighbouring building, this being the key to his freedom.The first thing for me to say is that this film does not merit close examination - in the cold light of day it falls apart in your hands. It has an air about it of a film which was developed entirely from the title - ""Man On A Ledge is a great name for a movie - now, who is he, and why is he on a ledge?"" (Snakes On A Plane, anyone?). So, please, don't go into this expecting it to make vast amounts of sense: it doesn't.Conversely, if you go in with a bag of popcorn and your brain in neutral, you are likely to have a good deal of fun, because this is a good natured action thriller with good action, lots of suspense, some twists and turns, Ed Harris as a pantomime villain, and decent turns from the principals.",Man on a Ledge

They eventually learn he's a cop who was convicted who stealing a valuable diamond, which he denied.It seems he just escaped from prison and he says he's trying to prove his innocence....Given the high concept of the movie, it should have been a rush of a thriller, much like Phone Booth. The set up is great, and the fact that something else is going on in the background adds to the curiosity value.But what we have is a case of nice title, shame about the film. Sam Worthington proves once again, that there is hope for all of us in the world of acting, because he is as wooden as ever in this, but has some very good support around him.And here lies the major problem, the scenes that should thrill, are just dull, and whenever the titular ledge isn't on screen, the film does spark to life.Harris, Bell, Banks, and even Burns make the film the watchable movie it should be.The last ten minutes defy belief, and you really have to take a massive pinch of salt, because if a man has really spent all that time wasting police time, taxpayers money and holding up traffic, do you really think he would be in a pub with the negotiator at the end?

Between this and the equally atrocious (but more expectedly so) Wrath of the Titans, one wouldn't be blamed for writing him off completely. The thing is I still like him as an actor even if sometimes I believe he needs a better agent.Anyway in this one he's Nick Cassidy a cop turned con whom decides to cause a scene by perching on top of a ledge of a high rise hotel threatening to jump. From there we follow the incident from a multitude of angles, be it the views of the cops, paramedics, mayor, etcetera, but none of them particularly interesting. Also, it contains one plot-hole too many, immediately taking me out of the film.My Grade: D",Man on a Ledge
20,gradyharp,'Today is the day when everything changes. One way or another.',10,30 May 2012,"Starting with a tightly woven story and screenplay by Pablo F. Fenjves and directed with an eye and an ear on tension by Asger Leth MAN ON A LEDGE provides on of the best suspense/caper heist/intrigue/good cop-bad cop movies to come out in a long time. The pacing of this remarkable story is such that it speeds by so quickly that the audience feels like the movie is very short – and that is even with the fact that there is a history of the main character shared in flashbacks, and an upfront suspenseful tale out in the open with a simultaneous heist going sub rosa. No one is who they seem to be on the surface and as the story unwinds we are able to discover a very deeply embedded history of a man on a ledge.Nick Cassidy (Sam Worthington at his best) checks into the Roosevelt Hotel in New York City, orders a champagne breakfast and then steps out on the very high ledge to begin the tale. A screaming woman from the street spies him and police surround the hotel, providing a trampoline for the victim to jump to safety. But Nick demands from the cop assigned (Edward Burns) that a particular negotiator be assigned to talk with him – that negotiator is boozily disgraced Lydia Mercer (Elizabeth Banks). Mercer takes charge, identifies with Cassidy's plight and forces her fellow policemen to leave the situation to her. Meanwhile we discover Cassidy's brother Joey (Jamie Bell) and his girlfriend Angie (Genesis Rodriguez) are in the building across the street, breaking in and performing an incredible heist for a 40 carat diamond owned by criminally minded David Englander (Ed Harris): flashbacks reveal that Cassidy had been imprisoned as a bad cop who allegedly stole that diamond and has escaped form prison to prove his innocence. The action goes back and forth between Cassidy and Mercer in their talks and Joey and Angie and their progress and Englander and the dirty cops assisting him, Gradually the true colors of all the people are revealed in a fine, startling way.The cast is exceptionally fine, with smaller roles being ably played by Anthony Mackie, Kyra Sedgwick, Pooja Kumar, William Sadler, Titus Welliver and others. For once a film is a true suspense story that keeps the audience riveted to their seats. The top notch cinematography is by Paul Cameron an the musical score is by Henry Jackman. From top to bottom this is a fine ensemble production. Grady Harp",Man on a Ledge
21,siderite,The film had no idea what it wanted to be.,6,21 October 2012,"I will start with the conclusion: the film had numerous plot holes, was inconsistent and the story was lame, but worst of all: it was boring. There should have been enough tension in this movie to keep us on the (l)edge of our seats, but instead I felt a strong need to go to sleep and wake up when it was over. Alas, I was not tired, so I help through it.It all started with a jumper from a building and the police negotiation, then it went back a month to see an intrigue about a cop being wrongfully accused and condemned, then it went into heist mode, then back to negotiations, then some arrogant bad guy making us hate him, then about corrupt cops, then some of them were not corrupt, then family ties, then comedic relief, and so on. This film was all over the place and managed to get nowhere.Bottom line: a waste of time.",Man on a Ledge
22,KineticSeoul,"A dull, boring and predictable heist/thriller without any thrills",3,17 August 2012,"This is a thriller/heist movie without the thrills. You might not know exactly what is going on at first, but when it does get to that point which is very quick, it just becomes predictable all the way through. Hollywood brought in Sam Worthington as the new face in movies but so far he didn't bring anything that stand out about this actor. And it's the same in this movie, he isn't bad but nothing memorable. In fact there is nothing memorable about this whole movie. It's absurd and ridiculous just about all the way through. The plan in this movie just goes way too according to plan when it comes to the heist with the timing and everything. It's okay when almost everything goes according to plan in a movie, but the direction this goes makes is just appalling. Like it's insulting the audiences intelligence. Which will make some audience members roll their eyes while watching. The plot is basically about a man on a ledge and he is up there for some reason while a negotiator played by Elizabeth Banks is trying to help the guy.

23,Hellmant,An interesting premise but the film does little with it.,6,15 May 2012,"'MAN ON A LEDGE': Three Stars (Out of Five) Sam Worthington stars in this action thriller about an ex-cop turned escaped con threatening to commit suicide by jumping from a Manhattan hotel room while a diamond heist is going on in the building next door. The film costars Elizabeth Banks, Jamie Bell, Ed Harris, Edward Burns, Anthony Mackie, Kyra Sedgwick and the gorgeous Genesis Rodriguez (also seen recently in the Will Ferrell comedy 'CASA DE MI PADRE'). It was directed by Asger Leth and written by Pablo F. Fenjves. Despite a good cast the film is just mediocre entertainment; it has an interesting premise but does little with it.Worthington plays Nick Cassidy, an ex-cop framed for a crime he didn't commit; stealing a diamond from David Englander (Harris). He breaks out of prison and flees to a Manhattan hotel where he threatens to commit suicide. Cassidy requests Detective Lydia Mercer (Banks), a police psychologist, to negotiate with. As Mercer tries to talk Cassidy down a diamond heist is being conducted in the building next door by Nick's brother Joey Cassidy (Bell).The movie is interesting at first but how it plays out is a little less than thrilling. The directing is adequate at best and the screenplay is lacking involvement. Worthington, Banks, Bell and the rest do the best with their parts though and it's nice to see Worthington continue to branch out a little. The film is forgettable but a little more than mildly entertaining.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/UUizoy5DkRo",Man on a Ledge
24,thesar-2,Man With Little Leverage,5,26 February 2013,"While I found Man on a Ledge fairly exciting and fun and I can see it's taking itself pretty seriously – for the most part, it just boils down to the Wal-Mart of smart and similar thrillers, such as The Negotiator or (the also starring Elizabeth Banks film) The Next Three Days.And dang, as cute as Sam Worthington is, he's quickly becoming worthless instead. Sure, he's not necessarily a bad actor, but he's about as plain, wooden and depthless as Mitt Romney is in every single movie I've seen him in – Man on a Ledge, Avatar, Clash of the Titans (1 & 2) and Terminator: Salvation.Here, Sammy will yell and do everything in his power to convince the actors in the films, the audience and most of all, himself, that he was so wrongly accused, we should feel something for him. His co-stars did their best to react to his verbal pleas, he never once convinced me to feel for his plight and he was just there for the paycheck and exposure. So, I guess: Mission: Failed.That all said, it's still a fun little, leave-your-brain-at-the-door feature that mercifully wasn't that long – although, at times it did seem it wasn't greatly paced.Good cop Nick (Worthington) was set up by wealthy and entrepreneur David Englander (played by way-too-old-for-this-sh|t Ed Harris) in regards to a stolen $40-mil diamond. 25 years in the pen for Nicky won't do, so his plan involves the quickest and easiest prison escape in film history and then prop himself on a ledge (duh) so people will listen to him.Obviously, we have some time to kill, so there's an incredibly unfunny sub-plot/plot of his bickering and amateurish brother & his girlfriend, a.k.a. Ren & Stimpy breaking in, not coincidentally, across the street to prove Nick's innocence.There you go. That's pretty much it. Eh, throw in a pretty and (for a reason) hung-over negotiator and some side chess pieces and you have it.Despite all its flaws and cringing moments – such as the tense couple of squabbling lay-burglars and Sam's soulless performance, it's a straight-forward and surprisingly tense at times film. Perfect for just a relaxing Redbox night. During the week. When reruns cloud your DVR.",Man on a Ledge
25,Lejink,Might as well jump!,3,10 May 2014,"Yet another chronically bad, loud, unbelievable, would-be action movie from Hollywood. Taking its cue from the ""Snakes on a Plane"" school of bleedingly obvious film titles, we sure enough get Sam Worthington's ex-con ex-cop atop a downtown New York multi-storey hotel in an elaborate (that's putting it mildly) anti-heist plan involving his couldn't't-look-less-like-his-brother err...brother Jamie Bell and his feisty but of course sexy Latina girlfriend (cue token underwear shot of said señorita) to clear his name for a jewellery robbery committed on big-bad fat-cat Ed Harris a couple of years previously.The detective he calls up to act as his negotiator with the cops? Yes, she's female and attractive too even if she's just come off a suicide negotiation gone wrong. With stunts freely borrowed from any number of like-simple-minded Hollywood action-flicks over the last few years, cliff-hanging moment succeeds cliff-hanging moment, impossible stunt succeeds impossible stunt and obvious twist succeeds obvious twist right the way through. And do you really think old Sam stays on that ledge alone all the way through? Guess again!With a numbingly pounding soundtrack, banal dialogue and employing every thriller-cliché imaginable it also uses around a million jump-cuts to detract from the same shots over and over again of Worthington looking down at his feet to the streets below and his pretty negotiator sticking her head out the window to talk to him, it at least saves the daftest until last when our hero eventually takes the plunge at the movie's climax.Characterisation is non-existent and the acting doesn't get close to saving it either in a movie where Jamie Bell getting to do a little pirouette at one point counts as the closest the film gets to subtlety. I'd much rather watch Harold Lloyd do this kind of gravity-defying thing although there are almost as many laughs in this feature as the great silent comedian managed all those years ago. Only I don't think the comedy here was intentional...",Man on a Ledge

Within a short space of time, he's become a news sensation, and has some trained negotiators and a whole city in the grip of his attention. But Cassidy is more than an apparently suicidal man- he's an escaped convict who insists his innocence and that the mayor of the city (Ed Harris) has framed him. Is he a crackpot- or is he telling the truth?Danish director Asger Leth presents his first Hollywood feature, after making two lesser known films in his native, er, Denmark. His style may need to adapt a little to the Hollywood psyche, or maybe it'll just warm with them. Here, he's turned his attentions to a real time thriller, that doesn't manage to generate genuine tension and suspense as well as other high concept thrillers, for example Phone Booth, but is still not without it's finer points or commendable effort.There's a fairly lively cast at work, as well as Worthington in the lead role, we have the likes of Edward Burns, Harris in one of his more slimier turns as the corrupt mayor, rising newcomer Anthony Mackie, as well as former Billy Elliott Jamie Bell, whose screen partner provides the titillating eye candy.The film also subtly throws in stabs at current social issues, such as the fall out on ordinary people from the global recession and the callousness of those in the twenty four hour news world, taking pictures on their camera phones and goading a man to jump as he stands on a ledge. All that it has to blend in with the unfolding story at hand, which is a bit of a shame if you think of how all the twists and turns don't come out in a genuinely surprising way or how it could have been a more thrilling experience all round in the hands of someone else. Still, it'll do as a piece of Saturday night fodder. ***",Man on a Ledge
27,bowmanblue,"Yeah, not bad actually",7,18 May 2014,"Okay, I didn't know what to expect when I watched this. And, after about fifteen minutes, the jury was still out. A man, played by Sam Worthington, climbs out onto a hotel ledge and threatens to jump. We don't know why yet. Hopefully we will. So I watched on.I guess the closest film like this was probably Phone Booth, i.e. it's primarily set in one, very public, location. However, Man on a Ledge is definitely different. Without giving too much away, the 'man' is on a mission and there are enough different locations in and around the building to hopefully not bore the viewer. There's action, conspiracies, baddies and everything you'd probably expect.Basically, it's a thriller and not a bad one at that. I didn't expect to like it. I'm not a fan of Sam Worthington generally and I thought the 'on a ledge' idea was a bit gimmicky and couldn't see where they were going to go with it.Now, on reflection, I'm glad I didn't know too much about the plot. I was pleasantly surprised.Not a classic, but certainly good enough to entertain (although you may have to suspend your disbelief to fully appreciate it - there were parts that may not quite have happened that way in real life - the heroes were pretty lucky in places, but isn't that why we watch films?).http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",Man on a Ledge

30,Floated2,Pleasantly Surprised,8,13 November 2013,"Man on a Ledge starring Sam Worthington was not much what I expected, which was a good thing. Having only seen the trailer a few times a while ago, and not revisiting it, my memory was not that stable. From my understanding the trailer does a great job at not showing too much information about the film (where as many trailers spoil a little too much). Man on a Ledge was a very solid action, thrill ride that kept you on your seat and interested where the story was heading. Sam Worthington does a great job as Nick, convincing as someone looking to commit suicide yet being able to stay level headed and not over the top. The supporting cast also does a fine job playing their parts, lead by Elizabeth Banks, Jamie Bell, Ed Harris, and Anthony Mackie. Nick being on the ledge is only part of the story but there is a reason as to why he does it, and a few bigger surprises come along the way. I found the film to be smarter than I had initially thought. I much so enjoyed its little twists as I was not expecting them. Many type of heist films such as this, people are very eagerly to criticize and look for ""plot holes"". Man of a Ledge does what is is set out to do, which is entertain, and for its runtime, it succeeds.

Not too much drama, fortunately, with a great cast that perform beautifully their roles, each one of them different and complicated. On the other hand, the end looses the whole atmosphere, even though the mystery that was created all through it, is solved, but somehow it feels like it was rushed to end.

32,TheMovieDiorama,Man On A Ledge overhangs its mildly entertaining plot with absurd plot conveniences.,5,28 February 2020,"Did you know that ""jumping"", the act of committing suicide by falling from a potentially deathly height, contributes three percent of suicides in Europe and the US? Did you also know that jumping makes up twenty percent of suicides in New York City alone? Suicide is no laughing matter. The observers may think otherwise down below, exercising ""suicide baiting"" to encourage the jumpers to plunge to their early demise. But, regardless, a serious subject matter.Leth's thriller exploits this self-destructive action by utilising it as a central plot device, to prove one man's innocence. Framed for the theft of a pristinely polished diamond, Nick climbs onto the ledge of the twenty-first floor of the Roosevelt Hotel to provide a distraction for his brother to actually steal the prized jewel from the tyrannical businessman. Bystanders, news reporters, helicopters capturing footage and seemingly the entire NYPD are preoccupied by Nick's monotonous shenanigans, whose intentions to not jump are clear from the offset. Consequently, the diamond heist remains concealed, despite a generously loud explosion garnering them entry into the fortified vault. Whilst this is all happening, negotiators and police detectives attempt to investigate Nick's case before officers corrupted by Englander take matters into their own hands. Oh, and then interwoven snippets of his conspicuous ex-partner searching for Nick, whose backstory includes footage of him escaping custody at his father's funeral.Clearly, it's a cumbersome structure, with sub-plots peering off the ledge every ten minutes. Some hang on, others fall. The communication between Nick and Mercer, as she attempts to obtain his trust, remained grounded throughout. Worthington's lacklustre terrified monotony somehow complementing Banks' independent spirit, as she is disliked by her colleagues. The two conversing made for some real connections. Unfortunately, their conversations are merely padding, much like the entire man on a ledge distraction. The bulk of the narrative originates from Bell and Rodriguez' heist ordeal which, again, is absolutely solid on its own foundations. The close calls, self-sufficient dialogue and functionality of this sub-plot was crafted solidly. Insert a few double entendres occasionally, and viewers can expect mild entertainment from two enjoyable performances.However, once the corrupted officers are revealed and Englander becomes directly involved with this whole escapade, the story descends into a free-fall of convolution. Plot conveniences and coincidences are littered throughout. To the point where it becomes blatantly obvious to even the less observant of viewers. The heist, the proving of Nick's innocence, was somehow planned over many years and relied on Nick escaping custody, fleeing the police for a long duration of time, adopting a new name, booking the exact room on the exact floor of the exact hotel at the exact time that Englander would be undergoing his conference. A ludicrous amount, no wait, an impossible amount of factors that would've jeopardised the entire task. But hey, atleast Harris' performance was sublime yet again.For what it's worth, Man On A Ledge does provide disposable entertainment. The amalgamation of all the sub-plots, with some being more meaningful than others, were well edited. However the over-reliance on conveniences, the chaotically underwhelming conclusion and the exploitation of a suicide method, does teeter towards the stupid instead of the intelligent.",Man on a Ledge

35,dee.reid,"""Man on a Ledge"" (2012) review",8,2 July 2012,"You can say this much about Asger Leth's 2012 crime-thriller ""Man on a Ledge"": it really is about a man on a ledge.Ex-New York City cop Nick Cassidy (the always watchable Sam Worthington) has just escaped from prison, after doing two years for a crime he didn't commit. After masterminding the breakout that sets the movie in motion, he winds up at Manhattan's famed Roosevelt Hotel, dines on an (apparent) last meal of champagne and lobster, calmly opens a window, and climbs out onto the ledge of the building's 21st floor.Hold on, stop the presses! A crowd of gawkers inevitably forms on the streets below, eagerly waiting for Nick to take the plunge into oblivion. But things become complicated when it's soon revealed that there may be a lot more to Nick's scheme than a mere death wish. When New York City's finest arrive on the scene to try to talk him down, he insists on only talking to a disgraced alcoholic police negotiator named Lydia Mercer (Elizabeth Banks, whose troubled character appears to be a nursing a hang-over) - because Nick believes that they both have something in common with each other, in that they both know what it's like to have the whole world turn its back on them just when they needed help the most.That's just the first of many whoppers in a movie that has many and never really ceases to surprise as far as ""white-knuckle"" Hollywood thrillers go, and ""Man on a Ledge,"" in its own uniquely preposterous way, earns the title of a genuine ""white-knuckle"" thriller that keeps you watching - no matter how preposterous things may seem - and thoroughly on the edge of your seat.Nick's plan isn't just a mere spectacle to garner media attention to help prove his innocence, but it's also doubling as a carefully orchestrated heist of a $40 million diamond belonging to corrupt hotel mogul David Englander (Ed Harris) that also involves his younger brother Joey (Jamie Bell) and Joey's cheeky main squeeze Angela (Genesis Rodriguez). And as the movie progresses, Lydia and her skeptical former partner Jack Doughtery (Edward Burns) begin seeing for themselves the holes in the official story regarding Nick's presumed guilt by the courts and soon find themselves fighting on his side along with him, as well.""Man on a Ledge"" does have a bit of contemporary relevance going on during its proceedings, with its script that was expertly authored by Pablo F. Fenjves. Immediately following the revelation of Nick's plight and the assembling of the masses down on the street 21 stories below him, the movie sort of becomes a modern-day take on ""Dog Day Afternoon"" (1975), with Nick becoming a parable of the so-called ""99%"" (a class I gladly fall into), as well as a modern-day folk hero. People on the street clamor around Nick because they believe that could be any of us up there threatening to jump - for whatever reason that they may have to be up there in the first place.Sam Worthington was the main reason I saw this movie, even though the film's many sub-plots and Big Reveals can sometimes take away from his star-power. He delivers an engaging and riveting performance here, just like he did in other noteworthy Hollywood productions like ""Terminator Salvation"" (2009), ""The Debt"" (2010) and my personal favorite of his so far, ""Avatar"" (2009). I personally loved watching him in those movies.Even though I was unsure of his character's exact nationality in this movie, I would hazard a guess that he's Irish? I'm only saying this because of how he would sometimes slip from an American English accent into an Aussie one in between line readings. Yet, while he may not be the most dramatic performer out there, he's at least highly engaging and watchable, and is always good at portraying the true Everyman; his ""Avatar"" director, James Cameron, said he's the type of guy you could definitely have a beer with after a hard day of work and you could quickly become the best of chums. This last part is especially why he's one of my favorite performers of the moment - despite any bad raps he gets for his acting performances.""Man on a Ledge"" is a movie that no matter how ridiculous its many plot twists and Big Reveals may seem, is a movie that kept this viewer thoroughly on the edge of his seat.

37,estebangonzalez10,"Several plot holes, but entertaining thriller/heist film",6,9 May 2012,"¨Today is the day when everything changes. One way or another. ¨ Man on a Ledge is the latest thriller starring Sam Worthington who has made a name for himself in several blockbuster action films like Terminator Salvation, Avatar, and Wrath of the Titans. These films have been box office hits, but he still hasn't managed to make it among the A-list actors in my opinion. This was a lower budget film and it had its flaws, but it was still an interesting and entertaining thriller. Sam actually chose this role because he liked the script and wanted to face his fear of heights since most of the film takes place on the ledge of a 200 foot building. This is Asger Leth's first feature film, since he previously had only directed a documentary, and Pablo Fenjves wrote this original script which is actually his first screenplay as well since his previous work had been for television movies. I was surprised these guys got so many talented actors on board for this film, but I guess Sam's presence helped. The script is interesting and it has some good thrills, but there are several plot holes in the heist that takes place, and many elements seemed borrowed from other famous thrillers we've seen before. Man on a Ledge lacks some originality, but the film still manages to entertain for most part. There is an interesting secondary cast and Worthington does a decent job as the lead although he doesn't have much space to work with. Be warned this film could give you some goose bumps if you're afraid of heights.The film opens with a man renting a Hotel room under a fake name and then writing a suicide note before he opens the window and climbs to the ledge of the 200 foot building in Manhattan. Someone spots him from the street and calls the police. Soon the police arrive, and so do the firefighters and SWAT team. There is a flashback where we see the same man in prison. His real name is Nick Cassidy (Sam Worthington) and he is talking to one of his visitors, his ex partner in the police force, Mike (Anthony Mackie) who is telling him that the case seems lost and he will have to spend 25 more years in prison. Nick claims to be innocent and escapes from prison when he is allowed to attend his father's funeral. He has a discussion with his younger brother Joey (Jamie Bell) and when the police officers are distracted he escapes. This is what takes us to the present event, but now Nick is on the ledge of the building and asks for a high profile negotiator named Lydia Mercer (Elizabeth Banks). As the movie goes on we begin to discover new things about Nick and his case. There is more to the simple suicide attempt than meets the eye; Nick is really trying to clear his name and prove his innocence while a heist is going on across another building.Genesis Rodriguez, Edward Burns, Kyra Sedgwick, and Ed Harris are also among the talented cast. Rodriguez and Bell sort of have the funnier and lighter dialogues although I didn't think it worked out really well. The film works thanks to a good performance from Worthington who always has you feeling like if you were on the ledge with him. Banks is also good in her role, while the rest of the cast really have no screen time. The heist scene is very interesting at first, but it begins to have too many plot holes and too many things have to go their way in order for it to really work. It wasn't very believable, but it still was entertaining and had me at the edge of my seat at times. I really didn't like how the end of the movie played out, but I can't judge the film entirely based on the ending. I have to admit I had a good time during most of the movie so I can't say this was a bad movie. If you are into thrillers then you will probably like this film.

38,juneebuggy,A fun original thrill ride,8,24 September 2014,"I liked this movie and was kinda surprised by all the bad reviews. I think what I liked the most was that this was a different sort of story than I'd seen before, at least in the first 40 minutes.Sam Worthington plays Nick Cassidy a cop turned fugitive threatening to jump from a Manhattan hotel rooftop. As an NYPD psychologist works to talk him down she learns that he may have a hidden motive for taking his own life as the biggest diamond heist ever committed is in motion and things aren't what they seem.I'm one of those people who enjoys a movie where you have to figure stuff out and initially this is a huge guessing game as you have no clear idea what is going on or why 'Nick' is doing what he's doing. His story is slowly revealed and unfortunately this gets very clichéd the further along we go, including a super happy ending that was a bit much.

This is undoubtedly the movies strong point, as it sets up the plot perfectly. Nonetheless the base plot stands on very tall legs with chance playing a key part of the plan and its success. The initial promise tumbles slowly due to this and the solid grip of suspense dissipates ending with low interest in the final outcome and high predictability. Actors also fail to develop bonds giving interaction a disjointed uninterested feel. Especially lacking is the Banks - Worthington duo, which as key to the plot, comes out tired and forced (that said Worthington himself is improving in leaps and bounds as an actor).Plot holes are pretty abundant, but overall the scriptwriter seems to focus on hiding the apparent flaws, rather than correcting them, eking out a jumbled mess when he labours to connect all the threads to something resembling coherence.

Why is the guy on the ledge there, why does he specifically want the one negotiator that keeps messing up? Do they have a history, did she drive him to the ledge?

There's just no surprise anymore after the first fifteen minutes, you know exactly what's going to happen and when. When we FINALLY get to the grand finale, things really get downright kooky. This ""average everyday guy"" suddenly goes Schwarzie on us and casually jumps from ledge to ledge, it could be so bad it's funny but the action set pieces are so stale that you just feel tired while watching them.

The old joke comes to mind that talks not so much being afraid of heights, or even falling, but instead the real fear is the landing. Ouch! Ouch! The camera work is outstanding. You feel as though you are on that ledge. Even though, in time, you get to know the entire plot, this continues to be very intense, and suspenseful because the acting performances are so believable. Kudos. And, then there is another aspect: there are dirty cops and which ones are they? How are they involved in all this? Also, to heighten the suspense and tension, there is the quickness of those revolving editing clips that take you to and from the ledge, the street below, the hotel window Nick stepped through and where police negotiator Lydia Mercer (Elizabeth Banks) hangs out, the Police Command Post Van, the team breaking into the diamond vault to help Nick, and, of course, the news people and police headquarters gathering information on Nick. All this helps insure you don't take your eyes from the screen. And, you don't. The movie did attempt some comic relief with supposedly humorous banter by the team breaking into the diamond vault and that banter fell flat. The seriousness of the matter, with Nick on the ledge, did not call for this type of behavior and was completely out-of-place. Not good. All in all, very good, and well-acted by all. Very entertaining. (7/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: One F-bomb only. Other than that only soft stuff and not much of that.",Man on a Ledge

Once you really get into the action, because before that, all you get is one hour of back story, action settings and writers trying to confuse us. I myself almost gave up, when I realized what the whole thing was really about, 30 or so minutes into the movie. But I stuck to it, got the explanation I wanted and a nice action packed ending, that was a little too easy, but really satisfying. Then the movie concluded on a sweet note, that made you care for the characters even more. I say good watch. The casting is pretty good too, even Elizabeth Banks and Edward Burns who were my least favorite picks at first. Great cameo by Kyra Sedgwick too, it made me want to watch a Closer episode.",Man on a Ledge

The filming is great and the acting is just fine.All in all, if you want to go to an entertaining film that's a fun watch you could do much worse that MOAL; it might be schlock but it knows it - it takes itself just seriously enough to be a good film, but never so seriously that you won't forgive it the usual caper like moves.

We got to see a lot of ledge but they did throw in a few really well done overhead shots that helped offer perspective as to the height and such.

48,saadgkhan,surprisingly entertaining,7,15 May 2012,"Man on a Ledge – CATCH IT (B+) Man on a Ledge is perfect combination of a Heist & man on a Ledge... It's a story of a man on a ledge, who wants to prove his innocence in diamond stolen case. Ever since Avatar, Sam Worthington has been appeared in multiple disappointing movies and delivers utmost wooden average performances. I actually started to believe that he is only one dimensional actor. You can give him any role, rich or poor he will look and act the same. Though ""Man on a Ledge"" is not a kind of movie to judge some one's caliber as an actor but Sam did impressed me. He was energetic and enigmatic. It won't be wrong to say that he literally nailed this part. Elizabeth Banks did a decent job. Jaime Bell & Genesis Rodriguez are hot & great together. Anthony Mackie, Ed Burns & Ed Harris are alright in it. Overall, it's surprisingly entertaining and critics never like something fulfilling the commercial norms.",Man on a Ledge

But in a film where characterisation is of minimal consequence, he's charismatic enough to get through. Man on a Ledge is such a film. In fact, this ludicrous thriller cares very little for any of the players, instead concentrating on the game. There are some genuinely tense scenes – mostly involving Jamie Bell and Genesis Rodriguez attempting to steal a $40m diamond – and the vertigo-inducing premise is intriguing for the initial hour, yet by the final act there's nothing more than a cheap curiosity holding it together thanks to one plot contrivance too many. Considering the supporting cast included Bell, Ed Harris, Elizabeth Banks, Anthony Mackie and Titus Welliver, it's a real shame that director Asger Leth couldn't extract more from them too.

51,hnt_dnl,Enjoyed the heck out of this movie!,9,10 December 2013,"""The proof is in the pudding!"" Famous quote that I sometimes forget too often. The 1-out-of-4-star rating attached to MAN ON A LEDGE (2012) that I kept seeing as I was flipping through my HBO channels was making me continue to skip this nifty, well-acted and plotted, hugely entertaining flick. I've come to realize that HBO tends to go by film critics when they rate the movies they air and THAT should have been my red flag! While I'll admit that SOMETIMES, critics know what they're talking about when it comes to certain movies that may tend to get overlooked or ignored by the general public, for the most part, they can be sticks in the mud! MOAL is definitely worth a watch to appreciate how good it really is.I thought this movie was going to be utter, forgettable crap going into it. The only thing I knew going in was that it starred dubious up-and-comer Sam Worthington (from the extremely overrated ""Avatar"", the horrid remake of ""Clash of the Titans"", and the terrible ""Terminator Salvation""), so the thought of forcing myself to watch a film starring Worthington didn't appeal to me. BUT, I'm glad to say that Worthington more than acquits himself extremely well (even if his accent slips a bit from time to time). I'd say that MOAL is easily the best performance so far of his career and he should take on more down-to-earth everyman roles like this one and stay away from the fantasy/sci-fi genre! Because Worthington really BRINGS IT in this surprisingly strong nail-biter.Worthington stars as wrongly accused ex-cop Nick Cassidy, who breaks out of prison after a 2-year stint, checks himself into a swank New York City hotel under a fake name, eats his ""last"" meal, then proceeds to step out onto the ledge (thus the film's title). When the cops show up, Cassidy demands to talk to no one but a infamous police negotiator Lydia Mercer (superbly played by Elizabeth Banks), a woman who for months has been a scarred, alcoholic, emotional wreck due to a recent failure with another jumper. I've seen Banks in mostly comedic roles prior to MOAL, and she REALLY impressed me with her dramatic work here, very convincing as a gritty, world-weary cop.In addition to the well-cast Worthington and Banks, what really sold me on this flick as being a keeper is the excellent supporting cast, who ALL made the most of their roles. Edward Burns (as Mercer's cop assistant) makes a welcome return-to-screen presence (hadn't seen this actor in ages) and I enjoyed his back-and-forth banter with Banks. Anthony Mackie (from ""The Hurt Locker"" and ""Eagle Eye"") is rock solid as Nick's former partner and friend. Titus Welliver (who always seems to be playing a tough NYC cop) is forceful in his limited screen time as the SWAT team leader. William Sadler (most famous for being the ""Die Hard 2"" villain) is engaging as a hotel employee who empathizes with Nick's plight. Kyra Sedgwick plays her role as the reporter on the scene with unabashed relish. The great Ed Harris is appropriately megalomaniacal as the wealthy businessman whose diamond that Nick was accused of stealing, the crime that landed Nick in prison. And last, but certainly not least, are the freshman cast members Jamie Bell (as Nick's younger brother Joey) and Genesis Rodriguez (as Joey's girlfriend Angie) who almost manage to steal the movie from the vets! The way this film plays out, one can tell that the director Asger Leth paid a lot of care in developing the characters, giving each one a distinct personality. Additionally, I think the plot of MOAL is deceptively simple enough to follow the first time, but still intriguing and intricate enough to demand repeat viewing just to catch little details that might be missed the first time. This flick is WAY better than the film critics give it credit for! It moves at a fast pace, but not too fast, and the action shifts enough for the viewer not to get bored and stuck in one scene for too long. While combining elements of several popular action-heist-negotiation flicks before, MOAL has it's originality combining these elements into one energetic, self-aware, confidently told flick! Highly recommended!",Man on a Ledge
52,thekarmicnomad,Old fashion Heist movie -needs a little sparkle,6,11 June 2012,"This is a take on an old fashion heist movie. Someone is stuck in a dire situation but they have a desperate plan to get out of it.As with all these kinds of movies the writers have to do quite a lot with not much to work with.At the end of the day this is mainly about a man stuck on a ledge; short of Godzilla attacking the ledge halfway through this is pretty much it and the viewer needs to get to grips with this before deciding to invest their time in this movie.There are some moments of tension but don't expect much in the way of fireworks or chemistry.

My friends and I were watching T.V and we see a preview for a movie with a guy standing on a ledge of a building. Then the title reads ""Man on a ledge"" and naturally we all start howling with laughter. The ridiculous name for this movie was the first speed bump then second was Sam Worthingtons atrocious attempt at doing an American accent. I never knew if his character was Australian or American. The story line was alright it kept you interested but there is more then its share of silly moments.This movie is about a man who one day crawls out on the ledge of a building and threatens to jump while a hoard on onlookers eagerly await seeing him splat. Unknowing to the crowd all this is a ruse to keep everyone attention away from a robbery thats really going on around the block.This movie was OK but it definitely had its problems. Acting was a major one Sam Worthington is awful. The plot was a nice take on a heist movie but the dialouge and writing left me disappointed as I did not care about any of the characters or what happened. Good for one time watch.",Man on a Ledge
55,vostf,"Lacks ambition, i.e. talent",3,22 February 2012,"Unoriginal. But execution could have made this a suspenseful thriller all the same.First flaw is the dotted editing: this movie has to be about the Man on a Ledge, right? This is the concept, hanging by the thread of how good a suspense you can build. The hero is not gonna jump but you've got to make him the centre of the unfolding story, with consistent new elements and twists and turns. Tough challenge.Maybe it was too great a challenge - well, it's all a matter of talent and strong-will - and they went for the easy busy highway. Thus we get a tension diluted with flashbacks + routine scenes with the supporting cast.And here lies the second big flaw. Since they didn't feel confident with the tense suspense of a Man on a Ledge during the whole flick, they also wanted to had some humour in the parallel storyline. This one should have been the suspense catalyst but in the end they must have thought it was not so great an idea, thus tongue in cheek it is.In the end there's nothing new or really engaging in the script, in the characters or in the way the story is told. It's not really well done: either they lacked talent and ambition or the concept wasn't so high-level after all. Anyway with talent you can work a flimsy story into something more interesting, that takes ambition and willingness to ditch all the tired clichés of the genre.About Sam Worthington: I found that he stole the show back in Terminator 4 opposite an overacting Christian Bale, then he was missing in CGI-acting in a similar/avatar role and now this movie does nothing to make him look better than a thick guy.",Man on a Ledge
56,JohnRayPeterson,Enjoyable thriller,7,12 June 2012,"I was curious to see if this movie could deliver on the plot and performances level, it did so sufficiently for me. As in most movies of the genre, especially from Hollywood, you can pretty much expect the outcome to be no big surprise. The good guys win; if you dismiss every movie for that reason, you will be dismissing most movies from Hollywood. In Man On The Ledge, it's the ride from the beginning to the end you should find interesting.Anyone who feels queasy looking down from high places will find this movie exciting; if you suffer from vertigo, be prepared to be catching your breath in a few scenes. I liked the idea of this movie's plot, the lead character Nick Cassidy, an escaped convict, is committing a daring heist to prove he was not guilty of that very crime a few years before. Cassidy is providing a diversion so his team can execute the heist, and a solid diversion it is.Though there aren't big names in the flick, there are experienced actors who deliver performances like the professionals they are. Ed Harris and Titus Welliver are such experienced actors whose characters are familiar to us. They have played these roles countless times before; they play their bad guy roles just the way we expect them to in this movie. Edward Burns is also playing a relatively familiar good guy role. Sam Worthington, who plays lead Nick Cassidy delivers a solid performance as does Jamie Bell in his role as Nick's brother. Genesis Rodriguez is in fine form, one you'll not tire of seeing, really. The movie has all the key elements a good heist should have; suspense, twists and turns, all are present. If the last couple of movies you watched recently were dramas, Man On The Ledge will be a nice change of pace, so I recommend it on that basis. I quite enjoyed it.",Man on a Ledge
57,Likes_Ninjas90,"Well before the first hour mark, that ledge was looking mighty tempting",4,2 February 2012,"Nick Cassidy (Sam Worthington) walks into a room in the Roosevelt Hotel, has one last meal and then stands outside on the ledge of the building. His positioning catches the attention of the public and the media below. In a flashback we learn that Nick was once a cop, partnered with Mike (Anthony Mackie) but then also a prison escapee, claiming he was framed. He manages to escape while at the funeral of his father, much to the distress of his brother Joey (Jamie Bell). Back in the present and Nick asks for the police negotiator Lydia Spencer (Elizabeth Banks) so that he can gain further media attention. She's pressured for results by Jack (Edward Burns), a hardened cop. Meanwhile, Joey and his girlfriend Angie (Genesis Rodriguez) are staging an elaborate heist in a nearby building, attempting to steal a valuable rock from corrupt businessman David Englander (Ed Harris). It becomes increasingly clear that the threads between the two brothers are somehow related. This disappointing thriller plummets quickly to its death before it can ever catch any air. What's missing here are threads of equal weight and importance. Director Asger Leth is fixated on what is essentially a gimmicky premise, and like its main character, it has nowhere to go. I couldn't help but recall the recent heist comedy Tower Heist (2011) and its structure. Neither film is high art but Tower Heist at least saves its biggest and most elaborate set pieces till last. The rest of the film is spent developing characters that have distinct personalities, a lot of self-awareness and rather plausible knowledge about their target. Man on a Ledge is all of its title, save for an early flashback. Everything else happening around Nick simultaneously fails to engage. The heist in the nearby building is a series of tired stunts that we have been before in much better and more interesting films. There's even a laughably silly cloaking scene that echoes Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol (2011), only I don't think they were trying to be funny. Given how much time is spent on Joey and Angie, it feels ridiculously anti- climatic. A lack of continuity also sours the tension in their thread because despite being tested by various high-tech security devices, in the next sequence they're comfortably in the office of their nemesis, waiting for him. The only time the film really thrills is early on when the camera first makes the transition onto Nick's ledge. It tracks through the window and then out onto the ledge in one movement. Its impacting because we feel the separation and the contrast of the two spaces: from the safety of the interior, to what could be a sudden freefall outside. The realism of the early ledge scenes evaporates in favour of increasingly stupid behaviour and impossible stunts. My least favourite moments are shared between Nick swinging off the body of a rappelling SWAT soldier and also when Lydia decides that she'll come out onto the ledge too. Any commentary about the media below is watered down into mindless caricatures, including a story hungry reporter and the drones cheering for Nick. Dog Day Afternoon (1975) this is not. I wondered if the scene where people in the crowd are falling over each other to catch the money Nick hurls at them was Hollywood being self-reflective. No one in Hollywood at the moment seems more locked into gruff-mode than Sam Worthington. Aside from some convincing trembling, which may or may not have been acting, he fuels Nick with little more than his usual testosterone levels. All of his dialogue reads like taglines from an era of bygone Hollywood action stars. When asked whether he thinks about hurting himself in prison he says: ""Hurt myself? No. Kill Myself? Every goddamn day"". I don't know why Ed Harris is in this film beyond a paycheque because he's a far better actor than being forced to play Dr. Evil's corporate equivalent. Elizabeth Banks has the look of someone more suited to a fashion catalogue, rather than a burnout, repressed cop. Try not to laugh when she attempts to coax Nick off the ledge by offering to go to lunch with him. Acting chops are about the last Genesis Rodriguez from Entourage will be remembered for. Her relationship with Jamie Bell is an uninvolving one. The implausibility of this film, whether it's the relationships, the premise, stunts or dialogue, makes it extremely hard to endure. Well before the first hour mark, that ledge was looking mighty tempting.",Man on a Ledge
58,skepticskeptical,"Mildly Entertaining, Ridiculously Implausible",6,9 October 2015,"I want to say that I liked this film because it was pretty entertaining, all things considered. But there were so many ridiculous implausibilities and sitcom-like moments that I cannot really praise it as a work of art. It's always nice when the good guy prevails and the evil guy is exposed, but in this story it only happens by the grace of God or reasonable facsimile. The only reason why the convict framed for the theft of a jewel still in the possession of its owner ends up prevailing is because the latter was stupid enough to remove the rock from the safe in which it was stowed and then proceeded to walk around New York City with it in his pocket. On top of that, the idea that a couple of complete novices (the convict's brother and his girlfriend) could actually pull off entry into a top-security vault (where they did not find the diamond anyway, of course) stretches credulity to its breaking point. And then there were the gratuitous and nonsensical depictions of the girlfriend as a bimbo in a Victoria's Secret thong and push-up bra as she squeezed into her Emma Peel style skin-tight suit. And then there's the blonde negotiator, Mercer, who is also supposed to be something of a tramp but ends up together with the ex-convict after she helps him to clear his name.Overall, the ratio of deus ex machina to plausible plot was way too high. None of this could or would ever have happened. The tone is that of a gritty crime drama—with a touch of slapstick thrown in for laughs. I think that gritty crime dramas work better when what they depict could in fact happen in the real world. This was more like fantasyland. If pigs could fly, sure, but the main character in this film would have been killed or thrown back in the slammer, barring that.",Man on a Ledge

60,CANpatbuck3664,Man on a Ledge is Dumb and Shallow but its a Decent B Level Heist Movie,6,28 February 2017,"*Minor Spoilers Ahead* A relatively young man enters a nice hotel and checks in. He orders breakfast, tips the doorman, scribbles some notes down on a napkin and then decides to step out onto the ledge. He is quickly spotted by someone on the ground and the cops arrive. When they make their way up Jack Dougherty (Ed Burns) is initially in charge of the scene. He sticks his head out the window to initiate the negotiation but the man refuses to calm down or leave the ledge but he specifically asks for Lydia Mercer (Elizabeth Banks) and he won't talk to anyone else. Why would he do that? Who is this man? Is this a serious suicide attempt or is something else the endgame here? The critics of this film have said that the film is just too hopelessly stupid and has too many plot holes to overcome mediocrity. The defenders of this film have insisted that this is a B movie thriller and it hits the mark that it's trying to achieve. Nobody is claiming this to be an Oscar calibre picture. I'll get the negatives out of the way first. The real weakness of this movie is the fact that the heist is so implausible and one can find the holes just by glancing too long at it. Angie and Joey's professions are never divulged but they are able to come up with solutions on the spot that secret agents would have trouble with. These are supposed to be blue collar people! I'm sorry but Man on a Ledge hearkens back to Tower Heist on being just a little too slack when the heist is going down. This security system that is guarding the David's stuff would be way too advanced for an ex-cop and a couple of rookie thieves to bypass. There are other points where the plot strains plausibility. The fact that Nick gets clipped by a train and walks away without even a concussion is straight bull. The cast that has been assembled here is mainly of a bunch of actors I like, so with that in my mind, it was one of the factors that intrigued me about the movie. Starting with our protagonist, Sam Worthington gets a lot of grief as an actor. I don't think he's a really good one but he does possess a certain charm and screen presence. I thought he did a pretty good job here, he sells a lot of the film's bad dialogue and I thought there was some pretty decent bantering between him and Elizabeth Banks. He's not the type of star that would raise the grade on this movie despite its flaws but he's solid enough. The better performances came from the cops. I think Elizabeth Banks is extremely underrated as both a comedic and dramatic actress but I thought she was the best performer here. She holds her accent and she's actually compelling here as the hostage negotiator. I thought Anthony Mackie is good but he's totally undercut by a crappy plot twist. At the start of the movie, he's extremely likable and it just made me sad when he turns on a dime near the climax. I would also credit Jaime Bell specifically, he's the more interesting of the bandits and he helps bring the humour to a movie that desperately needed some at points. Ed Harris was probably the actor I liked the least. He's playing a heartless billionaire but he's not interesting. He's just a $#!&. There's no dimension to him as a character and even though I think Ed Harris is a good actor he certainly didn't help here. Genesis Rodriguez was weak in this movie. She's playing to stereotypes too hard, they don't give her enough to work with and there doesn't seem to be much to her outside of that. If there was anything else that I can credit the movie for, after the first 30 minutes the movie paced pretty well. It moves along briskly and it's got some pretty solid camera work. Even though I was tripping over the plot holes and some of the bad dialogue, it moved quickly enough and that it kept me interested as it came to its conclusion. I was in a pretty good mood when I watched this but when I try to compare it to other movies though, this is still head and shoulders above Tower Heist. The film manages to coast by on its premise, some decent acting, a quick pace and solid camera work. It has its problems but I would agree that this is an expensive B movie that isn't aiming to be a classic like an Ocean's Eleven. It set its sights much lower and if you can look past the big pile of stupid that sits right in front of it, you could have a good time watching it. It just barely got past the finish line though.",Man on a Ledge

However I found the plot frustrating, Standing on a ledge of a high building seemed an excessive and pointless way to try to prove his innocence. The attempt to steal the Diamond was all that was necessary and there would have been much better and safer ways to cause a distraction.
The ending was also frustrating since all that planning to steal the Diamond it was easily taken from them. The very silly jumping off was Hollywood overdoing it as usual.

It just isn't fair to wipe out a perfectly good Sunday with two bad films. I consoled myself with the thought of a Misfits session to improve the day if this turned into a turkey, too.While Misfits transpired to be a temptation too great to resist, I needn't have worried. It won't go down in history as an all-time great but if you enjoyed the likes of The Siege and Heist you'll go along with Man On a Ledge. It's an action, thriller, revenge, heist, shove-it-in-your-pipe-and-smoke-it, sit back and go with the ride flick. Go with fun in mind and don't think too much about plot holes or the likelihood of a certain character hitting the mark in a particular scene (no plot spoilers here). It's not reality, it's optical bubblegum, okay? Nick Cassidy (Sam Worthington) is a cop doing time for stealing a $40m diamond from scumbag public figure David Englander (Ed Harris, chewing scenery) and goes on the run when escorted by armed prison guards to his dad's funeral. Except he doesn't head to Mexico, as any sensible escaped felon would, but opts to stand on the ledge of a hotel and threaten to jump in full view of the New York residents who help things along by yelling ""Go on, jump!"" But, in case you haven't seen the trailer, which reveals too much, all is not quite as simple as it seems.Actually, for those who have seen the trailer, it is simple. If you know the way Hollywood works with such fare, you'll know where this is heading. There are no great shocks but it is compelling and throws in a couple of entertaining reveals while trundling along like all good thrillers. But for a higher body count, it could easily have been directed by Tony Scott although it is actually the fiction directorial debut of Asger Leth. Never heard of him? No, neither had I. But you will again, that's a certainty after Man On a Ledge.The cast is rounded out with some reliable B-listers (particularly Jamie Bell and Elizabeth Banks) and sex appeal comes in the form of Genesis Rodriguez, all of whom add pace and interest to what would otherwise be a dull film – how much fun can be had by watching a bloke standing on a the wrong side of a hotel wall? The dialogue is clunky at times, particularly between Bell and Rodriguez who, without explanation, bicker and scowl at each other. I'm sure it was supposed to add tension to the scenes but they came across as petulant teenagers and it diluted the sense of pressure.There's an unforgivable, utterly pointless moment of schmaltz in the final scene but ultimately the film does the job it sets out to do: it entertains. I left the cinema thinking That was really good, but by the time I'd bought a pint of milk and some crumpets my enthusiasm had settled into Okay, that was fun but I'm hungry and I want a dose of wrongness.And that's where Misfits came in.Another film review from The Squiss.

66,kdnor2011,A Big Surprise,8,1 September 2012,"Like quite a few people in the world, I have a fear of heights. So naturally a movie about a man on a building ledge hundreds of feet off the ground would probably terrify me. Well we'll get to that in a second, but this movie actually surprised me. When I saw that it's running time was over and hour and a half I began to realize how thin this premise can be. There is only so long a man can be on a ledge before it becomes boring. Well, this movie was quite the adreneline rush.The biggest problem I had was that I felt no fear of the man being as high as he was. I don't know why, he wasn't like it was so poorly filmed that I knew he was always on a set, maybe it's just because I saw it on the small screen and not the big one. There are two characters who literally just come right into the movie, they aren't established they just come right in, even though we do get to know them. And this movie has way too much stuff going on.But you know what, all that stuff going on gave me an adreneline rush. It starts off a bit slow, but as the movie goes on I was starting to get pumped up during the story. I kept getting tense whenever something would happen that didn't seem to be going to plan, and there are some twists that work out really well. The acting is good, nothing great but good. And I love how it shows how much society loves to see death as long as they don't know the person. Every person on the ground wants him to jump.Man on a ledge was a huge surprise, its starts slow and doesn't really have the ""we're high up so you should be scared"" feeling. But it's a fast paced, adreneline pumped, twist filled ride that I'm glad I saw.",Man on a Ledge

68,Ramascreen,Jump already!,3,29 January 2012,"-- www.Ramascreen.com --There really is no other way to describe MAN ON A LEDGE than to simply call it Phone Booth meets The Negotiator. It's a mildly entertaining thriller that throws originality out the window. I think it's cute that it badly wants to be taken as a smart, edgy, heist action with unexpected twists and turns but once that juice runs out, as soon as the creativity hits the wall, everything about this movie falls apart..Somebody needs to tell Sam Worthington to either get an acting coach or fire the one he already has because not only does his terrible American accent keeps going on and off, the man practically has the same expression and presence in all his movies, at least since Avatar, which is probably the first time that general American audiences were exposed to Worthington. Elizabeth Banks is as dull as dull can be, talking to a negotiator like that makes you want to jump off the ledge instead. Other better-staged heist films would see MAN ON A LEDGE and laugh their ass off.MAN ON A LEDGE is essentially is a man who tries to prove his innocence, there's a plot within a plot, he makes the world think one situation while another related situation is happening at the same time. The interaction between the negotiator Lydia Mercer (Banks) and Nick Cassidy (Worthington) is underdeveloped. The only great performance in this film is by Ed Harris and even he couldn't save this ship from sinking. The way the film plays all sides is uneven and it's so obvious about it. The whole thing does feel like a it's handled by inexperienced filmmakers and screenwriters who bite off more than they can chew and so the results are consistent plot holes, surprises that don't make any sense and easy way outs. -- www.Ramascreen.com --",Man on a Ledge

71,Chris_Pandolfi,"He's Innocent, and He Has a Ridiculous Scheme to Prove It",5,27 January 2012,"The premise of ""Man on a Ledge"" is not very likely when it starts, and it only gets progressively less likely the further it goes until it reaches an ending that might as well have been written for a fantasy novel. This might not have been a problem had the filmmakers gone all out and made it an escapist spy thriller – say, something along the lines of James Bond. Unfortunately, it was clear to me that they were taking this material seriously, and they actually expected audiences to do the same. This applies, oddly enough, to moments of levity so glaringly out of place that even listening to them is downright embarrassing. In a movie like this, you can't convincingly lighten a tense and dramatic moment, especially when the dialogue is such that it wouldn't pass muster in a second-rate romantic comedy.The film stars Sam Worthington, who's a decent enough actor but probably shouldn't be relied upon for American roles. He's not the best at faking the accent it requires; his natural Australian voice will repeatedly surface throughout the film, which only makes his character sound odd. He plays Nick Cassedy, who begins the film by checking himself into a room at New York's Roosevelt Hotel, eating a meal, wiping everything he touched to remove fingerprints, writing a brief note, opening the window, and stepping out onto a narrow ledge. We then jump back in time one month, at which point we learn that he escaped incarceration at Sing Sing when he was allowed to attend his father's funeral. We also learn that he was at one time a cop, adding even more intrigue.Back to what I think is the present. A sizeable crowd has gathered at the intersection below, causing gridlock and street closures. The police have gotten involved and attempt to negotiate. As it turns out, there's only one person Nick is willing to speak to. Here enters Lydia Mercer (Elizabeth Banks), a professional negotiator who, after failing to talk a cop out of jumping off a bridge, has lost the respect of her peers. At this point, we learn that Nick was imprisoned for stealing a large diamond; he's now on the ledge in a desperate attempt to prove his innocence. He claims that he was set up by the diamond's owner, a powerful tycoon named David Englander (Ed Harris), a vile and shallow corporate typecast. Lydia initially doesn't believe Nick, although the more he talks, the more convincing he sounds. Is it possible that he's telling her the truth?Meanwhile, Nick's brother, Joey (Jamie Bell), and his girlfriend, Angie (Genesis Rodriguez), have infiltrated the building across the street. Their assignment: Break into Englander's vault and find the diamond. At their disposal are all manner of elaborate gadgets and gizmos, and of course, they will have to have crawl through air ducts, descend into rooms on cables, sidestep surveillance cameras and heat detectors, cut wires attached to alarms, and drill through metal doors. Why the filmmakers felt the need to make part of this story a ""Mission: Impossible"" rip off, I have no idea. It probably wouldn't have been so bad had Joey and Angie not been reduced to comedy relief; they repeatedly argue and make flippant comments like a married couple in a badly written sitcom. Only in a movie like this could something so inane be crossed with a jewel heist.Other characters work their way into the story, playing their contrived parts. There's Nick's former partner and friend, Mike Ackerman (Anthony Mackie). There's Jack Dougherty (Edward Burns), an obnoxious detective who does little more than push Lydia's buttons, even when he starts to take her seriously. And then there's Nathan Marcus (Titus Welliver), who has the tough-talking New York cop stereotype down to a tee. The single most unnecessary character is a scoop-hungry news reporter who, despite being white and blonde, is named Suzie Morales – with heavy Hispanic emphasis on her last name. The fact that she's played by Kyra Sedgwick doesn't shed any light on the issue.I suspect the plot wasn't intended to get more and more ridiculous as it plays out, but that's exactly what happens. The final quarter features two twists, one of which was expected due to the conventions movies like this operate under. The other was a genuine surprise, which isn't to say it was effective; it's a turn of events so arbitrary and nonsensical that I'm wondering if it was shot during postproduction and spliced in at the eleventh hour. But the greatest offense of ""Man on a Ledge"" was its very unflattering depiction of New Yorkers, who actively encourage Nick to jump and salivate greedily when Nick makes it rain money. The comparisons to ""Dog Day Afternoon"" become unavoidable when one of the onlookers, disgusted by the oppression of the everyman, actually starts chanting, ""Attica! Attica!"" -- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)",Man on a Ledge

73,nicolechan916,Pretty exciting once it gets into it.,7,13 October 2014,"At first, I was not engaged in the start of the film at all. It felt like it took a bit too long to get started and I almost turned it off. But I guess the beginning was a much needed exposition for the story to carry on. The story got much more interesting after Cassidy got onto the ledge and we realize that something else is happening and that he is just the diversion.The acting was pretty good, I believed that they were their characters. I would have like a bit more background on Mercer to get a more in depth picture of her character, and is she a detective or a police psychologist? The dialogue between Cassidy and Mercer was good though and clearly showed how they bonded quickly.It was also pretty exciting and a little thrilling watching the brother and his girlfriend break into the vault. The juxtaposition of Cassidy on the ledge and the other Cassidy breaking into the building across the street created this rising sense of suspense. The effects were on point too. Not too much but enough to be believable.I did not really like the ending.

74,doorsscorpywag,It does what it says on the tin.,2,12 May 2012,"Like Ronseal this film does exactly what it says on the tin. It's about a man on a ledge. And that is about it really as the actual story and the actions of the characters are too stupid for words. Bloke gets sent to prison for 25 years for stealing Ed Harris stuff and over a couple of years conceives a brilliant and cunning plan to prove his innocence based on a series of utterly ridiculous assumptions that leave plot holes wider than the Grand Canyon. He stands on a ledge and distracts a particularly bored New York on what must have been a pretty dull day whilst his brother tries to prove his innocence with a sexy Latina babe with enormous earrings. The whole plan is daft even for Hollywood and consists of blowing a hole in a skyscraper roof and defeating some hi tech security with a skate board a and fire extinguisher. It depends totally in the naivety of a woman negotiator, the utter stupidity of the NYPD and the crassness of New Yorkers who seemed to enjoy watching a man on a ledge hoping to see him jump. Even going as far as chanting 'Jump' at one point. But Sam Worthington wins them over by doing a few acrobatics and throwing money at them as Billy Elliot dances his way through a series of unbelievable Mission Impossible style situations to expose the evil Ed Harris with the aid of a 'magic bag' that contains everything you need to carry out an Impossible Mission. From skateboard, invisibility cloak, sexy attire for his assistant and a portable diamond drill which I know for a fact is a rather heavy piece of equipment but the magic bag makes it all light as a feather until he needs it. The plot is stupid enough but we never learn anything about the characters. Why is Ed so evil. What was the back story about the diamond? We will never know as it's just mentioned in passing. The ending is absolutely stupid as the NYPD show how they are slightly less professional then the Keystone Cops and Evil Ed does the stupidest thing ever shown in a movie to allow Sam to win the day. The crowd turn their jeers to cheers and we meet Sam now released in a bar and learn that the whole film hung on one incident that was frankly impossible without the collusion of whole departments of New Yorks administration which render the whole premise of the film completely ridiculous because it could never happen. Yes there is a bit of fun in it and a tiny speck of excitement but overall it was dumb even by Hollywood standards.",Man on a Ledge

Well off course he is. Wouldn't be much off a movie otherwise would it? There's a lot ""Man on a ledge"" gets right. It has Ed Harris, Jamie Bell, and Edward Burns in it after all. Having said that it also has Elizabeth Banks. Not that I've anything against her. But she always looks out off place to me when she's in anything other than a comedy.There are some half decent twists in the plot, as well as a couple off dumb, pointless ones. The dizzying heights that Worthington is towering above work in the films favour, but some off the silly moments in the script work against it. Plus there is a ridiculously hot girl in the film which seems so right, but for all the wrong reasons.

78,daggersineyes,This is worth a watch or two,6,28 September 2013,"The ""scathing"" reviews of this movie are amusing. I don't know what they were expecting but I think this movie does what it says on the package. While it's no great Academy Award winning effort, it most certainly isn't ""awful"" or ""garbage"".Ledge is a nice, interesting thriller with a good plot and some great action sequences (and a silly name). The acting is fine. I always enjoy Sam Worthington's under-stated acting and his co-stars were okay, apart from Ed Harris who (as he often does) hammed it up too much and under- mined the suspense a little when he was on screen. The direction is OK but I can't help thinking that in a more experienced director's hands this would have been a lot more suspenseful & thrilling. Nevertheless it's still got enough suspense, interesting characters, thrills, occasional giggles etc to make it a worthwhile watch and an entertaining evening's viewing. Ledge doesn't pretend to be the next best Oscar-winning, deep & meaningful blockbuster. It's a solid basic suspense story with a few twists, lots of clichés (but they work in movies like this!), the inevitable forgivable plot-holes and a happy ending for most of the characters. (NB Incidentally, some of the ""plot holes"" I've seen people complaining about are not actually ""plot holes"" at all. They're just bits that are not explained or shown in the movie. For example, there may well have been an internal investigation into the events of the day. But that's not relevant to this story so of course they didn't go into it. No-one cares :))Ledge is not a movie to ""make you think"" or an exploration of any serious, burning issue in life. It's quite simply a fun flick with lots of pretty to look at, twists to intrigue you and action to entertain. If you watch movies to be entertained rather than to pick them apart then you'll have a great time with this one! :)",Man on a Ledge
79,JurijFedorov,Fun and fast-paced action that's for sure worth a watch,8,11 October 2021,"Did I have lots of fun the FULL runtime of the movie? Yes. So that's the complaint?I've been avoiding watching this movie because the title just reminds me of many mediocre movies I've already watched so I was sure I had watched this one already. I hadn't so I finally did it and boy was it a mistake to skip it. The movie is not perfect by any means so it's not some action masterpiece. You can't get it all right, unfortunately Elizabeth Banks plays a leading role. I guess I can tolerate her in a movie where the cast is this big. All the actors are fine to good. There is not too much to do here for actors as the plot is the center-piece. This is a silly action movie like Ocean's 11. Don't expect all scenes to make sense or all people to act 100% rationally. There is quite a bit of silliness when we need to go from plot point to plot point in impossible situations. Hell, right at the start we see the lead escape from prison and even that alone seems iffy and lucky. Like, there is a ton here that would require unimaginable luck to pull off and anyone planning it would be completely deluded and crazy and not understand basic stats. So I'll get it if someone couldn't believe this actually could happen this way. Well, it couldn't. But what we have is a very well-shot movie with fast pace, lots of good actors, good action, tension from start till finish and some funny jokes. It's like Ocean's 11. A ton of craziness combining into a tight and fun plot that does require you to see luck as quite a different size in their universe.It's getting rare these days that a movie can have my full attention from start till finish. I have seen it all and really don't want to watch movies with weak plot anymore. So I'm looking for these kind of flicks with super clever scripts where everything makes sense and combines into one single storyline. This movie reminds me of Red Eye (2005) too where everything is clear and we move towards one single goal with a lot of tricks and new elements everywhere yet everything feels real because the action is focused on the goal and we know what everyone wants.Basically, it's fun action movie with fast pace and zero downtime anywhere whatsoever. It also doesn't become overly emotional or R-rated which makes this easy to watch any time of the day or in any mood really. This is rare in a movie. I have to give it 8/10 because I was fully focused all the way and enjoying the single scenes too. Great movie.",Man on a Ledge

Sam Worthington (Avatar) is Nick Cassidy, a veteran NYPD cop who was wrongfully accused of stealing a $40 million diamond that he was entrusted to guard. As the film opens, Nick Cassidy has already been tried, convicted, and sentenced to 25 years in prison. In an attempt to right this wrong, Nick has devised a plan to re-steal the diamond, that he has already been convicted of stealing. You can't be convicted twice for the same crime, can you? This film is a combination of 1/3 part ""Negotiator"", 1/3 part ""Entrapment"", and 1/3 part ""Mission Impossible I""; all of which do the scenes seen in this film so much better. Again, I did not hate this film; however, it's just not a great film either. I can recommend renting it or watching On Demand; however, I would be greatly disappointed having to pay full admission price to see this film in the movie theaters. As a sidebar, I would like to say that I did enjoy seeing little Jamie Bell (Billy Elliot) all grown up and still acting/working on screen!

The expectant New York crowd, ""just jump already"", are enjoying the entertainment and the patience of the Police top brass is beginning to wear thin.A great setup, where does the story go from here, we have two hours to fill.Other characters are thinly sketched, the disappointed brother Joey (Jamie Bell) and his ridiculously hot girlfriend (Genesis Rodrigues). Nicks dependable ex-police partner (Anthony Mackie) and Cop Dante Marcos (Titus Welliver) who calls the shots from the ground and restrains the obligatory gung-ho SWAT team. Quite why they need assault weapons to try to stop a man committing suicide is uncertain, what are they going to do, shoot him as he falls to the ground?The plot thickens, this is a Hollywood movie, we cannot spend the running time deciding and debating whether he will/will not jump, this is no character study. It is no plot spoiler to reveal that the suicide attempt is a charade, providing a distraction for another event, tied in with the reason Nick was incarcerated in the first place.David Englander (Ed Harris) is the token bad guy, perhaps the budget would not stretch to a real in vogue English baddie, a similar name will have to do. In keeping with the times, he is not a villain as such, but a Wall Street, sharp suited, tower building egomaniac, albeit with less hair then perhaps other real life characters, allegedly.The story starts well but one can imagine the pitch. A man on a building ready to jump and then the inspiration ran out. Then what, the studio executive would ask. Clearly more was needed, the escalating plot contrivances swiftly moving the film from ridiculous to preposterous, barely pausing for breath. The film ending on a crescendo of absurdities that would make even the most shameless of screenwriters blush.Fair to say a diamond is involved and an airbag, together with specialized equipment and expertise that would be unavailable to the characters as depicted. Ed Harris looks uncomfortable in the role and the general acting for all the supporting characters is average at best. Worthing is bland and involving, although Banks makes the best attempt at some decent banter, with fellow detective Dougherty (Ed Burns) but that's about it.Full marks to Worthington who apparently completed the wide shots on a real ledge. A braver man than most for sure, whether secretly harnessed or not.There are attempts at humour but the crime caper scenes appear to come from a different movie altogether. There is a bit of a twist but nothing to hold your breath for.A film that perhaps cannot decide what it wants to be, crime caper, comedy, drama or event movie. Ultimately falling badly between all of these options. The direction is flat and uninvolved, the characters unreal and overall the film does not fully reward the time invested.SummaryA good premise but ultimately a wasted opportunity. A weak thriller which becomes more preposterous with each plot contrivance.Unless you really have to see anything with Sam Worthington in it, not essential viewing.http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.co.nz/ http://www.facebook.com/JulesMovieReviews Twitter:@julesmovies",Man on a Ledge

Elizabeth Banks is the police negotiator who interferes in thiz circumstance. Jamie ""Tintin"" Bell is the brother who conducts a heist on next building, with his sexy girlfriend Angie (Genesis Rodriguez). And Ed Harris is a powerful multi-billionaire who has a secret intention. It reminds me of those simple movies that keep you entertain until the last minute, just like in ""Phone Booth"" (2002), ""Cellular"" (2004), ""Red Eye"" (2005), you name it! I always love thiz kind of movie. Three! Yeah, there are three possibilities to end thiz situation. First, finally he doesn't jump and the end. Second, he jump and the end, or there will be unthinkable surprise for the ending, one way or another. And yes, you know in your heart it won't end so easily, there are lots of twists and turns waiting for you. You bet! The mystery will keep you guessing until the end. The movie is presented by first time Director Asger Leth. Two! There are two reasons to watch thiz movie. First is Sam Worthington. Two years ago, I told everyone that someday thiz man will be a great iconic star. And hey look now. It is the future! He sells the movie only by his name! People will easily cherish him, ""Woo hoo, the man from 'Avatar' (2009)"". Second, if you have watched the trailer before, I'm sure it would tickle your curiosity about what will happen next. One!

83,EmmaDinkins,Chix Chat on Film review: And the people say...jump.,4,7 February 2012,"When you add a pinch of Mission Impossible, a dash of The Fast and The Furious and a smidgen of the Negotiator you get a Man on a Ledge. I enjoyed a number of things that took place in this film and others I found to be just too implausible. First of all I am a fan, so the fact that Anthony Mackie (Mike Ackerman) was in the film was reason enough for me to make it to the theater and see it. He had recently been to the Dallas area and mentioned his fear of heights and how the actual ledge scenes were real. So when he took one step towards the ledge I was immediately amused recalling his interview. As always his performance was true to the character he was portraying and as such I remain a fan. I could not accept that Lydia Mercer (Elizabeth Banks) would go to the lengths that she did to help Nick Cassidy (Sam Worthington), it was totally implausible that she would stick her neck out or go out on a limb given the circumstances. The David Englander (Ed Harris) portrayal was spot on, Mr. Harris has become very adept at the role of movie villain. I was totally convinced that he was an arrogant, entitled prig. The story itself was ambitious in an effort to create a fast paced action film, however as it progressed it quickly became too predictable. And the manner in which Nick approached David for the final confrontation was just plain ridiculous. The bantering between Joey Cassidy (Jamie Bell) And Angie (Genesis Rodriguez) was the most endearing of any of the other on screen dialog, they had good chemistry and played well together, but it made no sense that there had to be a wardrobe change for Angie, totally unnecessary aside from showing off her great body. This film did have some decent cinematography, the shots from the ledge were amazing and gave the audience a true feel of how high up the activities were taking place. I believe that I would have enjoyed this movie more had I not been tracking all the borrowing and the nonsense. Speaking of nonsense reporter Suzie Morales (Kyra Sedgwick), what the hell? I guess she doesn't want to be type cast as The Closer. The end of the story did have one unexpected twist, so for that reason I give it an amber light, it was truly bordering on red.",Man on a Ledge

It starts off strong and stays that way well into the second act, but the ending is pretty flimsy. I love Rockwell -- if you haven't seen ""Moon"", do so now -- and Banks, but they had no chemistry. It's like the director tacked on a love story to a heist movie. Another one of my biggest pet peeves was that while Rockwell was on the ledge, everybody in the room talked (and sometimes yelled) as if he couldn't hear what they were saying. I also was very confused as to why the Ackerman character was supposed to be a bad guy. I didn't really make that connection. But it's still an interesting movie, even though it could have ended better. (PS: that's a huge budget for a movie like this.)",Man on a Ledge

Unfortunately, the execution is a different thing altogether. What could have been a thriller filled with claustrophobic tension and edge-of-your-seat is sadly undermined by first-time feature director Asger Leth's lackluster direction and Pablo F. Fenjves's heavy-handed screenplay.For a while there, especially during the first half, director Asger Leth does pull off some worthy thrills and scenes involving Nick (Sam Worthington) stands on the ledge above 21st floor of Roosevelt Hotel is certainly vertigo-inducing. But he fails to sustain interest as the movie goes by. Another problem here is Pablo F. Fenjves's inconsistent and highly preposterous screenplay. Anybody expecting a smart payoff will be dumbstruck by how improbable and dubious the whole thing plays out here once the big picture is made loud and clear. Meanwhile, the heist alone is particularly a letdown since there is little sense of intrigue -- I mean, watching two inexperienced safecrackers (Jamie Bell, Genesis Rodriguez) who spends most of the time wisecracking and bantering against each other, is really hard to take the movie seriously.MAN ON A LEDGE is sadly a wasted opportunity. Had Asger Leth and Pablo F. Fenjves put more considerable effort to make things sensible, the movie would have worked better.Full review at http://caseymoviemania.blogspot.com/2012/02/man-on-ledge-2012.html",Man on a Ledge
86,bdgill12,"Clichés Abound, Boredom Comes Along For the Ride",5,9 February 2012,"When I think of January movie releases, I generally fixate on bad action movies. Unfrightening horror movies are a big part of the month, too, but action movies display the soul of the January Film Calendar. This year alone we were treated to Contraband (meh), Haywire (well received by critics, not audiences), The Grey (a different breed entirely), and Red Tails (underperforming in every way), all of which outshined poor little Man on a Ledge. If any January action film sums up the lackluster nature of the pre-Oscar releases, it's this one, a hodge-podge of lazy plot points and painful clichés.Man on a Ledge begins with Nick Cassidy (Sam Worthington), who we learn later is an ex-cop and a prison escapee, renting a room in a high-rise Manhattan hotel and promptly walking out onto the ledge (duh) 20+ stories up. This action catches the eye of onlookers from the street and soon cops rope off the area and send in Lydia Mercer (Elizabeth Banks), a haunted police negotiator who Nick requests by name. As she digs deeper into his story, Lydia becomes convinced there is more here than meets the eye and soon Nick lets it be known that he has taken these drastic actions in order to clear his name of the crime that sent him to prison, that being the theft of a $40 million dollar diamond from real estate mogul David Englander (Ed Harris). As it turns out, however, all of Nick's exploits are done with the intention of distracting the cops while his brother, Joey (Jamie Bell), and his girlfriend, Angie (Genesis Rodriguez), break into Englander's vault across the street to steal the item he was falsely accused of stealing in the first place.The most amazing thing about Man on a Ledge is that director Asger Leth was able to assemble such a large collection of quality actors for such a droll film. Worthington, Banks, Bell, Harris, Anthony Mackie, Kyra Sedgwick, Titus Willever, Ed Burnseverywhere you look, there's a recognizable face. And yet most of these faces are given next to nothing to work with. Harris delivers a watered-down-but-acceptable version of his role in A History of Violence and Banks is, as always, lively and entertaining to watch. Even Worthington is good-enough, though his inability to hold his accent borders on Cageian levels. In fact, if I may be so bold, the scenes in which Nick is actually out on a ledge, often speaking with Lydia, are solid. Not great, mind you, but certainly above average for a January action film. But just about every positive is overwhelmed by a decisively more aggressive negative. Every scene that focuses on Joey and Angie is awful. AWFUL. And I mean EVERY scene. Angie becomes more and more generic and stereotypical of a spicy Latin hottie and with each line of dialogue, I found myself more and more compelled to leave the theater. I don't know why Bell insists on taking bad roles in crummy movies. By all accounts he's a talented guy and yet he keeps popping up in films like The Eagle, Jumper, and this jumbled mess. Maybe he just needs better representation. Regardless, his uninspiring chemistry with Rodriguez is at best awkward and he displays an uncanny ability for having no comedic timing whatsoever. Moreover, each ""twist"" and ""turn"" within the movie's plot is as cliché as the one before, as Man on a Ledge falls into every action movie trap that you can imagine. 20 minutes into the film I could have written down everything that would happen throughout the rest of the runtime and I would have been spot on about 85 percent of the time. Even worse, none of the cliché plot devices are executed with any sort of precision. It's as if, when writing the film, Pablo F. Fenjves got stuck and said, ""Oh, I saw this in a movie one time, let's do that"" and then repeated this pattern multiple times. It is a boring, ""going through the motions"" narrative that never manages to get its wheels moving properly. Please see my reviews at thesoapbox.blogspot.com",Man on a Ledge
87,tecnogaming,"Solid entertainment, masterfully directed.",8,17 May 2012,"I don't know what's happening with reviewers these days, they are either too complacency or too strict, movies should be judged for their entertainment value not if they are believable or doable in real life.This movie started with a great premise, although somewhat clichéd but slowly but surely did everything in it's path to flow in the right way.The acting is solid, the script is perfectly well developed and although there are some parts that are pretty obvious, everything in this movie just works, even the overly exaggerated 'in your face' frontal breast of Genesis Rodriguez which distracted me more than i wanted to.Sam Worthington worked and did a nice couple with Banks, tension is what defines this movie, it goes in increment and have a perfectly climatic ending ala-battlefield 3 (I don't know but the ending sounded and felt just like the ending of that game).If you're fan of good movies with almost no stupid car-chasing scenes, perfectly written script and incredible fine tension, then, this movie is a must.I kid you not, it's been a Long time since I see a movie that handles tension so good as this one does.A solid 8 out of 10.",Man on a Ledge
88,TheCasualReviewer,A solid twist to the heist genre,7,5 May 2020,"SYNOPSIS:
Nick Cassidy (Sam Worthington) is an escaped convict who decides that in order to prove his innocence, he has to take things to extreme measures.REVIEW:
I was pleasantly surprised with this one. I'm not a big fan of heist movies since I've seen so many films and shows of the genre, but this has a fresh twist to it. It reminds me of the line in Shawshank, ""I had to come to prison to become a crook"" (probably butchering it). The acting wasn't anything spectacular and the whole time I was sitting there like ""Sam Worthington is definitely Australian or British"" which could be distracting, but I was right so that's one point to me. I thought Jamie Bell did a really good job in his role and you can never hate the beautiful Elizabeth Banks. Genesis Rodriguez was also good as Angie and oh my goodness she is just... great. Sorry, this turned into a daydream. I do have the question, if Cassidy never heisted the first time, how did he know so much for when it was happening. They didn't really explain that. Other than that and the fact that the acting is nothing to go crazy over, it was a solid heist film with a different take. 7/10.",Man on a Ledge

91,TroyeEvans,A Man's Story of Proving Himself Innocent,2,20 April 2012,"""Man on a Ledge"" is a well-directed thriller that revolves around a man and his family striving to prove something through unusual means. The focus is upon Nick Cassidy (Sam Worthington), a convict who has escaped from prison, only to stand on a ledge of a downtown building. Then enter another storyline, as Joey Cassidy (Jamie Bell) and Angie (Genesis Rodriguez) are working on stealing a diamond. Indeed, the connection is soon revealed, and the purposes become lucid and explicable.Being inserted as the plot unfolds is in-depth explanation of a more complex background, or if you like, what happened in the past. This, however, is taken care of in a casual manner as the information is revealed through only dialogue but not actually designated scenes.There is not much to surprise you in this film -- it is just a story as it is told, a story about a man willing to break the rules to prove his innocence which the law has failed to grant. And, in the optimistic view, it is a story well-told, with mildly exciting scenes here and there and a decent concluding climax.As unrealistic as the approach seems, it is a well-written story to be enjoyed. In some way it should be able to grasp your attention; the main problem perhaps, is that at some times it works better and at other times the entertainment is simply not as strong.",Man on a Ledge
92,kimi_layercake,Decent Watch With Enough Thrills and Holes,7,15 June 2012,"""Man on a Ledge"" is a Thriller set in New York based upon a former police officer, Nick Cassady (Sam Worthington) who is wrongly convicted of a crime he didn't commit and escapes from the prison to prove his innocence by actually stealing the diamond which he was supposed to stole in the first place.Cast wise, Pretty Good. Sam Worthington essays the lead role quite convincingly although one really feels a need for change to the way he approach his lead roles usually. Something is always missing. It could be that spark which ultimately separates the good from the bad or his tired demeanor. Elisabeth Banks is good and she looks good too. Jamie Bell, Ed Harris and others supporting cast pitch in well with their respective jobs. Overall, a good performance from everyone on the board.""Man on a Ledge"" storyline might seems similar to many other recent or slightly older thriller about prison escapees trying to prove their innocence. This films does that, but in a slightly unconventional manner. The plot, specially the heist part might seem implausible, but practical approach would make movies a dull watch.The Strength would definitely be it's unique yet slightly implausible storyline, decent casting and tight running time leaving no time to yawn. The movie is definitely bogged down a bit by Sam Worthington's unconvincing lead performance and loose ending.Overall, ""Man on a Ledge"" is worth watching, without giving a boring duration. It will not keep you on the ledge nor keep you hooked.My Verdict: 7/10",Man on a Ledge
93,MajorBaleegh,Excellent Movie,10,25 May 2012,"Last week I watched the movie Man on a Ledge, well I must say man it was a very good movie in my eyes as I have watched it over 7 times and each time it seems I am watching it for the first time. The acting of Nick, the negotiator, the Joe and even Maria was very good. Each of the character very well fits in his role and they performed very well. The dirty cops whose were working on the directions of Englanders also did their job pretty well. It is a worth watching movie which will keep you to your seats for 102 minutes of the movie. I will give this movie 10 out of 10. This is a true reflection of an innocent man proving he was innocent and the director rightly made his move and he is quite successful. I liked the movie very much.",Man on a Ledge
94,SlightlyMe,A good movie worth watching,7,23 February 2020,"An entertaining ledge hanging thriller. A bit predictable in places but still with many twists.
The story itself is enjoyable with a few holes, but I guess if you want factural you can always watch a documentary. The acting for the most part is great, and so it should with that cast. The scenes are done well.Definitely one to watch when you got time to kill.",Man on a Ledge
95,MosHr,A decent thriller/heist movie. Full of the usual plot-holes though!,7,4 January 2012,"As you'd expect, ""Man on a Ledge"" is a Swiss-cheese plotted heist and ""prove his innocence"" movie but taken as just that, it's quite an enjoyable movie. I suppose after having seen enough of these kinds of movies, I shouldn't expect perfection in how every plot thread is tied up since very few movies manage it. However, what the movie does excellently is setup the plot and build up the situation perfectly. Just starting as a literal man on a ledge, we see subtle layers added until we get this full on crescendo of diamond heists, negotiators, cops, convicts, bad guys, good guys all happening on in a single block in New York. So, given that you're willing to suppress your tingling plot-hole sense, it can be an enjoyable movie.The cast is quite good and the acting and tension is par for the course. The leads Sam Worthington and Elizabeth Banks do a great job. Seeing Worthington as an ex-NY cop, ex-convict and Banks as a negotiator/psychologist with a past is surprising on paper but they manage to pull it off very well. However, Jamie Bell is one of the heist-team but his opposite who plays Angie make for some cringe-worthy comedy, like some Sofia Vergara slapstick in the middle of a tense situation. Ed Harris looks emaciated but equally sinister as the villain and there are a host other minor NY characters.I can hear the Hollywood pitch for the movie in my head, ""it's like The Negotiator combined with The Italian Job but happens in NY and instead of a hostage situation we have a jumper."" And, essentially it's just that – a movie that heavily recalls other movies from the past except perhaps for the man on ledge. On a side note, it seems that every NY movie nowadays has a reference to the OWS movement and what a typical OWS protester might look like.The movie is at its best when it clamors for our hero who desperate and is fighting all odds to clear his name as he shouts from his ledge, ""I am innocent and this is my retrial."" The movie is at its worst when it's ungainly roping in all the plot threads it cast out but can't seem to put it together. Overall, it's a good enough movie for people who like these kinds of movies. If you've caught yourself bitterly berating the many plot holes in heist movies, maybe this isn't for you.",Man on a Ledge
96,ChristianLeFeuvre,A good film that allows you to sit back and enjoy without having to think too much,5,20 April 2019,"Nick Cassidy, played by Sam Worthington, is in prison having been convicted of stealing a rare $40 million diamond. On the day that he is allowed out for his father's funeral Nick escapes from police custody and, a month later turns up at a high rise Manhattan hotel.
Stepping out on to the window ledge 21 floors up it at first seems that he is intent on ending his life. Once police negotiator Lydia Mercer (Elizabeth Banks) turns up we learn that Nick was a New York cop and he insists that he is innocent and was framed by the owner of the diamond, businessman David Englander. It's not long before a huge crowd of onlookers, media and police have gathered on the streets below watching the drama unfold....however, it transpires they are looking in the wrong place as Nick's actions are merely to distract the police from what is really happening across the street. His brother Joey, played by Jamie Bell, and Joey's girlfriend Angie, are breaking into Englander's offices across the street from the hotel, to recover the diamond they know to be there, and prove his innocence.
This is one of those thrillers where the premise is a wronged man trying to get justice, similar to the outline of 'The Fugitive' with Harrison Ford, which incidentally is a much better movie, and with the knowledge that Sam Worthington's character spends most of the movie on the ledge it's easy to wonder if the film will keep the viewer interested enough in what's going on. The movie does have some good points, the performances from Worthington and Elizabeth Banks are good. Jamie Bell and Genesis Rodriguez play off each other well and have some good banter, and Ed Harris is well cast as the villain of the piece, Englander.
The visuals and cinematography are good, and direction by Asger Leth is ok but I didn't think he took advantage of the tension of the situation enough. There was enough action to keep the film going, but there wasn't really any feeling suspense or tension. It has to be said though, the thing that lets the film down the most for me is the script, it was too involved without any meaning, and by the second half of the film the implausibility of the entire situation grew to such an extent that you just don't really believe in what's happening any more.
I actually thought the trailer was far better and much more thrilling and dramatic than the actual movie.
All in all, 'Man On A Ledge' is a watchable film, there's nothing special about it it's one of those 'popcorn films' as I like to call them, just sit back and be entertained without having to think too much about a plot.",Man on a Ledge
97,wbswetnam,Convicted cop must prove his innocence,7,24 February 2012,"This another ""good cop, wrongly convicted, must prove his innocence"" movie, with help from friends and family of course. The lead character is a former police officer convicted of stealing a millionaire's prized diamond, and he must steal the diamond to prove that he had nothing to do with it's theft to begin with. He gets help from his brother and his sexy girlfriend. As a diversion during the robbery, he climbs out onto the ledge of a building so his cohorts across the street can attempt to pull off the theft.It's an entertaining piece of Saturday afternoon escapist crime drama and it works well in that role. There are numerous improbable scenes (like when he drives across the railroad tracks and gets smacked by a high-speed locomotive, only to run away from the completely destroyed vehicle completely unscathed) but if you can forgive the improbable scenes then it's great entertainment.",Man on a Ledge
98,amahlanand,Thriller teetering on a Ledge,8,9 May 2012,"Many thrillers with intertwining plot lines tend to get confused in themselves let alone causing confusion amongst viewers but this was not one of them. The cat and mouse game played by Worthington's character Nick Cassidy was superbly crafted by director Asger Leth, the premise was interestingly reminiscent of Joel Schumacher's 'Phonebooth' but contained a storyline more unique and intriguing incorporating curious conspiracies and unexpected twists all of which were tied together well.There are instances where some events come across slightly abrupt or are abridged without much explanation behind it but that does little to detract from the key events. The heist which the movie promoted mightn't have been intricate or having the brilliance of an 'Ocean's Eleven' or 'Inside Man', but it served as but one chunk of the plot line which made it much better, well supported by the 'man on a ledge' scenes and the flashbacks to lead engrossed viewers to the more important motives and reasoning which, unlike many heists, wasn't simply a desire for big bucks. It was Ed Harris who fit his profile best as the deprave real estate mogul. Albeit sidelined from the thick of the action where the 'man on the ledge' was for the majority of the story, he bagged the performance of the film.Sure, guys jumping off 21 story buildings unscathed and breaking in to a highly secure vault with the likes of fire extinguishers and wire cutters isn't what you expect to see on the 6 o' clock news, but that's why we go to the movies. This was never meant to be an accurate depiction of human life but fictionalised cinema. If you leave your cynicism at home and allow yourself to be entertained and thrilled, you will be. Undoubtedly, 'Man on a Ledge' far from fell flat.",Man on a Ledge
99,ToddWebb,6.6 is too low - It's better than that,8,29 May 2012,"Sure, the whole story is completely implausible. Then characters are cliché, and the story is trite. But I don't care. MAN ON A LEDGE worked for me.I wanted some basic action flick, and this delivers. I watched the movie without watching the trailers, or even the clip loop at the beginning of the DVD. They do reveal too much of the story. Not knowing anything (much) about the story, I was able to enjoy some of the twists and turns. As thin as the plot was, it was still fun.Don't expect too much and you won't be disappointed. It's good, basic action and suspense, and leaves you feeling, ""Eh, I was entertained for a while.""",Man on a Ledge
100,countryshack,Just Watch It.,8,3 July 2012,"I have No idea why people gave this movie such a low score. Yes, if you try and pick it apart, you know that this probably couldn't happen in real life. But Mission Impossible probably couldn't happen either if you want to pick at it. This movie is not filled with sex scenes and filthy language if that is what you are interested in. It's not riddled with CGI and massive car wrecks to just kill some time. But it does manage to keep your eyes and ears glued to the screen for an hour or two. So, grab some popcorn and a Coke and Just Watch The Movie. We both enjoyed it and never once got bored. It held our interest and attention until the credits ran.",Man on a Ledge
101,l_r_26,Mediocre,5,29 October 2014,"Maybe this movie would get 7/10 if it were made 20 years ago. I don't know maybe I have seen too many movies, but there was nothing fresh, and it was kinda boring and at times not believable. I'm not talking action scenes not being believable, I am OK with that. The normal drama scenes were the problem. Elisabeth Banks didn't do a very good job in my opinion. She is beautiful though.The ending of the movie is like what??!?It's good, but that was so lucky it's not even funny. I was wondering all along what the plan is, to reveal Ed Harris is a fraud.Their original plan could not work. What would Sam's brother and his girl do if they found the diamond in the place where it was supposed to be? No one would believe them. They could plant it there! Like what was the plan!!??And so, that plan fails , and then another plan fails, and then, plan C that could not be possibly predicted works great, and is probably the only possible way that all this stuff could work.Well in the end at least it worked.The movie actually wasn't that bad. It was just OK. And had some problems. Mainly though, I just wish the actors and casting did a better job. The only great role was Ed Harris.This movie is so so. Has some watchable moments, but it just doesn't click. Maybe I could give it 6/10 , but 5/10 is fair.",Man on a Ledge
102,FFman-847-460126,Haven't I seen this before?,5,7 February 2012,"Stop me if you've heard this one before. Escaped Convict. Actually Innocent. Extreme measures. The truth is that Man on a Ledge is an enjoyable movie. But it's weak. It relies on overdone story lines, bad cops, and an archetypical bad guy (Who appears to be bad simply because he has money). With lackluster actors and nothing special in the directing or the screen writing, this movie comes across rather flat.Next to the storyline, the worst aspect of this movie is the characters. Not the acting, but the characters they play. Elizabeth Banks' character has such an incredibly dull backstory that I'm hoping she'll accidentally fall out the window the entire movie. Jamie Bell and Genesis Rodriguez are even worse. There is nothing to their story. They add nothing to the story.The idea of this movie is the best part. The movie incorporates multiple aspects of New York City life that add to the storyline (namely the people down on the street yelling ""Jump!"" every few seconds). You have the cops that are all too used to jumpers. You even have a homeless man who somehow brings more to the story than some of the main characters.Sam Worthington is the only other aspect of this movie that makes it enjoyable. His character has to have so many facets that it is a difficult role to pull off. Worthington does it with ease. Although his work is destroyed with a horrible finale, he still is one of the best parts of this movie. If only they could have built an entirely new and unique storyline around him.Man on a Ledge is enjoyable. It is not worth seeing, however. If you want to see a good drama, go see The Grey. There is no reason to put up with a lackluster, recycled movie when there are better and unique movies all still in theatres.",Man on a Ledge
103,kdorsey321,Well,7,7 August 2012,"My next review is on the movie ""Man On A Ledge,"" starring Sam Worthington, Elizabeth Banks, and Ed Harris (great actor!). I wanted to see this movie in the movie theater, but I didn't get the chance too.I thought the movie wasn't bad, but I didn't think it was great either. I thought it could have been done better. Things in this movie were predictable and there weren't any surprises in this film. I felt I this movie could have used a surprise or two. Maybe this film needed some more characters. I just felt like there were things missing and there were things that were need for this film to at the least hit a nine on my rating scale.On a lighter note this is a watchable film. I was able to watch this all the way though and be somewhat entertained. A man being on a ledge getting ready to jump is interesting in itself. Interesting for anyone to want to know what is going to happen in the end.With that said I'm giving this film a 7 out of 10. This film had solid execution, interesting plot, and it keep you watching.

104,gillman11,Acutely And Overwhelmingly Average,5,5 May 2012,"It passed the time. If I could get away with such a low word count, that would be my capsule review.This film is a paradigm for movie going the past few years. Derivative and uninspired, miscast and completely nonsensical if you think about it too much.It doesn't work as heist movie because the central conceit makes no sense: a complex plan executed by clumsy amateurs leaving virtually everything to chance, played out in front of a massive audience (in the film at least). All leading to a cliché ridden, by the numbers conclusion of ludicrous gun-play and a ridiculous denouement, which makes most of the build up completely pointless.That said, the build up in the early part of the film is very well handled and it only really starts to fall apart once the heist begins.Most of the cast are good, Elizabeth Banks is convincing in an unfamiliar role and there is solid support from the likes of Ed Burns Anthony Mackie and Titus Welliver, Ed Harris can do no wrong in my eyes, the man is a god amongst mortals and Genesis Rodriguez is gorgeous and convincing.Problems with the cast are two fold: 1. Sam Worthington, why this guy is considered a box office draw continues to baffle me, it's not that he's bad but he lacks the charisma of a real heavyweight actor who can carry a film purely with his presence. He doesn't really need to, given the quality support he has but he has been decidedly average and unconvincing in everything I've seen him in. Does being in Avatar really count for that much? The accent slips a couple of times too.2. Why cast actors who aren't even from the US? Again, neither Worthington or Jamie Bell are that bad but there is an element that draws you out of the film when you realise these supposed native New Yorkers are actually Australian and English.Overall, it passed 90 or so minutes painlessly but brainlessly. Shouldn't we expect more from our entertainment, particularly something that probably considers itself a more intelligent thriller? It nearly gained an extra star from me for having the good grace to get Genesis Rodriguez in her underwear (which probably reflects my age more than anything else) but when that is a stand-out moment, your flick might not be all that.It's not below or above average, it's acutely and overwhelmingly average and for a flick that supposedly cost $42m to make, that's not really good enough.",Man on a Ledge
105,MrGoodMovie,Man on ledge = viewer on edge,7,22 June 2012,"Don't be put off by the rather boring title, this is a quirky little movie that works quite well and will give acrophobics a dizzying run for their money.I have to say that I figured a movie in which the plot revolves around some guy on a ledge would be relatively slow paced. However the film is in fact surprisingly fast-paced with the viewer largely unaware of the underlying plot even as our man steps out on to his ledge. The characters and their parts in the plot are revealed as we go, with plenty to keep the viewer on the edge of their seat as our disgraced ex-cop dangles precariously on his ledge. The revelations come thick and fast, and at one point you may well be asking yourself whether there are actually any good cops in this movie (luckily for our ""jumper"", there are!). There is one really good action scene/stunt in the movie which is difficult to describe without ticking the ""spoiler"" box so I will leave you to discover what was for me the best jaw-dropping moment of the film.And just in case anyone reading this review has already watched the movie and was wondering, Genesis Rodriguez stripping down to her underwear was my second best jaw-dropper scene (sad, I know!)Not an epic but a nevertheless entertaining movie that is well worth watching, and there is even a nice little twist towards the end.",Man on a Ledge

I don't write bad reviews, because I'm a cinema-lover and I tend to catch the spirit of a film...in fact it's my very first bad review ever... but I need to say something about Man on a Ledge. It has a good cast, but someway the actors played their roles in such a foolish way... like they were attached to the script so much, there's no originality in their actings.. it's kind of weird, because I've seen other movies with Edward Burns, Elizabeth Banks, Jamie Bell, Sam Worthington, that made me relie on their capabilities, but on ""Man on a ledge"", the acting is a complete flaw.I hated the argument, that plot never goes in a known direction (you got SWAT, idyllic Hollywood style witnesses of the ""suicidal"" event, lawyers and negotiators going around with no clear intentions and poor plot development)I hated the directing so much, that I'd better stop watching this boring, little clichéed stuff. In fact, you'll never compromise with this film. That's its worst flaw; you never feel attached to any of the characters. The ""humour touches"" are a bit naive and dull, it's really boring sometimes.We have no real entertaining, it's a big deception overall... for those who go for thrillers, avoid this crap.There are no memorable moments, it really sucked all the time. Flat actors, poor plot lines, incredible and deeply arguable wasting of acting talents and plot holes that will make you think if is it really necessary to write a critique about this awful film.

107,geodrake-71-627198,Decent enough blockbuster,6,15 February 2012,"Man On A Ledge is a popcorn action thriller with a fast plot and slick direction that allows viewers to turn off critical faculties and go with the flow. This is what the Hollywood industry is best at, providing movies with broad appeal that provide an escape from everyday life. There's no time for boredom as ex cop Nick Cassidy (Sam Worthington) and his brother Joey (Jamie Bell) put their scheme into action to prove he's innocent of a diamond theft. Ed Harris is always a dependable bad guy; the only problem here is that he's a much higher calibre of actor than the other cast members. I found Angie (played by the fabulously named Genesis Rodriguez) a bit annoying, her character seems to be there to only inject some comic relief and strip down to her underwear.

What utter tripe!This movie is the perfect weekend thriller. It is meant to entertain, and entertain it does. After a string of oh-so-overrated movies, this one comes as a breather.If you want an easy watch movie, watch this. True, there are no eye popping graphics, there are no half-naked women (there is one, and the one is hot, but then, I will leave that to you) but it is definitely a good enough watch.If you are looking for a water tight plot, go back to sleep, if you want to be entertained, watch this movie.",Man on a Ledge

I was entertained by  the spirit of the film more than the film itself. Let me explain. This  film mixes well used elements from previous films and tries to add a  fresh new spin by adding the height of a skyscraper. The down side is  that there are no new ideas here and no red herrings. This movie  telegraphs everything that is going on, no secrets. I appreciate the  film for the lack of thought so I just strapped in and enjoyed it. This  is defiantly a yellow light film. One that does not make you work for  anything and looks good on screen.",Man on a Ledge
111,joelsmith190,Man on a Ledge movie review,9,7 January 2015,"Starring Sam Worthington (from Clash of the Titans and Terminator: Salvation) is a 2012 clever thriller film that leaves all other ""clever"" films in the dust.With a great story and great execution, this proves you don't have to be Michael Bay or some other big name to make a fantastic movie.You watch as Sam Worthington's character is framed for the theft of the Black Diamond, so he stands on a ledge and acts like he's going to jump, to distract everybody from his brother and his brother's girlfriend or fiancée or something breaking into the place where he was framed and trying to steal the Diamond to prove Worthington's innocence. A good cop goes on the ledge, not knowing he's the ""guy who stole the Black Diamond"" and tries to coax him off.I'm not telling anything else about the film, but the rest of it is really satisfying. It doesn't answer everything, but this calm blood-pumper is a great film, earning a 9/10 from me",Man on a Ledge

Why he's in prison and whether he's actually a con-man or innocent unravels throughout the movie. It's fast-paced and in the second-half ,I was on the edge of my seat, guessing and enjoying every second of the ex-cop-now-con,good detective,dirty cop,bad friend,cool family,funny onlookers cocktail ! Elizabeth Banks gives a stellar performance as the thought-of-as-mental detective. The entire star cast has good timing and there is chemistry between characters where necessary, so that's a plus point. It is funny and quirky and you can enjoy it ,even if you are not a suspense-thriller fan. It does not get bracketed into one particular genre, which makes it a delightful watch for various genre fans. So, go watch it if you haven't already.",Man on a Ledge

I don't consider myself to be some sort of film critic, but I love the arts and have been involved in music and stage a bit in my day -- so I find it perplexing when the IMDb rating seems to be off by a couple of points. Ledge is really an engaging film, with some twists and turns that you couldn't second guess. A really strong cast keeps it tight and all corners square. Loved the fact that the ah-ha moment wasn't just at the end - constantly you had to flip back a page and realize what was really going on.

114,UnknownRealmsDotNet,One ledge you shouldn't get out on,5,27 August 2012,"Man on a Ledge starts off exciting enough -- a man gets onto a ledge to commit suicide but obviously with the intention to do more than just kill himself. Things unfortunately tumble downhill from there. For most of the movie the outlandish premise is forgivable because the events play out in a very exciting and engaging way. So for those first 40 minutes things look like this will be a fun, no-brainer, popcorn flick. But unfortunately, the end is aiming for that big, explosive, dramatic finale. It's got to have it so badly, that it just blows all credibility and coolness out of the film. Bummer. This isn't one ledge you should risk going out on.",Man on a Ledge
115,Tkbn3812,"Good enough movie, enough action and suspense to keep you watching",8,23 October 2017,"Man On A Ledge may not have gotten stellar reviews from critics, and it may not be perfect, but it's an adequate enough action-thriller film that should keep viewers entertained for two hours. The premise of the movie seems simple enough at first. An escaped fugitive threatens to jump off a building in New York, capturing the attention of everyone beneath him on the streets and all the police. He's doing this so that no one notices a robbery he has cooked up being undertaken just across the street.Of course, the plot is a fair deal more complicated than that. The man has conspired to steal a jewel from the building across the road to prove that he didn't steal the jewel two years earlier...yes, it's a very confusing plot premise. It's one of the main reasons that many found these film unappealing; its unbelievable plot.But the film is more enjoyable if you try ignore the unbelievable plot. The premise of a man threatening to jump off a building is played with well, keeping us engaged in the film. Sure, it is stretched out quite a bit, but it's played with just well enough that the audience doesn't get bored. We are reminded of his presence just enough that we don't forget about him and not so much that it feels forced.The acting isn't exactly stellar, with Sam Worthington, playing the main character, feeling a little dull at times. Regardless, his character is engaging enough, his character's raw desperation coming across clearly in the way Worthington acts. Despite the confusion it's hard not to feel even a bit of sympathy for his character, for reasons divulged as the movie progresses.The action scenes are what give the film its edge. The man on the ledge is juggled cleverly with the heist going on in the building across the street. Action throughout the film is slow at first, but the scenes gradually speed up, becoming more enjoyable and gripping as the film climaxes, until the satisfying ending.Honestly, the film isn't flawless, but it's a fun enough watch. If you aren't one to overlook plot holes, not-so- stellar acting and an unbelievable story, then this isn't the film for you. But casual viewers and action-lovers will be entertained. It has engaging action scenes and an interesting heist that no doubt should keep the most action- thirsty among us satisfied for two hours.",Man on a Ledge

Little to no character development? Check. Ridiculous plot? Check. Sam Worthington's accent was atrocious (incidentally his acting was too but I digress...). Elizabeth Banks was given horribly sophomoric, predictable dialogue that even she couldn't make work. And no one else is worth mentioning. Skip this one on Netflix and head straight for the 90's classic ""The Negotiator"" with Samuel L Jackson and Kevin Spacey (before he was exposed as a total creep).",Man on a Ledge

119,james-t-sheridan,Australian on a Ledge: Fun and Forgettable,6,12 July 2012,"Man on a Ledge is exactly what it purports to be: a B-movie plot with an A-level cast with a fun concept that never really goes anywhere, and it doesn't leave much of an impression. But, it is a kinda fun ride. Nick Cassidy (Sam Worthington), the titular man, stands on a 21st story ledge on a busy street in New Your City, grinding city traffic and business to a halt. A former cop who stages a daring escape during his father's burial at the cemetery, Cassidy requests a specific police officer, Lydia Mercer (Elizabeth Banks), to speak to while standing on the ledge, he makes few other demands, he keeps his cryptic motives to himself. Cassidy and Mercer build a rapport as helicopters swirl, tactical units prepare to descend on ropes from the roof, and a crowd gathers to watch the show. Meanwhile, nefarious and reptilian real estate developer David Englander (Ed Harris) who put Cassidy in jail through a complicated frame-up involving a diamond watches the proceeding from his building next door to Cassidy's hotel. And, Cassidy's scrappy brother Joey (Jaime Bell) and the brother's fiesty girlfriend Angie (Genesis Rodriguez) find themselves wrapped up in the twisty-turny plot as well. And, throw in a NYPD officer with just the right amount of cynicism (Ed Burns) as well as a few other cops that maybe can be trusted. Without giving anything away, the man on the ledge is not what he appears to be. But, the film is really what it appears to be: a fun idea, done with some style and some memorable scenes. Ultimately, this film is a stew of disparate parts with a rather dull performance from Worthington (whose Aussie accent fades in and out), a fine job by Banks, an underused Harris, a winning and flirtatious combination in Bell and Rodriguez (their scenes add some energy and banter), some outlandish plot twists, some cool stunt work, as well as some pretty elaborate break-in procedures and schemes. The film attempts some clumsy social relevance with the crowd on the street and the media coverage which doesn't entirely work. At times, I felt like I was watching an over-budgeted version of the Fox television show Prison Break. At others, I referenced Spike Lee's Manhattan bank robbery hostage thriller Inside Man, a much stronger film, with a much stronger script, with stronger performances and something interesting to say. Man on a Ledge doesn't have anything interesting to say, but it is perfectly harmless, perfectly watchable. And the ledge looks pretty sweet. Apparently, the actors were really up on a ledge with wires and supports hidden or edited out. Pretty fun stuff. But not too much fun.",Man on a Ledge

Especially,in light of the recent magnificent skyscraper shots of MI:4; even the ledge shots are dull.The cast is decent and good looking. But even the casting belies the plot ""twists"" that are supposed to surprised us. They have all done so much better elsewhere or so good-looking (Genesis Rodriquez, who just happens to strip to her undies for no good reason) they should!I can forgive incongruous events, awkward expository dialogue and can suspend my disbelief but, when it so unimaginative as this. Also, when or when can we stop stereotyping or laughing at old hack jokes that may have been funny once, but, damn it, give it up--do audiences think its polite to laugh at at something that just alludes to something that once was funny..(no spoilers...but I would be doing you a favor). And once again a Latina is a the beautiful sassy sexualized girlfriend. I guess they wanted to toss in a little cultural diversity by using the oldest tropes in the book.

To win one has plan and execute it either by self or with a reliable team. If things get impossible then adapt and improvise.This movie is one of it own kind.

123,Scarlet_Syndicate,Definitely worth a trip to the cinema,8,11 February 2012,"There's a lot of mixed reviews about this film. I'm happy to say i'm one of those who thoroughly enjoyed it. It had great acting and a great storyline which is what you go to see a film for really. A lot of people have slated this movie for its plot holes and 'unrealisticness' but isn't the whole point of a film, to entertain you? It's not meant to be realistic otherwise it'd be boring. Have you ever heard anyone slating The Matrix or Batman for not being realistic? I didn't think so. Any film that can keep an audience watching a man stood on a ledge for an hour and a half must have a good storyline i'd say. The cinematography also helped this by showing shots looking up and down from the ledge, constantly reminding us of how high up the main character was. I also enjoyed the flashback scenes and twists in the plot.Sam Worthington once again pulled off a great performance and the other actors (who i've never seen in anything else) were also great. The reasons I docked two stars off this film are for: 1. the title (probably a bit harsh but it's so unoriginal) 2. the predictability of the ending. I guess with a film thats rated a 12A you kinda expect it to be predictable but it does deem the ending a bit moot if you know what's going to happen. I think if the director had chosen to make this film a 15 rating, a lot more could have been done to it. And 3. Sam Worthington's accent; let's just say I went into the cinema not knowing where Worthington was from. By the end of the film, I was pretty positive he was Australian.Apart from those slight problems, I'd say it was a really well executed film and I'd go and see it in the cinema for a second time. I'll also be buying it when it comes out on DVD.Overall, without giving anything away i'd say this film was definitely worth a trip to the cinema. Go and see it if you haven't. Except if you're one of those people who like to complain about the plot holes in a storyline, then this film probably isn't for you.",Man on a Ledge
124,MovieShrink7,Perfect? Maybe not but its entertaining,6,2 February 2012,"Let me preface what I'm about to write with this, when you're in the theater to see an action flick you have to be willing to suspend reality for the duration. You wouldn't go into a Jason Statham movie expecting it to be perfectly realistic would you? So don't go into a movie like Man on a Ledge expecting the plot to be airtight. Having said that, it was a decent movie. The action sequences were filmed well, and you have all the predictable tension when a character just barely escapes time and time again. If you're a dude you have a pretty Latina girl both half naked in one scene and in a skintight jumpsuit for another. There is a surprising amount of comic relief from Jamie Bell who manages ""charming"" without losing a beat and yet a surprising lack of it from funny girl Elizabeth Banks. She seems to pull off a more serious role fairly well, however, even though her back story is more than cliché and bordering on cheesy. Sam Worthington is what he is; eye candy. Though, sadly, somehow I found him more appealing as a blue American in Avatar. He plays the role well enough, though there isn't a whole lot to work with; stand on a ledge and have a devilish grin every so often. Ed Harris is believable as a two dimensional villain character (what action movie would be complete without one?)All in all Man on a Ledge plays more like a comic book than a thriller. There are plot holes galore and my suggestion (if you can't simply overlook them) is to laugh at them afterwords. Here are a few to get you started 1) Australian brother + English brother=American Dad? 2) 3 prison guards + 1 felon= 1 gun? 3) small British guy and the hot Hispanic chick just happen to have recently graduated from MIT or the James Bond Academy of Science and Infiltration. There are a myriad of others I will let you find for yourself. Moral of the story; its worth a watch and a laugh or two if you feel like dissecting the plot for the massive craters that lie within",Man on a Ledge

126,lawman-65294,Enjoyable thriller/crime film with little in the way of surprises,7,9 November 2020,"This was far better than I expected going into the movie. The main cast did their jobs well and the scenes as well as sound do well to keep the pace of the movie hectic. In terms of the plot Nick Cassidy the protagonist was framed for a crime he did not commit. Elizabeth Banks is Lydia Mercer the negotiator tasked with talking Nick down to prevent him from jumping. Both played their roles well and the banter between the characters was good. In terms of the real perpetrators of the crime, it soon becomes fairly obvious and predictable who they are so don't expect major surprises or an unexpected twist if you have been paying attention throughout the movie. Regardless, Man on A Ledge was a fun, well paced for a thriller/crime/action romp. Definitely worth watching for Elizabeth Banks and Sam Worthington.",Man on a Ledge
127,brent-leslie,Good film!,8,6 June 2012,"This film shows you exactly what is wrong with Hollywood. Films that are gripping, edge of your seat, well written, well acted and most of all highly entertaining are not really even promoted these days. But films like ""Battleship"" that are big, brash, dumb, ridiculous and instantly forgot are promoted hugely and most turn out to be hugely disappointing.This film is the former. A ""cop tries to prove his innocence"" action thriller that necessitates a robbery to do so.The movie itself is well executed in parts. The set pieces are excellent and hang together well. The dialogue is good and acting is well done. However you tend to get a little lost in the plot as the historical strands start coming together - you can't quite figure out the whole thing and are left grasping for the tiny pieces of explanation of the back story. What happened exactly to the main character? How was his partner involved? While some will think ""This gives you room to use your imagination"", we aren't given enough detail to make sense of it. Apparently the main character was framed by a bad guy who had help from cops. That's all you find out and it seems thats all the writers want to tell you so they can keep throwing in twists. It would have been better to let the audience know more and kept the characters in the dark - it would have been much more fulfilling.Overall though the movie was highly enjoyable and a much better choice than seeing another Hollywood dumb fest. The terrible thing is that this film hasn't yet made a profit (and probably isn't likely to) yet Battleship has already done so. I guess we only have ourselves to blame then...",Man on a Ledge

A guy is on a ledge, threatening to jump, and he is trying to prove his innocence. I don't want to give any details away so I won't get too much into the plot. There are a few twists towards the end that are nice. I would have to say that the plot wasn't incredibly original. It is similar to other action, cop movies that we've seen before. Reminded me of 'The Fugitive' and 'Phone Booth' which were both movies I liked. (No where near as good as The Fugitive though!) There were good shots from the 'ledge' and some good action scenes that were nice at the theater. Overall I would definitely recommend this film.

129,enteredapprenticering,"Predictable cheap story, not credible characters",4,8 April 2012,"The story starts out with way too common themes, that have not only been overplayed in various movies already, but are connected in a not credible manner, it is almost a shame to have great actors like Ed Harris partaking in this very predictable movie. These themes are: cop in prison who is innocent and needs to prove it, bad cops that set him up, his long-term partner that supposedly is his friend, but also dirty, the ""family members of NY Cops stick together"" theme and last but not least the bad and corrupt powerful business magnate who has cops and the mayor in his pocket. The way the themes are tried to be connected are not credible and in some parts outright laughable. Just to mention one that is especially not credible: the actress Genesis Rodriguez plays the girlfriend of the cop-hero's brother. She is much more than just a pretty face and actually a great actress, as will be proved in the 2013 production of The Last Stand alongside Arnold Schwarzenegger. But here in this movie, she is either reduced in a non-classy manner to show a physically fit body with emphasis on her push-up bra or elevated to be a top-notch sophisticated thief breaking in a state-of-the-art high-security vault, where priceless jewelery is stored. Her qualification to be able to do so is explained by ""having sometimes broken into houses as a teenager in high-school"". Let this movie go, folks. Don't say I didn't tell you.

This plan includes a risky scheme to steal the attention of all New York while he stands precariously on the ledge of a hotel building while his brother sneaks around behind everyone's back.This movie has some great twists, great acting, and a great storyline.

131,Joshsports60,A Real Thriller,8,10 January 2012,"Ultimately, he's just a man on a ledge. He's a man with a decision to make. Go back to prison for 25 years for a crime he didn't commit, or perform the crime he committed to prove he didn't commit the crime in the first place.Hopefully, that wasn't too confusing.Nick Cassidy (Worthington) is a convicted convict serving 25 years for stealing and breaking into a thousand pieces, Dave Englander's (Harris) prized diamond. After breaking out of federal prison, Cassidy steps out onto the ledge of the hotel, and requests a certain negotiator (Banks) to talk to him. That is about as far as I'll go into the plot. But know, that this was a real thriller. The music set this thriller apart from others. It was fit in exactly the write places. The cinematography was also a real plus for the film. As the audience, we were constantly reminded how high up Cassidy was from the rest of the crowd.There were some negatives, however. Banks, by no means, was terrible in this movie. But they could've done a better job casting for the part. I actually think Worthington's Avatar cast mate Michelle Rodriguez would've been perfect for the role. Other than that, this wasn't the most original script. There were a fair share of cheesy barbs between Joey (Bell) and Angie (Rodriguez).Speaking of Genesis Rodriguez, wow. I mean, damn, she's hot. No disrespect for Bell, but he, like all of us, are out of her league. Overall, it was a good success by the relatively new feature film director-screenwriter combination.",Man on a Ledge

I am willing to suspend belief when it comes to action/thrillers (such as the Mission Impossible or Die Hard franchises) but you would have to be deaf, dumb and blind to believe the storyline in this movie. For example, he takes a flying leap off a 21 story building and lands on an air-bag that is not even on his side of the building and walks away like nothing happened? Or, the brother and girlfriend (who just broke into a building and held a man at gunpoint) get to walk away Scot-free?

It is worth seeing, if only for its humor. There are two unnecessary distractions. Nick & Lydia's ""relationship"" is totally unbelievable for those of us that deal in the real world of events of this type. Cute, but ludicrous. Also the fan service of Genesis Rodriguez as Angie is sad. There is no question she is a beautiful woman; there is also no question that the T&A is unnecessary. Maybe their target audience is teenage boys, not adults. Still the humor and twists are worth the time. You will enjoy the movie, even if the ending is poorly conceived.

Hmm... the movie's gotta be pretty good at the very least, right?No. It isn't. With a painfully long time spent with Nick Cassidy (Sam Worthington) on the ledge, the plot seems more and more predictable with every passing minute. But you might still think there could be something more in store. Wrong again.To be honest, the plot wasn't bad at all. But the script and the way certain events unfold pretty much ruined it. The ending was terrible; seemed hasty and gives the appearance that there wasn't enough time to fit in a good one.

141,BigMaxAttacks,Man On A Ledge - Ending saves the movie –SPOILER ALERT,6,3 March 2012,"The movie has its problems. It's very contrived. Very Very Very Contrived. But hey, it's a Studio Picture, were you really expecting anything else. It has very 'A' moments and then regresses to the trenches of late night 'B'. For example, the Latina is fine at times, but sometimes she really over acts, I have to blame that on the director, for jeepers sake, tell her to pull it back a little. It's like she's playing this caricature half the time, especially at certain times of the movie when it's just starting to feel like an ""A LIST"" movie, it cuts back to her and her boyfriend (the lead actors brother), whom does a great job dealing with over acting, because if he followed her lead, it could have gotten really silly, he played it well. Come to think of it, I have to blame the director for one of her B moments, for example, when in the middle of all the tension she STRIPS down to her underwear, WHY DOES SHE NEED TO CHANGE?!!!!!!!!!!! It's not like she's changing from a cat woman suit to a nun outfit, she changes from an outfit to basically the same outfit. I know, it's the gratuitous naked scene.. that you see in every B movie.. but this isn't a B movie, so why the B moment. They could have made a better excuse somehow, her clothes are stuck on something and they rip or something, but this was sooooooooooooooo over the head obvious. I'll be truthful, she's got a smokin' hot body, so no harm, but they could have at least had her change into something that didn't look just like what she was wearing, spend 10 minutes and make it less over the head. But worse than that, because her body was great, was her moments of over the top. It's like one of those guys from New York that are in a mafia movie and then they do a new york accent on top of their new york accent, it can get painful. If she just said her lines with her natural self it would have been less B. And I'm not jumping on her, well, I guess I am, it's just that there were a couple of moments where she ripped me out of the flow of the movie, and not for a good reason. She has potential, just needs to be a little more real, as in a little less over the top. The director should have watched her a little better, but overall, he did a tremendous job keeping us totally interested with the man on the ledge for 90 minutes. Hats off to the director. And overall, the acting is very good, the bad policeman running the show is obviously a new york type of guy, and here, he plays it straight, he's already one of 'those' guys, so he adds a 'little' and just delivers, without going too much new york on us. He works nicely. And so does the other cop (Ed Burns), there's been times in movies in the past where he did the extra east coast thing where it wasn't needed, but in this one he was perfect. I guess that's what practice does. The brother's girlfriend will find her place. The father was great. He did a great job with his small role. He could do nothing more there, really nice work. The lead guy (Worthington) had the responsibility of keeping us on the edge and he did all that he could with every situation and scene he had. Couldn't change a thing with him. Ed Harris does something here and there that is a little of what he does and a little of something new. The guy's a genius. He always delivers. The movie had a lot of convenient moments, especially with the brother and his girlfriend, but that's expected in these kind of movies, it's all convenient timing. It's fine, but I must say, the best is the wrap up at the end, you really feel good when the movies over, as if, that was fun, even though overall,95% of the movie is not a feel good movie, it's suspense, it just ends all nice and wrapped up in a happy box. If I had to go back in time I would watch this movie again. If you haven't seen it, definitely rent it. Well worth it, yes there are a couple of story flaws, like here's a cop that everyone knows his history.EVERYONE KNOWS that he stole a 40 million dollar diamond a year or so earlier a block away, but no one recognizes him that was a huge problem in the movie, and there are others, but still worth the watch.",Man on a Ledge

I figured out the end before the middle of the movie. Maybe if this movie was made in the 90's it would have been a box office blowout but audiences need to be challenged today. The cast did a great job with the material given to them except Sam Worthington needs to work on his accent a little bit. I never heard of Genesis Rodriguez before this movie but she was pretty good. I felt Anthony Mackie and Edward Burns talent was wasted. They both could have held meatier material. Also Kyra Sedgwick's role could have been played by anyone. Stick to the closer Kyra.

They write a character who is supposedly so smart that he can outsmart everybody and get the diamond, but not smart enough to realize that giving the diamond back means nothing, they're all dead anyway because men like that don't let people live. Lazy writing makes me want to find out where the writers live, fly, take a train, or whatever how many days it takes to get there, go to their house, knock on their door and punch the writers in the face when they answer the door for being lazy, inept idots using lame plot devices and not staying true to characters they spent time building and wasting our time with drivel. The characters spend all this time getting the diamond to prove his innocence but they have no end game. Seriously, they didn't plan this out. I'm no writer but just off the top of my head in thirty seconds I can come up with they could have had cameras with them broadcasting live to the internet when he returned to his office with the diamond proving he had it all along. They could have used their guns to walk him down to the street and make him reveal on camera to the hundreds of people waiting and the news crews that he had it all along. I'm not even a writer and I came up with two way more plausible outcomes than the hacks who wrote this did and I did it in seconds. You would suppose they had months to write it but the best they could come up with for a man they wrote as so intelligent that he could outsmart everyone, get out of prison, recover the diamond, set off an explosion while nobody notices, keep the public eye on him the whole time, he's that brilliant, but so they can have an action scene, they suddenly write this character they've portrayed as so bloody brilliant as the stupidest moron on earth with no exit plan.

In fact, this ludicrous thriller cares very little for any of the players, instead concentrating on the game. There are some genuinely tense scenes – mostly involving Jamie Bell and Genesis Rodriguez attempting to steal a $40m diamond – and the vertigo- inducing premise is intriguing for the initial hour, yet by the final act there's nothing more than a cheap curiosity holding it together thanks to one plot contrivance too many.

148,stravsky,A Film-Bot which slipped through quality control,2,1 December 2012,"'m fortunate enough to have visited the main film making studios and been treated to a glimpse of their prized FSG (film script generating) computer which allows you to input the theme or title of your movie, in this case MAN ON A LEDGE, before automatically generating a story usually containing cops/soldiers and crime/terrorism, which is also in some way connected to your chosen central theme. The script is subsequently printed directly onto toilet paper so that those results deemed too ridiculous for viewing can simply be used by staff as part of a studio cost saving exercise.Unfortunately mix-ups in the washroom do occur and before you know it a faulty script gets made into a movie albeit with an apology tacked on at the end of the film.

150,Mooviepedia,Below average thriller suffers from a weak script and lack of tension. Save your time.,6,12 February 2012,"www.mooviepedia.com Man on a Ledge is an example of the worst type of movie: flawed and inept enough to be disposable, but not quite bad enough to be memorable or enjoyable in a ""so bad it's good"" sort of way. It is a film without any compelling reason to be seen or even exist, and it fades so quickly from memory that I am struggling to remember even the basic points of its simple yet absurd plot only a few hours after watching it.Nick Cassidy (Sam Worthington, whose post-Avatar career decline is becoming far steeper than most would have guessed), an ex-NYPD officer serving twenty-five years in prison for allegedly stealing the world's most expensive diamond from shady real estate developer David Englander (Ed Harris, in a phoned-in performance), escapes prison and then proceeds to stand on a ledge of the Roosevelt Hotel in Midtown and threaten to jump in order to prove his innocence. The stunt, we are quickly informed, is merely a distraction to divert police attention away from the building across the street, where Cassidy's brother (Jamie Bell) is attempting to steal the diamond that never actually left Englander's possession.The cookie-cutter plot isn't helped by the script, which tries to build a web of secrecy and betrayal while also tying the story into the current economic crisis in a feeble attempt at social relevance. Characters are severely underwritten, resulting in gifted character actors like Ed Burns, Anthony Mackie, and Titus Welliver being wasted in thankless supporting roles, while the leads (Worthington and Elizabeth Banks, playing the police negotiator who tries to talk Cassidy down) do what they can* with the lackluster material. As a supposed ""thriller,"" the movie is devoid of any sort of excitement, with an over-reliance on scenes where characters evade disaster with microseconds to spare; this annoying technique hasn't been effective in decades, and Man on a Ledge seemingly features dozens of such moments. Plot twists abound as the film approaches its climax, but they are so obvious and ridiculous that the movie becomes laughable by the end.Man on a Ledge marks the feature debut of acclaimed documentary filmmaker Asger Leth; it is an unremarkable effort, with no moments of originality or directorial prowess standing out. The PG-13 rating is baffling considering that the most financially successful films of this ilk (The Town and even this month's bland Mark Wahlberg effort Contraband come to mind) have been R-rated; the teen-friendly rating ensures that the film's few violent scenes lack visceral impact, and Leth fails to build any sort of palpable tension that might have compensated for the absence of hard-hitting action. To his credit, however, the film is paced well, with it never dragging despite its inability to engage the audience. Still, it is impossible to recommend Man on a Ledge to even the most casual moviegoer when countless similar but far superior movies exist.",Man on a Ledge

The whole movie generally is like a mashed up version of a dirty cop and a heist movie, most clichés included. But it is not successful in adequately performing as either of it. It did not have any proper attention given to the heist parts; most things just seemed to fall in place one after another as planned. The dirty cop side of this movie has been recycled and resold in so many movies.Although there is a threshold for tolerating logical inconsistencies and very unlikely coincidences in a movie, provided it is well compensated elsewhere like humor or complexity, this movie is just not up there.It is just an average movie with a bit of extra thrill but it bears the sin of a not so great story.",Man on a Ledge

Unfortunately it was not to be.The movie is about a cop, Nick (Sam Worthington) who is wrongly convicted of stealing a diamond and framed by crooked cops and an evil multimillionaire played by Ed Harris. To set the record straight, he breaks out of prison, gets new clothes from a safe house, goes to Manhattan and checks into a hotel and then goes out onto the ledge of the hotel so that everyone below will think he's trying to kill himself. This of course is just a diversion so that his brother and his brother's girlfriend, can quietly slip into the building across the street to find the diamond he was accused of stealing. Simple right?Now, here are just a couple of plot holes that I noticed. First are we to believe that a cop just happens to have a younger brother who has a girlfriend who are both seasoned cat burglars who know how to cut the right wire to deactivate the high tech alarm, shimmy through elevator shafts and foil a high tech heat sensor? Wow that is awfully convenient. Second, at the end when he jumps off the building (without looking below mind you) onto an inflatable mattress he walks away without a scratch? Really? Third, when he finally confronts Ed Harris at the end, after surviving his fall, he simply knocks Ed Harris down and takes out the diamond and waves it in the air. And this is supposed to bring the cops that have been chasing him all day to a halt? And then because of this, they swarm on Ed Harris. What does that prove. He waves a diamond in the air so he must be innocent? That can't be another diamond. Of course not. All the cops on the ground know is that he's broken out of prison and has attempted suicide and now has attacked a big shot millionaire. What does waving a diamond in the air prove? By the way Ed Harris' character is a Trump-like figure, wouldn't he have more security around him? Also why would they take the time to frame Sam Worthington's character by cooking up the whole stolen diamond thing? Wouldn't it be easier to just kill his character rather than frame him? Of course these are only a few plot holes that I have shared here. I'm sure I'm leaving out a ton more, for example the dad popping up at the end. What was that? And whose funeral were they at? And how was that planned? So do yourself a favor and avoid this one at all costs.",Man on a Ledge

Slick direction, no nonsense scenes, the editor deserves a round of applause for trashing the redundant things. I think this is what adds to the movie, this ""keeping out redundant things"" thing. This ain't the best product but the quality's not been compromised. Music could have added more but I believe much attention wasn't paid to that area.

160,eemeden,Bad director and poor actors?,4,11 August 2013,"Good setting and Worthington and Banks are doing fine. But that doesn't save the movie.The scenes with the young couple, Jamie Bell and Genesis Rodriguez spoiled this movie for me. They are awful and made me think several times during the movie, that who would let such obvious poor quality stuff get into an expensive product? Many scenes should've been filmed over and over again until the actors got it right and are convincing in what they do.Bell's and Rodriguez's acting is fake and shared sense of shame is the result for the viewer. One of the most awful scenes is the one where Rodrigues is crawling in an air duct and tries to act scared or panicking and fails disastrously. In other scenes those two try to be funny but the duo is awkward and out of sync and they can't express their emotions convincingly. In addition the jokes are bad ones, even though they could be fun enough when done by proper actors or in a guidance of a master director.Bad acting doesn't have to be the actor's fault though at least not completely. Problems with acting might be just a consequence as well and an indicator of a poor director - Asger Leth. The scenes aren't polished and the lack of strong director's touch is obvious here and there. The poor acting might be the result of director's fails, maybe he couldn't bring out the best qualities of the actors, or maybe he failed to see just how horrible some of that stuff is, which was allowed to get into the finished product.",Man on a Ledge

Seriously, the 2006 movie Inside man, written in 2002 around same time as Man on a Ledge. I'm not fanatic enough to see whose copyright was registered first. But very similar to Deep Impact vs Armageddon the critics favor one way more than the other.Most audiences should enjoy Man on a Ledge, because they give a very human protagonist or set up at least a more likable hero from the start then Inside Man did. Now I will agree, with like everybody, Inside Man's ending is better. However, I will not disregard the very satisfying finish to man on a ledge.I watch this movie every 2 years, and have seen it only 5-6x but with that time between viewings I seem to stay on the edge of my seat each viewing! It may seem like a hoax, but the only *Spoiler* is that I recognize and remember the Dad and proposal at the end. The inside man - Theme to have principles over profit is very anti-American but I like that, what I think is so lazy is such a easy villain profile of being a Nazi, genecide benefactor. And that is such a easy and oversimplified yet boring Antagonist. Since Inside man writers hid there villain til the end, you can understand all the complexities of Denzel's detective and the bank terrorist. Yet inside man's is slow and boring and not edge of seat like the better written Man on a Ledge. Ed burns, and Ed Harris again prove to be strong supporting actors in a solid production! I always enjoy Sam Worthington's delivery very similar enjoying Denzel's ability humanize our hero's. Plus, Elizabeth Banks and Anthony Mackie had there better performances like in the 90% of all there roles in this movie... meaning it was well written and directed.I would normally rate in the 8/10's or 80's-88 rating but I rounded up to 9/10, because how many viewers enjoyed it like myself yet critics made the most illogical claims about the movie.Read the negative critic marks before ever watching if this is a new movie to you, and you will be totally confused on how so many of the reviews lack substance. The most consistent negative is bad puns about the title man on ledge and how any idiot could see what was coming, yet I'm pretty sure anyone watching this movie for the first time will watch the whole thing and not need a pee break or fall asleep which usually happens everytime I try to re-watch Inside man which is a movie I like.

165,chris-lee-67,Increasingly silly,4,30 June 2012,"Another in the list of films which come up with a decent idea and then completely fail to think of a plausible way to carry it through to a satisfactory conclusion (Phone Booth being another obvious comparison).Full marks for the premise and the heart-pounding scenes filmed on the (real) ledge, which made for uncomfortable watching, but after around an hour, the film gets silly. And then sillier. And then ridiculous. It's a shame because it showed initial promise. So much of the film relies on improbability, implausibility, pure good luck and unbelievable coincidence, that the time (and money) the viewer has invested in the film is thrown back in their face by film-makers who clearly couldn't care less if the film ultimately makes any sense. Suspending disbelief is one thing, but a film such as this should at least be slightly believable, otherwise the whole exercise is pointless.The main gripe is that the entire film involves one man attempting (in a rather complicated and, clearly, almost suicidal way) to prove he was innocent of a diamond theft. However, the way he ultimately does this, after 90 minutes of messing around, is to punch the 'villain' to the ground in front of the crowd and the police, then pull the 'missing' diamond from the villain's pocket. Instantly the police arrest the villain, even though all they have seen is him being mugged by a known criminal. Plus, any defence lawyer - and you would imagine a millionaire could afford the best, would claim that the 'hero' had the gem in his hand the whole time and planted it on his client. It's such a silly and trite ending that everything that has gone before is rendered mere teasing. Did I mention that this scene has taken place seconds after our hero has jumped 50 ft horizontally and fallen 200 ft vertically, straight onto an air-bag. Yeah, right.Genesis Rodriguez has a nice arse though. So 1 extra mark.",Man on a Ledge
166,tlginter9,Fun thriller for the family,7,4 July 2012,"I really enjoyed this movie more than the IMDb score reflects. It was a fun thriller than was enjoyable for the whole family (which is probably why it isn't hard-core thriller enough for all the viewers to rate it higher). It's hard to have a good thriller when you know too much about the plot before the movie begins, but this film does a good job of filling in back story while the action is moving. There were a lot of plot twists that really kept the movie interesting and fun. Even as I thought I had the ending figured out, another twist would keep me guessing. The pace wasn't super-fast, but enough to keep me entertained. I think the actors were good enough, but Ed Harris was definitely enjoyable as the bad guy! Not the most original idea, but I think they did a good job with it. Very happy I rented it; also glad I didn't spend the money to see it in the theater.",Man on a Ledge
167,turfho,VERY poor sound editing,3,2 September 2012,"This appeared to be a decent fun movie, however my wife and I struggled through 40 minutes of this before we turned it off. The reason being, is that it is the worst of worst when it came to sound editing/mixing or whatever you call it. It is literally impossible to hear people speak because of the extremely loud background music and other modulations. We kept expecting it to get better but finally gave up. We might have to try watching it again but with close captioned. There were couple places in the first 40 minutes, that they eliminated the background modulations and we were able to hear and understand the dialog. We thought wonderful...Then it right back to the same thing. All the dialog between the negotiator and the man on the ledge were not hear able. The excessive music was even being played when there was nothing exciting going on..There were areas when the music was not needed at all, like inside offices where numerous people were about.We did like the selection of actors picked for the movie. It appeared even without being able to hear their audio, that they for the most part were playing their individuals roles well. The location of shooting came off very well with the mix of the big city life and the non lack of people to use in the backdrops.",Man on a Ledge
168,Nebiki,I wish I was on the ledge,2,12 February 2012,"I am amazed at the generosity of human kind. Somebody funded, created and distributed this movie, which I can only assume was a charitable gesture to the actors involved. It certainly wasn't to the cinema-goers. We won't detain you with the plot, because to be honest, the director didn't. The acting was almost uniformly two dimensional. The plot line - an exercise in scripting by numbers. In the theatre we watched it in, it was clear people were voting with their feet by leaving. They were the lucky ones. Just when you thought it couldn't get any worse, the finale includes a proposal scene in an Irish police pub. I didn't actually check, but I assume they had secured the ledges in the building we were watching it in. Move on, nothing to see here.",Man on a Ledge
169,crossms-53911,Awesome!,10,6 August 2019,"7 years later and I still love this movie! Action packed nonstop. Brilliant acting. Handsome, beautiful, smart, awesome directing and production. Good guys, bad guys, good bad guys, and bad good guys. The little guy beaten to a pulp wins against the money grubbing rich mean, selfish. ...there's hope, at least in the movies!

170,swayzecrazyinwisco,"Watch it , it's good",8,10 May 2020,"I mean I don't see why anyone would review this poorly, it keeps you guessing, great storyline. Watch it, there is far worse stuff than this. This actually worth a rewatch.",Man on a Ledge
171,madacomarketing,Too many liberties taken to make the movie,7,8 March 2021,"The movie was quick and entertaining, but way too many ""no ways"" - windows in high rises don't open, for one thing. Then at the end, Mike Ackerman, cop, would've been wearing bullet proof vest. I forget the rest, but too many times I found myself saying ""no way"".",Man on a Ledge
172,alexis17-920-791094,Man on the Ledge - 2012,8,5 January 2012,"The trailer doesn't give away too much - I thought yeah, maybe. However, I won free tickets so there I was at preview night. And guess what? The movie turned out to be a pleasant surprise. It manages to hold you on the edge of your seat. There are several turns and twists. Plus it's the guy from Avatar, Sam Worthington who plays a former cop, now fugitive,Ex-con Nick Cassidy. Never seen him in anything else, just Avatar 3 times. He's sexy and believable. His Australian accent did come out a few times, but on the whole it was endearing. The only thing he takes off is his jacket and ""the ledge"". Most of the movie takes place entirely on a N.Y. Manhattan 21st floor hotel ledge. The crowd notices, and YEs we have a JUMPER. I loved the crowd scenes, I wished there were more close ups on some of the screaming dialogues. There were great characters in the crowd, News team and your typical good/bad cops, Swat and Tactical teams. Oh, yes the fire department. The cast was well chosen. Ed Harris, played the sinister millionaire perfectly. God he's good. Jamie Bell, plays our leads' brother...Joey Cassidy-he's awesome too. He tricks and worries us several times throughout the film. His partner in crime, Kyra Sedgwick, plays Suzie Morales, his girlfriend with a past, is beautiful, (for all you straight men- especially when she's in her undies) and their dialogue is total comedy slapstick. I loved them, I totally laughed and wanted to see more. Elizabeth Banks, the police psychologist, was perfect also in every way. The movie does not have any major violence or profanity but the heist is exciting. I liked it and would see it again.",Man on a Ledge
173,adamhwongstudios,"Great time-waster, keep it off your DVD shelf.",4,26 January 2012,"The premise of Man on a Ledge seems incredibly silly at first. There are a few nuggets of information you can glean from the trailer that prove my statement:There is a man on a ledge. Said man on ledge wants to prove his innocence. Man is no longer on said ledge.Seriously. Watch the trailer. I can't really think of any other word other than ""silly"" to describe it. Asinine, maybe, but I feel like calling this movie asinine is an insult to the thesaurus. Anyhow: all the clichés are there. The female detective shouting This is my negotiation! to What if he is really innocent? All those things that make the Crime Thriller genre gel are there, and there's no denying that this could turn out to be a cookie-cutter crime movie. It has promise to be an entertaining way to spend a rainy Tuesday night.But should you take that leap?Nick Cassidy, played by Sam Worthington, is a man on a mission (and eventually, on a ledge). He escapes prison, and rather than wait out his sentence like a normal person, he wants to prove to the world that he didn't commit the alleged crime that put him behind bars, and that he was set up by antagonist David Englander (Ed Harris).Man on a Ledge follows the same formula that many crime flicks prescribe to, such as Inside Man. Set plot, throw red herrings at buildings, distract audience, plot twist, fin. In fact, I was thinking of other bank heist movies, and Inside Man is the closest facsimile, minus the fact that Inside Man is actually worth owning.Was this film fun: yes, as a matter of fact, it was. But the trailer reveals every revelation that the characters uncover, so watching the movie is a backwards affair. There are its moments, but overall, it's a lackluster affair that's a great time-killer, but shouldn't take up space on your Blu-ray shelf.Spoilers after the jump! (see what I did there?)###Photography The thing that kept me entrenched and involved with the movie was the photography, masterfully done by Paul Cameron. I say ""masterfully"" like it will win awards based solely on the cinematography–it won't, but each of the shots needed a fresh feel, or it would've turned into an awkward Phone Booth like film. And no film wants to be compared to Phone Booth. Even phone booths are considering a name change.The movie isn't without its quirks. There are a few moments where Nick's brother, Joey (Jamie Bell) and his girlfriend, Angie (Genesis Rodriguez) fill in the comic relief role, and it's actually a welcome change of pace. The overarching heist motif runs dull in movies like these, especially where the viewer is particularly aware of the outcome.Once the previously mentioned duo enters the heist location, some pretty funny stuff happens. All of it is borderline ridiculous, which in the end, makes this movie bearable. There is a seemingly 80s-like underwear scene featuring Rodriguez that the director just felt he had to get in there. If it sells tickets, it works, I guess. If a tried and true cheap pop works, do it. Oh, wait! That was thirty years ago.The duo somehow managed to sneak into the safehouse with a skateboard, and Joey rolls stealthily across the floor on it. It's comical, but it's in these little moments like these that one realizes that the cinematography is actually top-notch, and can go unnoticed due to the predictable nature of the movieGrade: ****Story The weak point of the movie is, unfortunately, the story. The plot isn't helped much by the acting, either, as all of the cast pulls a mediocre performance across the board. As previously mentioned, the thing that makes this movie watchable is the amateur hour that ensues as Joey and Angie attempt what is seemingly what a heist were to look like if the cast members from Glee attempted one: it sucks, they are bad at it, and no one really acts like that. The bickering is borderline psychotic, and the innuendo is juvenile. Okay, maybe that was an uncalled for potshot, but this movie is bad, and I get confused when something is both bad and entertaining. Stop being so confusing, movie!The elaborate plan that Nick devised was to steal back the diamond from Englander, and prove that he never stole it in the first place. But if he shows reporters that he has the diamond presently, doesn't that just insinuate that it was in his possession the whole time? I'm going to steal the diamond. For the first time! he says with utter conviction. Some things just don't make sense. They are both bad and entertaining. Like American Idol! Okay, I should probably stop bashing FOX shows, but they brought it on themselves. This movie should've been a made-for-FOX movie. It's that ridiculous.Grade: *Overall, Man on a Ledge is an entertaining distraction, but it would definitely clash in any sane person's movie collection. Unless you collect bad movies. Then this would be a good movie to get. If that was the case, you probably own Troll 2 or Leprechaun in the Hood. This would fit right in.Final Grade: Watch it on Netflix (streaming).",Man on a Ledge
174,quietpeak,Just Awful,3,6 June 2012,"I love using the IMDb user reviews to guide my selection of movies and am usually very successful in picking a movie that I enjoy, based on other's tastes expressed in their reviews. This is my first. I feel compelled to write it so that some other user may avoid wasting 2 hours of their time on this movie.With a $40 million budget I expected more than this silly cotton candy formulaic completely predictable movie full of every cliché in this genre.I just saw it on DVD and make it a habit of reading at least 10 IMDb reviews before I pick any movie. I thought after doing so I was guaranteed at least some originality, decent acting, production values, and excitement. Instead I was left with the feeling that I had seen many elements of this movie in many other movies. Avoid it.",Man on a Ledge
175,bencowan41,Don't bother watching this.,3,16 June 2012,"I watched this film on Sky Movies and did not see any of the trailers or read any reviews prior to watching, a mistake I sorely regret.However at first I did enjoy watching the film as it seemed an interesting concept. But then as the story progressed I abruptly changed my mind.The film is full of overused clichés and is not unique or interesting in anyway, it is just another generic ""wrongly accused good guy"" story.The acting is poor for example the ""slapstick banter"" between Cassidy's brother and his ""feisty street wise girlfriend"" was inexcusable and the plot holes made me want to punch the television. A better title would of been ""coincidence"" as it is entirely dependant on it. There is barely any explanation of the back story especially for other main protagonists, like his brother and there is no logic whatever in any of the characters actions.",Man on a Ledge
176,ceeyung39,Somewhat Predictable,7,29 June 2012,"I only rated it a 7/10 because i could predict the movie This was a good movie altogether even though i could predict what was going to happen before it even happened because I've seen some movies with the same concept. I knew from the scene at the funeral where he fights his brother that it was a planned escape. As i stated before, the movie had some nice but predictable twist to it.Some of them are that the bellhop actually turned out to be his father, and how Dante was the one who set Nick up. Although i enjoyed watching this film, if i wasn't someone who's watched a lot of movies of the same category of this one i would have enjoyed it more.I would strongly recommend you to watch this movie!",Man on a Ledge
177,antbaroudi,I really loved Man On A Ledge!!,9,18 September 2013,"I found Man On A Ledge entertaining and full of suspense, and did not get up off my sofa at any point, I was that riveted. Sam Worthington acted excellently as Nick Cassidy, as did Jamie Bell as Joey Cassidy, his younger brother.. Wouldn't you go so far as to take part in a diamond heist to protect your family? I thought the banter between Joey and his girlfriend Angie was superb, making me laugh more than once, likewise between Lydia Mercer and Jack Doherty, played by Elizabeth Banks and Edward Burns.Ed Harris as the evil David Englander, and his accomplice Dante Marcus (Titus Welliver) were brilliantly cast, and that scene between them and the two Cassidy brothers on the roof had me almost screaming at the TV screen that things had better end well!Sure, the title is lame, but even though I watched the trailer and thought it weird, I still actively rented this movie out and gave it a chance, and how glad I am that I did! Next stop: buying the DVD!9/10",Man on a Ledge
