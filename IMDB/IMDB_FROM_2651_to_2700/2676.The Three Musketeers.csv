0,TheLittleSongbird,I really like it!,8,5 February 2009,"I have read the book, which is very good, and I have seen the Gene Kelly version and the 1973 film which I think are both better. At least this adaptation kept me entertained. The sword fights were clumsy, but energetic. Chris O'Donnell was a bit weak as the protagonist known as D'Artagnan. The king and Queen were a bit young, but at least they can act, particularly the lovely Gabrielle Anwar. Now for the pros. Great music by Michael Kamen, and Tim Curry's (one of the better actors in the film) Cardinal Richelieu is very slimy. It's not his best performance,he overdid the character at times, but I was entertained by one of my favourite actors, as he had some good lines like ""Austria's loss is France's gain "". Kiefer Sutherland was good too, and Michael Wincott was also impressive. Charlie Sheen likewise, but Oliver Platt had some truly funny lines, and delivered them with zany zest. The film itself looks beautiful, with nice locations, cinematography and costumes, and I liked Rebecca DeMornay as Milady. The only problem I had with Milady was the way she died, completely unfaithful to the book. Entertaining film, but I don't know what Alexandre Dumas would make of it though. 8/10 Bethany Cox",The Three Musketeers
1,SnoopyStyle,not quite fun or intense action adventure,5,4 June 2015,"D'Artagnan (Chris O'Donnell) intends to follow his father and join the Musketeers in Paris. His father was disgraced for supposedly failing to protect the king. Rochefort (Michael Wincott) working under the evil Cardinal Richelieu (Tim Curry) disbands the Musketeers. Three Musketeers Aramis (Charlie Sheen), Athos (Kiefer Sutherland) and Porthos (Oliver Platt) refuses to surrender. D'Artagnan quickly finds himself with three separate duels with the three Musketeers. He falls for Constance (Julie Delpy) who is a lady-in-waiting with Queen Anne (Gabrielle Anwar). D'Artagnan is captured by Rochefort but escapes after learning of Richelieu's plan to conspire with the English and Milady De Winter (Rebecca De Mornay) to overthrow the King.This Three Musketeers is trying to be another Young Guns. The problem is that it can't quite make this fun without feeling silly. This is a light weight swashbuckling adventure of yesteryears. It has no tension. The chemistry between the Musketeers feels tired. Chris O'Donnell has his joyless sincerity. The movie stalls whenever the swashbuckling action stops.",The Three Musketeers
2,jboothmillard,The Three Musketeers,4,26 January 2010,"I thought I had seen bits of the Disney made film with Chris O'Donnell, so I thought if I had, I should see the whole thing, from director Stephen Herek (Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure, 101 Dalmatians). Basically D'Artagnan (Razzie nominated Chris O'Donnell) is wanting to join the musketeers, or at least the three best members that remain where the others have disbanded, Aramis (Charlie Sheen), Athos (Kiefer Sutherland) and Porthos (Oliver Platt). The four of them are going against the villainous Cardinal Richelieu (Tim Curry) who is trying to get King Louis (Hugh O'Conor) off the throne, to rule England for himself. His right hand Rochefort (Michael Wincott) is the one who officially announces the disbanding of the King's Musketeers, but fighter and drinker Athos, pirate and lover Porthos, priest and poet Aramis, and eager and brave D'Artagnan refuse to throw down their swords. After capturing fellow villain, the mysterious Countess D'Winter (Rebecca De Mornay), they uncover this plot and do whatever they can to stop the Cardinal, and protect King and Country, all for one and one for all. Also starring Gabrielle Anwar as Queen Anne, Paul McGann as Girard / Jussac and Julie Delpy as Constance. O'Donnell is a little more bearable than usual (only other time is Batman Forever), the three stars as the musketeers all get their moments, but the Americanisation is a bit silly, and there aren't enough action bits, but it's a swashbuckling comedy adventure worth seeing once at least. Okay!",The Three Musketeers

4,hitchcockthelegend,"One for all and all for one, Muskehounds are always ready.",4,4 April 2013,"OK, this isn't actually the fab cartoon series Dogtanian and the Three Muskehounds, but Stephen Herek's Disney film is basically a live action cartoon.Starring Charlie Sheen, Kiefer Sutherland, Chris O'Donnell and Oliver Platt as Aramis-Athos-D'Artagnan and Porthos respectively, story is a fictional load of guff involving Tim Curry's evil Cardinal Richelieu trying to usurp Hugh O'Conor's King Louis XIII of France. Enter the last remaining Musketeers, sworn to serve their King, who after being joined by D'Artagnan set about foiling dastardly plans whilst admiring heaving bosoms.There's a couple of half decent sword fighting scenes, the photography (Dean Semler) and costuming is first rate, and undeniably there's a sense of fun about the whole thing; even if some of it is not intentional. But it's a pretty flat experience as valid entertainment, almost every casting decision is wrong, with O'Donnell and Sheen ridiculous beyond belief, the plot is wafer thin, the dialogue awful and the running time is padded out with music that hinders rather than enhances the pic. Michael Wincott (Captain Rochefort) and Rebecca De Mornay's (Milady De Winter/Sabine) breasts come out of the production in credit, but really you should seek out the Muskehounds as a better alternative for cartoon swordery. 4/10",The Three Musketeers
5,CinemaSerf,An OK remake that allows Tim Curry to rule the roost...,6,31 March 2020,"Ok, first things first - this has nothing at all to do the Dumas' book. We ought to be clear on that before we continue through this Disneyfied interpretation of this classic story. A way too handsome Chris O'Donnell is ""D'Artagnan"" who arrives in Paris determined to follow in his father's footsteps and join the King's Musketeers. There is a fly in his ointment, though - the evil Cardinal Richelieu (Tim Curry) has seen to it that this particular militia has been disbanded in disgrace. Through a series of mishaps, he finds himself facing three duels with erstwhile musketeers - Messieurs Aramis, Porthos and Athos who all end up fighting the Cardinal's guard and unite... Charlie Sheen, Kiefer Sutherland and Oliver Platt are his colleagues as they struggle to restore their legion and simultaneously avert an English invasion, and quite probably a coup to replace the infantile King Louis. It's quite well paced, there is plenty of action and Curry is clearly having a bit of a laugh as the evil churchman. Otherwise, however, it's an unremarkable remake lacking much of the charm and cunning of either the 1948 or Richard Lester's 1973 romp.",The Three Musketeers
6,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"All for one, and one light-hearted action adventure for all",7,24 December 2009,"I have not read the novel by Alexandre Dumas père, but we all already know that this is not, and was never going to be, the most accurate adaptation of it. This is about what you'd expect Disney to release. There is humor that only a child would laugh at(which is not to say that this isn't funny at all), everything is divided into black & white(meanwhile, kudos to them for not making it look as though all religious people are bad), and history is sanitized almost beyond recognition, to preserve the so-called innocence that the majority of adults(well, in the Western world anyway) prefer to believe their off-spring possess. With that said, this is an entertaining ride. The characters could use fleshing out. Curry and, to a slightly lesser extent, Wincott, are deliciously evil, making them immensely enjoyable to watch. Tim on-screen is like those Saturday morning cartoon villains who chuckle menacingly at their own fiendish plots. Platt portrays a jerk as usual. DeMornay does what she's known for doing, if toned down what with this being a family film. Parts of this are irritating to everyone over the age of seven. The story is easy enough to follow. There is mild language and violence, and sex tends to be hinted at or vaguely referred to in dialog. I recommend this to anyone into the genres. 7/10",The Three Musketeers
7,view_and_review,"Not a hard pass, but a pass",5,23 June 2020,"""The Three Musketeers"" failed to get off the ground. It had periods of high thrust, but never enough to get airborne.Charlie Sheen, Oliver Platt, and Kiefer Sutherland played the three Musketeers, which should be enough for a hit movie under any circumstances. Throw in there Tim Curry as the evil Cardinal trying to usurp the throne and a mercurial Rebecca De Mornay, and you'd think for sure that the movie was a smash.I don't know, it may have done well at the box office, but it didn't do well in my living room. It was too rote. At times I thought I was just watching an updated version of ""Robin Hood.""Cardinal Richelieu (Tim Curry) had a master plan to become king of France. Of course, that meant somehow getting rid of the current king. His first step was to disband the Musketeers, of which three decided not to relinquish their sacred duties. At the same time, a young man named D'Artagnan (Chris O'Donnell) had an ardent desire to become a Musketeer. If all it took was brazenness and a cocky attitude then he would have been more than suitable for the job from the beginning. He would initially bump heads with the three Musketeers only to aid them later (almost making him a fourth Musketeer).As a production it was grand. The costumes and the set were top notch and the actors garnered were ""A"" listers. The plot itself though was a stale one and it amazed me how many treacherous people the king had around him. I mean, the only way a Cardinal is going to take the throne is by having nothing but his loyalists around while ridding the kingdom of anyone loyal to the king. If you can accomplish that then that was one fragile kingdom to begin with. Maybe in an earlier time ""The Three Musketeers"" would've been better. Heck, maybe in 1993 ""The Three Musketeers"" was better. In 2020 it's not a hard pass, but it's a pass.",The Three Musketeers
8,FlashCallahan,I'm inspired to dance.....,6,3 November 2011,"The three best of the disbanded Musketeers - Athos, Porthos, and Aramis - join a young hotheaded would-be-Musketeer, D'Artagnan, to stop the Cardinal Richelieu's evil plot: to form an alliance with enemy England by way of the mysterious Milady.Rochefort, the Cardinal's right-hand man, announces the official disbanding of the King's Musketeers.Three, however, refuse to throw down their swords - Athos the fighter and drinker, Porthos the pirate and lover, and Aramis the priest and poet.Arriving in Paris to join the Musketeers, D'Artagnan uncovers the Cardinal's plans, and the four set out on a mission to protect King and Country....From the upstart of the film, you cannot help but think Disney is trying to cash in on the 'Prince of Thieves' bandwagon. For one Wincott pays the second in command villain, and Bryan Adams provides the 'big' song.Whilst it's nowhere near as fun as the aforementioned movie,it still has it's moments and the titular characters are a hoot whenever they are together on screen.O' Donnell on the other hand is the kiss of death for this movie, and ruins every scene he's in. It just goes to show that 'scent of a woman' was a one trick pony.Luckily Sheen, Sutherland and Platt share most of his scenes and over shadow him at all times.Curry is crazily fun as the Cardinal and just keeps the ham and cheese light. Other characters are wasted, and annoying, but the last third of the film ups the action ante and makes the whole thing worth sitting through.Just.",The Three Musketeers
9,Mr-Fusion,"""Come D'Artagnan, we're saving the King!""",7,16 November 2021,"If memory serves, I'd written this off as a ""Prince of Thieves"" cash-in at the time (even as a teen, it seemed obvious). But it's an unfair comparison and ""The Three Musketeers"" is entirely its own thing. This is a spirited, well-mounted adventure with evident chemistry between the lead foursome. Not to mention Tim Curry's undeniable screen presence and Michael Kamen's expert scoring. It's a good story with enough weight but still a sense of fun throughout; and you can primarily thank Oliver Platt for this, because he's clearly having fun. Plus, he's able to hold his own against the bigger names in the cast.Add in the clanging of rapiers and some wonderfully un-Disney sexuality, Older Me finds this movie a pleasure to watch.",The Three Musketeers
10,cricketbat,A lot less swashbuckley than I remember,6,26 November 2019,"I remember really enjoying this movie as a kid, however The Three Musketeers is a lot less swashbuckley than I remembered. This very loose adaptation of the novel by Alexandre Dumas was depending a lot on the star power of Charlie Sheen, Kiefer Sutherland, Chris O'Donnell, and maybe even Oliver Platt to carry the film, but that power has diminished a little over the years. At least ""All for Love"" is still a great song.",The Three Musketeers
11,slightlymad22,"Sheen, Sutherland and Platt are Young Swords",7,17 September 2014,"Based VERY loosely on the novel The Three Musketeers. It tells the story of d'Artagnan (Chris O'Donnell,) on his quest to join the three title characters in becoming a musketeer. Reteaming 'Young Guns' co stars Charlie Sheen and Kiefer Sutherland with Oliver Platt as the three Musketeers, and casting a delightful Tim Curry as Cardinal Richelieu and throw Rebecca De Mornay in there too, and the cast alone should scream ""This is a winner folks, get in line"" however it falls short, and sadly the problem is the casting of d'Artagnan.Chris O'Donnell is far too hot headed and arrogant to be likable, and it makes it hard for you to root for him as a hero. Never a great actor, he seems to have been very fortunate to get some great roles. He starred opposite Al Pacino in 'Scent Of A Woman' the same year as this. Al Pacino acted him off the screen, and won the Oscar, but he was there none the less. Then he managed to nab the role of Robin in 'Batman Forever' and 'Batman & Robin. He then landed a few leading roles in movies, before he turned to TV for regular acting work. Not bad for a guy who can't act and has zero charisma. De Mornay's performance is baffling as her performance gives the impression, she thought the movie was something totally different. Hugh O Conor as King Louis is another weak link, as is Gabrielle Anwar. With a better d'Artagnan, someone like a Brad Pitt or a Johnny Depp (tho Pitt had 'True Romance' and 'Kalifornia' out that year, whilst Depp was starting in 'Benny & Joon' and 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape?' so maybe they weren't available.... Likewise Leo DiCaprio, Depp's costar in 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape?' He also started in 'This Boys Life' with Robert De Niro. Maybe a Neil Patrick Harris (famous for being TV's Dougie Houser MD then) and some improvement in the supporting cast? this would have done better, and would have had franchise wrote all over it. Sheen and Suthwrland are both as fun and reliable as you'd expect, and Platt (the go to fat guy of the 90's) steals a lot of scenes, and had some good lines. The actual Three Musketeers of the title deserve a better movie than what they eventually get.",The Three Musketeers
12,filipemanuelneto,"A satisfactory adaptation, albeit with some obvious flaws.",7,14 February 2021,"""The Three Musketeers"" are one of the fiction books most adapted to cinema. This is another adaptation to add to the extensive list and, despite not being the best, it is one of the best that has been made in recent years (at least, the ones I have seen so far). More serious than the ""classic slapstick"" of the Seventies, it is more historically accurate than the 2011 blockbuster, despite remaining an adventure and having many moments where historical rigor is, as it were, forgotten in a corner. This is particularly true of the way in which almost all characters behave and act, and which has much more to do with the 20th century than with the 17th. As I said, it is a flawed film.The cast is quite good, overall. It does not provide us with an interpretive show, but does what is necessary to present a good work. Chris O'Donnell was satisfactory, he looks young and energetic enough for the character, and he looks like the best D'Artagnan of the three films I've seen so far (1973, 2011 and this one). Charlie Sheen, Kiefer Sutherland and, especially, Oliver Platt, are very effective, fun and energetic as Musketeers. Rebecca DeMornay is really beautiful and made the most of her physical talents and her magnificent hair in giving life to the beautiful and dangerous Milady. Gabrielle Anwar and Hugh O'Connor are effective as king and queen, but sometimes they seem lukewarm and devoid of personality. In the negative, I would highlight Tim Curry's poor interpretation of Richelieu. Despite the good lines and dialogues, he is histrionic and truly demonized the character. Michael Wincott also looks more dark and diabolical than he should be, but he doesn't sound too exaggerated.Technically, it is a film that is within the standard of the adventure films of the Nineties. It has an unoriginal cinematography, but the sets and costumes seem satisfactory. The filming locations were very well selected and include the Imperial Palace in Vienna and the Liechtenstein Castle. The visual and special effects play their part and the fight and action scenes were quite well done, although they didn't seem genuine. Michael Kamen leaves us with a good soundtrack, appropriately epic and grand.",The Three Musketeers
13,Vartiainen,"Rushed, but fun",6,25 January 2016,"Alexander Dumas' great book has been adapted to film numerous times. And for a good reason, for it is a great story, full of adventure, political intrigue, great characters and daring deeds. Yet I'd claim that it is not really suited for being a movie. Or at least I haven't seen a version yet that manages to capture the spirit and greatness of the original novel.That being said, despite its obvious flaws, this particular film is actually rather enjoyable. Charlie Sheen, Kiefer Sutherland and Oliver Platt portray Aramis, Athos and Porthos, respectively, while Chris O'Donnell plays D'Artagnan. D'Artagnan is a son of a musketeer, an elite guard of the king of France, and is all set out to become one himself. Unfortunately, just as he travels to Paris, Cardinal Richelieu (Tim Curry) has disbanded the musketeers as obsolete and outdated, all while vying for power over the young king. And thus all the musketeers have put down their swords. All except three, thus the title.What the movie gets right is the energy and the adventure. All the main characters are played by good actors and they give solid, entertaining performances. Curry is especially enjoyable as a completely over the top villain. The action scenes are also very good and the whole film looks very nice, having great production values. Definitely a film for all adventure fans.Where the film fails is as an adaptation. The events of the book are not followed all that closely and a lot of the story lines have been completely dropped. And even when they follow the book, it seems that they are in a rush. Like the scene where D'Artagnan and the Three Musketeers meet for the first time. It is a classic scene that been imitated countless of times, but in this film it happens in under five minutes. Like they were in a terrible hurry, which is a real disservice to such a great scene.All in all, The Three Musketeers is at its best if you don't know all that much about the original story from the book. As a standalone film it is a fun little adventure film with good characters. Still, I've seen far worse adaptations.",The Three Musketeers
14,FiendishDramaturgy,This was the first High Dollar Disney Live Action to Really Pull it Off.,9,15 March 2007,"In later years, Disney has managed a wild success with the Pirates of the Caribbean run, and most people think this is the first non-animated Disney full-length feature to really achieve the height of story or accomplish the epic filming of the aforementioned franchise. Unfortunately, that is not the case. Disney's family adventures were fine stories, well done family films, which entertain and teach the appropriate Disney-centric moral lessons.The Three Musketeers fully delivers the story. It IS Disney-ized, of course, but it still tells the full and embellished story of the Three Muskateers in a fun, family-oriented kind of way.Watch the Man in the Iron Mask with DiCapprio for the REST of the Musketeer Story.I found this to be fine Disney fare-one of the best, in fact.I love this one.It rates an 8.9/10 from...the Fiend :.",The Three Musketeers

Mr Lester's earlier version was too self - consciously smug and clever for me;tried too hard to be British and Monty Pythonesque(Heaven forfend).Here it's just good old - fashioned fun with Mr K.Sutherland outstanding,but all the boys doing the most unlikely feats of swordsmanship and athleticism. This is not a serious history of pre - revolutionary France.It's a family comedy with bags of action that can offend nobody except the po - faced critics who want to see a straight adaptation of Monsieur Dumas' immortal story. I liked this film.It made me laugh,the horsemanship was outstanding,the swordfights brilliant and Mr T.Curry deliciously bad. I have a feeling that Dumas would have forgiven the liberties taken with his text in order to make it accessible to all,not just a few Francophiles,who,clearly,don't want to share it with the rest of us peasants.After all,it was that sort of attitude that triggered the French Revolution,n'est ce pas?",The Three Musketeers

Taking the template of the latter and adding a little Young Guns for good measure, the result is a jauntily paced, but listlessly plotted junior division yawner that couldn't be any more 90s if it featured Bill Clinton in a pair of Zubaz pants singing Hootie and the Blowfish songs on stage at Lollapalooza.Let's look at the 'Prince Of Thieves' similarities.Both featured a score by Michael Kamen.Both featured a hit song by Bryan Adams. In the case of 'Musketeers', Sting and Rod Stewart joined in to make it a three cheese pizza with the torturous ""All for love"".Both films featured Michael Wincott playing essentially the same character.Tim Curry was clearly meant to replicate the turn by Alan Rickman, but Curry plays it more straight.The overall tone was undoubtedly inspired by 'Prince Of Thieves'.",The Three Musketeers

The famous Musketeer phrase is also said a lot.This film is a little bit of a weird one, in terms of how I feel about it. It's clearly enjoyable but I wasn't sure if it deserves the step above rating that I've given, by the end I think it just about gets there. I like the plot, the locations and pacing, but it took a relative while for the cast to grow on me.Chris O'Donnell (D'Artagnan) and Oliver Platt (Porthos) would be my standouts, I liked both of them pretty much from the beginning; it's my first time seeing O'Donnell, away from his 'Batman' appearances, though have seen Platt a number of times.Charlie Sheen (Aramis) and Kiefer Sutherland (Athos) are the ones who don't work amazingly in my opinion. I don't love their acting styles here, while I didn't sense enough chemistry between the two - and Platt, for that matter.Tim Curry, meanwhile, is always hit-and-miss to me - not helped by the fact that 'Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties' is my biggest memory of him, I'm constantly hearing Prince XII whenever he talks - my apologies, Mr. Curry.Lastly for the cast, it's also interesting (for me) seeing Paul McGann involved - I've very recently become aware of him through television's 'Luther'.

18,barnabyrudge,"Easy-going, thoroughly inoffensive version of a richly detailed literary classic.",5,30 April 2009,"Alexandre Dumas was noted for his long (frequently 800+ pages) and sophisticatedly plotted historical novels, the most famous of which include The Man In The Iron Mask, The Count Of Monte Cristo and The Three Musketeers. This version of Three Musketeers does away with the many subplots and intricacies of Dumas's original story, and is a very simple-minded retelling which favours pace and humour over anything meatier. Only the skeletal outline of the plot remains intact – it's just an example of Disney using this particular classic tale to churn out a family swashbuckler. Perfectly easy viewing, yes, but also uninspired and disposable.D'Artagnan (Chris O'Donnell) is on his way to Paris to become a musketeer as was his now-dead father before him. However, his timing couldn't be worse, for as he arrives in Paris he learns that the musketeers have just been disbanded by the scheming Cardinal Richlieu (Tim Curry). Only a handful of musketeers remain loyal to their uniform – most notably the daring trio of Athos (Kiefer Sutherland), Porthos (Oliver Platt) and Aramis (Charlie Sheen). Via a series of coincidences, D'Artagnan falls in with these three adventurers and finds himself fighting to restore the musketeers and overthrow the Cardinal before he seizes control of France. Their main quest is to track down a cunning spy, Milady De Winter (Rebecca De Mornay), and force her into revealing how the Cardinal intends to put his plans into effect. They must also save the King (Hugh O'Conor) from an audacious assassination attempt.Considering how slight and unambitious the film is, the makers have managed to get together a truly star-studded cast. On the whole, though, each actor is wasted in a largely underwritten and forgettable role. Sheen in particular seems to exist pointlessly on the periphery of the action and has virtually nothing to do. Likewise, O'Donnell and Sutherland have too little to work with to make their characters genuinely identifiable. Platt has it slightly better as the boozy and high-spirited Porthos, while Curry easily walks away with the movie by doing his best impression of a pantomime villain as the sinister Cardinal. The film's many action sequences are well choreographed and spectacular, but lack true spirit. Much of the photography – with Cornwall and Austria standing in for 17th century France – is pleasing to the eye and lends the film a polished look. It's not hard to sit through The Three Musketeers – it moves quickly and smoothly from one entertaining sequence to the next. But it IS hard to view it as anything more than a simple time-filler, and a dumbed-down version of a story that should really contain so much more depth",The Three Musketeers

20,gcd70,"Weak, disappointing, predictable (yet occasionally funny)",4,11 December 2007,"Predictable and unoriginal, this is formula film making at its best, as director Herek has followed in the footsteps of ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"" by making a carbon copy of that movie in order to guarantee success.Of course this time we don't follow Kevin Costner through Sherwood Forest but rather the King's own brave guards, ""The Three Musketeers"", through Paris as they try to thwart an attempt to overthrow his majesty.No aspect of Alexandre Dumas' original adventure story is really done justice here, and brat-packers Charlie Sheen, Kiefer Sutherland, Oliver Platt and Chris O'Donnell in tow, never quite strike you as swashbuckling. While O'Donnell plays the heady D'artagnan fairly well, the other three are more like a group of wise guys reeling off smart remarks as they dispose of the Cardinal's evil men. Even Tim Curry, as wicked, scheming Cardinal Richelieu has been better, although he does enjoy his villainous role.Dean Semler's cinematography is often spectacular, and Michael Kamen's music enjoyable, in a film which is otherwise weak and disappointing, if occasionally funny.

Soon D'Artagnan become entangled in the musketeers fight for survival and their quest to save the king.Well, a variant of the classic, this is the best adaption of it I've ever seen. What separates this movie from other musketeer and movies of this kind is the light-hearted and humorous spirit throughout the movie. Also the different characters are great, Tim Curry is great as the evil cardinal. And the three musketeers is so good (especially Porthos, I like him) that mostly D'Artagnan is just another bystander. O'Donnel does no bad work, no, but the others is really good. Add this great acting and characters to costumes and some nice swordplay you got a really nice movie. Which brings me to my one line summary, a quote from Richelieu, All for one and more for me! I like this movie, and would really like to see some more of the same kind. Action, Adventure, Love and Comedy... all in one!8/10",The Three Musketeers
22,TheOneThatYouWanted,At least the first half doesn't s&@k,5,15 September 2018,"For the first 40 minutes of this film I was wondering why it has as low of a ranking as it does because it was well paced and entertaining. Then after watching the rest of the film, the mystery was solved. The second half of the film crashes and burns with convoluted side plots, poor pacing and choppy action scenes.",The Three Musketeers
23,triple8,An adventurous journey into fantasy,8,10 September 2003,"This is the only version of the three musketeers that I've seem but I have to say I really enjoyed it. This is a great movie to watch when you've had a bad day or just want to escape into fantasy. The movie is pure fun and adventure(lots of good looking men for the ladies and lots of solid action/adventure for the men). It's a great ""escape movie"" plus a great tale of friendship and camaraderie. This is a movie I throughly enjoyed and would easily give multiple viewings too.The cast was really good and the movie is well paced and stays interesting throughout. It's easy to just kick back and enjoy the movie, from beginning to end.Some people don't like these type of fantasy/sword fighting movies but I think the appeal of this movie is it can cross over even to people who aren't fans of such types. I could easily see, for instance someone hating ""The Princess Bride""(which I loved) if their just not into fairy tale type movies. But I think this movie can appeal to all types:people who love the above mentioned type of movie but also people who may not conventionally choose a movie of this type and are just in the mood for a slice of good solid fun and adventure. I'd definitely recommend ""Musketeers"". Nothing really negative to say at all.",The Three Musketeers
24,Spleen,I'll admit it: I liked it,7,19 January 2000,"Disney's version of `The Three Musketeers' was made like lightning in order to undercut some other studio's version - or perhaps to prevent some other studio from undercutting Disney, I'm not sure which.  In either case it shows signs of haste.  There's none of your intricate, dazzlingly inventive swordplay or action sequences; there's lots of competently executed, run-of-the-mill, whatever-works-simplest stuff instead.  Characters consist of their costumes and little more.  There's el-lame-o dialogue.  Anything that separates `The Three Musketeers' - the work by Dumas, that is - from any other swashbuckler, has been ruthlessly excised.I found myself liking it all the same.  The fact that I liked it is a fact about ME, and not the film, which is not, I'll admit, very good.  But there is one fact about the film I'd like to draw everyone's attention to.  The musketeers  clearly think morality is something very important, but their concrete notions of right and wrong are decidedly odd.  In fact they're downright primitive: like Aristotlean physics, only sillier.  There is so little common ground between the code of honour of the musketeer and our own code that we throw up our hands in despair; we don't even bother to adopt the musketeer's code as our own for the purposes of the fiction; and yet, somehow, our sympathy is always with the musketeer.I shouldn't say `somehow'.  This strange feeling of sympathy is something to write home about when one encounters it in the novel, whereas in the film we have a villain - a cardinal, no less, and who likes cardinals - who all but has horns and a tail.  Still, SOME feeling of forlorn bloodlust carries over from the book, to give a tint to what would otherwise be a very colourless film.",The Three Musketeers
25,Gislef,Eh Adaptation - Okay Action Flick,6,11 February 2000,"Nope, it's by no means an accurate adaptation of Dumas' original work.  Umm, does nanyone really care?  Dumas' plot, while interesting in and of itself to many, is probably not one that many folks who think of ""the Three Musketters"" could actually _tell_ you.This movie sets out to more or less capture the feel of such films, rather than the source material itself.  In that regard, it's not too badly done. The characters are pretty broadly drawn, but adequate for the younger audience they're aimed at.  Sutherland, Platt, and Sheen all seem way too young, but at least the first two are entertaining.  Platt in particular manages to steal every scene he's in.By the same token, Richelieu's character is simplified to ""generic bad guy."" The King and Queen seem too young as well (although they're represented age may be novelistically and/or historically accurate - again, could most folks really tell you, or care?).Overall, I'd recommend the movie for some light entertainment, but don't take it too seriously.",The Three Musketeers
26,jjnxn-1,Harmless and action packed,8,15 March 2012,"Lightheaded and lighthearted this is the definition of escapist entertainment and that is meant as a compliment. Something to watch when you want to relax and not have to think about the plot of the movie. Chris O'Donnell is impish if a bit callow in the lead but the real show is musketeers anyway and there is where the movie excels. Keifer is suitably brooding as Athos and Charlie Sheen, before he became a surly twitchy mess, is a charming Aramis. The standout however is Oliver Platt going full on ham as Porthos giving a delightfully over the top performance and walking off with the picture whenever he is on screen. Rebecca De Mornay also seems to be having a good time enacting the villainous Milady de Winter, she's sexy and silky. Lastly there is Tim Curry positively consuming the scenery as Cardinal Richelieu, in his flowing red robes he and Oliver Platt are in a dead heat for biggest scene stealer. The production is high class with vibrant with color and beautiful settings, true it bears only a passing kinship with the source book but it is a fun time with lots of action and a carefree mood.",The Three Musketeers

28,petra_ste,The tracks of Dumas' tears,4,4 July 2007,"When it comes to movie adaptations, I am not a purist. More than often the plot of a book HAS to be changed significantly (cutting minor characters, subplots...) to translate well on screen. But there are times when this revisionist attitude goes too far, and this version of The Three Musketeers is one of them. The classic novel by Dumas père is a fairly straightforward action/adventure tale, so it's surprising they felt the need to dumb it down by ruining the character of Richelieu, radically altering the story and adding an abominable final act - which features scenes such as Richelieu shooting Aramis with a hidden gun and ludicrous boss battles.Sutherland is not a bad choice as Athos, and could have been acceptable in a serious adaptation. Sheen and Platt, two capable performers, are miscast - or better, their characters have been rewritten to suit them. O'Donnell simply lacks the charisma and fire required by the part.It's not entirely Curry's fault (albeit his Monty Python-ish performance is an embarrassment), but Richelieu is the movie's worst blunder: the Cardinal in the book is an intriguing, textured character, not a ghoul-like, sneering ubervillain. Other players (De Mornay, Wincott, Delpy) are better, although saddled with pathetic material.Watch the 1948 adaptation instead (the one with Gene Kelly, Lana Turner and Vincent Price): a better movie, closer to the book and with MUCH BETTER sword duels.4/10",The Three Musketeers
29,DukeEman,Oh what fun we had...,6,21 January 2002,"An enjoyable romp with the Musketeers as you cheer for the good guys and hiss for the baddies. What stood out was that each of the three Musketeers were emotional characters in their own right. Sheen's Aramis had God on his side. Sutherland's Athos had a broken heart. Platt's Porthos was a dirty lying bag of fun. And O'Donnell had an Eighties hair style that made him the Golden Boy. As for Tim Curry, he was delicious as the evil Cardinal Richelieu who hammed it up for you to enjoy.",The Three Musketeers
30,artzau,**SPOILER AHEAD*** This film STINKS!!!,2,26 January 2003,"Alexandre Dumas, Pere, was not one of the great writers of French Literature but he did write a series of rousing adventures, Les Trois Mousquitiers among them.  Most of us know this wonderful tale of male bonding and intrigue from the many translations of this series and, for those who don't like to read, from the many films which have appeared.  The role of D'Artagnan, the young farmer's boy from Gascony, who comes to town to join the King's Musketeers has been brought to the screen by the likes of Douglas Fairbanks, Gene Kelly and Michael York.  This role and story makes for lots of cinematic fun and the lead role is a great one for a scene-chewing ham. But, with Chris O'Donell, we don't get ham, we get bad baloney.  The truth is, this film, like the gharish DeCaprio sequel which appeared a year or so later, Man in the Iron Mask, is a made-for-high-school-kids, costume teen flick.  That, I guess, is forgivable but this version is a bad one.  Tim Curry, of Rocky Horror fame is a grinning parody of the insidious Richelieu and the supporting fellows of the wannabe musketeer, O'Donnell, Sutherland, Platt and Sheen-- while competent actors in their own rights-- seem to stumble through their roles making the entire film, a caricature of this wonderful classic tale.If you love costume drama and the classic tales of adventure, you'll no doubt be very disappointed with this piece of celluloid manure.  If, on the other hand, you're a teener with a love for loud music, catchy & defiant phrases and pure nonsensical action that has neither historical connection nor relevance to life in general, then you'll likely find this film worthy of the price of a Blockbuster rental.Alas, the bitter truth, with the array of talent such as Curry, Platt, Sheen and Sutherland, this could have been a decent film.  Having seen all of the classic remakes of this film, including all of the offshoots that I could find, I found this mindless, poorly written abuse of a great story to be the worst.  Yes, worse even than the Jackie Chan rip-off, Musketeer, that followed a year or so back.",The Three Musketeers
31,Java_Joe,Fun if a little thin.,6,15 June 2019,"The Three Musketeers by Alexandre Dumas is a swashbuckling story of adventure, excitement and really wild things. The Disney version? It's a decent flick about four guys called Musketeers that are the King's personal guard and seek to right a wrong that's been done. With the exception of the names of the main characters and certain scenes it's nothing like the book. But that's not really a problem in my eyes because it's still a fun, albeit flawed, movie.Like all adaptations certain liberties are taken with the source material to reduce a novel to movie length. Changes are made, scenes are created for it and the general plot remains the same. And so long as the movie entertains this is normally not much of a problem.The basic plot is young D'artagnan travels to Paris to become one of the Musketeers who are the personal guard of the king. Along the way he meets three men that he insults in one way or another and all three challenge him to a duel. He shows up to fight his first battle only to find all three men that he insulted are there waiting for him. They argue and bicker over who goes first and how rude it is that first one will wind up killing the young hothead. But when D'artagnan discovers that these three men are some of the fabled musketeers he immediately apologizes and asks to join their ranks. Unfortunately the garrison has been decomissioned and the musketeers are no more. Cue the intrigue and them trying to get the musketeers reinstated.Most of the main characters are portrayed as they are in the book. Porthos is the larger than life bon vivant, Aramis is the pious and quiet one, Athos likes to drink and D'artangan is bound by duty and honor but he can be brash and hotheaded at times. And on the other side is Cardinal Richelieu who in the book was scheming and underhanded but is portrayed as just plain old evil. But as I said, exceptions sometimes need to be made and Tim Curry delivers a great performance in the role.It's not a great movie but it is very entertaining. However, the book is much better.",The Three Musketeers
32,hokeybutt,"Well, What Do You Expect From Disney Anyway?",4,2 August 2004,"THE THREE MUSKETEERS (2 outta 5 stars)Well, about the best I can say for this movie is that I didn't hate it. But is certainly one of the lesser adaptations of the Dumas classic. Sort of like the ""Young Guns"" of swashbucklers. Disney figured it might be box office gold to have musketeers played by the likes of Charlie Sheen, Kiefer Sutherland and Chris O'Donnell... but I think by the time this movie came out their film careers were already on the downside. The story is condensed to almost nothing... nothing but the basic bare bones of the plot remains... however there is lots and lots of action (lackluster, dull, unexciting action but... activity at any rate). There is even time for making out with tavern wenches (while on an extremely urgent mission). Tim Curry as Richilieu may have seemed like a good idea... but this cartoon version of the character doesn't really give him anything to sink his teeth in. Oliver Platt as Porthos comes off best... but his constant witticisms start to go stale after awhile. The softening of the character of Milady (Rebecca DeMornay) makes her treatment at the hands of Athos and the musketeers seem more callous than just. The swordplay in this movie is very tepid... even downright awful at times. (Was there no budget money to give Sheen at least a lesson or two?)",The Three Musketeers
33,shanfloyd,Made to fit in the family movie category.,6,8 March 2005,"This is a quite safe, undetailed and conventionally entertaining adaptation of the Musketeers' story directed somewhat towards young audiences. It excludes all types of mature, controversial and hard-to-interpret elements of the novel and if one claims it to be the worst film adaptation of the novel for that reason, it is in a way true. But I see it this way, it is a very pleasant experience to watch the film because it never got boring or incomprehensible. It may be called a good family movie to watch in a tired mind.The cast is not bad. Keifer Sutherland, whom I consider as one of the most underrated actor of our time, is a good Athos. Charlie Sheen as Aramis is also fine. But Chris O'Donnell as D'Artagnan ? That was perhaps a poor choice. And I don't know, Oliver Platt is just not good enough to be Porthos. That character had more gravity.",The Three Musketeers
34,badajoz-1,OK and passes the time,5,10 January 2013,"Yes, there are liberties taken with the plot lines - the worst being Cardinal Richelieu thinking he could be King. But heyho Alan Rickman as Sheriff of Nottingham in Kev's 'Robin Hood' was trying it on the same, and had less chance than the Grey Eminence. Hollywood does take terrible liberties with European classics, just like Abe Lincoln, Vampire Slayer!!! The film is cheeky in tone, with plenty of swordfighting, derring do and love betrayed, but it does not quite shirk the state terror of executing Milady! The end is dragged out rather but the acting is pretty good and the storyline lollops along nicely. It is trying to emulate Dick Lester's version but comes up short against a really fine film that gets the balance of staying true to the book and getting plenty of laughs - remember Charlton Heston as Richelieu talking to Raquel Welch's husband played by Spike Milligan!!!!!!!!!! - Priceless. Enjoyable romp if you don't mind the changes to storyline and Tim Curry's overacting.",The Three Musketeers

As to adults... it has a monster who dies a very grisly death, a couple of dangerous stunts, a massive explosion of gunpowder and some kissing.If you've seen a music video with Mr Sting and the two other guys, you have seen it all. Anyhow, you can easily do something else while this movie is on. No general nagging, no dramatic drawbacks, but the impression of the film can be described as ""Whassup?"" or ""So what?"". Personally was bored in the very beginning of this ""epic"" already. A Chinese-looking bad guy with the good old martial arts ability is looking stupid here. Besides, I remember that the novel itself, I mean the book, is quite thick, and it just cannot be crippled down to one even three-hour movie.If you still are hesitating if it is worth watching, then check this out.Some youngster is bumping into a few characters. Cut. Some big bad boy in red is smiling. Cut. Some infant-looking king tries to give orders and act like a man. Cut. A scene with fighting. Cut. A scene with some sexy-looking lady who lures a boy. Cut. Some monster of a man is attacking a good character. Cut. A good guy pretends to be a priest or something. Cut. A bad guy is talking bad trash from the bottom of his bad heart. Cut. A falling lamp. Cut. A falling bad guy. Cut. A good guy is shot to death. Or is he? Cut. Cut. Cut I don't give a damn who dies in this one. The king and the musketeers suck anyway.To me this movie is like this (sorry if I violated the chronological succession of these monumental pieces). This charade of the characters you don't care about can help you to kill time. It passes all by in a blur and you ask yourself ""Wassup?"" If you never read the novel or saw our great production (and you know that you never will) - give it a try. Maybe, it will pass for a good comedy/action/adventure. It has at least 5% of ""Indiana Jones: the Temple of Death"" brilliance after all.I would strongly suggest any cinema connoisseur to stick to our version of ""The Three Musketeers"". It's a classic and is already considered to be a ""cult production"" (damn, I still remember how I suffered when Konstantsia (Constance) died and how impressive the scene of Miledi's (Lady Sabine DeWinter) execution was). As to this ""The Three Musketeers"", it is 5 out of 10 (who knows: if I had not seen our version of this novel, I would have probably fallen for this heartless eye-candy) - the mark goes mostly for the camera-work, costumes, and stunts.

I grew up absolutely loving this film to virtually no end. No other version compares to it.We all know the story: The treacherous Cardinal Richelieu (Tim Currey) plots to overthrow the king of France by disbanding his guard, the musketeers, and forming an alliance with the Duke of Bukingham. With the the help of the one-eyed Captain Rochefort (Michael Wincott) and the deadly Countess DeWinter (Rebecca De Mornay), it seems that the Cardinal is unstoppable. Luckily, the three musketeers stand in his way. With the help of the young and cocky D'Artagnan (Chris O'Donnell), Athos (Kiefer Sutherland), Porthos (Oliver Platt), and Aramis (Charles Sheen) shall cut down evil and save all of France.This movie has all the charm, action, drama, and comedy mixed with an all-star cast. The villains are delightfully despicable the way they play around with the thoughts and actions of all the clueless people around them. The musketeers are truly unique: Athos having the tendency to be serious, Porthos being the comical ladies man with all kinds of crazy weapons, and Aramis as a mild mannered priest. D'Artagnan is a bit stubborn to a fault, but he's still pretty good.Definitely superior to every other movie adaptation. Check out this wonderful adventure.",The Three Musketeers

The humour and action fit together perfectly, and it features some very outstanding scene-stealing performances; especially from Tim Curry (natch!) and Oliver Platt.<Spoiler Warning>IMHO, Chris O'Donnell plays a young dashing hero very well in this (my fav movie of his); and Platt, Charlie Sheen and Keifer Sutherland play the classic sword-masters with a great mix of dash and humour.  Keifer's dramatic undercurrent to the frivolity going on around him works very well, and helps this from becoming too schmaltzy.

40,DeuceWild_77,"Lighthearted version of the Dumas' classic with a good cast, especially Oliver Platt & Michael Wincott who steal the movie with inspiring performances.",7,18 September 2018,"Produced by Walt Disney Studios and loosely based on the Alexandre Dumas père epic 'cloak and sword' romance novel, ""The Three Musketeers"" is a lighthearted action / adventure flick plenty of humor with a good cast of (then) young stars, some of them coming from previous collaborations such as ""Young Guns"" or ""Flatliners"".Director Stephen Herek (""Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure""; ""The Mighty Ducks"") and the screenwriter David Loughery (""Dreamscape""; ""Star Trek V: The Final Frontier"") gave it a modern twist to some of the dialogue and situations and the result is a fresh take on an all time classic, a 'popcorn flick' that entertains without insulting the audience.The characters are colorful enough; the humor works; the pace is frantic and the action sequences are mostly, well done, the movie never gets boring and the cast delivers appropriate performances, from the over the top cheesy villain of ""Mr. Rocky Horror Picture Show"", Tim Curry as the malevolent Cardinal Richelieu to the more serious in tone, but way effective, Rebecca De Mornay as Milady de Winter.Chris O'Donnell & Gabrielle Anwar, fresh from their breakthrough roles alongside Al Pacino in Martin Brest's ""Scent of a Woman"", play respectively D'Artagnan and Queen Anne of Austria, with Hugh O'Connor (the young Christy Brown in ""My Left Foot"") as her husband, King Louis XIII of France.
O'Donnell displays well on-screen the reckless Gascon who dreams to be an honored Musketeer like his late father.Charlie Sheen and Kiefer Sutherland, together again after ""Young Guns"", play the (not so) religious Aramis and the regretful Athos, with Oliver Platt stealing all the Three Musketeers' scenes as the flamboyant 'bon-vivant', Porthos.
Sheen got the top billing due to his star status back in '93, but his character is the emptiest in story arc and the Musketeer with less screentime (and less memorable, too).Michael Wincott, forever the 'baddie' (""Robin Hood - Prince of Thieves""; ""The Crow""; ""1492 - Conquest of Paradise"") is once again, excellent portraying an evil character as Captain Rochefort.Julie Delpy's role as Constance is too small for even get some consideration and Paul McGann in the dual role of the D'Artagnan's fellow Gascon with a feud, Girard and one of the Cardinal's guards, De Jussac plays both differently as if it were not the same actor.In short, if a viewer wants to watch a more sober, closer to the book and much longer adaptation of this all time classic, should check the Salkind's produced epics of the 70's directed by Richard Lester and starred by Michael York as D'Artagnan; Oliver Reed as Athos; Richard Chamberlain as Aramis; Faye Dunaway as Milady De Winter and Charlton Heston as the Cardinal, if not, and just want to spend less than 2 hours of pure escapism, this version is the one to get.Fans of movies such as ""Young Guns"", ""The Rocketeer"", ""The Mummy"" or ""The Mask of Zorro"" will appreciate this unpretentious, but entertaining flick.",The Three Musketeers
41,no-skyline,It's not a bad movie its just average in so many ways,5,11 May 2007,"Disneys interpretation of the Three Musketeers was always going to be a watered down version which is fine in a swasbuckling family film but did it have to be so bland? The main problem for this it has to be said is the casting of O'Donnel as D'Artaignion he doesn't have the screen presence to pull it off.The other problem is that the story has already been done fantastically in Richard Lester's Musketeer films comparing the Musketeers across films it shows just how good the 70's cast were. Sheen is no match for Chamberlains Aramis and how can anyone compare to Oliver Reed as Athos? Certainly Sutherland doesn't here. The films main successful cast member is the always excellent Oliver Platt who steals every scene he's in and is the only truly memorable feature of the movie.Of the bad guys Curry is by turns brilliant in one scene and hopelessly over the top in another, Michael Wincott is menacing as Rochfort but again comparing it with the 70's version not as good as Christopher Lee.This isn't a bad film , it's average and why make an average movie of a story thats been done brilliantly before by a far superior cast? Rather than seeing this check out the Richard Lester version which is a family film that both kids and adults will enjoy leave the Disney version for now.Average - not bad, but not good either 5/10",The Three Musketeers

I found myself pulled right in to this world and enjoyed every moment of it, imagining myself as a Musketeer fighting evil! There really is some great content to be found, with a very good mix of contrasting highs and lows.One thing that kind of hit me was that while the film is called The Three Musketeers, it's not really about them, in my opinion. It's more about how D'Artagnan and how he... well, spoilers. I recently saw some of the latest superhero and space battle blockbusters (you know who you are) and I'll say The Three Musketeers was a far more memorable and enjoyable experience.Some of my favorite scenes are where the camera is up close on a couple characters as they interact.

But still a fun time. The actors is what makes this movie. The cast does a great job. The three muskuteers are charming and likable and each character stands out but everyone gets room to shine. And their young protégé D'artangnan (the protagonist of the movie) is so naiv it's like sheer stupidity, but it's suppose to be bravery. The villains are also hilarious and great. And the women beautiful and charming. It's a classic Hollywood 90s adventure. The cast even manage to squees out real griping emotions when it's time for drama. Even how ridicules the nonsense plot is, or how the only thing it takes from the book is the names of the characters, it's a fun ride!So, I really enjoyed my experience with this movie that is probably long forgotten by most people today. Kind of weird feeling also to remember watching this as a kid and finding it really exciting and a bit frightening, and today see that it's almost a movie for children, I guess that's why I liked it so much as a child. But what's feelt even weirder then that, is the knowledge of that the actors, that today have made very different careers and are famous for many other things but this movie, where younger shooting this then I am today.

Alexandre Dumas' classic story of brave musketeers is an outstanding story of courage, friendship and love.Although the plot might seem to be completely flat it is yet very enjoyable.

All Dumas' great characters has found fitting actors for portrayal.""Three Musketeers"" has been filmed several times and it has been fitted to an animation features but no other adaptation has made my heart so keen to the subject like Herek's 1993 version. Now fourteen years later after watching musketeers hundreds of times it still remains one of my favorite stories, and I cannot valuate its givens by rating the film. Even in nowadays I remember every line by heart. ""Three Musketeers"" is timeless piece of fiction and foundation of a great childhood. I recommend it to everyone in a family from seven years up. ""Three Musketeers"" represents what was then great adventure movie like ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" is now.The theme song ""All For Love"" performed by Bryan Adams, Sting and Rod Stewart remains one of the most influential songs in my records. Bryan Adams had had a collaboration earlier with now late composer Michael Kamen in ""Robin Hood: The Prince of Thieves"" with records braking song ""(Everything I Do) I Do It For You"") and Adams was asked to do a song for also ""Three Musketeers"". It may not have been as big hit as Everything I Do... but it sure is as beautiful.Raise your swords and step in to the boots of the brave bodyguard's of the king of France!

I believe it could have had  a slightly more serious tone to the story, and maybe should've been a little bit more dramatic. There were to many scenes where it goes from serious to comedy. I couldn't tell if the Producer was trying to get into a serious sub-plot with Countess DeWinter(played by Rebecca DeMornay)and her Ex-Lover Athos(played by Kiefer Sutherland)and after the movie takes a turn toward a more serious story line when Countess DeWinter commits suicide, and then the story goes back to being a comedy again. But the action scenes are fun to watch and the costumes are done well. However the 1998 film ""Man in the Iron Mask"" will blow this film away.This one as fun as it is to watch, it just doesn't take itself serious enough. Ironicaly I belive this was the best acting that Kiefer Sutherland ever did, He played his role perfect, there is a scene where the 3 musketeers are in a brothel and D'tagnan (played by Chris O'dennell) approaches Keifer's charactor who is drinking alone because he is remembering his past heartaches, you can almost see the years of heartach in his eyes, and hear the echos of his regreted past in his voice in that scene. Kiefer gave his best ever performace as an actor in this movie.Kiefer plays the role of Athos with seriousness,drama, and believebility.Unfortunatly, Kiefer's briliant performace is surrounded by often comical scenes which makes Kiefer's briliant acting seem out of place in this film. This is just a film to watch only for fun with the kids. I give it 4 out of 5 stars.(it gets a 5 on the fun factor)",The Three Musketeers
46,r-fronimides,"To me, its much better than the 1973's version.",8,12 September 2020,"So, I re-watched both versions; the 1973 and this one.I thought I remember the 1973 was the best, since the great costumes, the landscapes, the music, the SUPER casting, etc. Well... I didn't remember the super-POOR directing, though! The 1973 is a PARODY/COMEDY, not a drama/adventure. I didn't enjoyed at all - as action/adventure, but I ...laugh in many scenes.Now... this one, here.
I think is better. It has also good casting (okay... not THAT AMAZING as in 1973's version), but they are fine actors too. But... at least here, you watching SERIOUS sword-fighting! Yes, there is comedian element too here, as there is in Alexander Duma's original novel. But, damn, its an ADVENTURE, its a DRAMA novel, I want to see that on the screen.And this movie here it does that.
So, to me, this is MUCH BETTER version of the story, much better than 1973's.",The Three Musketeers
47,KingProjector93,Exactly what it says on the tin,6,30 December 2014,"Athos (Keifer Sutherland), Porthos (Oliver Platt), Aramis (Charlie Sheen) and D'Artagnan (Chris O'Donnel) team up to battle the nefarious schemes of Cardinal Richelieu (Tim Curry) to usurp power in 17th century France. Now told under the name of Walt Disney Productions, and from the director of Bill & Ted and The Mighty Ducks, Stephen Herek.Although it may not the most accurate or layered adaptation of Dumas' tale, Disney's 90s version still offers a decent swashbuckler. This is down to a charismatic cast, special points towards the great Michael Wincott and his icy voice as the deadly Rochefort, alongside a wonderfully charming Platt as the bon-vivant Porthos, who provides the brunt of the comedy in the film with his hands-off lifestyle. Throw in some nifty and uncluttered sword fights shot with patience and grace instead of clumsy shaky cam, and even a playful yet also thrilling score by the late Michael Kamen, and these go a way to help out.However, don't expect a lot of the intricacies, extensive development and politics of the original story, or the self awareness of the more renowned Richard Lester films of the 70s. This as basic and lean a 'Musketeers' telling as you'll find anywhere. Plus, being a 90s Disney live-action film, it's super safe and predictable, even for a story as often told as this one. You can tell who's good, who's bad and what happens next right from the word go, thanks to often hammy performances from the support cast, as well as rather basic, rote dialogue.Regardless, as far as its brethren of that era go, this is one of the company's better live-action efforts amidst a slew of lame remakes and comedian star vehicles. If you may not be in the mood of the wilder hijinks of 'Pirates' or 'National Treasure', this should fit the bill just fine.",The Three Musketeers
48,Pythe,"I admit it, I love this movie",10,27 March 2009,"All right, let's get down to brass tacks here. What does the 1993 adaptation have in common with the source novel? Practically nothing. (What else did you expect from a Disney film?) The characters' names are the same, the character traits remain to a lesser degree. And...well, that's about it.Now, I love the novel. As a relatively sophisticated reader/movie goer, I know I should really take the movie to task for removing pretty much all of the depth and color of Dumas's story and interpreting everything in basically the most cartoonish and two-dimensional manner possible. I really should.But...I just can't let this movie go. It's a rollicking, fast-paced swashbuckler with a decidedly old-fashioned feel. The use of vibrant color, the grand and elaborate sets, the simple yet energetic action sequences; I'm reminded of a sweeping adventure film MGM might have made in the forties or fifties.The cast is particularly strong, and all the actors seem to be having a ball in their roles. Kiefer Sutherland is perfect for the brooding Athos; Charlie Sheen is wry as the pious Aramis; and Oliver Platt chews the scenery as the arrogant, eccentric Porthos. Chris O'Donnell, as the ambitious D'Artagnan, interjects himself quite ably into the group dynamic, and the four leads develop great chemistry with one another throughout the film. Tim Curry and Michael Wincott soar to great heights in their cartoonish villainy, and Rebecca De Mornay is alluring and tragic as Lady DeWinter.Michael Kamen's score is romantic and bombastic and triumphant--perfect for the tone of the film. Heck, I even like the Rod Stewart/Bryan Adams/Sting collaboration, ""All For Love,"" that plays over the credits--clearly calculated to help the soundtracks sell copies, but dammit, I still believe in their sincerity! (Well, maybe sincerity is too strong a word.) The Three Musketeers, inaccurate an adaptation though it may be, is still a fast-paced, lighthearted thrill ride like you just don't see too often anymore. I hate wrapping these reviews up, so I'm just going to stop here. Bye.",The Three Musketeers
49,schmimic,"En Guarde! A Disney tale of heroism, if you're into that sort of thing.",9,24 May 2005,"Starring: Charlie Sheen, Kiefer Sutherland, Chris O'Donnell, Oliver Platt, Tim Curry Anybody remember a more civilized time when people fought with swords instead of guns? Well, more accurately, swords and guns, but mainly swords? This movie attempts to recapture that, a time back in France when to be a musketeer in the service of the king was one of the greatest honours you could possibly have.D'artagnan (O'Donnell) is a young man who has dreamed his whole life of becoming a musketeer, just like his father before him. He is on his way to Paris to join the musketeers, only to get there and find out that they have just been disbanded. He gets this information from Athos (Sutherland) when he stops by musketeer headquarters, and he manages to get himself penciled in for a duel at twelve o'clock with Athos. Later in the day he meets Porthos (Platt), offends him as well, and gets a duel scheduled for one o'clock. Shortly after that, he encounters Aramis (Sheen) and arranges a duel with him too, for two o'clock. Sounds like a busy day. Too bad he didn't know ahead of time that these three men were the last musketeers.When D'artagnan gets ready to have his first duel, the Cardinal's guards show up to interrupt the party and arrest the musketeers. D'artagnan fights with the musketeers, then they ride off, leaving him alone. It's about then that a few more of the Cardinal's guards show up, along with Captain Rochefort. D'artagnan is arrested and taken to the dungeons below the castle. He then escapes and eavesdrops on a conversation between the Cardinal (Curry) and the Countess D'Winter. In this conversation he learns about the Cardinal's secret plans to make an alliance with the Duke of Buckingham in an effort to overthrow the king and take the throne for himself. D'artagnan is caught eavesdropping and brought before the Cardinal, and then the order is given for him to be beheaded.Our three friends who were scheduled to duel with D'artagnan and seemed to have just disappeared show up to help D'artagnan out of his little jam. He tells them about the Cardinal's plans, they get the heck out of there, and go to find the spy that is heading over to the Duke of Buckingham in order to find out in more detail what the Cardinal's plans are.So, I think that's enough of the general gist of the story. It's a Disney movie, so it comes complete with a happy ending, but I won't give it all away. It's amusing enough, and I'd deem it worth watching.Bottom Line: 3.5 out of 4 (definitely worth watching)",The Three Musketeers
50,jimmylee-1,"Yet Another, Three's A Charmer",5,20 July 2006,"I really didn't think it could get any better than the 1973 version of the Three Musketeers. And I was right - but this one isn't bad (although re the former, I wish the film quality was a little better and Faye Dunaway wasn't quite so over the top). Maybe a purist would be a bit offended, but I found the chemistry, the clowning, and the come-as-you-are attitudes of Oliver Platt, Charlie Sheen and Kiefer Sutherland great fun. They didn't take the movie too seriously, so neither did I. Chris O'Donnell did a basic job as a country yahoo come to the big city, and tagged along with the other three quite well, which is, after all, what D'Artagnon was supposed to do.With the man who is apparently the hardest working chap in show business, Tim Curry (is there anything he hasn't done?) playing the evil Cardinal with slight panache (didn't overdo it, which could have been so easy), and Rebecca De Mornay playing what I thought was one of her best roles ever as the Lady deWinter, the overall cast wasn't too bad.The stunts and sword fights also weren't bad; contemporary realism was much better in the 1973 movie but this one was much more lighthearted and that's a fine thing. There are shifts from Dumas in character attitudes, in keeping with that lightheartedness; again, purists may be offended but I found them in keeping with the overall tone of the movie (which, after all, is a Disney flick).I found the song rather an abrupt change to the soundtrack - ""all for one and one for love"" put me in mind of a fast food jingle - but that's just my taste (puns, I just walk into them).OK, maybe it's not going to last forever as a classic, but it has some fine lines to pass the time, and it's got Porthos the Pirate in it. What more does a fun movie need?",The Three Musketeers
51,chucknorrisrules,Part of the exclusive and very special club of films that I want to watch from the start again as soon as the end credits have rolled.,10,30 March 2009,"I am aware that there is a book of The Three Musketeers, but I haven't read it, so it doesn't matter...what matters is the film itself.Now, as I have made absolutely clear in the summary above, there are a few movies that are so good that I feel like re-watching them as soon as the credits role. And as I have made clear blahdeblahdeblah...this is one.The atmosphere is mad and more fun than a barrel of chimpanzees on LSD. The underground dungeons with flaming torches and people sticking their arms through the sardine-like grids and the eeeeeeeeeeevil villains who are shown as ruthless from the word go, are textbook cheese, and just what is needed in this film.Straight away, we are thrown into the action, with some very pleasant surprises. Chris O Donnell as the hotheaded D'Artagnian, Keifer Sutherland as the (fairly) straight-headed Athos, Oliver Platt as the bonkers but ingenious Porthos (with tricks up his sleeve that come out of nowhere such as a triple-bladed dagger), Charlie Sheen as the religious Aramis, the beautiful Julie Delpy as lady-in-waiting constance, Tim Curry and Michael Wincott as the classic bad guy double-act (with evil villain and secondary baddie with eyepatch), even Paul McGann in a hilarious double-role, sometimes playing a leader in the Cardinal's guard, but mostly playing a wuss who has it in the neck about his sister's 'honour' with D'Artagnian (and was clearly never breastfed by his mother). Not to mention the hilarious mullet that Hugh O Connor sports as the king of France!The entire film consists of swinging thin swords about, jumping onto moving carts and up and down walls while swinging said swords, meeting beautiful women, and with an exciting climax at the end. If you've read the book, good for you. I hope you enjoyed it. But if you're devoted to it, then avoid any contact with this film. It's action all out romp where the brain does not have to work hard, but just sits back, relaxes, and escapes. If you want deep 'real-life' and 'gritty' stuff, then forget it. This film has none of that. Good vs bad, simple as that.I'll be honest, I deeply loathe, despise and detest Disney Fairy stories (though animations such as Toy Story and The Lion King get a thumbs-up from me). Having said that though, the mouse house do a damn fine line up in feel-good action romps such as this one and Pirates of the Caribbean, and if you disagree then dive head first into a hospital surgery bin.",The Three Musketeers
52,greenforest56,very uneven,6,25 September 2005,"This was an uneven picture. The sets and costumes were excellent, the cinematography and directing good. The cast was uneven. Ironically, the good and bad casting cut right down the middle: all the bad guys were good actors  all the good guys bad.Tim Curry as Cardinal Richelieu was excellent: sleazy, slimy and elegant. Budding actors take note: one challenge an actor has is when his line is a single word. Study Curry's single line: ""Three?"".Michael Wincott entirely complements Curry as Richelieu's evil 'hit man'. His gravely voice lends credence to his heartlessness.Rebecca de Mornay gives a good performance of a good girl gone bad.Now to the good guys, our Musketeers. Keifer Sutherland? His casting must be some kind of incestuous Hollywood affirmative action. How else can you explain his non-talent presence? Chris O'Donnell? A pretty faced non-talent.Oliver Platt? Barely adequate. Too portly and unathletic for an action hero.Charlie Sheen looks quite handsome with long hair and a goatee. He gives his usual performance, neither good nor bad, merely competent. Unfortunately, his religious fervor is not quite believable.There is some script failure here. The 'wronged sister' gang, apparently inserted for comic relief, is entirely unnecessary, as the Musketeers are comic enough themselves. Nor is the gang particularly amusing.The tragic love affair involving the de Mornay character was quite touching in Dumas' original, unfortunately the film makers dropped the ball here. My guess is they substituted action for story development and this fell by the wayside. Of course, casting the King as a good guy, or any French king, is laughable. Especially amusing for the idealistic values he espouses. All the kings of France got a good laugh at that little speech.Which leads to the 3rd failure: too much action, i.e. way too many casualties, more than necessary. The sword fighting, except the last scene, was not exceptional. The film makers should have viewed a few Errol Flynn movies first: better fighting, fewer deaths.What saves this film is the power of Dumas' original story (this is the 4th movie version), the excellent acting of the villains, and the attention to detail, authenticity, costuming and sets.",The Three Musketeers
53,negeati,an adaptation for kids,3,1 January 2000,"I consider this movie the worst adaptation of the Alexandre Dumas' novel. Most of the performers are miscast. The only one who does an OK job was Kiefer Sutherland as Athos. Charlie Sheen, as Aramis and Hugh O'Connor as Louis XIII are useless. Julie Delpy (one of the greatest French actresses) is used only to show Chris O'Donnell gets the girl. She is on the screen for five minutes. Oliver Platt was supposed to be fatter for this role and Rebecca De Mornay scarier. Remember her in ""The Hand That Rocks The Cradle? The second biggest problem is the villain. Tim Curry is not frightening at all. He is definitely no Glenn Close (I made this comparison because she appears as Cruella DeVil in another Stephen Herek movie).
But let's dissect the plot. The biggest problem of the movie. The Cardinal will become king after the king is assassinated? If I did not know any French history, maybe I would believe it. But since I know some, the idea is laughable. If the king of France does not have any male heirs (girls were always excluded) the crown goes to the younger brother. The Cardinal had absolutely no chance of getting the crown if he was not related to the king, and he was not. And anyway that's not what happens in the book. The script is a very bad adaptation. 3/10.",The Three Musketeers
54,TheDuke-2,Not up to par,4,19 August 1999,"This movie was not cast correctly.  The cast from ""The Man in the Iron Mask"" should have been in this movie.

If you want the best, stick with the 70's version with Michael York and Oliver Reed.",The Three Musketeers
55,goey312,Goey Rating: NFF (Nice Family Film),6,19 July 2005,"An entertaining swashbuckling movie. This movie really doesn't supply any surprises, there are not any unbelievable twists or turns. The actors did do a good job and the scenery was nice but the movie never really stands out as anything spectacular in any way.This movie revolves around three odd ball musketeers who are the only three whom have refused to turn in their swords upon the order from a government that has abolished the position of musketeer. Then joined by a new recruit the four of them must survive as outcasts in a society trying to kill them and still they try to protect the king. In the end obviously they all work together and magic happens just as it does in all of these types of films. There is one thing to be remember from this movie though, i'm not sure that this is the first movie to use it or not but it definitely needs to be quoted.

56,Torch-6,"That high-pitched whine you hear, is Dumas spinning in his grave.",1,5 June 2000,"A truly miserable interpretation, both of Dumas' classic tale, and of French history.  Depicting Richelieu as a womanizing lecher, lusting to paw Queen Anne, making his plans from his personal gondola while cruising the flaming canals under 17-century Paris borders on high camp at best.Tim Curry was an inspired choice for Richelieu; but rather than the malicious dignity to be expected from the statesman who arguably saved France's bacon from the lassitudes of the crown, he's a scheming lecher, thinking only with his glands.The script's attempt to modernize the story turns Rochefort the assassin into Darth Vader, and D'Artagnan into a less-than-competent Luke Skywalker (who does of course succeed in offing the bad guy).For all the money put into this film, I truly expected something better than joke portrayed.",The Three Musketeers
57,ophelia_1969,These musketeers are tastier than the chocolate bar!,10,11 October 2000,"In my opinion, there has not been a better adaptation of the Dumas classic than this. It is not only the closest to the book, but it is also the wittiest. The casting in itself was genius. With Oliver Platt (Lake Placid, Dr. Dolittle) playing the wise cracking Porthos the pirate to perfection, Charlie Sheen (Spin City, The Chase) playing the god fearing Aramis with ease, Chris O'Donnell (Batman forever, Batman and Robin) playing the youngest musketeer D'Artagnan with a subtle charm and arrogance, and Kiefer Sutherland playing the brooding, melancholy musketeer leader Athos with undying depression, you can't miss. I highly recommend this film to anyone who remembers playing swashbucklers or cops and robbers as a child. Not only does this version have the best looking musketeer, but it also has the most magnetic person as the villian, Tim Curry (Congo, Rocky Horror Picture Show). Although most rememebred for his untouchable role as Dr. Frank N. Futter in Rocky Horror, Curry captures Cardinal Richelieu with such perfection, it's hard to remember he is only acting. I found myself so enthralled my this movie, I was actually yelling at the acreen. Rooting for the good guys and booing the bad guys, it truly a great film!I GIVE THIS FILM: * * * * (4 stars)",The Three Musketeers
58,AlrightGuy,This movie is an insult to Alexandre Dumas (spoilers),3,22 December 2006,"This movie is so bad on so many levels. From the first scene, when D'Artagnan duels with an annoyingly shrill caricature (he didn't deserve to be called a character). His opponent is a blatant walking gay joke and is completely inappropriate for what pretends to be a family picture. Also out of place in a family picture were some of the violent images and the generous cleavage shots. Obviously the movie veers from the novel, but it veers so far that the book becomes source material in name only. Aramis is no longer the pious gentleman of Dumas' novel, but instead he is...well, Charlie Sheen with a Bible and cross. The plot is almost completely thrown out and the exact opposite of virtually everything in the book happens. Worst of all, Milady DeWinter is transformed from one of the most evil creatures ever into a sympathetic character who is not really bad and only dies because she chooses to sacrifice herself. The script, if it can even be called a script, is hopelessly corny. It feels like they were trying to do the kind of movie they ended up making with Pirates of the Caribbean but failed miserably. The screenwriter hacks it up, showing no knowledge of ballistics (for the last time, cannonballs DO NOT EXPLODE!), anatomy (a wound to the gut may be fatal, but it will not kill a man within a few seconds), or military procedures (the King's guards would be going into war with the King, not disbanding!), and certainly no knowledge of the Dumas novel. Some things were kept, those things being the three-way duel and the fact that Athos used to be married to Milady. That's pretty much it. Really. That's it. I know we can't expect a page for page adaptation, but this was just awful. Oliver Platt's performance as Porthos was the one good thing, and even then I think it was more Platt being himself than playing the character.",The Three Musketeers
59,pcernea-1,An Unintentionally Funny Butchering of the Immortal Classic!,3,3 March 2010,"This purported ""family film""-ized Disney Version of The Three Musketeers looks like it was written by Alexandre Dumbass. Many reviews defend this version by saying that it is a family film. In fact it is probably less tame than the novel. For instance, Cardinal Richelieu is always (hilariously) looking down the shirt of every woman he comes into contact with, including Queen Anne of Austria. At one point, he actually tries to grab the breasts (!!!) of Milady deWinter, but she stops him with a dagger. No mention is made of D'Artagnan's adultery with Constance Bonacieux; however, towards the beginning, priest Aramis is about to commit adultery with a bombshell whom he is coaching in theology!!! There's plenty of death (albeit without blood) and even a bit of torture. So you see, this isn't really a family film, so why not stay true to the original plot? Perhaps, if the intention is to lower the IQs of movie-going families, the filmmakers have succeeded.That's not to say that the movie has no saving graces, which is why I gave it a 3, not a zero. There are actually plenty of witty lines, but that's all this movie has going for it, besides the inadvertent humor. Most of the funny lines revolve around sex, like when Milady tells Richelieu, ""I don't think you're burdened by chastity.""Now let's talk about funny things that make this movie so bad. D'Artagnan's name is laughably pronounced in an American accent, ""Dartanian"". Chris O'Donnell interprets the role of D'Artagnan as an imbecile. He lands himself in prison for confronting a bunch of the Cardinal's guards alone, and then he threatens his captor (""Captain"" Rochefort) during interrogation. It's a miracle he didn't get killed right then and there. D'Artagnan is supposed to be boorish but smart, not a numbskull. Much of O'Donnell's acting is absolutely wooden!The Cardinal has this goofy goatee that makes him look ridiculous when he smiles. His plan is to make a secret alliance with the Duke of Buckingham who is going to invade France, and then make himself KING OF France!!! Why this complete reversal of the plot into something completely unrealistic and stupid? Anyway, I could go on and on. I think even as a kid I thought this movie was stupid. Any kid could benefit more from seeing the Richard Lester version or, better yet, reading the book! To sum it up, this movie would probably make Dumas roll around in his grave.",The Three Musketeers

I did not watch much more but threw the disc into the trash can. Richelieu may have been indifferent to the suffering of poor folks but he was a statesman, not a monster.

It's pure entertainment. Great costumes, lavishing scenarios and good story.Besides that there are some decent efforts to keep the 17th century feel, always with a modern touch. That was cool and Porthos was a very good example of that.Michael Kamen's music is also another remarkable point and adds a lot of emotion to the movie. It also respects the period of the story.The movie has some good values to pass to young audiences. It deals with friendship, honor, courage, ""all for one, one for all"", injustice and righteousness.This was the version I grew up with alongside ""The Man in the Iron Mask"" (1998) and the 1987 anime version which is also a very good retelling of the classic.All in all, I love this movie even with it's historical inconsistencies.

The humor is great and when it goes serious and dark, it's right on the mark. You really feel for Athos and Milady. The scene where she dies is heartbreaking even after several viewings.I grew up with the Richard Lester version,which is also great. But Charleton Heston's Richelieu is so dull, especially when compared to Tim Curry's scenery chewing performance.I love Michael Wincott, so seeing him as the evil Rochefort is just perfect.This might be the best film Chris O'Dowell has ever done, he's cute and charming as D'Artagnan.",The Three Musketeers

Everything's simple. Why's the villain being a jerk? He's evil and greedy. Why's the hero being heroic? For honor and a dead dad. Why do only some character's have accents? Don't worry about it. How does D'Artagnan commit 1st degree murder without remorse? Psychopath.

She went there to assassinate him!  This whole movie is a crock. The producers couldn't leave anything intact.  After the fight with the Cardinal's guards, the four men went away delighted with having beatin the guards, they didn't run off and leave D'Artagnan like that.  And what is with the gay little charactor fighting D'Artagnan at the beginning?  That's not at all how he left for Paris.  His father, Rochefort never killed him, gave him his sword, some money, and a letter for the Captain of the Musketeers.  D'Artagnan met Rochefort on the road and fought with him on his way to Paris, that's why D'Artagnan really hated Rochefort.  I could go one all night like this, but instead, I'll give the readers one piece of advice. Stay away from this movie as you would a rabid dog, rent the 1974 version with Michael York, Richard Chamberlain, Oliver Reed, and Charlton Heston, it's ten times better, follows the book to perfection, and is hilariously funny at the same time.  Don't even waste 50 cents to rent this flop.  Only watch this version if Mystery Science Theatre 2000 decides to bash it!",The Three Musketeers

72,apuluvmanjula,Why I don't like this film...,4,11 October 2001,"Contains Spoilers If you want a decent family film that is kind of a rip off of ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"" then this film is just right for you.  Okay, maybe this rather mediocre film is NOT a rip off of ""RH: PofT"", but when I saw it for the first time in the theatres when I was 11 I sure did think so.It doesn't exactly help that Chris O'Donnell is in this film.  He is my candidate for one of the worst actors in Hollywood.  Not *THE* worst actor in Hollywood, but certainly on the bottom of that very short list.  I don't know why, but he seems to play the same character over and over again.  I really don't like him at all.  There hasn't been a single film he was in that I liked!  And since he was pretty much the main character of this film rather than the Three Musketeers themselves (which REALLY annoyed me) that really ruined the whole film for me.The story was vaguely characterized and I began to wonder the point of each character.  (Caution:  spoilers ahead.  Do not read if you haven't seen this film!)  Why did Rebecca DeMorney kill herself?  Just what the heck was the significance of Chris O'Donnell wanting to avenge his father's death?  Was it absolutely necessary to make him a ""Sex symbol"" and a very dashing, young, naive man??  I think the character would have been a bit more appealing if he were a strong character who wasn't a glorified child!  And it would have been nice to see some of the heroes more often!  It seemed to me that the Three Musketeers were glorified ""sidekicks"" to D'Argtanian (excuse the spelling).Overall, this is a decent family film that will be enjoyable if you don't pay too much attention.  And if you like Chris O'Donnell for any reason, then go rent this film.  You may actually like it!",The Three Musketeers
73,LadyOfGlencairn,The best version of the famous Dumas classic!,10,8 August 2002,"There are many that would argue that this movie was not that great, and in my mind perhaps I know thats true.  But despite its flaws, I found it to be thoroughly enjoyable and the characters charming!I thought that both Charlie Sheen and Oliver Platt did the humour in the characters justice and they are definitely well worth watching in this film. Chris O'Donnell gave us one of his better and more enjoyable performances, looking hot as always! :)  Keifer Sutherland...I loved!  This role worked so well for him.  Another thing...Hugh O'Conor, I had never even heard of him before this movie, and I just loved him.  He and Gabriella Anwar had a surprising chemistry that was nice to see.For anyone that loves the classics, this is a must see.  This is one of those movies I never tire of!",The Three Musketeers

Let's see what remains of the book, the title, the names of the characters, and that's about it.Now I have no problem with Hollywood setting a morality play in Louis XIII's court, far from it. But I do object to the plundering and complete destruction of a literary classic in order to create it. They've bowdlerized Dumas. What they've done is the equivalent of turning James Bond into a teetotaler who abhors violence and respects women for their personality.Just stick to the 1970s version starring Michael York as D'Artagnan, or if you can find it the early silent French serialization.",The Three Musketeers

78,Call_7,Pityfull!,2,12 November 2006,"I watch this ""version"" of the Three Musketeers, only last month, because I was rather reluctant to see one more of it: 1 - Because a movie from a French book, made in the US, requires utmost caution. 2 - Because I read the book at least 10 times between the age of 12 and the age of 50, each time with a renewed and even increased pleasure. I was right, I should have skip it. Sure we can read ""it is not a true adaptation of the book, it is for fun, etc,..."", but!!! The book is entertaining, fun, rich in humor, adventures, action, sweet moments!!!. Why should anybody re-write a perfect scenario, to make a grotesque story, with story, with ridiculous characters, who, thanks God, for the sake of France, were so opposite in the real History. I take only one example of what I say: a physical fight between the King of France, and Richelieu, on a small boat, ending in the fall of Richelieu in the water. I do not at all object on making funny movies about historical personages, showing them ridiculous, etc,.. but this movie refers to a book with a perfect story. OK give it another title; respect the author!!",The Three Musketeers

This movie has everything; action, romance, swordplay, gunfights, exciting heros', and a facinating villain. The actors are top-of-the-line, the swordplay is realistic and convincing, the settings are wonderful, and the script is hilarious. The only thing I think they could have done better is the part of D'Artanian. I mean, they gave that great character to Chris O'Donnell!!!! WHAT WERE THEY THINKING???? That part deserved a MUCH better actor. Chris ruins everything he plays, this being no exception. All in all, I give it 8* out of 10*.",The Three Musketeers

If 16 year old me hadn't paid my hard earned $3.50 (wouldn't it be nice if that were still the price of movie tickets?) I would have walked out of the theater.I think that some time before this came out there must have been a law passed that stated that if you are going to make The Three Musketeers into a movie that you are not allowed to make it resemble the book in any way.If your whole concept of The Three Musketeers comes from this little farce than you really know nothing about this great story. The Three Musketeers is an exceptional piece of historical fiction filled with political intrigue, great heroes and sinister villains. What it doesn't have is an overabundance of slapstick jokes, ""Porthos the Pirate,"" a wimpy Lady DeWinter, the nauseating overuse of the line ""all for one and one for all"" (they say it exactly one time in the book) or D'Artagnan being played by Chris O'Donnell.

83,skmaven,"Prequel to ""At Sword's Point""",7,10 September 2010,"Carping about the lack of fidelity of Disney's The Three Musketeers to Dumas' book or to history misses the point. It's not *our* history. It is (implicitly) set in a parallel world, possibly - no, probably - the same one in which the delightfully silly sword-romp At Sword's Point (1952 ) is set. And this too is a delightfully silly sword-romp, not to be taken seriously in the least.Almost every time the story is revisited, the character of Athos gets another softening. In the book he murdered (or attempted to murder) his wife out-of-hand, without waiting for her to regain consciousness and try to explain (what an SOB!), and still hates even her memory. The relationship never comes up in Fairbanks Sr's The Three Musketeers, and is barely hinted at in a reaction-shot in The Iron Mask - which still manages to make clear that there's some real bad history there. By the 1948 version, he ""merely"" repudiated her - and never ceased to love her. In the 1993 version he believed her guilty of murder and turned her over to her enemies, and grieved for her ever after.I don't have a favorite version of The Three Musketeers - each and every one I have seen is flawed, usually in different ways. But this one makes a nice casual treat, particularly on a double bill followed by At Sword's Point.",The Three Musketeers
84,gigem-aggies,Great Movie!,8,18 March 2002,"I've read a lot of people's reviews on this film and have been really shocked that some people don't like this movie.  So what if it doesn't follow exactly to the book?  It was refreshing to see a different plot twist.  This movie has been done to death and never so terribly as last year's 'The Musketeer'.  This version, however, stays true to exactly what Alexandre Dumas books grab you with...great action scenes, romance, swashbuckling, humor, deception, heros and comedy.  I would have to say that Oliver Platt as Porthos was my favorite character in the movie, although Michael Wincott made a great Rochefort.  All in all, this is a great film. It doesn't stick exactly to the book, but who cares?  Disney definitely did Dumas' classic novel justice with their rendition.",The Three Musketeers
85,Maryah,Just a series of cliches,5,27 March 2002,"This movie has two things going for it.  For one, it has Kiefer Sutherland in it (though he's stuck with really lame dialogue).  And secondly, the horse work in the movie is excellent--I especially like that little Spanish horse that D'Artagnan rides in the beginning.  Aside from that, it's just a bunch of Hollywood cliches in sequence. It has a tacked-together feel, as if they had a bunch of scenes they wanted to include, but didn't really know how to integrate them into a seamless whole. In some scenes, the Musketeers are light-heartedly slaughtering people, as if it's just a day's bit of fun, and other scenes are more serious and dramatic, but they don't work because the characters aren't adequately developed and don't seem very realistic. So basically the movie just didn't work for me.  5/10",The Three Musketeers

This movie set off a discussion between my wife and myself about the value of movies that use the titles of well known novels. She says that, if the movie inspires people to read the novel, that's good. I say that too many people will see this movie and think they don't have to read the novel.No movie can do justice to the Three Musketeers because it is too long and has too many subplots. The people who made this movie said, ""So what?"" The actor who plays D'Artagnan was quoted on a pre-release interview as saying that he was not aware that The Three Musketeers was a novel. He thought it was a candy bar. That attitude pervades this movie. Let's have Milady de Winter take a header off a castle and have Cardinal Richelieu steal away poling his own boat.It's a light-hearted devil-may-care movie that is technically well made.

Let's just say that although Chris O'Donnell's hair could have been more historically correct, it made him look really hot! All of the actors in this film gave excellent performances (O'Donnell, Charlie Sheen, Oliver Platt, Kiefer Sutherland, Rebecca de Mornay, Tim Curry and the guy who played Rochefort, I don't know his name).A lot of people have been saying that this movie is an insult to Dumas' novel and stuff like that. I disagree, as all they have done is made it easier for children to understand the complex book. After all, it is a Disney movie.

89,closeharlan-1,Steaming Pile,1,11 February 2006,"How many times does one have to endure the phrase ""All for one and one for all"" in this piece of mindless Disney drivel? A lot, it seems. far too often for my taste as the phrse becomes a sound bite rather than a declaration of loyalty. Performances worth checking out are by Michael Wincott, and by Tim Currey, who chews screen time with a desperation that doesn't seem necessary given Curry's genuine acting talent. Otherwise this is a total waste of time. In both cases I couldn't help remembering that Tim Currey and Michael Wincott were not Charleton Heston and Christopher Lee. Charlie Sheen, Kiefer Sutherland, and Chris O'Donnel are never convincing as 18th-Century Frenchmen and come across only as 20th-Century actors from the New World. Oliver Platt is amusing but in the end is also unable to make the audience suspend disbelief. The script is insipid and juvenile at best and is an insult to stupid people. I came out of the movie feeling cheated and talked down to. This movie lacks the grandeur and the wonder that a good period piece adventure must have.For a better handling of this material, check out the Richard Lester films ""The Three Musketeers"" and ""The Four Musketeers"" both of which star Michael York and are much closer to the original Dumas.This version is awful; don't waste your time.",The Three Musketeers

Potential camp classic, however. In one instance of Ed Wood-ity, Val Kilmer is about three stories up on a balcony addressing the Musketeers gathered on the ground below. The Musketeers are yelling and cursing and they sound a mile away, and Kilmer replies in a slithery whisper that the Muskies three stories down hear clear as day, even over their own outcries. So bad it must be laughed at. I usually don't blame an actor for a poor performance, but there is no excuse for Chris O'donnell.",The Three Musketeers

There are plenty of laughs, and enough drama to keep everyone invested in the movie until the credits roll. It is a lot of fun to watch, even with all the minor and funny mistakes. It shares almost nothing with the book, other than the names of the characters. You will not be one bit sorry to spend the time watching this movie -- it will let you forget your stressful life for a while, and have a little fun. Kids love it!!!

And I can understand those angry people who say it has nothing in common with the classic novel or some even say this film disgraces it. I can understand them but I don't agree with them.First of all I'd like to say that I've been a dire-hard fan of the classic novel since my childhood (now I'm 28). Especially I loved D'Artagnan an Atos. And I loved Milady!!! Yes I really loved her! She was such a bitchy girl! (I'd like to watch her playing by young Sharon Stone, but maybe it's too much!). So the guys were the heroes of my childhood and I 've always realized all the brilliance of the novel and its characters!So when I watched this film for the first time (approx. in 1995-96) I was so angry with it! ""How could they spoil such a beautiful story!"", I exclaimed. But with years I became much more patient with this film and began to realize that it's quite good but on its own. You see, so many times filmmakers tried to screen The Three Musketeers. Some did better some did worse. In Russia we have our own version of the novel which is made in style of a musical (and have always been of a great popularity here). But the Disney version is something new. Something that has never been done before. Yes there're a lot of clichés there. There're constant discrepancies with the novel. There're talks and actions that could never happen in those times. But there is a lot of fun in this film! And it's not an absurd fun like in Hot Shots or Men In Tights. It's a warm and light-hearted fun for children and adults. It's, as we say in Russia, AN OLD STORY IN A NEW WAY. And it surely has a right to live.And finally I'd like to say that only those who really understand and adore The Three Musketeers by A.

96,adrenalinejunkiegurl,Worse Version of The Three Musketeers,1,2 July 2011,"I got one word for this movie: Stupid! Just flat out, plain stupid!Overall, this was a very entertaining and it had the moments, but I have to say it was one of the worst versions of The Three Musketeers ever and I hope this latest version of The Three Musketeers is better. The plot in this movie did not follow the original plot and there was not enough dialogue between some very important characters from the book. Yes, this movie is meant for entertaining the kids and family, and I will admit there were a couple of times where I laughed at it, but that was mostly because of how stupid and inaccurate the screen writer made the movie.The whole plot is where the Cardinal, who is portrayed as an evil, merciless man, dismisses the musketeers as the king's bodyguards so the musketeers wouldn't be in the way of his evil plan to become king and in comes D'Artagnan who is just itching to be a musketeer like his father finds out about the Cardinal's plot so he and the three musketeers have to go and stop the evil plot. D'Artagnan is a naive and hot-headed little boy and perhaps a bit stupid; Athos is a brave drunk; Aramis is a humble, religious man yet a seducer(?); and Porthos is an arrogant womanizer and a pirate?!?!?! Where exactly did the pirate come from? When D'Artagnan found out Porthos was a pirate, he was actually AMAZED by it! Amazed by it? If D'Artagnan ever first found this out in the first place, he would not even step a foot near Porthos again! Did Disney even know back then that if you were found out to be a pirate or associating yourself with a pirate, you would be hanged?!?!?!?!?! Obviously not! They just think that everything they do in this movie is possible, even with a pirate being able to be a musketeer, not to mention a religious man such as Aramis being a seducer!And where exactly did the ninja come from? This takes place in the 17th century in France, so how exactly does the ninja fit in this movie? If this was a ninja or samurai version of The Three Musketeers, then maybe I would find the ninja believable, but since this is NOT a ninja or samurai version of The Three Musketeers, then I would have to say that Disney did a pretty poor job at creating this movie!The movie was entertaining, but just stupid.

Very ordinary, but the humor in the picture is really good and makes the movie better, it has a little sarcastic tone in it- which i enjoyed a lot.

However, I love this film and will watch it again and again if given the option. The always brilliant Oliver Platt is hilarious as the wittiest Musketeer, Porthos while Charlie Sheen's deadpan one-liners are equally as funny. Tim Curry as the inevitable English-accented villain drips venom and steals every scene he's in. What's important to remember about this film is that it is fun and entertaining.

The cast was absolute perfection. The weakest character was the boy king and he was supposed to be weak, I guess he nailed his part. The film itself was done extremely well with great scenic value and the story was wonderful. This is one of my top 10 movies of all time. No collection would be complete without this trophy. It is one of the very very rare movies you can watch over and over and always enjoy it. Possibly finding new ways to enjoy the wonderful humor and fun.

Yes, nobody has a French accent, for the story to be set in France, and the story may have been romanticized; yet the cast works so well together. This is especially true of the title characters: Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, portrayed by Keifer Sutherland, Oliver Platt, and Charlie Sheen (respectively). Chris O'Donnell is seen in one of his few acceptable roles, and Tim Curry does what he does best: portray a powerful, slimy, and altogether evil Cardinal who (surprise, surprise) wants to rule the land and, take candy (the Queen) from little kids (the King, who I never cared for personally). There is an almost damning amount of the Deus Ex Machina that makes the plot somewhat forgettable. Overall, the cast saves this movie if nothing else does. the title characters are charming, funny, and play a great part in another coming-of-age story. May I also mention ""All For Love"" is one of the greatest collaborations ever produced, what can you expect except greatness from Rod Stewart, Bryan Adams, and Sting?",The Three Musketeers

The harsh character who hates everyone and then has a stand-off against the enemy allowing the others to escape and think he's dead and then miraculously come back! Me and my bro were cackling as we pointed out this and similar stuff. Tim curry is funny as heck too. it seemed like he was thinking ""I'm stuck with this, so why not have fun?"" and makes the main baddie, Cardinal Richelou the biggest perv the world has ever known. This guy comes on to everyone in the movie who vaguely resembles a female, that includes the young king, who looks a woman disguised as a man disguised as Micheal Jackson. The dialog isn't anywhere near the correct time period and while the minor characters at least have accents (though often not necessarily french as they should be) the three musketeers remain pretty darn American. So if you enjoy movies that are side-splittingly bad, filled with cheesy lines and even cheesier enemy death, this is the film for you!! Otherwise, keep your sanity and stay away!",The Three Musketeers
105,mtpaintball,"you've seen the movie, now read the story",6,26 August 2005,"simply put, It's a ""fun"" movie. But if you care about the history then this isn't for you. But perhaps is entertaining enough to inspire a 1993 Disney viewer into reading about the true story.definitely not a current Disney release with essence of the films i had while growing up, ie ""flight of the navigator."" It's good humored, some really good lines actually. Not necessarily factural but still entertaining.I still prefer watching this over ""the musketeer"" jet lee meets french swordsmanship... grrrrthe comments about Chris O'Donnells acting is correct but may just be from simplistic diolog that does not follow any linguistic styles of the time. But expected from a Disney production. Tim Curry does a fantastic job actually, simplicit still but he does his job at holding together the piece as well as the comedy from Oliver Platt, very enjoyable. But once again, if anything let this entertain and inspire you to adventure into the story of the three musketeers",The Three Musketeers
106,randymonte,Fine Movie - All for One!,8,20 January 2006,"As a big fan of the Dumas novel, I have to say that the plot of this movie is not identical to the book, but a fine movie in its own right.Each time I watch it, I notice something else that is good. Each of the Musketeers play their parts well, giving unique personalities to each character. I was especially impressed with Tim Curry's leering, conniving depiction of the Cardinal Richelieu. His facial expressions and bearing give a great personification of a powerful, evil leader. I also loved the casting of Gabrielle Anwar as Queen Anne. During one conversation scene, the camera suddenly switches from another character to her, making a portrait-type picture. I caught myself thinking ""Wow, she really is pretty!"" Overall, the scenery, costumes, casting and script were excellent. It is a good movie to use for familiarity with the Musketeers and to gain a sense of great camaraderie.",The Three Musketeers
107,christof-4,Terrible stupid plot with an incredible historical fault,1,19 January 2001,"The plot of this movie is so ridiculous and stupid and has nothing to do with the original book, one could easily fill an average sized book with complaints about it! Details have already been mentioned a lot of times in earlier reviews so I only want to add one more nail to the coffin:In real life Cardinal Richelieu was a very important person in european history and lived on for a long time after the death of King Louis. He even de facto reigned France during the childhood days of the next King, the world famous King Louis the 14th. How could the ignorant scriptwriter dare to let him die at the end of this crappy s**t and change world history! It´s the same as if Indiana Jones would have killed Hitler at the end of ""The last crusade""!",The Three Musketeers

109,Henriette,Filming on location,10,4 August 2005,"I love this movie for its humor and tempo and of course because of the nice actors, but what I discovered last vacation made my day. We visited Vienna, Austria and we, my husband, my son Erik and me went to see an underground lake close to Vienna in a town called Hinterbruehl and they told us that this movie was filmed there and I saw the boat used by Cardinal Richelieu(Tim Curry) There are also still prison scenes where the musketeers run through following Richelieu to be seen. Very cool.... It used to be an plaster mine that when it closed was used in the 2nd WW for building airplanes. They still have to drain a lot of water everyday to keep it a touristic attraction. You get a tour in a boat and the water is very clear and cold, but very beautiful.",The Three Musketeers

111,annathebookworm,A fantastic addition to the halls of the best movies. Lighthearted and hilarious with a side dish of adventure.,10,6 June 2006,"The Three Musketeers is a fabulous addition to the halls of the best movies. It was lighthearted, fun, and done in a great imitation of a swaggering, swashbuckling adventure. From the romance, comedy, adventure, and fighting, it truly has been added to my list of favorites.It went from a duel between 'enemies' (Girard and D'Aariagnan) to a dripping chamber of horrors, and soared through carriage fights, hungry flames, drawn steel, a few romantic moments, and still had plenty of steam to finish in a commendable end with the young, bold D'Aariagnan becoming a Musketeer. The characters are ruddy with life and personality-- Mysterious, cloaked Athos; Former priest and articulate Aramis; Young D'Aariagnan, arrogant yet true; The hilarious, quick-tongued Porthos; The oily Cardinal with his malicious schemes; Girly Girard and his brothers; Constance, the Queen's lady in waiting; and finally, the intoxicating Countess de Winter. Truly, a fantastic tale.",The Three Musketeers
112,d_griffin,Don't watch this.,1,6 January 2007,"This movie has no relation with the classic book of Alexandre Dumas. It's just a fiction-action-comedy of Hollywood, and the title should be changed. It shows well known scenario in the form ""10 minutes action, woman, 10 minutes fight, beautiful woman"" etc. Of course, there's a joke on each 7 minutes. The actors are OK, except the king Luis XIV, who's just too young for this role. The story of the musketeers is about honor and friendship, and I didn't find such thing in the movie. Better watch the Russian version of the ""Three Musketeers"", it's at least close to the book. I regret that I lose my time to watch this movie.",The Three Musketeers
113,trimni,"Fun, but the title is misleading to say the least!",4,12 September 2007,"Had the film been entitled simply 'three musketeers', it would have been far more accurate, since exactly the title (and, to be fair, the names of the characters) are basically the only things this film has in common with the Dumas book. However, having seen quite a few of this sort of Disney 'adaptions' of stories I grew up with (H.C. Andersen and A.A. Milne to name my personal favorites - the original stories, not the Disney versions!), I was well prepared and thus I was quite able to enjoy this film for what it is: an hour+ of mindless pass time requiring less than no thinking on the viewers part. Which there is absolutely nothing wrong with; most of us need to shut down every now and then, but there is, to my mind, something wrong with capitalizing on classic titles, without even attempting to stay true to them! Shame on Disney! Again! I suggest that you forget about Dumas and enjoy a typical Hollywood-type fun ride - if you like that kind of ride :-)",The Three Musketeers
114,Cokkii,This NEVER gets old,8,12 September 2009,"I can't begin to tell you how many times I've seen this movie and I still love it.I was introduced to The Three Musketeers as a child and as I've gotten older I've been able to enjoy the movie, its plot, characters, action, and adventure, more and more. I agree that many one-liners can be taken from this movie and make any inside joke twice as enjoyable. My family endearingly nicknamed this movie ""Whoa, ugly.""Some parts I know can be a little too intense for the younger audience (i.e. drinking, wenching, murder/obvious killing, torture chamber, suicide, etc.) but can be enjoyed by all ages. The ""chicken"" voice of Girard and his constant quest for revenge on young D'Artagnan is a lite and playful element and add a very appreciated chain of humor. This is a movie very rarely shown on television but can be found in most chain movie renters.I highly recommend purchasing a copy of this movie for yourselves.",The Three Musketeers
115,annajedlickova,Kind of bad joke,1,1 February 2014,"This movie is either the most terrifying adaptation of all existing ones or averagely disappointing parody. If you've ever seen any older French Musketeers, prepare yourself for big surprise. If you know books, be prepare for nasty shock. Characters pictured in books can be related to those in movie only because of their names.Whole story is based on ""what if"" scenario. Writers unfortunately forgot, that they are to adapt fictional story already. Their interpretation might just work for real story. Of course it backfired in case of novel. This movie might be better, very good even, if they'd left main characters unchanged. It might have been some completely different adventure of well-known beloved literary characters. This might have been a hit.Creators was trying to tell a touching story about societal injustice in 17th-century France. Using famous novel and its characters, they completely failed. In their attempt to bring time and place nearer for aimed viewer, creators managed to destroy everything what might evoke 17th century period in the process, which is more unfortunate than anything I mentioned above. In short, this movie is in my country considered to be a joke. Bad one.",The Three Musketeers
116,moth57,There's french chivalry in it.,7,14 May 2010,"I saw it yesterday morning, in french and in France...Of course, if you've read Dumas, you won't find the book at all in this movie. Of course, if you are french, or if you know the french history, you should be horrified by this Richelieu. And I mean it, if King Louis was like this little boy, we would have killed our King many years before we did ! The worst thing is certainly the inside of the castle, or Richelieu who can see a naked Queen...Speaking of the Queen Anne d'Autriche, even french kids don't know that Anne from Austria is Spanish, that she married Louis for the peace between Spain and France (and not Austria and France). So that's an understandable mistake.But if you want to see a bit of the french chivalry, I think that is not so bad ! I liked the four musketeers, their humor, their panache. I found Dumas'thoughts (kind of) in the actors. And Austria's woods look like the french ones, Austria's old stones like ours too ! It was fun, and I just want to have fun with movies, so I'm pleased !",The Three Musketeers

119,brainpower-302-398622,Funny and Different,8,26 February 2012,"After seeing almost every version of The Three Musketeers i watched this version expecting to be bored to death. But how can a movie with Tim Curry and Charlie Sheen be boring ? This version was fun to watch from start to finish even though it had some bad choices ( Hugh' O'Connor, Chris O'Donnell) the storyline was OK and the acting brilliant. Athos , Porthos and Aramis were finally portrayed by good actors and Curry was a scheming bastard but funny at the same time.I still have to see a good D'Artagnan and this still wasn't it , O'Donnell came out and the least important character and his acting didn't help.All in all, a fun version and i hoped it would be the last but it looks like i was wrong. Too bad they didn't the Man in the Iron Mask with these actors, it would have been hilarious and we wouldn't have to see the DiCaprio version with some has beens Musketeers.",The Three Musketeers
120,sulka,Horrible Hollywood version of classic European story,2,14 August 2005,"Incredibly cheesy Hollywood production. The only thing in common with the real Three Musketeers is the names of the characters and maybe 5% of the plot. Not so hot action scenes which include an eastern two-sworded kung-fu guy fought in ruins, as if the castles were ruined when the movie's story is supposed to happen.Expect to not understand the story if you don't know the original and if you do, expect to be horribly disappointed at the low quality script adaptation.

122,tauranus,So soft but a hard time swallowing it,4,28 February 2013,"What's good? I guess the setup, dresses and production was OK. What's bad? Well, almost everything else. The melodrama, the deep emotions, the compelling story.. it's a bit like drinking old whiskey with coke. Gives you the hickup but doesn't satisfy your thirst. Unlike somebody else, who gave this piece of crap one star, I do give it four - for the reasons mentioned above. Cardinal Richelieu is perhaps the best character in the whole story, but the biggest failure here is that Disney had to chew it all down to little pretty pieces for kids to digest. I believe children can handle a bit more, but the Three Musketeers was never meant for children anyway. I think I will next try to find the best french version of this and hope it might live up to the original story better. So far the absolutely best movie version of this story has been the late 30's one with Gene Kelly. Check out how EFFORTLESSLY he jumps 4-5 meters during the duel scene around the pond.. but then he was physically far superior to O'Donnell, who is all buff but not really fast or explosive in any way whatsoever.",The Three Musketeers
123,lordebon,"Good movie, but much license taken",8,10 April 2005,"Personally, I consider this a rather good movie - the acting and story is much better than that of the remake ""The Musketeer."" Readers of Dumas's fantastic book will notice that this film has been made with a lot of artistic license taken on the book -- this is definitely NOT a film version of the book, but rather a film merely based on the book with the same general plot.Despire that, this is still a good film overall. I would highly recommend it to anyone, whether they have read the book or not. However, having read the book does allow one a greater appreciation of the movie, and the book is definitely a good read. 8/10.",The Three Musketeers

I therefore was expecting this film to be somewhat good, or at the very least to have a vaguely similar plot.Needless to say, I was mistaken.I can safely say that not a single event that took place in the movie happened in the book. The descriptions of characters, the battles, the style of uniform, the alliances, and (god help us) the love interests were almost all perversions of the original. I had to turn the movie off within five minutes of the first time I tried it!I understand that there is such a thing as creative license, but this has gone to the point of butchering. I tried to enjoy it, honestly I did, but it just hurt too much.",The Three Musketeers

In my opinion, the best three musketeer movie ever made!! The setting was incredible as well as the clothes design, exactly what you'd want THE three musketeers to look like! There is NO better cast on this planet then the ones they had, great combination with Charlie Sheen, Chris o'Donnell, Oliver Platt and Kiefer Sutherland!! they portray the characters perfect!! the three musketeers is a legend loved by many people and i think this movie has a real great way of bringing that to screen and really make you feel as though you're back in that time! My personal favorite is Aramis, and that's the fun part! you can relate to ONE of the musketeers as they're very different yet the same! That's why it's such an enjoyable movie. It's a classic and 20 years from now, people will still watch it AND enjoy it!! You will most definitely NOT be disappointed if you buy it on DVD or anything, rather make sure you have it so you'll be able to watch it 20 years from now ;-)!!",The Three Musketeers
126,henrylee-71252,One of the most fun adventure movies ever made,10,4 March 2021,"This movie takes all the cliches you'd expect from the genre and executes them perfectly in a way few other adventure movies do. Tim Curry delivers a voluptuous performance as Richelieu, Michael Wincott is a perfect villain as Rochefort. Each of the 3 musketeers and D'artagnan are fun, charming, and fitting to their roles.A brilliant score by Michael Kamen, one of the best, and fantastic sword fights by Bob Anderson. If you don't already know, Anderson did the sword fights for Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, The Princess Bride, Pirates of the Caribbean, and more. You really can't get a more fun and exciting movie than this.I'd place this movie up there with Robin Hood Prince of Thieves and Willow.I've loved this movie since I was very young and now in my 20s I still sing it's praises at every chance and watch it a couple times a year.",The Three Musketeers
127,pgleaton,"Very entertaining, though not quite true to the original story.",8,22 June 2019,"I thought that it was VERY entertaining, though not spot on in the area of sticking to the original story. All of the main characters are mostly entertaining, and there is just a hint of comedy. The main point that I liked was that Tim Curry was playing a particularly nasty Cardinal Richelieu. His performance reminds me s lot of the Sherriff of Nottingham in Kevin Kostner's version of Robin Hood. A HUGE attitude, along with total ruthlessness, and just a hint of humor. Perfect Tim Curry! I still love the tiny, school girl scream or D'Artatagnian's pursuer, especially after he's inducted into the Musketeers. To me, this is a light hearted version of the original story. No, it's not perfect. I don't think that it was meant to be. Most of the main actors, Sutherland and Sheen, were still in their 'Bad Boy' days during the filming of this movie. I'm not sure of the reasoning in the casting of this movie, but, for me, it worked perfectly. Yes, I do recommend this movie. Not because it is accurate, but just the basic reason that it is entertaining. I hope that you enjoy it.",The Three Musketeers

That's what the writer, director and actors envisioned. It's what they portrayed. The basic triumph of good over evil, of justice over self-serving malice. Escapism! And in that light, it's brilliantly done. Come on, it's not a literary masterpiece, nor was it intended to be. It's every child's vision of The Three Musketeers. No different than Burt Lancaster in The Crimson Pirtate. Just plain fun! Have you ever known any real heroes? The archetype is men or women who laugh in the face of danger, give all for those who are weaker and have an attitude of irreverence for all they encounter. They don't think of themselves as greater than others. They just know what their responsibilities are, and they execute them. Sheen, Platt, Sutherland, and O'Donnell all act this out in expert fashion.",The Three Musketeers

This is a really cool movie to watch on Friday nights with friends and family. Yes, it is a good family movie.Movies like this one have unforgettable characters. In fact, you'll probably find your self quoting lines from the movie ALL OF THE TIME.
