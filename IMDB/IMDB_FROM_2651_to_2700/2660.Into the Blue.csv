0,SnoopyStyle,Lost me in the second half,5,5 September 2014,"Jared (Paul Walker) and Sam (Jessica Alba) are a young couple trying to scrap up the money to hunt for treasures. Their friend Bryce (Scott Caan) arrives in Bahama with his new girl Amanda (Ashley Scott). The foursome does some diving and find some minor sunken treason. Then they come across a down plane loaded with cocaine. Jared and Sam don't want the drugs but Bryce and Amanda have other ideas. They decide to go back to map out and lay claim to the wreck suspected to be the legendary Zephyr. Only afterwards do they plan to report the drugs to the police. Bates (Josh Brolin) runs a competing professional salvage operation. He and his men are watching. Jared needs real money to hunt for the wreck. Bryce sees a way with the drugs in the downed plane.This starts out fine. It's a lot sun and a lot of beautiful bodies. About halfway through the movie, the escapist fun is all gone. It tries to turn into some tough gritty drug land thriller. It's too hard of a turn and throws me off the trail completely. The characters aren't likable enough to have rooting interest for. Scott Caan does such a good job as a douche that he infects the rest of the group. I didn't find any love for these characters and the fun is all drained out in the second half.",Into the Blue
1,claudio_carvalho,Predicable But Entertaining Adventure,6,17 June 2006,"In Caribbean Sea, the diver Jared (Paul Walker) and his girlfriend Sam (Jessica Alba) have a simple life, aiming at finding a treasure, but without money to buy the necessary ship and equipment. When Jared's friend, the egocentric and selfish young lawyer Bryce (Scott Caan), and his new girlfriend Amanda (Ashley Scott) arrive in the island to spend a couple of days with them, they dive together and accidentally find a wrecked airplane loaded with cocaine, and evidences of a sunken boat with a treasure. Afraid of losing the treasure for the arrogant hunter Bates (Josh Brolin), Bryce tries to convince Jared and Sam to negotiate a small part of the drug to raise the necessary money for the expedition, but the correct couple does not accept the proposal. Bryce and Amanda decide to deal themselves with a drug lord, jeopardizing the life and integrity of Jared and Sam.""Into the Blue"" is a predictable but also entertaining adventure. The underwater scenarios and the locations in the Caribbean Seas are stunning and worth the movie. Jessica Alba exposes her wonderful sexy body in a bikini and certainly is another attraction. Paul Walker also performs a good job. The plot begins warm, but has a very violent conclusion. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Mergulho Radical"" (""Radical Diving"")",Into the Blue
2,jboothmillard,Into the Blue,4,25 March 2010,"This is not a sequel, but it is certainly a follow-up from director John Stockwell (Crazy/Beautiful) to his own Blue Crush, with another water based film, filled with a couple of girls in bikinis, obviously a good hook. Basically, in the Caribbean Sea of the Bahamas, diver Jared Cole (Paul Walker) and his girlfriend Sam Nicholson (Razzie nominated Jessica Alba) decide to take a diving trip, with Jared's best friend Bryce Dunn (Scott Caan) and his new selfish New York girlfriend Amanda Collins (Ashley Scott). After spending a little time in their paradise, they come across some pieces of treasure on top of some sort of ship or something. But then even more interesting, a crashed plane on the sea bed, and inside a whole hoard of cargo bags containing cocaine, but they are not telling anyone else about this until they find enough of the treasure to make their fortune, and they are ignoring the drugs. Slowly, they realise that their are people looking to take their hundreds of cocaine bags, and Jared and Sam's lives are in danger as suspected of thieving. They are on a race against time to make sure the shipwreck is found, and the cocaine stash destroyed, along with the bad guys, before it's too late. Also starring Josh Brolin (James's son) as Bates, James Frain as Reyes, Dwayne Adway as Roy, Tyson Beckford as Primo, Gill Montie as Big Dave and Chris Taloa as Quinn. Just like the near predecessor, the ocean sequences are beautifully filmed, and there are some good moments of diving and jet skis, and seeing the two girls, well, Alba more so, in bikinis, makes good viewing, but this film doesn't stay consistent. It is interesting for the first forty to fifty minutes, but then it trails into a boring non exciting crime thing, so while it isn't all boring, it isn't as good as the film that came before. Okay!",Into the Blue
3,ma-cortes,"Suspenseful, thrilling and well-paced underwater adventure about a divers who locate a a shipwrecked treasure and drug",6,19 June 2008,"This is a suspenseful and engrossing movie with agreeable performances and good rendering of underwater action. It concerns about an innocent couple(Paul Waker, Jessica Alba) get involved in an underwater search for treasures in the island Bahamas. They descend deep into the big blue without the aid of any kind of breathing apparatus, though sometimes use scubas. The frogmen get excited when they accidentally discover what they believe is a vast sunken treasure. They along with a friends(Scott Cahan, Ashley Scott) find a shipwrecked galleon and a crashed plane plenty of dope . In the process they are threatened and then must to thwart the enemies. The team of divers faces danger when they attempt to retrieve goods from a pirate ship, as they spend time in shark-infested water and compete with treasure-seeker(Josh Brolin) and confront against nasty drug-lord(James Frain). The four divers set off on a perilous expedition in search of legendary treasure of pirate, resting in ocean floor and take back drug into the plane.The pace moves along nicely and production values are on the high scale. This is an amusing seagoing adventure in which the ocean deep figure prominently , though this time guarding sunken treasure. The action is plentiful with undersea excitement with terrifying underwater sequences. The film is spirited, lively and at times rather frightening light bemusing. Made mainly as vehicle for Jessica Alba and Paul Walker, and they show particularly in the technical excellence of the underwater scenes. They show off their considerable screen presence, both attractive and slender. Lightweight entertainment notable for sunny outdoors and underwater photography as well as Jessica Alba in a bathing suit, a glamorous bikini. Jessica Alba fans will ask no more than the sight of their idol in a swimsuit although Ashley Scott come across as the more likable of the two girls involved in this fast-moving sunken treasure yarn.Gorgeous cinematography manage to keep this afloat with fab footage maritime by cameraman Shane Hurbut and pulsating musical score by Paul Haslinger. The movie was spectacularly shot in Cayman Island and Nassau, New Providence , Island Bahamas. The motion picture is professionally directed by John Stockwell. He's a good actor with no much success(Christine, Radiactive dreams, My science project) and occasionally successful director(Turistas, Blue crush,Crazy/beautiful, Cheaters).",Into the Blue
4,BA_Harrison,Paul Walker and Jessica Alba get in deep trouble.,6,15 March 2009,"For a film set in deep water, Into the Blue is, for the most part, incredibly shallow stuff, being little more than an excuse to deliver some very impressive underwater photography whilst simultaneously showing off the stars' hot bods.The storya rather predictable adventure about a group of divers who discover a crashed plane full of cocaine on the ocean floor while searching for sunken treasuredefinitely comes second to the stunning visuals (and the even more stunning shots of Jessica Alba's fine ass) and it isn't until the film's closing moments that things eventually kick into gear to bring viewers the tense action promised in the DVD blurb. Fortunately, the exciting endinga surprisingly violent and bloody underwater battle between the divers, some nasty drug dealers, and a load of ravenous sharksis well handled and leaves the film on a high note.Paul Walker, as hunky, handsome hero Jared, is his usual bland self and the gorgeous Ms. Alba does little more than look fantastic in her itty-bitty bikini (but does she really need to do anything more?); full marks, however, go to Josh Brolin who steals the show as reprehensible drug-baron Bates, a nasty piece of work if ever there was one.",Into the Blue
5,michaelRokeefe,One man's treasure may belong to someone else.,5,10 January 2006,"INTO THE BLUE is beautifully photographed and most of the underwater scenes are astounding. Jared(Paul Walker)and Sam(Jessica Alba)are joined by old friend Bryce(Scott Caan)and his new squeeze Amanda(Ashley Scott)as they dive into the shark-infested waters of the Bahamas. Jared and Bryce have dreamed of discovering sunken treasure since they were boys. The foursome discovers a legendary pirate ship rumored to have gone to the bottom with millions in gold. The divers also find a sunken plane containing a cargo of cocaine worth a king's ransom that puts themselves in dutch with the drug lord wanting his illicit property.Walker proves to be a man's man in this well-paced adventure. And Miss Alba is a beat shy of cardiac arrest. Caan, son of veteran actor James Caan, is one of those method actors that can sometimes be a pain in the butt. Another actor's son is in the cast...Josh Brolin, son of James Brolin. The younger Brolin plays one of those cocky friends that turns out to be two-faced and devious. Miss Scott is attractive in her own way, but her talent seems one dimensional. Expect edge of your seat thrills and more than enough action to hold your attention.",Into the Blue
6,sunwarrior13,An Escapist Adventure,6,3 October 2012,"Greed turns an idyllic vacation into a nightmare in this movie entitled,Into the Blue.It is underwater action film starring Paul Walker and Jessica Alba together with Scott Caan,Ashley Scott,Josh Brolin,James Frain and Tyson Beckford. It was directed by John Stockwell. Jared Cole makes his living salvaging wreckage from ships off the coast of the Bahamas. He shares a rattle-trap trailer home with his girlfriend, Samantha ""Sam"" Nicholson, a shark expert who works at a nearby resort. While both are happy with their lives in the islands, Jared dreams of finding a major score and living the high life. One day, Jared and Sam are paid a visit by Bryce Dunn, a childhood friend of Sam's who is now doing very well as a lawyer. Bryce and his girlfriend, Amanda, have come to the Bahamas for a few days of diving and fun, and Sam and Jared show them the waters while making use of his yacht. While diving with Sam, Bryce, and Amanda, Jared discovers the wreckage of a plane used to smuggle drugs, and thinks he may have found the big score he's always dreamed of. While Sam persuades Jared that the cargo is too risky to move, Bryce and Amanda think there's a fast buck to be made, and team up with Primo, a local underground entrepreneur, to fence the contents of the plane. However, Bryce and Amanda have underestimated just how dangerous Primo and his henchmen can be, and now Sam and Jared must come to their rescue.This film is fun to watch because it's, well, fun to watch particularly when its stars dive into the blue in their various skimpy bathing suits but it's not much of movie. Stunning tropical scenery and gorgeous athletic movie stars may not make a movie great, but they sure don't hurt.There's anything wrong with an escapist adventure, but if you're rolling your eyes in disbelief at the plot and the dialogue, it makes it hard to enjoy the scenery.",Into the Blue
7,preppy-3,Boy was this STUPID!!!!,5,9 October 2005,"A bunch of divers (played by Paul Walker, Jessica Alba, Scott Caan and Ashley Scott) accidentally come upon a plane under water that contains heroin. They pledge not to say anything but--naturally--Caan and Scott stupidly tell the local drug lord what they found and things predictably go wrong.The plot is obvious and REAL stupid...they threw in some last minute ""twists"" that I saw coming a mile away. The script is pathetic chockful of campy dialogue and clumsy exposition. Also there were some ""male bonding"" scenes between Caan and Walker that are hysterically bad. But this movie was just made to show off the bodies of their stars.Walker is shirtless 90% of the movie--he is very handsome and muscular and, surprisingly, wasn't too bad. Caan looks pretty good too and enjoys himself. Alba looks great--attractive and a hot body. Too bad she can't act. Scott is pretty good too. Also the women are photographed MUCH more explicitly then the men. Caan and Walker are ALWAYS wearing baggy shorts when they dive--that's pretty stupid. They should be wearing Speedos for more freedom of movement. Meanwhile Alba and Scott wear the smallest bikinis possible. There's nothing wrong with that but it reached the point where I got the uncomfortable feeling that director John Stockwell was enjoying himself WAY too much photographing them. One shot of Scott unnecessarily photographs her lying down from the bottom of her feet so we can get a very clear view of....well you know! Then she's topless for no particular reason (we don't see anything). That aside the underwater photography is stunning as are the overhead shots.Basically though I was bored--the plot was insulting and I need more than endless shots of Alba and Scott practically nude to keep me entertained.The teenage boys in the audience seemed to like this--they're probably the best audience for this movie. Adults--stay away! I give it a 5--for the photography and Walker being shirtless so often.",Into the Blue
8,zardoz-13,"Wet ""Blue"" Dreams",6,19 June 2007,"Sexy Jessica Alba and hard-bodied Paul Walker swim gracefully through clear aqua-blue waters in ""Blue Crush"" director John Stockwell's new movie ""Into the Blue"" (**1/2 out of ****) with just enough on their sculpturesque physiques to maintain a PG-13 rating for this tame Sony Pictures release. Watching ""Into the Blue"" is like visiting a huge aquarium, because the filmmakers spend almost as much time beneath the 'blue' as above it. ""The Skulls"" cinematographer Shane Hurlbut provides stunning picture postcard photography of the cool, carefree Caribbean, while ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" underwater lenser Peter Zuccarini captures the pastel-colored ocean flora and fauna in the Bahamas as well as the Cayman Islands in all its scenic splendor. Essentially, ""Into the Blue"" qualifies as a quasi-remake of director Peter Yates' ""The Deep"" (1977) with Nick Nolte and Jacqueline Bisset, itself a rehash of director John Sturges' ""Underwater!"" (1955) with Jane Russell, Richard Egan, Jayne Mansfield, and Gilbert Roland. Over the years, other notable scuba-diving treasure hunting sagas have charted a course on the silver screen, among them Cornel Wilde's ""Shark's Treasure"" (1975) with Cornel Wilde, Samuel Fuller's ""Shark!"" (1969) with Burt Reynolds, and Enzo Castellari's ""The Shark Hunter"" (1984) with Franco Nero. Predictable as the tides themselves, ""Into the Blue"" springs few surprises and lacks the conflict required to keep audiences poised on the edge of their seats. Indeed, danger lurks everywhere in this slowly-paced but atmospheric adventure yarn, but nothing as gripping as ""The Deep"" with its nasty moray eel nor as exciting as the sharks in ""Shark's Treasure"" will make you gnaw your fingernails in dread anticipation In fact, the people who made ""Into the Blue"" do their level best to debunk the bad name that the Discovery Channel has been giving sharks. Moreover, unlike virtually every other actioneer, ""Into the Blue"" deals with events that could realistically occur, even when director Stockwell and ""Torque"" scenarist Matt Johnson take dramatic license to spice things up. Life in the Bahamas for Jared (Paul Walker of ""2 Fast 2 Furious"") and Sam (Jessica Alba of ""Sin City"") isn't exactly a breeze. They live in a crappy trailer and Jared bails water out of his half-sunken boat when he isn't supervising tourists about how to scuba dive . Jared is restless, but Sam keeps reminding him that they have all that they need of each other to be happy forever. Meanwhile, Jared wants to go his own way and be his own boss, rather than have to work for smarmy treasure hunter Bates (Josh Brolin of ""The Goonies"") who treats our hero with nothing but contempt. The plot thickens when Jared's shady friend, Bryce (Scott Caan of ""Ocean's Eleven"") turns up with his flavor-of-the-moment girlfriend Amanda (Alba's ""Dark Angel"" co-star Ashley Scott of ""Walking Tall"") and the keys to a former client's yacht and beach house. No sooner do our blemish-free protagonists don their scuba gear than they swim up onto a plane wreck on the ocean floor with 800 kilos of cocaine in the fuselage and a bunch of decomposing corpses. Jared and Sam want nothing to do with the illegal haul, but you can see Amanda's nose twitch at the prospect of all that blow and Bryce's eyes light up like a cash register. Bryce struggles to convince Jared that they can salvage the plane, sell the drugs, and use the profits to finance their ocean-floor excavation. The first complication that our heroes face after they discover the plane is the possibility that they may have found a sunken treasure ship from pirate days. If they inform the authorities as to the whereabouts of the cocaine, they fear that others will investigate the area and spot the sunken galleon. Things get progressively worse when the dastards who owned the coke show up and brandish their pistols.The biggest problem that ""Into the Blue"" suffers from is its soggy storytelling. After the usual half-hour set-up where our heroes and heroines discover the treasure, the action veers finally into its secondary plot, propelled more by the hijinks of second-string leads Scott Caan and Ashley Scott. This is about the time that director John Stockwell should have pumped up the adrenaline in the plot and cranked out greater suspense. The complications that take place about a hour into the story between Walker and Caan over the advisability of seizing the drugs from the wrecked plane recall director Sam Raimi's ""A Simple Plan,"" except that Walker and Caan have fewer qualms. Persuasive acting doesn't smooth out these ripples, but the plot gives these pretty people more than enough to do in the process. Caan appears miscast as a highly-paid New York crime lawyer. Meanwhile, Josh Brolin chews his mustache as a despicable villain who gets exactly what he deserves deep down in Davy Jones' locker. Eventually, those harmless sharks swim away and our protagonists find themselves menaced by vicious tiger sharks. That's about as unnerving as ""Into the Blue"" gets when certain characters aren't waving automatic pistols in the faces of our heroes and heroines. A brief car chase with the villains pursuing our heroes down narrow streets does little to enliven the proceedings. Trim-waisted Paul Walker and Alba click as an underdog young couple we come to like living on the edge of poverty in paradise, while we grow to dislike outsiders Caan and Scott as well as bad guy Josh Brolin. If you haven't taken a vacation to the Caribbean, ""Into the Blue"" delivers first-rate travelogue footage of several eye-popping locales. Guys that want to ogle Jessica Alba's curvy rump and gals that want to drool over Paul Walker's six-pack may find what little plot that spruces up ""Into the Blue"" an annoyance.",Into the Blue
9,neil-476,"Don't expect Shakespeare, but take your sunglasses",7,2 November 2005,"I put forward two words to describe this film - attractive and undemanding.It looks good - the scenery is pleasing, the leads are all very attractive, the underwater sequences are vivid and spectacular. And, if you put your brain on hold, the story marches along well enough - when it flags there are, at least, attractive things to look at.The idiot lawyer (Scott Caan) really irritated - I could forgive the plot much, but not for asking me to accept that this complete chump belonged to a profession which, like 'em or loathe 'em, does require its members to use their brains.And, having established the maverick nature of his girlfriend as well as her unknown provenance, I felt the plot could have made more use of her as opposed to her ultimately disposable function in the story.And the editor should be shot for letting the same extra wander through the airport checkout twice.But I wasn't expecting Shakespeare. Attractive, undemanding escapism - that's what I was demanding, that's what I got.",Into the Blue
10,anaconda-40658,Into the Gutter.,3,30 November 2015,"Into the Blue (2005): Dir: John Stockwell / Cast: Paul Walker, Jessica Alba, Scott Caan, Ashley Scott, Josh Brolin: Below average thriller about the temptation of danger. Simple plot regards the discovery of a sunken plane that contained a massive amount of cocaine and the danger surrounding the site as smugglers close in. Director John Stockwell wisely concentrates on the relationships and details the structure but the conclusion is unrealistic and action oriented. The big downside is that the characters are mainly cardboard props with little personality and exist mainly to narrowly escape getting their asses handed to them. Paul Walker is given the role of hero who will ultimately conquer because that is what we expect. Jessica Alba plays his girlfriend involved in the marine life. She gets kidnapped and plays damsel throughout most of the movie. Scott Caan plays an old friend who becomes greedy. He is the one who lands their asses in trouble because he is dumber than sh*t. Ashley Scott plays Caan's five day girlfriend who is more trouble than she's worth. She is also dumber than sh*t. We have a lot of stupid people in this film whose prime talent is making all the wrong decisions. Action fans will enjoy its impressive marine footage but story is thread bare and drowns in silly action and much nonsense that spirals the script into more than the blue. Score: 3 / 10",Into the Blue
11,gradyharp,The Beauty and Danger of the Deep,8,28 December 2005,"INTO THE BLUE surprises. Despite an opening sequence that is frightening and grisly, this film starts with the feeling that it is another pretty people at the beach flick - mindless, but visually attractive 'what I did last summer on the waves' story. But stay tuned: this is a film of visual splendor and tense intrigue and action that is up there with the best of them.Amidst some of the most spectacular underwater sea photography on record blooms a story of friends with polar priorities: Jared (Paul Walker) and Sam (Jessica Alba) live the simple life in the Bahamas, sport diving, looking for lost treasure ships as a hobby; visiting lawyer friend Bryce (Scott Caan) and his just-met current squeeze Amanda (Ashley Scott) have dubious pasts and are out for the quick buck no matter the dangers. This quartet spends the first part of the film diving and playing underwater with the glorious sea life until the unexpected discovery of a submerged airplane (recall the opening sequence) containing vast amounts of cocaine changes the playing board. Jared and Sam won't deal in drug trafficking while Bryce and Amanda are unable to resist. Once this strident mark is hit the movie becomes a fast paced intrigue of good vs evil, crime, police corruption, all mixed with chase sequences both on land and underwater. Tragedies occur, priorities alter and the polarities among friends are tested.Even if the story of sunken treasure and drug trafficking weren't as well written as they are, this film would be well worth the time spent just watching some of the finest underwater choreography on a stage both fascinating and gorgeous and with a cast of beautiful bodies in synch with the splendor. The cast is good and certainly beyond even the eye-candy appeal of each of the actors. Peter Zuccarini's underwater cinematography deserves Oscar attention; Shane Hurlbut controls the above water cinematography well. But director John Stockwell is to be commended for the pacing of this edge-of-the-seat story - and that is saying a lot for a film that is close to two hours long! Yes there are chinks in the mortar of the story and moments where the audience must suspend belief (just how long can Paul Walker hold his breath anyway?), but in the end this is a film that deserves serious attention from the movie audience. It is better than you would expect! Grady Harp",Into the Blue
12,zetes,Meh,6,6 December 2009,"Not half bad, though definitely forgettable. The biggest thing the film has going for it are its visuals. The underwater photography looks spectacular (I saw it on Blu Ray). Even better, of course, is Jessica Alba's rear end, which is the movie's most important character. Ashley Scott provides a nice secondary butt for the greedy. I suppose if you're a woman, Paul Walker is kind of studly. For me, though, he was just a block of wood. I'm surprised he can submerge in water. Josh Brolin is a good villain. If I were the writer, I would have killed off Scott Caan a lot earlier. He's an obnoxious presence and makes the movie less watchable every time he speaks. The story itself, about a group of treasure divers who find both a ship full of treasure and a plane full of cocaine, is not bad, nor is it good. It's kind enough not to get extremely stupid, but much of the story is fairly uninteresting.",Into the Blue
13,mm-39,Not Good,3,22 June 2006,"I believe the makers where trying to copy the movie The Deep, which is repeatedly shown on TBS. Not much of a story, and looks like the film makers produced, this future 99 cent rental, on the quick. The characters were unlikeable, and why was the bar scene shot? I guess they were trying to make the film into a hunk and babe beach fest. No real mystery or suspense in this film. I would not even rent it on 99 cent night. The preview looks better than the movie. Into the blue could kill a few acting careers. Has Paul Walker done any decent movies? He is not a bad actor but needs help in selecting the roles he picks.Wasn't he in Joy Ride? Now that was an interesting movie and good selection on his part.",Into the Blue
14,JamesHitchcock,Unacknowledged Remake of the Deep,3,4 April 2017,"You can just imagine the discussions among the studio executives.""Let's make a film with Jessica Alba in a bikini!"" ""Great idea! What's the plot angle?"" ""Plot? With Jess in a bikini do we need a plot? Make her character a swimwear model or something!"" ""Naah, too obvious. What about pirates of the Caribbean, sunken treasure, that sort of thing? Make Jess a scuba diver. In a bikini, of course"".And so we end up with a sort of unacknowledged remake of ""The Deep"" from the seventies. Like the earlier film, it is about treasure hunters diving for sunken treasure and tangling with drug-dealing gangsters, and like that film it relies heavily upon the charms of its scantily-clad leading lady, Alba here and Jacqueline Bissett in ""The Deep"". (Indeed, ""The Deep"" itself can be seen as an unacknowledged remake of ""Underwater"" from the fifties, a film whose main attraction was the sight of a scantily-clad Jane Russell). ""Into the Blue"", however, does offer a bonus to its target young male audience; we have two couples, not just one, diving for the treasure, so we get to see two pretty girls in bikinis. (Ashley Scott is the other).There is a problem with remakes, acknowledged or unacknowledged. Or rather, there are two problems. If you try to remake a good film, the critics will gleefully claim that your effort is nowhere near as good as the original. And if you try to remake a bad one, they will (equally gleefully) accuse you of desperately trying to succeed with a formula which failed last time. Well, ""The Deep"" was (in my view at least) a pretty bad film, and ""Into the View"" does not improve on it. Indeed, it is probably even worse.The main flaws of ""The Deep"" were a clichéd plot, some manic over-acting from Robert Shaw and some rather dull photography. The main flaws of ""Into the Blue"" are firstly a plot which is so tortured as to come, at times, close to well-nigh incomprehensible. Secondly, the dialogue is often difficult to hear clearly. I spent the whole of the running-time, for example, thinking that Paul Walker's character was called ""Gerry""; it wasn't until I saw the closing credits that I realised this was actually supposed to be ""Jared"". Mishearing a character's name would not in itself have spoilt the film for me, but this was merely one symptom of a wider problem, and frequently mishearing crucial lines of dialogue certainly did spoil it.And thirdly there is the acting. Alba put me in mind of Louis B. Mayer's famous dictum about Esther Williams- ""Wet she's a star, dry she ain't"". She earned a Razzie nomination for Worst Actress. None of her co-stars were so nominated, although if Mayer had seen their performances here he might have opined that ""wet they ain't stars, and dry they ain't either"". And that includes that other big name, Walker, for once in his career acting in a film without any fast cars in it.Alba and Walker are merely wooden, but Scott Caan as Bryce, the other boy in the foursome, is something worse than wooden. He makes Bryce so unsympathetic (admittedly, with a lot of help from the scriptwriters) that we end up wondering just when he is going to get his well-deserved come-uppance along with the rest of the villains. Incredibly, however, we are supposed to accept Bryce as one of the good guys, even though he can see no moral objection to collaborating with a vicious gang of drug smugglers and even though he shows very little emotion when his girlfriend is killed by a shark. (He would be a lot more upset about losing the gold than he is about losing his girl). Bryce is supposed to be a hot-shot New York lawyer; the New York Bar Association should sue the film-makers for implying that they would ever permit such an unprincipled jerk to practice law.About the most one can say for the film is that the underwater sequences are generally attractive and well done. And, of course, Jessica Alba looks gorgeous. But, I'm afraid, sometimes bikinis are just not enough to turn a badly written, badly directed and badly acted film into a good one. 3/10",Into the Blue
15,Smells_Like_Cheese,Honestly? It's just OK,4,30 January 2006,"While 2005 was one of the worst years for cinema, ""Into the Blue"" is a prime reason for that accusation. Well, ""Into the Blue"" wasn't really that bad, it wasn't that good either. I felt that it should have been titled ""Really hot, greedy, and horny people in bathing suits"". The actors, we got two really hot actors who's careers are on fire right now, Jessica Alba and Paul Walker. Together, they did a decent job of acting, but their characters were a bit unbelievable. The other characters/actors, I just didn't care about. I felt that the story had just cheated me out of so much and I didn't understand why some of the stories were made the way they were. This could have been a great adventure film, especially for the summer time. But it just turned out as an average teen movie that I feel adults just can't really get into. If you are an adult and you enjoyed the movie, I'm sorry, no offense to those who enjoyed the movie. I guess everyone must really love Jessica Alba in a bikini, huh? 4/10",Into the Blue
16,blanbrn,"Good and entertaining action drama that twists with cat and mouse games of blackmail, plus nice eye candy with Jessica!",7,18 December 2017,"Really not a big fan of these type of movies, yet from time to time I do watch these action drama types that involve criminals and good against bad with plot twists of mind games! And this picture ""Into the Blue"" has all of that.The story is simple it involves a plane crash, and a ship or boat type that have sunk into the deep blue waters of the Bahamas, already present and living like two love birds are two straight arrow types Jared(the late Paul Walker)and Sam(Jessica Alba who's so cute and sexy!)who welcome some old friends Bryce(Scott Caan) and Amanda(Ashley Scott)who's morals are a little dirty and questionable.Along the way a tale of cocaine and treasures unfold with divers and drug dealers involved as it's high action and rocky drama on the waves of the Bahamas! Also Jessica Alba has a damsel in distress moment as she's kidnapped and taken hostage by the bad drug dealers as she has her mom taped with duct tape. Overall it has all the elements and themes of action drama movies like adventure and bad against good and rescue and the search for better goods!

17,disdressed12,disappointing to me,5,13 March 2007,"to me,this movie was disappointing.it's not a horrible film,but it just seemed blah.i do think some of the underwater scenes were nice,but other than that, i didn't find it interesting. i find it ironic that a movie involving deep sea diving has such a shallow plot.this is just my opinion.that wouldn't have bothered me so much, if the movie were fun and entertaining,but it just didn't it do for me.i don't think the movie was awful,it just wasn't anything.a movie about the deep blue turns out to be 'beige'.(bland)i don't know what else to say,except that i probably wouldn't recommend It to my friends,based on my impressions,but to each their own.i guess i'd say this movie was average,therefore i give it 5/10",Into the Blue
18,Robert_duder,"A decent, and different thriller",6,6 January 2006,"Once again I take opposing sides against most reviews here on IMDb. Into The Blue wasn't the showcase of Jessica Alba's form like everyone is making it out to be. In fact I thought Into The Blue was a decent thriller with some very unique moments considering the majority of the action and film takes place under water which gives it a very unique spin. Although I think in some ways it also dampens (pun definitely intended) the plot because at times it's a little hard to follow. Nonetheless Into The Blue gives a decent story with some okay acting to be watchable. And anyone who has decided to only sit through it to watch Jessica Alba in a bikini will be sorely disappointed because there is more Paul Walker in this film than Alba.Director John Stockwell is no stranger to the ""teen"" flick after doing Crazy Beautiful and Blue Crush both which aimed themselves towards the teenies and Into The Blue is no different. He cleverly uses Paul Walker, and Scott Caan as the girl magnet and Alba and Ashley Scott as the eye candy for the guys. But it's not as blatant as everyone would have you believe and there is more of a story than many would have you believe. Walker and Alba play the already established couple and they are cute together but their chemistry isn't anything special. Ashley Scott's character is mostly vapid and annoying which I think is partially the whole idea but her presence is mostly unneeded. No one person's performance or character stands out. This film is mostly held together by the decent storyline and the very well filmed under water scenes.Anyone looking for something intelligent or a real edge of your seat thriller will mostly be disappointed by this but if you go into it with the expectations of it being ""okay"" and I think teenagers will enjoy the characters and story more than the adult movie goer will. And I don't mean to take away from the fact that Jessica Alba certainly is hot...but it doesn't hold the movie together by any means and the characters are very shallow. It's something to watch if you haven't seen it and chances are you won't despise it but you won't be listing in your top...say...200 movies. 6.5/10",Into the Blue
19,MLDinTN,hot guys and gals mixed with sharks equal fun,7,12 March 2007,"This movie is by no means a brain teaser, but it's fun to watch. If you like the ocean and snorkeling, then you'll like this. The film has a lot of cool shots of sea life. Jared and Sam are a couple whom team up with his friend Bryce and his girl Amanda. They go diving and Jared thinks he may have found a shipwreck with lost treasure. But they also find a drug plane with all cargo intact.They decide to find proof for a claim on the wreck before calling the police about the plane. Only problem is they don't have the money to buy the needed equipment to move large amounts of sand. So Bryce and Amanda decide to do a little side deal with the drugs but of course when you deal with drug dealers, problems ensue. Now they need to get the drugs to save their lives. And the real bad guy turns out to be someone from early in the movie.The movie features a couple of shark attacks that are not realistic, more funny than anything. Sharks attack someone and the water is filled with blood, yet they leave all the good guys alone. And a shark wouldn't go after someone like these reef sharks did. We aren't talking great whites.But the action is cool and filmed well underwater.FINAL VERDICT: If you like the ocean, Paul Walker, or Jessica Alba, then see this. They are hot in it.",Into the Blue

No, it doesn't. Yet, I wonder how many times I've watched this. There certainly is something alluring about 'Into the Blue', and its not just the eye candy. The acting is good, except maybe for Jessica Alba, who is not always believable and portrayed the character I least cared about.The character actions were more then just a bit questionable, and there were a few credibility issues. The call to adventure is the draw card for me. I loved the treasure hunt theme, the underwater shots, the suspense and action that followed, and yes, the beautiful bodies... *add dreamy face here*...Although the film is slow moving and takes its time before accelerating to full throttle, I never really found it boring. I enjoyed the characters, and the setting. There's also a few unexpected turns and twists.

This treasure of gold and coke was discovered by beach boy Jared played by the late Paul Walker and his hot girlfriend Samantha, Jessica Alba, while scuba diving off the coast.It's Jered's friend Bryce, Scott Caan, from NYC who's a mouthpiece or shyster-Lawyer-for drug dealers who talks both Jared and Samathata or Sam as she's called to go diving for the loot that in the end leads to Bryce's girlfriend, that he picked up the night before at a Go-Go bar, Amanda, Ashley Scott, who ends up getting attacked by a 15 foot shark who ripped off her leg thus killing her.There's also a side story to all this in British drug lord Reyes,James Frain, whom the cocaine belonged to forcing Jared & Bryce to retrieve his drugs or else he'll have Jared's girlfriend Sam deep-ed sixth-ed and turned into shark bait at the bottom of the Caribbean Sea. there's another sub-plot to all this in that Rayes's partner***SPOILER***""Aquatic Theme Park"" tour guide Derek Bates, Josh Brolin, who feels he's trying to screw him out of his share of the cocaine has him and his boys-local Bahamans hoodlums-knocked off so he can keep all the drugs all for himself along with the wreckage, some 150 million in gold and jewelry, of the sunken ship ""Zephyr"".***SPOILERS*** The action gets fast & furious as well as wet and waterlogged in the final moments of the movie with Jared and Sam slugging it out with Bates and whatever he still has left of his gang after he had most of them murdered along with his partner the snake-like and double crossing British drug kingpin Reyes. Bates get his much like the shark in ""Jaws"" did with an pressurized air tank slamming into him that exploded on impact.

The second because of the great underwater sequences (I wonder if James Cameron paid a visit to the set in relation to being the ""mentor"" of Jessica Alba?) This movie, again motivated by the participation of Jessica in the casting, was right timed: actually, in February, it's cold and rainy days thus it was great to see sun, warm in the Bahamas! Actually, I find that this kind of movie would be more successful in winter than in summer! The young cast is perfect: Scott Caan and Josh Brolin looks like twins to their father, and the glance of Ashley Scott is enough particular to recall her 30s sequence in ""AI"".The diving moments are great just for the sake of the natural beauty and for the world of silence!

Even though it's considered as a mystery feature, ""Into the Blue"" focuses mainly on a plot that deals with narcs, searching for ""treasures"", and partying on extremely attractive locations.To be honest, I kept watching it only for Jessica Alba's hotness. I mean, she spends most of the time wearing a skimpy, sexy bikini that doesn't leaves anything for the imagination.Therefore, I got myself interested in the plot because of it's fast pace, entertaining situations, and popcorn f/x.

It is hard to find someone to root for in this movie, though, as the ""good guys"" are mainly motivated by greed. A bit like the ""cattle drive"" in City Slickers 2. It has its moments, though. Jessica Alba is worth looking at in this film, as she has a good role. As greedy as the good guys are, the bad guys are REALLY nasty.

Sure its basically just a virtual vacation action movie with gratuitous ass shots, like excessive, close up (very sexy) ass shots but whatever, everybody looks good and the underwater stunts and intriguing story made up for it. Paul Walker (sigh) plays a diver/treasure hunter who along with his girlfriend (uber sexy Jessica Alba) find themselves battling sharks and ruthless criminals after discovering a historic ship wreck and a sunken cargo plane loaded with cocaine. I actually got quite wrapped up in the story, especially since I used to live in the Caribbean and dated a dive instructor. The island life is well portrayed and while sadly my boyfriend was no Paul Walker (who is) Paul does a good job here.Everybody looked so relaxed underwater considering the extreme stunts they had to get through. Scott Caan is essentially his Hawaii-Five-0 ""Danno"" character but I enjoyed the moral dilemma he and his girlfriend created.

30,noralee,Mindless but Visually Entertaining View of Attractive Ocean Flora In Between Violence,5,5 October 2005,"""Into the Blue"" beautifully delivers exactly what it advertises -- Jessica Alba in a string bikini and a sun-drenched Paul Walker as the primary flora in a lot of water. For the record, straight women get a bit cheated, as Alba's attire is a marvel of waterproof tape (especially with the camera constantly down her (or her stunt or body double's) front and up her rear) while Walker wears long trunks and jeans throughout so we get half the view straight men do. Are we not customers too? Can we not get our pound of flesh? Is our money less green? Oh sure, we're supposed to mostly care about cuddling, and we get on the big screen some of Walker's engaging smile and crinkly blue eyes as ""Jared"" establishes his romantic fidelity to Alba's ""Samantha"" with less passion than he won over those of us oblivious to fast cars in ""Noel."" I came in a few minutes late so missed some of the most romantic scene, but I didn't seem to miss any explication. I get that the 12 year old boys in the audience are restless during such romance, but older, female members of the audience would have liked more as a break from the confusing action.The two swimsuits, er, actors do have chemistry together, even though he's at least eight years older than she. Alba is charming as her ""Sam"" does get to spout morals, as she makes clear that drugs and drug dealers are bad, and is kindly to children, convincing that love is all we need, and she is neither helpless nor super, but does get to use some of her old ""Dark Angel"" chops. I'm sure dentists will be happy how sexy she makes brushing teeth look. But I was mostly worried if the actors were using strong sun screen or if they would be eligible for workmen's comp when they develop skin cancer from so much over-exposure.While the plot gets way overly twisted up levels and levels of corruption and way too many bodies pile up (and I did not think it appropriate that audience members brought very young children due to the violence and occasional naughty word), the morality basics of the slippery slope of compromise are presented well, though there no noir subtlety or comeuppance. I think the confusing elements in the underwater action sequences may be due to editing confusion over which masked stunt double is portraying whom.As usual in such films, the bad guys do seem to have the most fun. Ashley Scott's party girl brings some ambiguity to her role as an evil influence. Josh Brolin was almost unrecognizable behind his gristle and gruff voice and James Frain was enjoying slumming in what sounded to Yank ears as a working class accent.The soundtrack includes some good Caribbean song selections, such as by Ziggy Marley, and a few surprising singer-songwriters, such as Loque, but even more would have been welcome. The instrumental music is serviceable, but it ramps up too obviously with surprise villainous attacks.This is a visually entertaining, mindless ride.",Into the Blue

It was silly with this one though because I mean, were they actors or were they fishes? Anyhow, Jessica Alba and Paul Walker are a couple who dive in search of sunken treasure for a living. Walker's character used to work for a marine bureaucrat whom he now resents and considers a rival. One day, his (Walker's) brother comes to town with his latest chic Du Jour and together they all go diving. They unexpectedly discover the crash site of a plane and when they swim into it discover that the plane has been the carrier of some serious drugs. They are split on whether or not to take the drugs for themselves, sell it and become rich or to go to the authorities. Things quickly go awry when they can't keep their story within the group and word leaks out about the drugs and site. Then things begin to go horribly wrong as true natures of certain characters become revealed. The plot was solid but some of the scenes were too unbelievable to swallow.",Into the Blue
33,eric262003,Jessica Alba Looked Hot! Too Bad Everything Else Was Bland,5,17 February 2014,"Okay, at first the only reason I watched this shipwreck of a movie called ""Into the Blue"" was to see Jessica Alba in a sexy bikini and boy did she not disappoint as she spends the majority of the movie clad in a bikini and Daisy Duke shorts. This fulfilled my movie night and my erotic dreams and made me forget about the amateur storyline and the pathetic ending of what had potential to be at least an average movie. The late Paul Walker stars as Jared, a down on his luck treasure hunter whose luck takes a turn in a different direction as he finds a relic from an old, obscure shipwreck. As Jared and company look for the abandoned ship, they spot a crashed drug plane and can't decide what to with the evidence they found. If they report the situation, they may not have the opportunity to find their treasure, because the area will be blocked for them. Eventually our flawed protagonists face time with the drug lord in order to survive this ordeal and to unravel the sunken ship before their rivalry does which would end up making them poor and destitute. As predicted as always our heroes emerge victorious as they overcome the drug lord and usurped their rivalry and successfully find the lost ship and the treasures that come with it. Not to show any disrespect to the deceased, but Paul Walker in my opinion was never really a talented performer and would be better off as the secondary star like his performance as Brian O'Connor from ""The Fast and the Furious"" series. Scott Caan is nowhere close to his father James' legacy, but was still fun to watch as Bryce, the cocky, best friend to Jared. The settings were absolutely photogenic, but it proves null and void thank to the crummy script which needed a lot more editing. At least Alba's sex appeal was enough to keep me glued to the set each time she poses in her bikini. All in this entire movie does not do justice at all. There are really no deeming entertainment values in ""Into the Blue"" unless to like the beauty and of the dimly clad outfit Alba wear throughout most of the movie. And that's not entirely a bad thing.",Into the Blue
34,screenman,Rather Boring.,5,25 May 2008,"In order for a story to involve the viewer, we must be induced to care about the characters. For me, at least, this work was a signal failure.The four young protagonists were about as shallow, bland, self-absorbed and hedonistic as it was possible to be. These were the kind of people that Freddie Kruger and Micheal Myers were created to indiscriminately slaughter before they left high school. This bunch evidently escaped.The story itself was woefully slow to develop. There were lots of pointless little side issues that appeared to take us nowhere. The director himself might have fallen victim to the languid lifestyle of his subjects. However, it seemed we were being lured into a false premise; because about halfway through, the movie jumped a gear. Very quickly the kind of slaughter depicted in a typical teen slasher began big-time. Frankly; so many people seemed to become embroiled in the rather tired premise, only to be bumped-off one way and another that it was hard to keep up. Towards the underwater climax, things became so confused for me that at times I really didn't know who was doing what and to whom.The idea that these gormless nonentities could pull a fast one on a bunch of hardened professional cocaine gangsters itself beggars belief. But implausibility was the byword in this movie.Unfortunately, by the time the action kicked-in I had so completely lost interest in its subjects or their ambition that whether or not they succeeded, survived, were shot or eaten by sharks was all the same to me. I was pretty much out of it.In justice, some of the filming - particularly the underwater sequences - was absolutely stunning. It was almost a celebration for the delights of scuba diving. But that just wasn't enough to save the day.If you're into blue-water 18-30 holidays; then I suspect you're going to love it. If you're young, shallow, pretty and hedonistic (and probably carrying one or two STD's), perhaps you'll identify with its characters. I'm not, and I don't. I was bored; and for that it gets 5 stars. And 4 of those are for the photography. Check-out 'Trespass'; now that was really slick. And I remember another cracker in which the crashed plain was full of money. That was called 'A Simple Plan'. Coincidentally, both starred the excellent Bill Paxton.",Into the Blue

Then as the saying goes ""Keep your friends close and your ermines closer"".

The cast are all good enough, although they were probably chosen as much for their looks as their acting abilities, but who can deny that Jessica Alba and Ashley Scott did add a sexy feel for the male audience, and i guess Paul Walker and Scott Caan did the same for the ladies.What really made the film for me was the truly fantastic scenery and the underwater camera work; it was flawless and stunningly beautiful in a way that is rarely captured on film, three cheers for the direction and the film crew for that.7/10",Into the Blue

40,Victor Field,"Depending on your views re Jessica Alba, you might want to subtract some stars...",6,5 November 2005,"Jessica Alba filmed ""Into the Blue"" before ""Sin City"" and ""Fantastic Four,"" but its already long gestation period was made even longer by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's adoption by Sony. It might have done better at the box office had it opened in the summer, but then again maybe it's better to spread the Alba goodness a bit; and it's likely to do better on DVD and cable (witness Cindy Crawford's ""Fair Game,"" which was never relegated to after midnight showings on Sky Movies - always a good sign).Understand something; ""Into the Blue"" isn't great art by any means - Matt Johnson's script is so story-deficient that even padding by gratuitous jetski sequences and extended song montages can't hide its flimsiness, and the story of our heroes and their friends finding a downed ship and a plane full of heroin (with predictably nasty results) is as short on sense as it is on plot; the bad guys just seem to turn up out of nowhere. It also suffers from some weak directing by John Stockwell, who seems more interested in getting in gratuitous flesh shots than moving the story along; a pace that's pretty languid and actually generates less dramatic tension than ""Help! I'm A Fish"" or any given episode of ""Flipper"" - the versions with or without Jessica (most damagingly in the action climax); and a tendency to leave one of the actresses from ""Dark Angel"" off the screen for worryingly long periods - and I don't mean Ashley Scott. It also might have helped if the movie had junked the plank on legs that is Paul Walker (who, unlike Miss Alba, doesn't even try to put in any effort emoting-wise... then again, this is a movie with Paul Walker and Tyson Beckford, he of the wavering accent, so who expects great acting?).SPOILER TIME! It also might have helped if the movie had gotten rid of Ashley Scott a lot sooner than it actually does - it has to be said that her exit at the fangs of a shark is so abrupt that it almost doesn't register. (Maybe they remembered how she seems to doom anything she's in - see also ""Birds of Prey,"" the second season of ""Dark Angel"" and the original pilot of ""Joey."") END OF SPOILER!Fortunately, Scott Caan and Josh Brolin (more reminiscent of Jeff Bridges than his actual dad, happily) give the movie some energy as our hero's jerk of a best friend and a salvage expert, the photography both under and above water is wonderful, and it does pass two hours harmlessly enough; unlike its most obvious inspiration ""The Deep,"" it didn't bore me or make me want to set fire to the screen, which is okay. It may play a lot like a long episode of ""Baywatch,"" but at least it doesn't have David Hasselhoff singing or Pamela Anderson.SORT OF SPOILER HERE...And as for Jessica Alba... well, the end credits roll over footage of her (and Walker) cavorting in the Bahamas waters amongst the marine life. Speaking as a lifelong credit junkie, I actually wanted the credits to GET OUT OF THE WAY so I could get a clear view.Nobody has ever gotten that reaction from me before. Enough said.",Into the Blue
41,TOMASBBloodhound,Now that's what I call marine biology!,5,18 January 2006,"You almost feel like Rodney Dangerfield from Back to School after watching this movie. The film has some neat underwater photography, some good stunts, and even a twist or two. But ultimately, it's just as excuse to show off some young flesh. Is that entirely a bad thing? The Hound thinks not. A good dosage of Jessica Alba flesh can warm you up on the coldest winter day.Into the Blue is directed by John Stockwell. Yes, the guy who played Cougar in Top Gun. One may dislike the content of the films he's made thus far in his early directing career (Blue Crush, Crazy/Beautiful), but one cannot deny the fact that the man knows how to shoot young women's bodies. Since there are only two female main characters, that means there are also plenty of young men for the women to feast their eyes on. Paul Walker kind of has the Justin Timberlake thing going on. Seeing him and Tyson Beckford really makes me feel out of shape now that the holidays are over.Oh, the plot! I almost forgot. It's basically a re-hash of The Deep. We have young treasure hunters in the Caribbean who find not only a sunken ship carrying gold, but a recently crashed plane full of cocaine on the ocean floor. Naturally, the drug dealer of record in the area wants the coke for himself, and doesn't want anyone getting in the way by searching for treasure near by. The resulting action has numerous gun battles, shark attacks, kidnappings, and acts of machismo. The film is a little long, but the conclusion is worth sticking around for.This film is not to be confused with anything up for an Academy Award this year. It was filmed nearly a year and a half before it was released for reasons I would not dare to speculate on. It did make $18 million bucks in the theaters, but any long-lasting success this film has will depend on if any of these stars goes on to have a long career. There is an extraordinary amount of violence and gore for a PG-13 film. An F-bomb or two here and there, would have certainly given it an R. The acting is pretty sparse. The scenes above water look rushed, and possibly printed on the first or second take. The scenes below water are very impressive, however.The verdict: 5 of 10 stars. This is a popcorn flick with some decent production values, and a hot young cast. Not much else. Too many bad guys, and a plot that doesn't know when to resolve itself. Here's a little game if you get bored with the movie... see if you can hold your breath as long as these people do in some of these scenes.

At least I didn't watch many films with this kind of plot and scenario. I enjoyed it especially because of that, but also because it has a very well constructed plot and characters in my point of view. The beautiful actresses also help to turn this into an ""interesting"" and attractive movie, but the entire story and the plot twists make it enjoyable, that's for sure.

Paul Walker is aite in the lead, not the best but not the films worst either. jessica Albas performance was pretty bad, she was playing someone who follows the rules and is all strict but yet was not convincing. Scott Caan was the one performance i enjoyed in this movie, his character was actually interesting and he has some acting skills. The direction was pretty bad in this flick, felt like a B movie throughout. This is just a moneymaker, not a serious movie, its ridiculous at times, but entertaining, has a fast & furious vibe to it.

45,moviesleuth2,Just plain fun!,8,30 December 2008,"In a way, watching ""Into the Blue"" is like going on vacation. Great sights. Fun. Exciting. No pressure. Escapist. Those definitions could easily describe ""Into the Blue."" Definitely not one to go down in the history of films, but that isn't the idea.Jared (Paul Walker) and Sam (Jessica Alba) are two young lovers living in the Caribbean. They don't have much, but Jared spends his time looking for buried treasure and Sam works at a SeaWorld-type place. Enter Bryce (Scott Caan) and his new flame Amanda (Ashley Scott), and things are looking towards a great weekend. But then Jared finds something BIG, but he doesn't have the money to claim it. Through a series of complications and twists, the four end up in a battle for their lives with some really nasty people.I know that was vague, but experiencing the twists is part of the fun.In a movie like this, it's expected that everyone in the cast is extremely good looking. ""Into the Blue"" is no exception. What makes this one better than the rest is that the most of the performances are solid. Many people might disagree with me, but I like Paul Walker. He may not be Edward Norton (there are times here when he strikes the wrong note), but he has charisma, and he makes a hero easy to root for. Same goes for Jessica Alba, who's adorable as always, and is a perfect match for Walker. Caan (in a scene-stealing performance) is a lovable goofball whose brawn outweighs his brains by a factor of about 3 to 1. Of the four, the only one who doesn't give a good performance is Ashley Scott. She's got the looks, but not the acting ability. James Frain and Josh Brolin are great as well.The actors aren't the only great visuals to ogle at. The scenery is always beautiful, and director John Stockwell presents it in the way to make it look its best (considering the material, that's not hard to do, but Stockwell makes it better than usual).""Into the Blue"" has unambitious goals, but they are such that they are difficult to achieve. It has to have thrills, but they can't raise the adrenaline level too much or else it will destroy the mood. It has to be involving, but not so much that it changes the relaxed feel of the movie. I know I'm not making much sense, but if you see the movie, you'll understand. But Stockwell and his cast and crew understand what needs to be done, and they make it work. It's a great ride, but in a breezy, relaxed sort of way.It's not a surprise that many critics trashed this movie. It's not for them. It's one of those movies to watch while you sit back and relax.",Into the Blue
46,Laakbaar,Adventure in paradise,8,6 August 2013,"I have no choice but to give this film a high score, because I've seen it three times now (once in the theatre; twice on the tube), and each time I've enjoyed it immensely.I should add at this point that I am an experienced and obsessed diver and snorkeler, so the underwater setting is part of the attraction for me. The underwater scenes here are vivid, colourful, visually exciting and beautifully filmed. It was like being there.I identify strongly with the character of Jared (Paul Walker). Here is a guy who knows how to handle himself and doesn't put up with any sh*t. If there actually were people like Jared in this world, leading the life he leads in this movie, I would be green with envy. This movie makes me want to quit my job, abandon my responsibilities, book a flight to the Bahamas, and look for someone like Jared to hang out with.The irony is that once Jared has made his fortune, he will look back on his simple island life, complete with dockside trailer and old boat, as the best days of his life.I would have enjoyed a movie just showing Jared and Sam (Jessica Alba), a hot couple living their perfect lives in this Caribbean paradise. However, the drugs story was entertaining enough. And I think it reflects the reality that the drugs trade wreaks havoc on many Caribbean islands.The character of Bryce (Scott Caan) was perhaps the only annoying thing about the film. No redeeming qualities there at all. It's inexplicable that Jared would hang out with someone like this, and that the filmmakers didn't kill him off in the end. Die, Bryce, die!I thought Josh Brolin played his role particularly well. He's an under-rated actor.If you love diving, snorkeling and the Caribbean, or if you just want to look at eye candy (male and female) for 90 minutes, you'll enjoy this film. I don't understand the low scores, but perhaps most moviegoers aren't into diving movies.",Into the Blue
47,raypdaley182,could have been so much better,4,24 July 2006,"Right, firstly I want to let you all know this a review of the DVD version of the film after having seen ""The Making Of"" and the deleted scenes.I don't know if this or Fantastic 4 was made first but whichever was made first, the director obviously saw Jessica Alba in a tight outfit and thought ""I can use that in my movie"" Jessica Alba does look pretty but she also looks about 13 years old. Paul Walker is a new face to me and I've never seen him in anything before this, Scott Caan I assume is James (Rollerball) Caan's son? Ashley SCott is also very pretty and plays her part well and you know she's going to be the weak link in the chain of close friends as the girl he's known for only 14 hours.Take the films The Deep, Jaws & Deep Blue Sea and combine them all with The Bahama's, Drugs, Treasure and Betrayal.The cute looking guy and his girl are down on their luck after he looses his job (by the way, the deleted scene of him saving the boy by cutting his dive belt should have been retained and then his conversation with his boss about a lost dive belt would have made more sense then) and then anxious to find treasure.He gets lucky and finds some stuff and then finds a plane (looks like an old DC3) which is full of drugs. His morals are too high to sell the drugs but this will happen eventually. When they find The Zeyphr the wreck looks far too new, even the plane looks like it's been in the sea longer.Friends who turn out to be involved in the drug scene and who is going to betray them next and who is going to die or get killed.The sharks all look CG as do the fish (but it turns out they are all real) and the shark attacks look very good but sometimes are are a little bit over the top.Generally the film is played more for action with the boats, guns , sharks and drugs. It ends on a high note with them finally finding treasure on the Zeyphr but the ending could have been a lot better.Quite a weak film sold on some action and the cute cast.",Into the Blue
48,tastyhotdogs,"Treasure,drugs and people holding their breath underwater for a really long time",6,11 December 2006,"Stuck in a motel room with little on, Wifey asked if we could watch this sure train wreck of a movie. Surprisingly, it was better than I thought, although maybe my standards have dropped.The movie is about a couple who deep sea dive looking for treasure and stuff. One day they discover a few curious treasures, then a plane. The plane is full of drugs, and the group are faced with a decision as to whether to report the plane or to keep it secret until they build up their treasure chest. Soon they become entangled in a game of life and death,and must decide how much they are willing to risk.Like I said, actually not that bad. I was expecting a movie based around Jessica Alba wearing a bikini, but there was a bit of a story and some great underwater & diving cinematography. Sure, most of the characters were annoying and I got frustrated with how ridiculously long everyone could hold their breath underwater, but for the current crop of movies in the genre it wasn't too bad.",Into the Blue
49,bh_tafe3,The Big Bounce Three Deep Blue Crushes After the Sunset,7,15 July 2009,"Over the years these part oceanic travelogues, part bikini clad star vehicles have produced plenty of films, some of them good, some of them bad, nearly all of them instantly forgettable. All concerned here deserve some credit for producing a film with slightly more substance than many of their predecessors.There's nothing that interesting or different about the story: a group of deep sea divers searching for a boat of sunken treasure accidentally stumble across a crashed aeroplane filled with cocaine. One of them sees dollar signs, some go along with them, some don't. All of them end up in a world of trouble, especially the attractive female lead who gets kidnapped and held as ransom.But somehow this one seems to work better than a typical genre film. The production values seem sleeker, the performances more realistic and the leads more likable than a typical stock plot phone in effort. Paul Walker proved his worth as an affable, flawed leading man a long time ago. Alba can still make stupid actions seem intelligent, Scott Caan plays a redeemable rogue and Josh Brolin a grounded but watchable villain.This is hardly a cinematic masterpiece and follows a plot you've seen a hundred times before, but somehow seems to succeed, almost in spite of itself, where so many similar films have failed.Delivers exactly what the poster would suggest and with a minimum of fuss. In short, there are plenty of worse ways to spend two hours than Jessica Alba running into trouble in a bikini and continually getting saved by a shirtless Paul Walker.",Into the Blue

51,CelluloidRehab,A stitch in time saves someone from making a crappy movie.,4,23 February 2006,"From the director of Crazy/Beautiful and Blue Crush (John Stockwell), we get this. In this case his pedigree is clearly evident. This movie can be compared to fried dough. At times it looks, feels and tastes good, but is actually full of air and empty calories.The story revolves around the friends, acquaintances and adventures of Jared (Paul Walker) and his girlfriend, Sam (Jessica Alba) in the Bahamas. Jared starts the movie out by getting fired from his touristy scuba job and Sam works as a shark trainer at a Sea World-type place. On a pleasure dive with his friend, Bryce (Scott Caan), they find the treasury remains of a shipwreck. A few feet away from the treasure, they find a plane full of cocaine and 3 dead guys (definetly not Tom Hank's Fedex plane). Hilarity ensues !! Actually it doesn't. The three of them along with Bryce's tag-along-friend, Amanda (Ashley Scott), decide not to say anything about either wreck. This is so they can keep it a secret while they find the ship wreckage (apparently this ship has some historic value as it could be the ship of an ex-slave turned pirate). Amanda and Bryce try to convince the other half of the expedition that they need to forget the wreckage and just pull out all the coke. That point is revisited when the group cannot afford to rent a 30k salvage vessel. There is also the presence of Jared's ex-boss, Bates (Josh Brolin) to create some of the conflict. The coke becomes the giant elephant in the room. No one seems to do be able to do anything that isn't related to the coke.The first 35 minutes is the meat-and-potatoes of the movie. This is what I like to call Jessica's scenes. Jessica is the star of the movie. The director makes the same mistake as the director of Fantastic Four, by not including enough Jessica scenes (albeit in a lesser degree than in Fantastic Four). Fantastic Four was plagued by a lot of visuals, not much of a plot or acting ability, and very, very few instances of Jessica. A plane-full of bushwhackers and Cruzan could not help me to enjoy FF on any level. Thankfully the first part of this movie has lots of great shots of Jessica. For convenience I have itemized the best scenes that she is in by the approximate time:0:13:39-0:14:23 ; 0:18:40-0:18:55 ; 0:58:28In the next 35 minutes the movie loses a lot of steam, due to the decrease in Jessica's presence. During this portion Ashely becomes more prominent. Her ""abilities"" keep this movie above water, however, she is a slight downgrade to Jessica. The last third of the movie turns into a combination of Half-Baked (the selling of drugs for some other purpose) and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (heist plot except not as effective nor funny). It is at this point the movie seemingly stops. It goes into silly, predictable, and quite unbelievable mode. I think maybe the director got into the props at this point. By now, you are hoping the movie ends and the vault that it is being stored in burns to the ground.There are some standout moments in the movie :1) First ever underwater shot of a person doing blow in the water.2) First use of Jessica Alba's butt as flotation device.3) First use of Jessica Alba as a makeshift air tank.4) Nice use of longitudinal long body shots (feet to butt perspective).5) Jessica's line - ""Shut up, you coke whore !!!"".Unfortunately I cannot really recommend the movie. This movie's merit is very similar to that of Oliver Stone's Alexander. In that movie, the rental highlight was the consummation scene between Alexander and his bride (Rosario Dawson). This movie's appeal is all related to Jessica. Everything outside of her has been done before and much better.",Into the Blue
52,mnpollio,Fast-paced eye candy,7,1 June 2007,"It is hard to understand the ill will directed at this harmless and relatively entertaining action thriller as it has absolutely no pretensions about what it is trying to be. It is merely a few hours of beautiful scenery, lovely underwater photography, well-choreographed action sequences and a fine showcase for the hard bodies of the leads. Paul Walker and Jessica Alba are young lovers in the Caribbean who, along with obnoxious visitor Scott Caan and his slutty drug-addled groupie Ashley Scott, stumble onto buried treasure. While trying to figure out how to stake their claim legally, they find their troubles multiply when a downed plane carrying drugs turns out to be lying a hop,skip and a jump away. Walker and Alba figure they can ignore it and step up the pace on the treasure, but naturally sleazy Caan and Scott figure why hunt for fortune when they can seize the drugs and make a killing themselves. This naturally allows them to run afoul of various unsavory characters and then pull the good-natured leads into the mix. Director John Stockwell keeps the pace humming along and even manages some rather suspenseful moments - particularly a night dive which results in tragedy. The villains are by-the-numbers and there are no astounding developments to take this beyond a technically well-done B-movie. Caan and Scott have the requisite bodies to compliment the brief swimwear, but their characters will really try your patience. Golden-girl Alba was born to wear a bikini and does well with a somewhat boring good girl role. Walker, who gets all sorts of grief for his acting, is actually well cast here playing a basically good guy forced by circumstances into some dealings that he would otherwise have steered away from. He is believable, sympathetic and appealing, manages to carry off the action sequences with aplomb and, along with Alba, seems completely at ease inhabiting a role that requires a high eye candy quotient as well as physicality. A surprisingly painless and enjoyable experience.",Into the Blue

I'll let that sink in for a moment...Got it? Good. Now I don't want to hear any whining about how you paid to go see this and it was just Alba and Walker running around in bathing suits. DUH! A more apt title would've been Into the Booty. Not only would it have been a clever play on the fact that these kids have found the hidden treasure from the merchant ship Zephyr, but it would also accurately describe how the camera manages to find every single angle to depict a day in the life of Jessica Alba's wedgie. If it's Ms. Alba's tan, toned booty you want then that is exactly what you'll get. The ladies get a shirtless Josh Brolin. Oh, and I guess the wimpier Paul Walker runs around shirtless most of the time also, if you like scrawnier guys.People are bound to make fun of Walker's acting (and rightfully so), but the guy's fairly harmless. When you need a graduate from the Keanu Reeves School of Acting to play a dive bum, who else are you going to call? Strength in acting isn't exactly what director John Stockwell was going for. Scott Caan provides comic relief, and Ms. Alba and Ashley Scott deliver some mighty graceful swimming, and that's about all that was required of them. And hey, the underwater photography is fantastic!I have to say that I'm a little disappointed that Josh didn't have more screen time. His character is introduced at the beginning, then he disappears for about 45 minutes, then he comes back again briefly until he finally settles in as the main bad guy for about the last 15 - 20 minutes and proceeds to be the most interesting (and most important, in my unbiased opinion) character of the movie. Despite how good Jessica Alba looks, it's Brolin that decides to actually bring some acting chops to the film. Get this guy in a Clint Eastwood Western quick! Everybody I talked to agreed that he was a great bad guy, very intense. The fact that I threatened bodily harm on anybody who said otherwise had nothing to do with it.Anyway, Into the Blue is aimed directly at the 15-30 age demographic. Anybody expecting much more than eye candy and some fast and furious water action should probably enroll in a ""Movie Expectations 101"" class. If you can ignore the cheesy ""love over treasure"" quotes, Jessica's attempts at emoting, the unbelievability of characters holding their breath under water for about 5 minutes, and Walker's use of outdated terminology like ""bro"" and ""gnarly"" then you might realize the fun quotient here is about the equivalent of a day at the beach.",Into the Blue
57,skallisjr,Almost Unbearable,3,1 January 2006,"There are very few films I give up on before they end. This is one of those. The film has a very promising beginning: an aircraft over the ocean is in trouble, and someone runs from the aft toward the cockpit area. Both of the men in the pilot seats turn to see what the guy is doing, even though anyone looking through the windshield can see that the aircraft is in a significant dive. Everyone screams; the plane crashes.That's at the very beginning. After that, we go to the hero and heroine, such as they are, who are physically attractive, but not that bright. He's jobless, being a former diving instructor who pushes his boss into the drink when the guy gets just too officious. So then what? Rather than looking for another job, he and his girlfriend go off with an old friend to have fun. Our hero finds a plane wreck while diving, and brings up dope. He also finds an artifact from an old shipwreck, but the dope is more immediately important.Spoilers, minor as they might be: When Sam decides that the package of dope should be thrown away, the package is slit and the powdered dope is dumped into the water. An unanswered question (as far as I saw it) is what did that do to the sea life? Loopy sharks? Also, what on earth were the pilots doing while their aircraft was in a dive? Screaming isn't very informative.Anyway, I rented it and sat through as much of it as I could take. The film dragged, and finally I threw in the towel. Ms. Alba has a nice body, and if that's all they wanted to show, why didn't they remake an Esther Williams film? If you're male, and 15 to 25, the female scenery is nice enough to sustain you farther than I could get through.",Into the Blue

61,oshram-3,Glorious eye candy but little else,4,5 October 2005,"Like most of the rest of the male viewers of this film, I went solely because the TV ads featured -- prominently -- Jessica Alba in a bikini. Yeah, it looked like there was some action, a car chase or two, you know, the usual action staples. Fine. The makers of this film knew how to fill seats (and the ladies had the very handsome Paul Walker shirtless for an hour and a half) and weren't trying to fool anyone. You were there to see pretty people cavort around mostly naked in the Caribbean. Just so we're clear.It's a good thing the ad campaign was so up front, because that's pretty much all you get in the movie. The plot is a mish-mash of clichés, a messy complicated affair involving treasure hunting, drug smuggling, betrayal, and so many double crosses you're rendered dizzy trying to keep track of them all. The basic gist is that Jared (Walker) is a down on his luck diver (who can hold his breath for unnaturally long periods of time) who is looking for his one big score and believes he has found it in a pirate ship that just happened to be unearthed (unsead?) near a crashed drug smuggling plane (drug smugglers still use DC3s? I guess so). His wily friend Bryce (Scott Caan) drops by with his new floozie, Amanda (Ashley Scott), which you know was really unnecessary because with Jessica Alba frolicking around in her skivvies, you don't need more eye candy, really. As George Lucas (unknowingly ironically) said, ""You can overdo these things."" Of course Jared and Bryce want to go after the drugs, but our moral hero (and heroine) are against it. Things go south when Bryce tries to cut a deal with a local drug-lord (I had a hard time finding him threatening when his main muscle was model Tyrese) and then they have to go after the drugs, and honestly, things get even more complicated from there. Turns out, as you would expect, that nearly everyone in town is involved somehow, which, if that's the case, how come the two poorest people on the island manage to find the drugs, but all the gangsters you can shake a stick at can't? Actually trying to keep track of the plot is fun, because it gives you something to do. The acting is acceptable (although both Caan and Scott don't really take themselves or the film all that seriously); Walker seems to know he's in a dumb flick but gives it an earnest try. And I just can't tell with Alba, especially with this film. The first twenty minutes are a soft core homage to the young starlet, with the camera caressing her body the way most fanboys would love to (to be fair, the women get Walker in very little clothing as well). But director John Stockwell takes the fetishization of Alba's body to a new high (or low, depending on your point of view) and showcases her toned physique for minutes on end, the camera following her around the reef like a voyeur. I'm not necessarily complaining about that -- I don't have an issue ogling pretty girls in bikinis -- but it goes on so long you start to feel just a little creepy watching all that gyrating disguised as swimming (let me put it this way; she played a stripper in Sin City and that was like a cold shower next to this sequence).Having harped on the biggest visual effect in the movie, I can honestly say that any fans of either of the leads should turn off the computer now and go see this movie. Alba and Walker are lovingly shot through the whole thing and you'll get an eyeful of both of them. But there is no other reason to see this film. It's a confused mess, only getting more chaotic as it goes on, and it steals its final denouement from, of all places, Jaws, breaking the first rule of bad cinema: *never* remind the audience of a better film. Of course, given how weak this movie was, that wouldn't be hard to do.",Into the Blue
62,bob-rutzel,Needed More Suspense,6,28 December 2005,"Looking for sunken treasure in the Bahamas waters, four divers find a downed plane that contains a cargo rich in drugs. Now what to do about it. More than half the movie is shot under water and some of the scenes with fish are pretty good, but it was difficult to tell who the divers were since they all looked alike with their scuba gear on. And, when the bad guys got in the waters, well, it was really confusing as to who was who. And, then there was the problem of tight quarters inside the plane. Different colored gear for the bad guys vs the good guys might have helped. Now, you know why the good cowboys always wore white hats.For a thriller, this lacked the suspense it should have had. There was no tension. Everything just happened so fast that you didn't have the time to be nervous or afraid for someone about anything. The nervous camera was back and there were too many shots abruptly taken away bouncing back and forth between action below water and up on the boat. The camera moved so fast at times I had no idea if a harpoon was shot at a good guy or a bad guy. But, I think the real problem here is that the script didn't allow any one actor to be in charge with conviction. Everyone was a supporting actor, and no one could establish who it was he/she was supporting because that person wasn't in the movie. Everyone just seemed to roll with the punches. Put it this way, Jessica Alba was the girlfriend and there were no Dark Angel (her TV show) moments here, and yes, I kind of expected some of that. Still, it was an entertaining movie. Shots of Jessica Alba in a bikini on land or in the water were worth the price of the DVD rental.

The warmth and allure of the islands and the sea in beautiful color, along with four very beautiful leads. From a script by Matt Johnson, the story takes you on a journey that comes from an accident. The opening shot of the plane going down was tremendous. From then on we are hooked on what's to happen. Won't reveal this because you must see this movie.I thought all the underwater photography was overwhelming. Terrific shots of the underwater sea life, including fish of all sizes and colors. The incredible blue of the sea matching the blue of the sky is notably why I feel the title INTO THE BLUE is so right for this. The actors, doing their own stunts underwater did very well. And director Stockwell didn't miss an opportunity to bring the suspense and secrets of underwater life.Paul Walker, playing our hero had just the right appeal and looks to carry this story. He was natural in the role as well as strong in his delivery. Hope to see more of this young man in the future. This was a great vehicle for his abilities. Showing his athletic talents along with his realistic acting impressed me very much. His sidekick, played by the equally adept Scott Caan, son of James, was a perfect match. You could see these two guys had a ball doing this flick. Scott was the antagonizer to Walker. I hear they are friends in real life. You can see that. Playing their playmates are Jessica Alba and Ashley Scott. Both lovely ladies and lookers in their bikinis, still they brought some good interplay with their guys and seemed natural in their relationships with the boys. A great foursome. Add Josh Brolin, son of James, as the heavy, and you have terrific conflict. Scatter many natives of the area and it rounds out an exceptional cast. I was never bored with this. There were times when the action was slow, but it held your interest. Particularly underwater. Breathtaking scenes while scuba diving amongst the coral. How they managed to get some spectacular footage in the water was amazing. Hats off to director Stockwell, his camera crew and his four leading players for an awesome adventure.

65,boyinflares,"Gorgeous Scenery - Walker, Alba and the Ocean!",7,4 June 2006,"""Into the Bue"" is your typical action-adventure film, though one which is surprisingly good (if not predictable) thanks to it's two leads and terrific ocean back drop. The plot is decent enough to hold your attention, though I'm sure most people are interested in it more for the cast. Paul Walker is as hot as ever, and Jessica Alba still has it. But they should not be viewed just as hotties, they are both terrific actors, and though there is little character time in this film, I think they both convey what they need to in the space given to make their characters seem believable, and more importantly likable.Scott Caan and Ashley Scott round out the main cast, but their characters are highly irritating, and you may find yourself not caring about what happens to them. Plenty of beautiful ocean scenery throughout the film, and some interesting fishes! Lost of action and fighting scenes, and a fairly decent soundtrack too. My main gripe with the film is that there are plenty of arse shots of Jessica Alba and not enough of Paul Walker! Otherwise throughly (and somewhat mindlessly) enjoyable.",Into the Blue
66,leilapostgrad,Austin Movie Show review,2,10 October 2005,"Are you expecting to see lots of close-up shots of a near naked and very tanned Jessica Alba swimming underwater for two hours? If so, then you won't be disappointed by Into the Blue. In fact, if you're expecting nothing more than to watch a bunch of very toned and tanned bodies swimming underwater for two hours, then you won't be disappointed either. You'll only be disappointed if you expect to be entertained. I was bored by god I was bored! Jessica Alba plays Sam, a shark-loving scuba diver who spends her sun-filled days swimming in the glistening Caribbean Sea with her equally-tanned-and-toned boyfriend Jared (Paul Walker). While looking for buried treasure, they come across a sunken airplane filled with cocaineand wackiness ensues. Yes, there are hot people to look at, but looks will only take you so far, and an hour ""Into the Blue"" and you're going to start wishing for an interesting and captivating story line.

When they find out Jared has found it, the hunt begins...'Into the Blue' really tries to be a movie. It's not mindless dumb movie energy you'd expect from watching the trailer. Jessica Alba and Paul Walker give convincing performances, and Scott Caan provides some much needed comic relief. The unique thing about this scuba flick is the footage is simply stunning. Nearly every shot in this film is beautiful, above or under water. And I'm not just referring to the camera pans up and down buff bodies. To put it simply, the writer and director knew what the target audience was looking for... and they deliver a little bit more.

This review also panned the director for ""crazy/beautiful"" and ""Blue Crush."" Much has been made of Jessica Alba and Ashley Scott in bikinis. As if that's a bad thing. Sheesh. What can I say. I thought it was a great blue water action flick myself. And I liked ""crazy/beautiful"" and ""Blue Crush.""Into the Blue has great scenery, great cinematography, beautiful Caribbean setting, and splendid action. If you liked the old James Bond flicks with the same setting (think Dr No) and if you like things like Blue Crush and for that matter if you like the old Sea Hunt series (with Lloyd Bridges) and if you like the (modern version) of the Titanic ... I think you'll like this flick.There was a LOT more action, frankly, than I had anticipated in this movie. The drug-smuggling / underwater struggles / etc were for me a wonderful throwback to Dr No and Sea Hunt. The beautiful beach bum scenes were wonderful throwbacks to Blue Crush and the beach blanket movies of the sixties. The treasure hunt / salvage features were wonderful tastes of the same kind of thing in Titanic and the like. This all makes for a good mixed genre movie that I think did it's job very well indeed: great entertainment!",Into the Blue

The main characters (Jared, Bryce, Amanda and Sam) are all very convincing. While the story might not be the newest or most exciting thing to happen to mankind, it's filled with suspense, and, without revealing the ending, I'll strongly recommend you to expect the unexpected.

She makes the film what it is - a total tossfest!This is the kind of movie you watch when the wife goes out shopping and you cannot find your porn.

Into The Blue stars Paul Walker and the sexy Jessica Alba as two lovers. I had a feeling that Into the Blue would be a good film overall. I remember seeing the first trailer of the movie, and it didn't make it seem like the movie was a thriller. It made the movie seem like it just just some romantic film. Probably the studio knew it wasn't gonna work out because the movie is an action thriller, so they made a different trailer to make it more exciting. I wanted to watch it because it did look good.Into the Blue is Jessica Alba's third movie to be released in the year 2005 (Sin City, Fantastic 4 and Into the Blue. Her sexiness just keeps rising in each of her movies. She should do more bigger movies. I was also shocked when I found out Into the Blue made less than 6 million dollars in its opening weekend at the box office. I had high expectations for this movie, but I guess I was wrong.Into the Blue is really not a bad movie. It's a great action thriller. There are absolutely no boring scenes in this movie. If you want to rent a movie, I suggest that you rent this. Some might say it's a bad movie and some might say it's good. America's Trusted Critic Roger Ebert gave this movie a ""Thumbs Up!""

If it isn't, it sure resembled it a lot. Paul Walker and Jessica Alba are two money challenged treasure hunters, who spend most of their spare time diving and laying around on Walker's rundown boat. When the two of them and a couple of their over zealous friends discover an abandoned plane filled with cocaine, they get in some hot water when a couple of them try to make a score with the local baddies to fund a bigger treasure find.""Into the Blue"" has plenty to look at. The Bahamas are beautiful, the stars are all looking good, and its obvious that Jessica Alba is in really good shape. Plenty of eye candy for everyone. The plot is pretty predictable and there are lots of continuity errors. The acting isn't that great either. However, I've seen a lot worse. I've always wanted to scuba dive and find buried treasure as well as go to the Bahamas. I guess I was living vicariously through the actors in this. This is no masterpiece, but it's a good rental.

80,BrigitteD,Into the bore.,2,12 October 2005,"""Into the Blue"" is a fall release that tries desperately hard to keep a firm grasp on a season gone by with its depiction of sand and surf. Looking like a pilot episode for the WB's newest teen prime time soap opera, this film showcases a cast of attractive people and their physical attributes, since any acting capabilities on their part are pretty much absent.Set in the Bahamas, Jared (Paul Walker) is a renowned beach bum and recently unemployed lifeguard. Keeping him company is sexy girlfriend Samantha (Jessica Alba), who works as a shark handler at a marine exhibit. Jared aspires to make a fortune as a treasure hunter, a quest which is further pursued when his friend Bryce (Scott Caan) and his party girl love interest, Amanda (Ashley Scott) join the team.Thus begins the group's underwater exploration which leads them to two discoveries, a legendary shipwreck containing an abundance of gold, as well as a downed cargo plane filled with bundles of cocaine.The foursome then finds itself in a moral dilemma that involves claiming their bounty of wealth, which would also mean exposing the stash of drugs. Their plans are further complicated when a rival treasure hunter (Josh Brolin) and some drug smugglers become involved, both looking for their own piece of the prize.As consenting viewers, we have to sit through endless sequences of deep diving and bickering before we finally get to the confrontation with the bad guys, and by that point, we don't really much care anymore. Until then, the film attempts to keep us interested with its visual aspects of aquatic creatures, as well as its human life forms.The latter is depicted to great effect with its appreciative, if not perverse lingering shots of bikini-clad buttocks. Jessica Alba whose most recent work was in two comic book inspired projects, further extends to this film, since her character here is once again nothing but the rough draft of a caricature.From a female perspective, Paul Walker is easy to look at, but his acting is nothing memorable, as he once again stands in as the pretty boy in the center of an action canvas.Rounding up the set of adventurers, are Caan and Scott whose reckless and impulsive behavior dims any smart judgment they might have. Then again, it's doubtful they had much in the first place.""Into The Blue"" could be best compared to a useless day at the beach, minus the water-clogged sandals and sunburn, but bottom line, this is one treasure that is better left undiscovered.",Into the Blue
81,asalem182,Is it silly? Yes. Is it original? No. Can Paul Walker Act? Not at all. Is it very entertaining? YOU BET,8,23 December 2005,"Into the Blue was an entertaining movie, nothing more, nothing less. Just make sure to check your brain at the door and you'll have a good time.Into the Blue tells the story of four divers, Jared (Paul Walker), Sam (Jessica Alba), Bryce (Scott Caan), and Amanda (Ashley Scott), who discover a shipwreck AND a plane containing 800 kilos of Cocaine at the bottom of the sea. I told you it was silly.Despite the stupid plot, there was a lot to like about Into the Blue. The movie has really nice underwater shots, where you could see amazing looking fish. The cinematography was great too. And then there were some really cool Jet Ski stunts, and an entertaining car chase. The fights were nicely executed, and more violent than I expected. The movie had some funny scenes and one of the best soundtracks I've heard this year. Also, there's eye candy for all the boys and girls out there (the 4 leads in the tiniest swimsuits). I have to wonder why Sony decided to release ItB in the middle of the fall while it screams SUMMER FUN.Enjoying the movie mainly depends on the viewer's ability to ignore its flaws. And frankly, there are some flaws here. There are plot holes (near the end of the movie, Jared jumps into the water handcuffed, and the next shot, the handcuffs are gone). The acting was awful too. I was one of the ten people on the planet who didn't jump on the ""I hate Paul Walker"" bandwagon, but I have to admit he was horrible here. He almost made me laugh in two of his ""dramatic"" scenes. Alba was almost as bad as Walker, but she wasn't given much to do in the first place. In fact, Scott Caan is the only cast member who gave a decent performance.So, I'd recommend Into the Blue, but only if you're looking for 2 hours of entertainment.

That's about it.Somewhere between the crotch and pex shots lurks a story concerning two couples' discovery of sunken treasures: the multi-million dollar bounty of a legendary shipwreck and a drug trafficker's submerged airplane loaded with kilos of cocaine.The Coppertoned leads are certainly easy on the eyes during the opening travelogue passages, but when it comes to the business of acting Alba and Walker can't stay afloat. Walker is best grinning and baring it while Alba's method appears to be an uncanny ability to nod along with each syllable she pronounces.Couple #2 consists of a taller, blonder version of Ms. Alba (Ashley Scott) who, unlike the sexless sex goddess doesn't mind appearing topless in long shot. Not since ""Young Guns"" has a film assembled a cast of second-generation talent. Scott Caan seems to have gotten the role of hotheaded party boy Bryce cause his old man played Sonny Corleone. Following in the dynastic footprints of Danny Baldwin and Chris Penn, Caan is another thick-necked ape who, when given a chance, provokes little more than unintentional laughs.The villain in the piece is played by Josh Brolin, son of James Streisand. If only Josh put as much force into acting as he did into (allegedly) smacking around real-life spouse Diane Lane. Rounding out the family affair behind the lens is director John Stockwell, son of ""Blue Velvet's"" Dean Stockwell.

That image of her magnificent body outstretched with her arm reaching out for a shark is one of the most memorable cinematic images ever. I swear I could spend an entire week on a liveonboard watching this on repeat.There is probably no chance of her doing this sort of dangerous stunts like this again, thanks to her fame. The insurance premium could sink a battleship.The plot is about as believable as Brokeback Mountain - but it doesn't claim any pretensions - it is what it is.

I was pleased to see that (a) she spends the whole film with very little clothing on and (b) it was actually a pretty good )albeit formulaic and a bit predictable) movie.Basically, Samantha's boyfriend/fiancé whatever is some sort of treasure hunter/salvage guy, trying to get his damaged boat going again, because in the area that they live there's rumored to be sunken treasure. The b/f's (I think) brother comes to down, along with a dangerous looking girl he just met.

But sometimes movies suck so bad and are so predictable that giving the movie a thoughtful review is not fair to me because the people who created the movie didn't think about you so why should I give them the same consideration. So, I will say that the only reason to see this movie is Jessica Alba and her body.So Paul Walker(Fast and the Furious) does a bad job portraying Jared, a loser who pretty much has nothing to live for except a sinking boat and a delusional, yet very hot girlfriend named Sam, played by Jessica Alba (Fantastic Four.) Both of them along with two incredibly stupid friends go treasure hunting, since they are in the Bahamas, that's what people do, and may have found a 200 year old sunken ship. Oh, and a airplane that crashed in the water with enough Cocaine to fill Robert Downy Jr.'s prescription for life. So the four have to fight the drug smugglers, other treasure hunters, and corrupt policemen, who all work for each other by the way, to try and get this sunken ship. Wee! Yes, well, this movie sucks. Speaking of sucking, let's talk about Paul Walker for a second. I have seen things floating in a toilet bowl that act better than him. I was so tired of seeing close-ups of his incredibly cut body that I was violently ill, and that was after the first five minutes.The only redeeming thing about this movie is that for at least three quarters of the movie, Jessica Alba is in a bikini, and there are some shots of her underwater that make me think that the only way you can see more of her skin is if she does a nude scene in a movie, or you are dating her. The director must have known that she was his only commodity and he used it well.The script is so ridiculous and unbelievable that I just can't talk about it in a positive way so I won't talk about it at all. Safe to say that I can't imagine writer Matt Johnson doing another movie ever again. By the way, this is the same ass that wrote the incredibly horrible movie Torque. That should tell you how bad this movie is and how unbelievable the story became.To sum up, movie sucks, Paul Walker sucks, and Jessica Alba continues to be ultra hot. This movie will be in my collection, once it hits a pawn shop and I can get it for $4, and I will just fast forward to the scenes with Alba swimming in the ocean. However, if you don't find her attractive, I suggest you go get circumcised because that will make your life just as rewarding as watching this movie. ***This review and others can be seen at www.bbmc.dockratent.com**",Into the Blue
92,Lord_Frog,Average. Impressive shark footage though,5,7 March 2006,"Nothing to call home about. This is the kind of movie that you will forget a few hours after watching it. It starts OK but descends quickly in familiar thriller territory, nothing we haven't seen before... This is actually quite similar to ""the Deep"", but more fun and sexier. Forgettable as well. But I loved the sharks! If I were you I'd wait until it plays on TV or something. It's OK but not worth spending cash on it. There's surely a better film in the video shop.

It's hard to work out whether Jessica Alba really is as bad an actress as she appears in a few scenes here, or whether it's down to the appallingly bad dialogue and script she's been given. Every cliché in the book is here - car chases, evil drug barons (oh guess what, he has a British accent!), idiot friends who get people into trouble, endless underwater fights, unbelievably moral and ethical hero who's supposedly so poor he can't rub two pennies together but turns up in every scene wearing a shiny new designer t-shirt... well you get the drift.One expects such unbelievable nonsense from Hollywood fare I guess, but somehow the whole thing is so leaden, predictable and just plain dull I found myself wanting to press the ""fast forward"" button after suffering through the first hour. It's one of those movies that you feel you've already seen 100 times - only last time it was faster, slicker and more interesting! Action sequences underwater don't really work without sound, and the soundtrack constantly distracts instead of enhancing the on-screen ""action"".If it's on TV with nothing else on the other stations then it might be worth a watch.

Alba's not a great actress either though...she's seemed to settle into the stereotype of ""looks good on screen, so doesn't have to act"", the same thing that happened to Drew Barrymore. Her earlier work, and Dark Angel were so much better than her recent film work. The supporting cast was even worse!

(Caan and Brolin are only in films because of having powerful fathers in the business) Poorly written, almost no continuity, boring for extended periods, many scenes should have been cut shorter, very little realism (Even experienced divers need to breathe, and in that first treasure finding scene, all 4 didn't bother to go up for air hardly ever, including the 2 ""cityfolk"" who were afraid of the sharks), obvious studio tanks in supposed underwater scenes, etc. If I listed all the problems with this film, I'd be here all day...so if you were looking for a good treasure hunting film like I was, just know not to bother seeing this film.

This of course leads to problems when they try to inadvertently sell it back to its owner, who of course takes umbrage and threatens to kill them.The first 2/3 of the movie is only six pack abs and good looking people in tiny bikinis, swimming underwater. Don't get me wrong, I appreciated Jessica Alba as much as anyone, but a good story and some adequate pacing would have been nice. The story doesn't really pick up until after they recover some of the drugs, and by then, most viewers will be bored.

Not even Jessica Alba's half-nude rear end could come remotely close to saving this disaster of a movie. OK, a few nice underwater shots, but I've seen far better in many other movies and in documentaries, also in amateur footage shot around Bermuda, for example. This film exhibits high-school style direction, bad acting, a silly ""plot"", boring scenes, and dull dialogue.

I should say that I am a diver an even that aspect of the movie wasn't enough to save the movie for me.Lets list the faults:1. It is almost impossible to feel sympathetic for the main characters. Two of them have objection personalities and two are just stupid. 2. It takes a million years before it gets into the story...I may be exaggerating. 3. Relys too much on beautiful scenery rather than and actually having a storyline. 4. The characters talked like a hybrid of a preppy and beach bum. It might suit the characters but it is no less annoying. 5. There is almost zero suspense, it is not only predictable but poorly timed. 6. Hollywood ending.

He is a very strong actor in the traditional sense and his natural on screen charisma is appealing to both guys and the young women/teenage girls audience who will like this type of movie. He obviously got into great physical shape for Into The Blue and his acting is very convincing and he's also tough in character for the role which his fans will also appreciate. He has solid on screen chemistry with Jessica Alba and they look very good together as a young couple in love. Overall the script really works well and is a combination of romance, drama, mystery, action and adventure. Plus on location shots in the Caribbean also add to the excellent cinematography.

Aside from that and it being really cute to watch together I can't give it a really stellar rating. I would have lost all interest about halfway through the movie when it hit a standstill trying to set up dramatic tension between the paper thin characters. It is also a very pretty movie with the setting in someplace I would love to go vacation along with gratuitous underwater scenes. This is the other thing that broke my suspension of disbelief, they are under water for way too long! Even with the professional diver background it seems like it was an unrealistically long amount of time between breathes, which is fine, but then the element of drowning is put into play later.

Still, the setback was eminent. Except for some nice scuba diving underwater scenes (i.e. good-looking actors with very little clothing), it is really much to this film at all. You get the same feeling you get when you watch a 60's and 70's James Bond movie, although this film has more stupid plot-twists, poorer script and less excessive fights: You pretty much know what you will get. Though, in this case, you don't necessarily get very much of what you are expecting. Every character is a crook (at least to some extent), but the good guys win regardless of the odds. Although the definition of ""good guys"" is somewhat floating (pun intended, sort of) throughout the entire move.The characters speak a whole lot about their actions and its consequences. In the end, none of it seems to matter. Ultimately, what is good and what is bad? Who cares, as long as you can show Jessica Alba in her bikini and Paul Walker in his Speedo. Right?",Into the Blue
106,Spellvexit,Well-paced fun,8,8 October 2005,"I was astonished at the dismal rating for this film, which at the time of this writing was 4.8. Into the Blue never demonstrated any pretense of becoming the next academy award winner, and instead faithfully executed its focus -- beautiful ocean scenery, beautiful bodies, and a significant degree of tension and action to carry the plot. I found the characters believable, especially given the target audience of the movie: the dialog was fairly cleverly humorous, but serious when it needed to be; the characters were adequately conceived, including the intentionally unlikeable 4th party woman who ""wasn't family."" Most of all, I enjoyed the pacing of the movie. Some slow underwater scenes were accompanied by peaceful music belying the increasingly perilous situations the characters found themselves in. Halfway through the movie, the tension never fully dissipates, as each event flows into the next as the stakes rise. The badguys are dealt with intelligently, and there are enough twists to convincingly carry the instability and danger of the situation.I went into this movie wanting to enjoy it, and I wasn't disappointed. Though its premise wasn't the most intellectual of premises, I don't feel as if it were dumbed down as much as many action movies do, and instead carried out is plot with due respect given its expectations. I'd recommend this movie as a good post-summer adventure flick!",Into the Blue
107,culmo,"Watch ""The Deep"" Instead",5,11 April 2020,"Spoilers ahead, yes.The premise here is that a drug plane has crashed off Nassau and the main cast of characters stumble upon it while looking for treasure. Paul Walker plays the loser with no bright future who is looking for a quick find that will allow him and his hot girlfriend (Alba) to not have to worry about actually working real jobs. Walker has no real plan here ... and he can't even go to sea until his connected friend (Caan) arrives with some hottie he met at a club the night before. Caan plays some sort of defense lawyer and one of his clients had a mansion in the Bahamas that he used for payment ... eh, all right...
Oh, and the mansion comes with a speedboat. Great timing, right?So they all go out diving ... free diving at extreme depths and for long periods of time ....
Seriously, don't go free diving like these fools do. You ... will ... die. At one point, they free dive INSIDE the sunken airplane. Uh, no, you do not enter a wreck you haven't thoroughly checked out, and you most definitely do not go FREE-DIVING inside a strange wreck.Uh, anyway.Yeah, they discover both the remnants of a shipwreck and the drug plane. There's some moral dilemma stuff--do they tell the cops, do they try to sell the cocaine ... it's tired and predictable and there mostly just to pad the runtime.Long story short, the 4some of idiots end up having to get the drugs for the drug dealers or else. The hottie from the club ends up dead from a shark attack, and Josh Brolin turns out to be the actual drug kingpin ... because that makes sense.This is a poor ripoff of ""the Deep."" It's the same premise ... treasure hunters looking for a sunken ship stumble upon a cache of drugs and must contend with the dealers. The Deep is far superior to this mess.Let's talk character motivation.
Hottie from the Club: She apparently likes cocaine and convinces Scott Caan to try and sell some of it.
Speaking of Caan, in one scene he is talking about how to cut out his hottie girlfriend from the money they will make from the treasure. In the very next scene he is doing the typical jealous boyfriend routine. His character does whatever the plot needs him to do in order to advance things.
Jessica Alba is the moral center of the group, always knowing what is right and pretty much there to show off her ... eh, assets.
Walker is the morally gray person. He's a hard luck sort of guy with a heart of gold ... and like most poorly-created heroes, he is able to one-up the bad guys at every turn.
Josh Brolin ... treasure hunter turned drug kingpin? Eh, all right. the excuse is that investors don't like it when treasure hunters return empty-handed. Yeah, I'm also sure investors don't want to get involved in a highly-illegal trade too, but whatever.Don't watch this movie if you want a good story and fascinating characters.Watch this movie for the reasons intended: underwater shots, nice scenery, and eh ... the T&A.

There was absolutely no chemistry between Jessica Alba and Paul Walker. The acting was definitely not the cream of the crop.For whatever it's worth, Paul Walker does look extremely hot and for those who would like to see Jessica Alba in a bikini, go for it and spend ten dollars. Otherwise, with the exception of a few surprises, the movie was well below par. I only rated it higher than a 2 was because Paul Walker was hot in it.",Into the Blue

And who came up with these characters: a dive bum, an ethical hottie, a coke whore, and (this tops the list) a lawyer who can't read Latin, is broke, and wants to sell cocaine.A contrived premise and unrealistically bad decisions being made by the characters made my wife and I both squirm in discomfort as one bad decision was made after another.That being said, the movie started out pleasantly slow, spending enough time to develop the characters (although they were cardboard thin) and establish the beautiful location and the premise of the plot. Things were moving along ""swimmingly"" and then WHAM - major action and major drama. Beautiful cinematography and plenty of gratuitous T&A (Jess Alba is simply yummy - in revealing low-cut bikini). Some of the underwater scenes show her bikini riding up to become a thong - delicious. It's unfortunate that Alba plays second fiddle to the male players.Some shocking moments, an interesting twist and a few surprises lead to an ""edge of your seat"" climax.

123,j-streutker75,Into the Blue rather not,3,2 May 2006,Into the blue is as shallow as the sea their diving in and that's about 6 meters or so. I thought finally an exciting movie featuring the wonderful sport of scuba diving but unfortunately i did not turn out that way. Into the blue is just a series of underwater shots and )(sometimes a scene with your typical good and bad guy to keep the story going) of beautiful people swimming holding their breath for way to long. Further more ascends and descends our male hero into the deep blue see far to often in a row which according to my own scuba education contributes to the Bens which can cause major injuries and even death after the cave which also features divers this is yet again a disappointment.

124,chris60,Better than average treasure hunt adventure with humor and awe-striking undersea photography.,8,10 October 2005,"""Into the Blue"" is a tropically set treasure-hunt thriller, rife with drug smuggling gangsters, which focuses on an ethical quagmire. Paul Walker's character, Jared, tries to maintain personal integrity while facing greed and others affected by it. For divers, this movie is very nearly almost the movie that gets it relatively right. The scuba- related incidents involve oversights that no open water diver should make, but in the grip of greed, are passably believable. Sharks get the most realistic representation in any fictional movie to date, behaving as fish and not bloodthirsty monsters. (Of the dozens that surround the actors in many scenes, only two were CGI.)Of special note is Peter Zuccarini's outstanding underwater photography: the best yet in an undersea adventure movie. The lighting and color are entirely natural, and give the non- diver an authentic feel of what it's like below the surface. The sense of awe when encountering a wreck is genuinely conveyed, and I commend the actors for emoting effectively through their dive masks. So much is being made about the beautiful cast that I expect some will dismiss the film as a skin flick with beaches and fish. To support their point, they'll likely fixate so entirely on Ms. Alba and Mr. Walker's hindquarters that they'll miss the rest. A pity. There's a readily enjoyable adventure waiting here.",Into the Blue

The diving scenes are rather beautiful, and one cannot deny the beautification increasing effect of Alba in a bikini swimming by the camera.But after a while the movie devolves into A1 formula action. Not necessarily a bad thing, and it's kind of well done, except when the fight sequences show three (or was it two?) fights between different people cut together. I for one could not follow the events on the screen.All that however fades into insignificance beside the monumental stupidity displayed by the movie's hero, Jared. He makes one awful decision after another - alienating his girlfriend while failing to inform her she's threatened by a gangster, giving up the secret treasure for no good reason, abandoning said girlfriend to dive into the sea with his hands tied behind his back to randomly destroy the drug shipment that might keep the gangster happy and so on.

The underwater cinematography was amazing - totally worth the matinée price and cheaper than diving- the kind of film you need the bigscreen to enjoy. Sure I love much more clever crafted films , but for the MTV generation this film had just enough, maybe the fact that I am an ocean person, have a thing for treasure, the romance of lost properties and jessica alba- i was totally enjoying it. I thought the casting was great- sure Paul really cant act, but he reminded of more than a handful of people I went to highschool with - so I could believe it- his obnxious pompous buddy was classic and some of the underlying subplots of human greed are so universal that I actually felt something for these morons. The real star is the ocean here and the good guy/ bad guy looked like my step brother and fit the bill. Anyhow i doubt this film will do very little justice on a small screen, but overall the script was solid and the sea animal work was mind blowing.

134,bladeforger,Enjoyable movie but not Bogotá,8,17 May 2006,"This was a very enjoyable movie. Paul Walker is a great hero-type and will probably become one of the next stars that they ladies drool over. Jessica Alba performs splendidly and the shots of her swimming underwater are worth the rental by themselves. Ashley Scott turns in a very convincing performance in her role as the disgusting little tramp we want to rescue from herself.The biggest disappointment was the opening scene supposedly set in Bogotá. It's a tropical setting in the movie. I've been there, and Bogotá isn't tropical--it's 2,600 meters above sea level and occupies part of a huge mountain plain up in the Andes Mountains... where the only reason it isn't covered with snow is the proximity to the Equator. Picture Colorado Springs or Winter Park, Colorado. Move it south a bit to delete the snow. Add 10-12 million people. It's cold at night, reaching close to freezing, and mild during the day--sometimes in the 70's. You sleep under a pile of blankets, put on a coat in the morning, and take it off around noon. You keep the sweater and long pants ON. There are absolutely zero palm trees and not one alligator or crocodile. It's not the Amazon. Come on, Hollywood! Get the locations right! Another ""problem"" with the movie is all the free diving. Our band of merry divers goes traipsing all around with snorkel, mask, and fins. Some of the sequences would require vigorous activity on one breath for 3-5 minutes. I love the fantasy, but it's not very likely. Of course, neither is James Bond, so we can't count off much for that. Just don't try it at home.A big bonus for the movie is that it doesn't portray sharks too badly. Sam (Jessica Alba) works with sharks, tags them for later study, and dives with them. Thank you, Hollywood! Too much anti-shark prejudice and ignorance has allowed these necessary apex predators to become endangered.The plot is just twisty enough that you keep guessing who will be a bad guy/gal and who will turn out to be a good guy/gal.Finally, the underwater scenes are just lovely. If you dive or ever wanted to dive, you'll love it.",Into the Blue
135,CinephileMagazine,Into the Blue is a shallow mess,3,16 January 2006,"Let's be honest, there really wasn't much expectation for this movie to be good considering the cast and filmmaker involved. Even though the plot  about a group of young wannabe treasure hunters who stumble onto a buried 17th century pirate ship (next to a downed plane full of cocaine)  holds a lot of potential as an exciting action adventure, nothing of the outcome is anything other than a glossy advertisement for string bikinis and 6-week abdominal workouts. Everything Into the Blue attempts to achieve  from action, suspense, and God forbid, romance  fails miserably and is a testament to the quality of the screenplay and the actor's lack of charisma. It must be said though the film does look good; cinematography is rich and vibrant, and the underwater photography is clear and inviting which compensates for the ridiculously dull story that almost reaches an unforgivable two hour running time. Whereas movie like The Mummy and The Deep (which this borrows from) have the ability to remain a guilty pleasure for years to come Into the Blue fails even this small feat primarily due to the lack of story. To be blunt: nothing happens for almost 2/3rd of the movie; it's one long setup that goes absolutely nowhere with scene after scene seemingly used to show Paul Walker's abs and Jessica Alba's ass. Well, if you're a shallow moviegoer who appreciates this type of in-your-face eye candy and doesn't want to be bothered with conventions like plot, story and strong characters, then this is the type of movie is for you.

It's sad to see such a soulless movie trying to use aesthetics like the paradise it's shot in and it's lead characters to mislead the audience into thinking this movie wasn't a waste of everything involved in the project, your money and your time. The writers thought something in the line of this to be original: I'm super talented but no one values my skills so I'm poor, but do have the hottest girl ever because I'm actually super talented. Let's add some drugs and some guns. Ooeeee, let's add a random bad guy who looks like a pirate because he's on a boat. You know what, let's add another crazy hot girl and this one guy who annoys the Tish out of everybody and who's predictable, bad decisions are easily foreseen by the audience not to make it too shocking for them. BAM, movie. How peculiar, a flop, who could've seen that coming. Jessica Alba + bikini, wow. Just wow. Why can't she just be in a few proper movies, in bikini.

Worth a watch!",8,26 October 2005,"I'd read about this film and seen the trailer and knew I would see it even after I read all the damning reviews people have written.For the first hour, it's easy to see why people might get bored, there's a lot of character and story building going on and besides the diving there isn't a lot else going on action-wise. Personally, I am quite into diving so for me the appeal was there. It was quite odd for me as after an hour I had found myself totally immensed in the story and unaware of anything else happening in the cinema around me! After the first hour things really start hotting up and the action begins. Without giving too much away the climax is just about right in terms of time although Jared's summary of who is crossing or double-crossing who was rather too brief and quick for me. Never mind, we all knew who was the bad guy anyway. And so after the climax is the finale and it's predictable stuff sure, but I'm all for a happy ending (hey, who isn't?!).I summary, I would recommend this to anyone 25 or under really.

Oh yeah, and no explanation is ever given for her seeming soft spot toward the 'treasure finder' in the beginning of the film? - or maybe she was meant to love everybody ;) Anyway, aside from that...

150,fotofilm,Beautiful underwater,6,25 December 2006,"It's an okay action movie, with beautiful underwater shots.Jared (Paul Walker) and Sam (Jessica Alba) is a gorgeous couple living in the Caribbean. They have a wealth of love of each other, but not much of anything else. Sam's trying to make a moderate contribution to her household by working in a water-themed park; while Jared's just fired from his diving-instructor job. They're struggling to make ends meet. One day Jared's buddy Bryce (Scott Caan), and his newest girlfriend Amanda (Ashley Scott) come for a holiday. While having a great time diving, they come across two 'treasures'. One is a very old sunken ship full of treasures and the other one is a sunken airplane full of cocaine. Although they're not that interested in the cocaine, their finding of it attracts unwanted heat from the underworld, the drug dealers. So they can't just pick up their ship, they have to deal with these no-holds-barred criminals first.The set (the sea) is so beautiful and the actors swim like fish (I wish I can swim half as good). A big part of the movie is shot either on water or underwater. I never saw underwater cinematography as pretty as this.As for the action, storyline, acting, and the rest although they're not bad, there's nothing special either. I also think the movie's too long and I wish they show more (sexiness) of Jessica Alba.",Into the Blue
151,alldevilgirl,Writing my college essay would have been more fun...,2,27 September 2005,"I cannot possibly fathom why anyone could enjoy this movie, or think that it is ""overall great"". This was an atrocity, an abomination, and pretty much a waste of my time. I understand that an entertaining movie doesn't need to have some sort of cinematic credentials to be amusing and fun to watch: but this movie was just... bad. It was a reason to show Jessica Alba and Paul Walker pretty much naked. I imagine the casting decision went something like this: ""Who would look the best in their swimwear for the entire movie? Oh, and make sure they're incompetent enough as actors to accept the role."" I know this critique may sound harsh, but it is undoubtedly one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It rivals only the awfulness of Gigli and Glitter. Granted, I laughed during much of the movie, but I'm not quite sure that was what the director was going for. If my friends hadn't been there to entertain and laugh with me, I don't think I could have stayed awake for the entire movie. I saw this as a preview and, thankfully, it was free. And yet, I still want a refund. And now to write the essay that would have been written if it were not for the abomination of this movie. Oh, and for a quick plot synopsis for those of you who are curious: Jessica Alba and Paul Walker are a poor but desperately happy couple who discover a plane full of cocaine - in close proximity to this plane they find various types of buried treasure, leading them to suspect that an infamous ship/treasure is somewhere in the area. But, of course, being poor, they don't have the means or equipment to properly search for the ship - but his arch-nemesis does. Chaos ensues from there on in... I think you get the picture. Some gore, random shark attacks, and corny dialogue are just some of the exciting things you'll witness. The end.",Into the Blue
152,project_x5,Not nearly as bad as you think,8,29 September 2005,"Into The Blue is surprisingly better than everyone is making it out to be. Don't go in expecting The English Patient, it's just a bit of summer fun. The plot is intriguing, original and even unpredictable. The acting was believable, and the photography was absolutely stunning. It's not as much of a 'thriller' as I would like it to be, but I definitely don't think anyone who goes in with the right mindset will be disappointed with this film.Into the Blue is a thriller set in the deep, shark-infested waters of the Bahamas. When four young divers discover a legendary shipwreck rumored to contain millions in gold at the bottom of the sea, they believe their dream of buried treasure has come true. But nearby on the ocean floor, a sunken plane full of cocaine threatens their find. The friends make a pact to keep quiet about both discoveries so they can excavate the shipwreck before a rival treasure hunter uncovers their secret and beats them to the gold. But their plan goes awry when they realize dangerous smugglers are already closing in on the missing plane, and one of the friends makes a fatal decision that quickly turns the treasure hunters into the hunted.Starring Jessica Alba and Paul Walker, this movie has something for everyone under 25, and shouldn't be passed up if you're simply looking for a fun night out.",Into the Blue
153,African_Safari_Guy,Body Double for supposed nipple oops??,7,21 December 2005,"With early DVD copy, I noticed Jessica Alba did ""most"" of the underwater scenes... Except for one stupid 5 second shot at the end where some guy pulls ""her"" back under water and cops a feel exposing a brief nipple.Pausing the DVD (as most guys will) I noticed that the actress in just this 3 seconds is a really thin flat chested double. Other things that give it away is the hair, eyebrows and nose.It had to be planned, because it wasn't a tough scene so Alba could have done it herself, like every other scene. It was only a couple of frames, so only pervs like myself would find it. I'm just baffled as to why they would go through the trouble of deception, and if Alba signed off on that planned hoax? Did they have to take several takes until the nipple was peaked?? No need to reply. I comment about once a year. I just needed to vent and expose the illusion.LOL",Into the Blue
154,miglmu,I'm filled with a vision of the ocean.,9,2 November 2005,"If you like crystal clear underwater scenery, life at a sunny shore and boating there is no way for you to miss this film. I watched it twice on a razor sharp big scope-screen to take in all the underwater details. The film takes every opportunity to put the likable characters under water, and this is what the film is all about. The beauty of the people in this simple adventure plot adds to the overall beauty of this film and is not a separate element as a lot of Jessica-Alba-in-bikini-blah-blah suggests. Let it put a smile on your face but let it not pop your eyes out. Along with that, pop songs, film music and sound effects are organically interwoven. The film consists of scenes and NOT of cheap fast cuts and hectic camera work, below and above surface. The filmmakers obviously liked and knew what they were doing. What I couldn't believe is that the same filmmakers also liked detailed scenes of unnecessary cruelty though not too explicit and only near the end. I learned from this and some harsh critics here that when you set a new standard of underwater-adventure you don't reach that part of the audience who only want the thrill of fears and killing and the clash of good vs. evil, because these people totally miss the beauty (and all the work that obviously went into achieving it) and feel bored. So why spoil a film with that in the first place? There are enough cruel thrillers out there. So go for all-adventure, anti-cynic. A step in the right direction and an honorable follow up to THE DEEP. Funny note: After the Columbia-logo during the credits I thought, who knows, perhaps this is the new THE DEEP (also Columbia), and THEN on the screen appeared the name of the executive producers including Peter Guber, the original producer of THE DEEP ;-) Similar in story and more important similar in care for detail to achieve a great underwater adventure.",Into the Blue
155,walkernet,This Ain't Shakespeare People! N2 The Blue is OK. Just.,5,29 September 2005,"Its placed in the Caribbean, and a laid-back islander with a sputtering sea-based enterprise and a girlfriend who is way too fine for him, and some flaky friends come upon some volatile buried treasure. But their find is further complicated by the discovery of some lost drugs, which some modern day pirates want back. Badly.Now if you've think you've seen this film before, you have, but it was called ""The Deep."" That 1980s film from the book by ""Jaws"" author Peter Benchley starred Nick Nolte, Jacqueline Bissette and Lou Gossett Jr. as the Caribbean baddie before ""An Officer and a Gentleman"" and when he started playing an old flying ace shepherding young hot shots in the ""Iron Eagle"" films.But this is the almost identical plot line for Into The Blue with ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" star Paul Walker, Alba, Scott Caan and Tyson Beckford as one of the Lou Gossett villains. Beckford's Primo owns a club in the Bahamas and gets into the mix when the criminals are only interested in getting back the planeload of cocaine that went down during a storm.Interpersonal tension is what keeps ""Into The Blue"" involving, and moving fast with little down time. It is the human dimension that makes stories interesting, and one of a struggling entrepreneur with a hot girlfriend who might get tired of his once-endearing quirkiness who is on the verge of a tremendous life-altering treasure is always interesting to an audience.""Into The Blue"" also has a hint of ""Carlito's Way"" about it as well when Jared's pal Bryce shows up, played by Scott Caan from ""Enemies of the State."" With probably more lines than he's had in any other film of his I've seen, Caan is here a criminal attorney and he's used to living the fast life with people who bend the law and pay him the big bucks to get them off.""Winners write their own rules"" Bryce tells Jarred. ""Losers play by them.""""The whole flip-flops and shorts on the wooden deck thing sounds okay now, but what about when you're the Fat Old Guy at the end of the bar, going on about how you lost the treasure to Bates?""Then Bryce starts to play on Jared's fears of losing Sam, about his raggedy boat, and not having more than $50 bucks at a time. That gets his attention as well it might!""How long do you think a woman like Sam is going to hang around for that?""""Sam's not like that"" counters Jarred.""They're all like that, bro.""Bryce tells him to be a Winner not a Loser. They can always turn in the plane later to the authorities after they pull up the legitimate treasure.""And in a few weeks we'll all be on the Discovery Channel!""Bryce is also something of a comic relief character, saying things we might be thinking. He refers to a tale of a former slave turned buccaneer as ""Okay, so that Snoop Dogg Pirate -- what's his name? -- he leaves this fortune, behind, right?""The tension under director John Stockwell is kept high, and there's lots of action topside and under the waves. Toss in some real water-born sharks here and there and betrayal and double-crossing and disappointments and it makes for a good time at ""Into The Blue.""The idea that lawlessness and piracy on the high seas still exists may be new to many but those of who are part time River Rats know of it well.The cinematography of ""Into The Blue"" is gorgeous, and no doubt due to the Second Unit Director P. Zuccarini. Second Unit directors are often used in technical and demanding work like period war films, when someone is needed with more in depth skills in aerial filming, or as here in sea filming. --kjw",Into the Blue

161,dethrow_drew,"Drugs, Treasure, and Chicks--What Else Do You Need",9,27 March 2006,"Into The Blue is one of the better adventure films that I have seen in the last year or so. Innocent locals of the Bahamas, Jared(Paul Walker) and Sam(Jessica Alba) team up with their vacationing friend Bryce(Scott Caan) and his new found partner Amanda(Ashley Scott) to find some multimillion dollar treasure that has possible been brought to the surface by the recent storm. In the meantime, they happen to stumble upon another treasure, a downed airplane that was trafficking cocaine to the island. They encounter the tough decision of cashing in on the Zephyr, the ancient ship they uncover, or the equally valuable but dangerous cocaine. After the drug dealer finds out about their discovery, Jared must decide between the love of his life or fame and fortune.Director John Stockwell makes it hard to recognize the real theme of Into the Blue. It is not about the drugs and hidden treasure they uncover. I am disappointed to say that it is about the strength of love. A person really has to watch it to see what I mean, but the relationship of Jared and Sam is night and day difference with Bryce and Amanda. They really portray this as they make it through the adversities of the film. The other couple really lets out the vibe that they are just on a fling in the Bahamas, and they could care less if the other one died.An awesome perk of this film for all the guys out there is the swimsuit shots of Jessica Alba and Ashley Scott. You really need to see the film to appreciate the incredible underwater camera work. I am would be willing to bet that the person behind the camera was a red-blooded American man. And there is something for the ladies to. Paul Walker probably is shirtless for about seventy-five percent of the film.

For these reasons, please watch this movie on a wide flat screen !

One man who does this down in the Bahamas is known Jared (Paul Walker) and beautiful girlfriend Sam (Jessica Alba) assist him. While working on his piece of junk boat, Jared's best friend Bryce (Scott Caan) shows up from the United States to visit with a girl named Amanda (Ashley Scott). Jared's biggest competitor is Mr. Bates (Josh Brolin) who has a ton of money. Jared, Sam, Bryce and Amanda came across a sunken plane, with over 100 million dollars worth of drugs while diving. Jared did not want to sell the drugs or turn in the plane until they found the Zephler. Legend has it that the man driving the ship over 150 years ago abandoned it because of the love of a woman. The ship is said to have over 50 million dollars worth of treasure in it. Bryce and Amanda go to dive for the drugs, and then turn in the drugs. The owner of the drugs called Jared to come help bail Bryce and Amanda out. It is then that Mr. Bates is discovered as the drug's owner and tries to get their location from Jared. Jared and his friends manage to fight off Bates and find the Zephler. Jared then realizes the real treasure in life.The 2005 film Into the Blue director John Stockwell gets the message across that there is a greater treasure to life than gold and ancient objects. He uses the story of the Zephler legend to show that true love is more important than some old treasure worth millions. Life is not complete without friends and loved ones to take our problems to or just to be around. Mr. Stockwell makes great note of that through this brilliant film.When asked about how successful somebody's life is, people tend to talk about how much money they make, how fancy their career is, and all their luxury items. The people who think this way need to wake up and think about more important things than material items. Love and friendship surpasses all money and luxury items, because without friends and loved ones who is there to share our wealth with.

The baddies are all one-dimensional dummies who appear to have no brains. Whereas Jessica and Walker's characters try to so hard to be good Samaritans that it's nauseating.I always thought Jessica Alba was the worst at her profession. But Paul Walker seemingly does the impossible, he actually does WORSE than Jessica! You'd think Jess was Julia Roberts after witnessing Paul Walker's performance. Seeing him try to threaten someone in this movie was enough to make me cringe. Scott Caan's performance was way over the top, epitomizing the term ""overacting"".The reason most want to see this movie is because of Jessica Alba in a bathing suit. Sure, she looks good in the movie. But there really isn't as much cleavage as you think. If all you want is Jessica, then your better off drooling over her dance scene in Sin City as you would here.In conclusion, Into the Blue is a horrible and forgettable movie, with a predictable script and atrocious acting.

I nearly puke every time I see or hear a bad review of Into the Blue. There is nothing not to like about it. Each character has his/her own personality, so I have no clue why anyone says the character development doesn't meet ""their standards."" Then tell me this: If the character development isn't up to their standards, then why was I able to make out that there was a laid back dive bum with his lover, and a funny, sometimes crazy man who worries about treasure and money nonstop, with his lover who shares the same goal? That's right, you can't prove me wrong because you know absolutely nothing about movies, people who didn't like this flick.I am a hardcore diver myself, and I can tell you that I've never felt more related to a character in my life from a movie. Now, keep telling yourselves that the character development is bad, if it raises your self-esteem.Also, I've heard that this movie is at times boring. I literally stand in shock when I hear this, because it is absolute garbage. I may be one of the biggest admirers of the ocean and her beauty, and the mysteries she holds for us. The turquoise Bahama color in the ocean is among the best visual that I've ever seen on screen. The dives that the characters make are just amazing to watch, and no, I could care less about all those people drooling over Jessica Alba. I paid little attention to her in the water unlike most people, because I took time to admire the picturesque setting in the water. These dives are just magnificent. I've seen the flick about four times, and I still can't get enough.CLOSING COMMENTS: Anyone who doesn't like this movie, you don't know about the ocean, and probably don't even know how to swim for that matter. Anyone who has ever been diving like the characters in the movie have knows exactly what I'm talking about. Don't submit a comment when you can't appreciate the ocean. All you one out of ten people, go diving, and I'm sure there will be 10/10 on for your rating next time.I've also heard people talk bad about the story. People, get real. The story is fun to follow, and is an intelligent filler to all of the sights of the ocean.Now lets talk about the ending. Of course I'm not going to tell it to you, but I will say that it is one of the best movie endings that I've ever seen. It just has one of those Bob Marley type feel good endings, and above all, I felt almost sad while I had a smile on my face because the movie ended.Basically, the only reason not to see this movie is because of the fear of it ending.THE OCEAN IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PLACE ON EARTH, AND ANYONE WHO EVEN GIVES THIS MOVIE A NINE OUT OF TEN SHOULD GET A CLUE.

Perfect casting for the roles with beach babes Jessica Alba and Paul Walker, but the problems they faced seemed far too unreal and distracted me too much from the sea-scape.

But I walked out of this flick after the fourth gratuitous shot of her super-flat tummy writhing under water. I even sat through the underwater wedgies (and believe me, there's enough to please even the most hardened critic).No idea how the plot unfolded or whether or not they all lived whatever was supposedly chasing them; I couldn't stomach more than twenty minutes of this movie. We know she's hot. We know Paul Walker was carved out of marble in some back-alley Italian studio. Could we please all move on now? The best part of this whole 'film' was my cinnamon soft pretzel, and even then I couldn't enjoy it, knowing that the stars of this movie probably haven't seen such carbs in YEARS.So my twenty-minute review: nice abs, Jess.

180,chris6249,"""Into The Blue""",6,26 December 2005,"""Into The Blue"" is a good movie for one of those night's where you have nothing else to do but to watch movies. Don't get me wrong, it's not a terrible movie, it is just not what i expected. From the trailer it looked like this was going to be a good action / thriller. I was wrong. For the first 45 minutes it focuses on a diving instructor (Walker) and his girlfriend (Alba), who have friends visiting and search for treasure under the ocean. They find a crashed plane under the water, loaded with cocaine. It leads you to believe that finally it is going to get suspenseful in this part of the movie...wrong. After some more treasure hunting and leaving the whole plane / drug find on hold, at about 1 hour and 15 minutes in the movie is where the plot comes into play. They have to get the drugs from the plane to the drug dealer in 12 hours. Now instead of doing that right away they keep going treasure hunting for about another 15-20 minutes. Then finally at about 1 hour and 20 or 25 minutes into the movie (with 25 minutes left in the movie) the action and suspense that is shown in the trailer come into play. Overall, ""Into The Blue"" is a good movie with a decent storyline and a satisfying ending and action, when it is shown. Just letting you know, don't go into this movie thinking that all of the scenes shown in the trailer is what the movie is about because it is not. It is about 75% Drama, getting to know the characters and the sub-plot and the other 25% is where the good action is. It is a good movie for Drama / Action fans. Recommended as a rental. 6/10",Into the Blue

If you haven't seen previews already then I shall inform you of why you should pay to see this movie. The majority of it is underwater which is really really neat. The ocean they're in is absolutely beautiful! To find out what it's about, watch a trailer, you'll be hooked. When I walked into the theater I wasn't sure how well I would like it. I ended up LOVING it. When it comes to DVD, I'll be buying it for sure! If this is your first Paul Walker experience, may I suggest to you The Fast and the Furious and 2 Fast 2 Furious. Both of which are excellent. I was so disappointed when they postponed the release to Sept 30 instead of this summer. I know it would've done well, but I guess that would have been a lot of movies with Jessica ALba in them. Oh well. She did a super job too. I'm really exited about this movie.

182,no_remorse_69,This film is unequivocally spectacular (Absolutement Pêche),10,22 October 2005,"Into The Blue (Stockwell, USA, 2005) is set to be the most criminally under-rated masterpiece of (post)modern times. Its place in international critical canons ought to be a simple arbitrary fact. This might seem hyperbolic to some. Let me assure you, it is not. The qualities of this film know no bounds. I shall sing its praises until I find myself staring at the ceiling of some hospital ward, malingering on my deathbed. All scholarly criticism aside, this picture is a no less than 10,000 leagues ahead of all other underwater drug-smuggling Cameltoe-Festaculars that have ever gone before it, and I daresay, of all that will succeed it. I cannot begin to convey via this most primitive form of expression - word-processing - how supremely; how all-encompassing; how serotonin-inducing, director John Stockwell has improved the basic quality of my life. In a single motion picture, spanning just two hours, he has brought to mankind what can only be described as an unbridled cacophony of excellence. Listen not to the critics of your local newspaper. Listen not to Jonathan Ross on Film 2005 just before you brush you teeth and go to bed. Listen to the little man, or woman, inside your head who sees in Jessica Alba something that is lacking from your otherwise mundane life. Listen to the self you buried years ago, along with your childhood dreams. Listen to me. Go see this film. Pure cinema rarely sees the light of day in the nocturnal world of Hollywood cinema. By nocturnal, I mean dark. And by dark I don't mean smouldering films with edge and deeper meaning. I mean films that don't deserve to see the light of day. The kind of Hollywood films that saturate our daily lives. Be they advertised on the sides of double-decker buses or on our packs of Crunchy Nut Cornflakes, offering some cheap plastic tie-in. With Into The Blue, it seems Hollywood has awoken from a slumber rivalled only by a fictional character, Sleeping Beauty.Sleeping Beauty? How about beauty that's awake, and real? And tanned? And not wearing very much aka bikinis? And called Jessica Alba, co-starring Paul Walker, Ashley Scott and Scott Caan. These players aren't just the Baywatch cardboard cut-outs you might expect. If Into The Blue was a chess match between Gary Kasparov and ""Deep Blue"", the actors would be the knights, bishops, rooks and royalty combined. There's no corner-cutting cast-wise, or production-wise. This is a Tour De Force like no other. I can scarcely remember a time in my life when I've felt more alive than those glorious moments I spent in The Skydome Cinema, Coventry on that Saturday afternoon. Life could not be better.

183,dja-noble,good film ; well worth watching; good pace,8,4 June 2014,"I really enjoyed this film, and not having watched Fast and Furious I did not initially link Paul Walker and recent tragedy (so my view of film is not prejudiced by this event) ... To put it simply : Good narrative, plot, pace, visuals. Timing of events, for once, all locked into place well. The film even works with its low Parental Guidance (UK PG) rating (making it a 15 by adding more visual violence would have worked but taken some of the charm of the film away). I think some viewers, if watching a thriller just want to see blood / violence , but honestly this film did not need the extra ketchup. Beautiful people ... makes you want to hit the gym before summer holiday. As expected the ocean imagery / island life works well and leaves you wanting to jump on a plane.

But I think that the whole point of the movie WAS Jessica Alba in a bikini. And no more. The drug dealers, the treasure, the sharks... just a plot device to get attractive people, namely Jessica Alba, semi-naked on film. Gratuitous definitely. Although they did surprise me with the fact that I expected a shark movie, but didn't get one. All in all, the movie is watchable, I don't think you'll get anything out of it, but it passes the time.

I was expecting a movie targeted at teenagers and generation x, with a lot of skin and fast boats. While it definitely had a few close ups of Jessica and Paul underwater and some professional waverunner stunts, it was also a pretty good story with a ""leave you hanging"" ending. In fact, the storyline was much more dominant than the skin and fast boats. Although billed as the lead of the movie and clearly the largest star, Jessica Alba (and her character) played a backseat role to Paul Walker whose ethical and moral dilemmas were the heart of the movie. Maybe it's the same theme in many movies? Young bright people with everything going for them are introduced to bad influences and they are tempted by these outside forces. They make a few bad decisions, learn from them, and then make the right decision. Or do they? Into the Blue follows the same premise, but at least this premise dominates the movie, not selling out for the teenage box office. At least not overtly. This movie isn't going to win an Oscar, but it was definitely worth $10.",Into the Blue

Josh Brolin shows up as Paul's former boss who is a big-time treasure hunter with plenty of money to make it work.Seems pretty straight-forward, right? Oh wait! Paul's brother, played by Scott Caan, and his girlfriend of 14 hours, Ashley Scott, show up and want to go diving! Guess what they find? Treasure. And now we get into the only enjoyable part of the movie: the whole process on how underwater treasure hunting works. But of course the audience this was intended for won't care about that and won't add any explosions to the movie, so lets have them find a plane full of drugs. Can you see where this is going?The usual people die, and there's a happy and somewhat mildly informative ending. The ending, of course, skips the whole thing about how our heroes manage to get away with killing people and making stuff explode, only to then get the money to make all their dreams come true.Lets look at the stars again. The best one? Josh Brolin, then Jessica Alba. I consider Paul Walker to be the same type of guy as Keanu Reeves, which isn't a good thing people.

The only important to remark is the nice body of the blonde girl, who is always showing and swimming for boys attraction. It seems that the movie spend many dollars in renting ships and moving from one scenario to another, but the sound and the camera director is not average.

It was a fun popcorn movie and better than the usual crap that is released as ""action thriller"" these days.

So what if the Director is obsessed with Jessica Alba's anatomy, must say it is quite photogenic.This movie serves up a moral lesson, inspiring scenery, believable characters, yes people can be that young and dumb, amazing how they always end up smelling of roses.If you just want a bit of fun, then this movie is the ticket.My only concern is that its rating seems to be inappropriate, but then again, most ratings on movies seem inappropriate now-a-days.

194,morpheus4uic,Amateur divers looking for treasure get into deep water with a powerful drug lord,1,28 September 2005,"Into the Blue has all the suspense of watching guppies at feeding time. Films like this legitimize a shift to so-called reality entertainment and give rise to a distrust of the motion picture as viable escapist entertainment. The writing is sophomoric. The directing is uneven and dull. The editing is murky. The underwater photography, while beautiful for the most part, suffers at the hands of inept special effects and some examples of really bad lighting. The plot of this film is not very credible, yet far too predictable, and, for a supposed action/adventure film, slow to the point of becoming inept. Watching a puddle dry might yield more drama than this clunker. The acting is almost entirely one-dimensional and seems to rely upon skin, poses, and bronzer. Miss Alba gives it everything she's got, but that's not saying much. Mr. Walker is a bundle of mannerisms. Scott Caan's acting is alternately inept and imitation Chris Penn. The rest of the cast must have been desperately seeking employment at the time this film was cast. In a packed preview earlier this evening, I never heard a sound from the audience, except for frequent movement toward the exit. My advice is to watch guppies feed for two hours instead of wasting your time and money on this bloat.",Into the Blue

My only complaints about the film are that Jessica Alba says ""Intense"" far too often, and Paul Walker screams like a girl in one scene. John Travolta even has a cameo (though it's not listed in the credits for some reason) as a one-eyed pirate named Arb-Dunlop. My favourite scene is near the middle of the film when Jessica Alba's character gets really mad at Paul Walker and he smacks her right across the chest with his numchucks! The entire audience in the theatre cheered at that scene! If you like boats you'll obviously love this movie as there are a ton of them, as well as some underwater diving sequences. The movie could have been slightly longer in order to give a more satisfying ending. John Travolta's part could have been longer also, but he solely a comical relief appearance.

I would have left if I weren't with others and I would have gone to sleep if I could have.Jessica Alba was a very tasty treat to watch on the screen and the location was divine. Unfortunately, Jessica Alba's gorgeous body and the beautiful location couldn't save this movie. The plot writers and script writers should all have their union cards revoked for this movie. The plot is disjointed and trite. The characters were shallow predictable caricatures. From early on in the movie, the only thing that wasn't a sure thing was who was going to die before it was over (although even this predictable to a degree).If you want to see Jessica Alba spend the majority of a movie in a bikini, wait until it comes out on DVD.

From the Jet Ski scene to the Yachts to the fantastic display of coral fish and rays galore I felt like I was right there. It seems the movie is being ripped up because of the drug involvement and treasure find similar to the Deep. Are you for real? Take any murder mystery and of which there are thousands, and guess what there's a stiff a cop and someone with a weapon who seems like a nice guy but isn't. And that's OK cause as long as there's blood a babe and a bad cop the tickets will keep selling. As long as you see this movie for what it is you will enjoy it very much. This is about a guy with high morals -a little lacking today, who is living in trash to do what he wants more then anything in the world, a treasure finder.

It's about treasure hunters, them finding a plane full of coke in it and people getting greedy which happens. Josh Brolin played an awesome bad guy. I've never seen him play one of those before. I'm sure Paul Walker is not the only person who has held their breath underwater for a long period of time and if you actually check the website for the film it tells you how long he held his breath underwater and that the director was impressed with all of the actors.

207,doobie_docter,Jessica Alba's ass has to be the closest thing to heaven.,8,24 January 2006,"It's a fun movie, gets pretty intense with some shark attacks and ass kicking cocaine dealers. But the highlight of this movie has to be Jessica's bum, god gave her a gift and a damn nice one at that. Definitely the nicest ass in town. 2 thumbs up for her 2 loafs of bread. I suggest this movie to anyone who likes acdtion packed thrillers with a side order of two plump hams. THe best part is when shes swimming in the water looking for treasure, the camera is right up there, bang on her booty. I want his job thats all I can say, and we all know what he was thinking when he was filming that. I know what I would be:). BEsides that rent the movie because it really does hook you from beginning to end. Definitely a choise on the movie racks! Speaking of racks, Jessica Alba...Ahh never mind see for your self.",Into the Blue
208,Lisa1188,Whoa...!,7,30 August 2006,"This was a weird movie! Of course I wanted to see it because of Paul Walker - the God and Jessica Alba - The Goddes. But I thought this movie wouldn't be more than the two of them loving each other in the ocean. I didn't have high expectations, because Jessica's acting doesn't always impress me (let's take ""Honey"" for example...).So I just sit in my chair and waited for some romance between two beautiful people, in the beautiful ocean. The beginning of the movie was a bit awkward and got me wondering, but I shook my head and just went along with it. It started getting better, showing a lot of Paul, and I was enjoying every second of tanned hot body, until... well, until things went completely wrong. All of a sudden I wasn't seeing beautiful people, but dead people.. shot-dead people... shot-not-dead-but-barely-living people?..... half-eaten-by-sharks people??...... people who were *cutting off arms of dead people*??? Huh?! Did I miss something here? Therefore, that's my opinion about this movie. It's got a lot of unnecessary violence that comes out of nowhere. I just think that everything is too shallow at the beginning, and it goes too far towards the end. Maybe I was completely taken by surprise and I'm still shocked, but that's my opinion.To conclude, I give it a 5 for the acting, a 5 for the unexpected violence, and a 10 for Paul's body (*daydreaming*) ... therefore, a 7!",Into the Blue

210,JeremyCollinz,I need help!!!,8,30 December 2005,"I need help with a song in the movie and it is really making me mad because i looked all over the internet to find the group and/or song title and i just am not seeming to have any luck with my search. My girlfriend and two of my other friends and i are trying to figure out who the song is by, the artist, in the movie when Paul walker finds that black rock in the water towards the beginning of the movie and then all 4 of them go back in to water to look for treasures with Scott Caan hesitating and then holding the mop because he is very afraid of the sharks. We can't remember who it is and its prostrating me but i do know that the group had an old song about a girl or something. any help is appreciated.",Into the Blue
211,itsonly_me,Click flick with action...,9,31 December 2005,"I personally liked the movie a lot. It's good for girls because it has the whole two people being crazy about each other and the guy giving up treasure for love plot line. But also includes action so guys can enjoy it too. I also really like that Jessica Alba fights in the movie, instead of just waiting for the guy to come and save her. Most of the music throughout the movie is also good, especially ""The Time Of Our Lives"" by Paul van Dyk, but it makes me mad that there is no soundtrack out for the movie. I also agree that you don't have to think much throughout the movie which is fine by me. Its a fun movie too watch not to mention has an attractive cast. I personally think it's really good.",Into the Blue
212,thomas-allier,The movie that makes me a pirate of the Caribbean ; ),8,7 February 2006,"After reading some negative feedbacks regarding Into the Blue, I was a little bit pessimistic about that movie that's why I went to see it without expecting anything from it(...except maybe to contemplate Jessica Alba :). From the very beginning, the paradisiac place where the story takes place in with a suitable music grab you from your boring every day life...into the blue. After 5 minutes, you're already dreaming of being Jared (Paul Walker) (people here have no surname ;) having Sam (Jessica Alba:) just for you but everything gets complicated when old Jared's pal Bryce arrives on the Island with is 14 hours girl friend Amanda. As a bad boy, the new guy involves Jared in doing nuts illegal stuff with drugs discovered before in a crashed airplane. As a consequence. Jared and Sam who were hoping for a quiet happy life sink in illegality in spite of themselves and paradise becomes hell! Add to this some tiger sharks, lost treasures, pirates, drug dealers, treasons and you get Into the blue, the kind of movie you'll be happy to watch, a cold Winter Saturday night with noisy pals with some pizzas and fresh beers. I give it an 8 because it really lets me escape from reality. In a nutshell, if you're afraid to buy it, rent it!",Into the Blue
213,newsgroups-ast,"not bad, but don't mess with their bodies",7,16 January 2006,"If you don't like (apnea)diving or swimming you better miss this film, cause it only gets good if you really do. The main plot catches someone cause it could be happening to locals and the characters act natural and intelligent. The only thing I have to complain about is, that the director obviously tries to push the movie with scenes of just filming bodies of the women. It is not often, but when it happens it just rips the general nice oceanic atmosphere apart.I disagree with my previous commenter where he is blaming the actors to do their job bad. I haven't seen one scene where you ask yourself how they get their job as actor. Generally there are no close-ups on faces, and the focus in the movie lies on catching the atmosphere of apnea-diving and having fun on the sea. And yes, money corrupts this shiny world, once again.After all, nice general happy movie of a body-filming-focused-director",Into the Blue
214,Crid1237,This movie blows....,5,29 January 2006,"Pirates, gold, hot women, explosions, underwater combat, you'd think that this movie has it all. Yet, somewhere it went wrong. Maybe it's not fair that I judge this movie since I spent about half my time watching it and half my time zoning out while some sort of contemporary soap opera played itself out in the Caribbean. This movie tries to be something its not: deep and insightful. It needed more action and more fatalities. I will give this movie a 5/10 however because the few and far between action sequences sounded pretty good on my home theater system. I especially liked the scene where the cannon falls on that guy's arm. Ouch thats smarts.",Into the Blue
215,lordSnoop,high class bullshit with some sharks,1,27 May 2006,"It is always a pleasure watching Jessica Alba in a bikini, but this movie is really something you should try to avoid. A lousy story meets weak actors plus some coke and sharks. And of course there's also the classical Hollywood love story with quotes on a really great level like: ""would you give up a treasure for love?"" and ""i've known her for five days"" after his girlfriend dies (and by the way she was the regular bit** without character which we can find in every cheap Hollywood movie like this). I mean aren't there already enough movies like this with half naked chicks bouncing around? When i wanna see a hot bitch and a scenario that looks like being written by a 16 years old slightly retarded kid while he was sitting on the toilet doing you know what i can go watch some porno. Watchin the movie is a complete waste of time if you don't wanna play with yourself and even then it's only half excusable. John Stockwell strikes again with another piece of crap.",Into the Blue

217,micktonerfurlong,Into the blue,7,10 May 2007,"Alba in bikini!! Maybe a seven is harsh? 10 lines of text? Jeez! I Said all there is to say already!? OK, OK this ten lines of text thing is dragging my talk on this movie out already, but I don't watch dark angel because it's plop. But if alba is in a movie i'll watch it! She once tried to take me out on a date but it was a Sunday night and there was a chance of some overtime so I took a rain check. You all know how much cash a Sunday involves? But seriously.. Alba in a bikini?? I may watch this again. And again. I hope this constitutes 10 lines. ALBA/BIKINI End of. Oh, and did I mention..Alba in a bikini? Oh... yeah.. How could I forget this film did contain cocaine and sharks. Plus I don't usually use the word plop. But all my other words weren't appropriate.. so to speak. Enjoy.",Into the Blue
