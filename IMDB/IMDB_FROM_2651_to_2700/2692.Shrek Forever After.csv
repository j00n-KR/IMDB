0,TheLittleSongbird,"Decent: not as good as the first two, but better than the third film",7,18 January 2011,"The first Shrek was funny and original, and one of my favourites of its year. The first sequel was just as delightful and as charming, and while the third film wasn't as bad as I thought it would be it did suffer from being too tired and contrived. Shrek Forever After is an improvement on Shrek the Third while lacking the charm, heart and magic that was there clearly in the first two.Thankfully, the story is not as contrived as it was in the third film. I loved the idea and it did start off well, the ""what would life be like if Shrek had never existed?"" reminded me of one of my all-time favourites, It's a Wonderful Life. However, in the middle act it did have its predictable parts. The pace sags a bit too in the middle act particularly when there are parts that don't have as much humour as I would have liked. Also, while the animation was very good on the whole, I did feel that Rumplestiltskin's facial expressions were occasionally overdone and forced.Criticisms aside, the animation is very good, very colourful and lively with some nice backgrounds. The soundtrack is also great, while the jokes are fresher and wittier than the last one, Donkey getting the best of them. The characters are still likable, the pace is in general snappy and the writing is amusing. The voice acting is also top notch, not only from Mike Myers and Cameron Diaz who are rock-solid but especially from Eddie Murphy who seamlessly comes very close to stealing the film while Antonio Banderas makes a welcome return as Puss.Overall, not a classic but an improvement and an entertaining film. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Shrek Forever After
1,SnoopyStyle,Fine conclusion,7,15 August 2014,"The King and Queen was about to make a deal with Rumpelstiltskin when Fiona was saved by Shrek. He's bitter at the happily-ever-after state of affairs. Shrek and Fiona have 3 kids and he's struggling with domestication. He's tired and wants to go back to scaring the villagers. Rumpelstiltskin tricks Shrek into a deal to give him the day he was born. Shrek discovers the new world is ruled by Rumpelstiltskin, witches are running things, and ogres are hunted. He and Fiona have never met. When the day expires, he will never exist. There is an exit clause in True Love's Kiss.The start is a little bit slow. It's grumpy with a tired Shrek. New character Rumpelstiltskin isn't the most visually interesting. It does take a touching turn. It's a good 'It's a Wonderful Life' story. It has a warm message and the gang is back.",Shrek Forever After
2,claudio_carvalho,Underrated Animation,8,10 December 2010,"On the day that Shrek rescued the cursed Princess Fiona from the tower where she was kept prisoner of the dragon, her parents King Harold and the Queen were ready to sign a contract with the cunning Rumpelstiltskin delivering the kingdom Far Far Away to him. On the present days, Shrek feels bored with Fiona, his family and friends and near a breakdown, and he misses the years when he was a terrifying ogre. Rumpelstiltskin overhears a discussion between Shrek and Fiona and meets Shrek, offering a deal to make he feels a frightening ogre again. In return, Shrek should deliver one day of his childhood to Rumpelstiltskin. Shrek is lured and Far Far Away is distorted under the reign of the tricky Rumpelstiltskin. Now Shrek misses his family and friends and has to win Fiona's heart again to save Far Far Away, his friends and himself. I have just watched ""Shrek Forever After"" and my expectations were very low, based on the IMDb user's rating and a couple of reviews that I had glanced. However I liked this underrated animation a lot, which has a good story with many hilarious moments. Once again, Donkey ""steals the movie"" and this character has been for years the best role of the wasted Eddy Murphy. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Shrek para Sempre"" (""Shrek Forever After"")",Shrek Forever After
3,kosmasp,Wish-fulfillment,7,23 October 2010,"After the very disappointing 3rd Shrek it only could get better now couldn't it? Maybe there was a slight chance it would continue downhill, but fortunately they actually did manage to come up with a good story. A story one can only hope that puts the Shrek Saga to rest. What else should there come after this? It's OK to do a spin-off with Antonio Banderas character, but please not another Shrek (because I very much fear it would be along the lines of the very bad Shrek 3).So while they didn't invent anything new (or did they?), the basic idea to make it about Shrek finding himself was strong enough to fill the movie. Not that many subplots and almost no distraction help the movie significantly! Not Pixar territory, but a good movie nevertheless.",Shrek Forever After
4,jboothmillard,Shrek Forever After: The Final Chapter,5,11 December 2010,"The first two computer animated films were great, the third film was fun but not as good, and this final film in the story is an improvement on the predecessor, also being the only one in 3D. Basically the film starts with the past where the Queen Lillian (Dame Julie Andrews) and King Harold (John Cleese) almost signed a deal with Rumplestitlskin (Walt Dohrn) before they found out about Shrek (Mike Myers) rescuing Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz). Forward to the present, Shrek is getting tired of the same repetitive life he is having with his wife and three ogre triplets, Donkey (Eddie Murphy), Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) and all the fairytale friends hanging round doesn't help his stress level either. It is at the birthday party of the three babies that lets out his big roar of frustration, and storms off to get some peace, and that is when he meets Rumplestiltskin. He offers Shrek the chance to become the former ogre he used to be for one day, feared and lonely, using a day from his past he wouldn't have any memory of, and he signs the deal. So Shrek has some fun scaring people, but then he gets captured by witches, working for Rumplestiltskin, and he realises that Donkey doesn't recognise him because the day he was born hasn't happened, and also that his life will end when the one day deal is up. So when they escape, Shrek does eventually convince Donkey to help him get back to the normal world, and they have the contract folded in a certain way to reveal how. They determine that Shrek needs to find Fiona and share true love's first kiss once again, and they only find her beneath the ground, with many other ogres who have formed a resistance. Fiona, also not knowing Shrek, reveals that no-one rescued her, she just escaped the castle herself, and she is still cursed, and the only way she will be convinced to love Shrek once again is to charm her all over again. Hearing that Rumplestiltskin will offer any wish to whoever brings Shrek in, he hands himself in, and demands that he grant his wish to have all ogres released, of course Fiona isn't. Donkey, the fattened Puss in Boots and the ogre resistance go to the rescue, and they thwart Rumplestiltskin's plan, and when it looks like Shrek is disappearing from existence, Fiona, having fallen for him again, kisses him. In the end, everything goes back to normal, Shrek realises how much his friends and family mean to him, and everyone does indeed live happily ever after. Also starring Jon Hamm as Brogan, Glee's Jane Lynch as Gretched, Craig Robinson as Cookie, Larry King as Doris the Ugly Stepsister, Kathy Griffin as Dancing Witch and Mary Kay Place as Guard Witch. The voices are still good, although Rumplestiltskin could have been someone we actually know, the computer animation is still good quality, and the It's a Wonderful Life style storyline is much better than the previous, all in all, a fun final animated fantasy comedy adventure. Worth watching!",Shrek Forever After
5,Tweekums,A somewhat darker fourth instalment,8,16 February 2017,"Shrek, the ogre who was once feared throughout the land, is now living an ordinary life with his wife Fiona and their three children but sometimes he misses his old life and finally during his children's birthday party he has had enough and storms out. Soon afterwards he 'rescues' the evil Rumpelstiltskin and afterwards as they talk he says he would like just one day of his old life. Rumpelstiltskin says he can give him that in exchange for one other day in his life, a day he can't even remember. Shrek can't see any catch so signs the deal.Suddenly he finds himself in an unfamiliar world; at first it is great, everybody fears him again, but then he realises there is something very wrong. He is captured by witches who take him to the castle in a cart pulled by Donkey who has no memory of Shrek. Once at the castle he finds that Rumpelstiltskin now rules. He is told that the day he gave up was the day he was born; after the one day he asked for he will cease to exist! In this world he was never born so he didn't befriend Donkey and Puss in Boots. He didn't rescue Fiona. And the King and Queen were tricked into a deal that gave the kingdom to Rumpelstiltskin. All hope isn't lost though; there is a get out clause 'True Love's Kiss' will save him. This isn't easy though; not only will he have to find Fiona he will have to make her fall in love with him once again all in one day.After a slightly disappointing third instalment this is a step up; it still isn't quite as good as the first two films but that would be difficult. The story is quite a lot darker as we see Shrek make a mistake that costs him everything he holds dear and could potentially lose his life. This adds a sense of urgency to proceedings and makes each step towards fixing things satisfying. The fact that Shrek hasn't impacted on their lives means familiar characters have changed; most notable Fiona who, after escaping from the tower on her own, has become a warrior princess leading an ogre rebellion against Rumpelstiltskin and Puss who is fat! Rumpelstiltskin is the most villainous of the antagonists in the 'Shrek' films to date; he is genuinely unpleasant and may disturb some younger viewers I thought he was a great character though. The animation is good, as one might expect, although some scenes look as though they were done to show off 3D effects which may have looked great in the cinema but merely look good when watched on DVD. Overall I'd recommend this to fans of the series even if part three disappointed them.",Shrek Forever After
6,BA_Harrison,Do the roar!,9,1 September 2010,"After the dismal effort that was Shrek the Third, I had no real expectations from this fourth outing for Dreamwork's lucrative green ogre and his fairytale pals; all I was looking for was an hour-and-a-half's mindless distraction from a very boring cross-channel ferry journey.What a pleasant surprise it was, then, to discover that this latest Shrek adventure is not only much, much better than the previous chapter, but is actually as enjoyable as the first two, with a cool 'alternate reality' storyline, a memorable villain in the form of the marvellously malevolent Rumplestiltskin (Walt Dohrn), some terrific new characters and plenty of familiar ones, loads of genuinely laugh-out-loud moments (Donkey's party trick with a pair of eyeballs still has me chuckling a week later), and a well-worn but still heart-warming message: that we should spend more time appreciating the good things we have in life, rather than yearning for the things we don't have.On the more technical side, the CGI is excellent and really makes me wish that I had seen the film in glorious 3D to fully appreciate the impressive visuals; furthermore, the voice-work is perfect as one would expect from the talented cast, and the choice of music is inspired (check out the witches busting some moves to The Beastie Boys).With Shrek the Third, it had looked as though the fairy-tale was finally over, but if Dreamworks can guarantee to keep the quality this high, I have no problems with them spinning out the franchise for a few more adventures.",Shrek Forever After
7,tavm,Shrek Forever After should be a great way to end an iconic series,8,7 June 2010,"I've now seen all four Shrek movies in first run in theatres. The first two were great and the last one wasn't so bad to me but this one, which should be the last one considering the way it ends, had a little more heart in characterization that got me quite touched which probably shouldn't surprise anyone who's read many of my comments under my username if they know that my favorite movie is It's a Wonderful Life since there are many elements here inspired from there. Kudos, as always, to the voices of Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, Antonio Banderas, and especially Mike Myers, for providing great pleasure these characters have provided me over the years. Seeing the character of Rumpelstiltskin as the villain was quite a good new twist here. And having the witches battle the ogres was also an exciting touch. And how about the way Puss in Boots lets himself go... Okay, I'll just say I highly recommend Shrek Forever After. And so long, Far Far Away...P.S. This was another animated movie I enjoyed watching in 3-D.",Shrek Forever After
8,michaelRokeefe,The magic of a lover's kiss.,7,22 May 2010,"Not too arguably the most endearing animated series, Shrek reaches its final chapter in SHREK FOREVER AFTER. The franchise has been very good for Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz and Antonio Banderas. The original was pure bliss and really encouraging to look forward to what would follow. Unfortunately the second and third episodes gradually got worse. The fourth installment is not as magical as the original, but a whole lot better than the two middle flicks. Being in 3D may have been and enticement, but this is Shrek. Far, far away is in for some changes as the green ogre becomes complacent and temporarily not happy with his marriage and fatherhood. He makes a deal with the shady Rumpelstiltskin(Walt Dohrn)to trade off a day of his childhood, not knowing that he gives away the day of his birth. True friends Donkey and Puss are instrumental in bringing Shrek and Fiona back together... forever after.Others lending voices: John Cleese, Jane Lynch, Mike Mitchell, Lake Bell, Meredith Veira, Ryan Secrest, Larry King and Julie Andrews. And what would a Shrek movie be without the tunes? This time we hear from The Carpenters, The Beastie Boys and Stevie Wonder. A very nice and positive way to say farewell to a franchise.",Shrek Forever After
9,studioAT,Ogre and out,4,24 December 2010,"Dreamworks have smartly ended this series before it continued its decline. The first two films were excellent and while these last two have still had a lot of charm and humour they have lacked that vital punch that separates a good family film from being a great family film.This film may be a slight improvement on the last one but there are still a lot of weaker jokes and already dated pop culture references that miss the mark. All the beloved characters return but by now the format is looking slightly tired. It is a nice final chapter for the fans but it feels right that this is Shreks last outing. Overall the Shrek saga has been an enjoyable one with lots of nice lines and characters. You could quite happily buy the whole box-set and find good moments in all four films, the problem is that these moments got a little far and few between in the last two films.",Shrek Forever After

11,hitchcockthelegend,Dreamworks play safe and sign the series off with dignity.,7,4 December 2015,"After the monstrosity that was Shrek the Turd, the Dreamworks team behind the Shrek franchise woke up and realised what made the series so popular in the first place. Shrek Forever After is not a particularly great film, but it finds some firm footings to appease the adults and children alike.Thematically it's as safe as houses, it pitches Shrek into a ""It's a Wonderful Life"" scenario, where the big green ogre gets to spend a day away from the life he didn't realise he was happy with in the first place. Making a deal with the nefarious Rumpelstiltskin, Shrek finds a world of darkness for ogres, a world ruled by a psychotic who has an army of flying Margaret Hamilton's to do his bidding. Worse than that, Fiona doesn't know him, she's the leader of the resistance and has no time for some big green ogre love. Donkey is all mangy and Puss in Boots literally has become a fat cat, it's a horrible life, man!The action and graphics whizz past the eyes in what is a perfectly pitched time frame of 90 minutes. It never reaches the heights of the first two movies, but it doesn't strain for laughs or narrative cheek (Pied Piper as a bounty hunter? Genius), or more crucially, it's never dull, something part 3 can't safely claim to not be. It bows out with head held high, not so much in a blaze of glory, but with a dignified recognition of the fact it's time to retire to the swamp and chill out. Take it easy Shrek and the gang. 7/10",Shrek Forever After
12,dbborroughs,moments are great but the story is too well known for it to fully work,6,13 June 2010,"Its a another remake of Its a Wonderful Life but with ogres and fairy tale characters.I'm really split about this film. They got so much right, the love between Shrek and Fiona for example, that you wonder why they bothered to remake a classic film. I mean the emotion and the bits work but the central plot is too worn and Rumpelstiltskin is too big a jerk Frankly had they managed to do something new, change the story around some how so it wasn't a direct steal this probably would be better, possibly the best of the films. But something doesn't work and despite getting so much dead on right there is a sense that they didn't care enough to completely make a full fledged film.Worth seeing, more so than the last two, but I'd wait for DVD...something I should have done.",Shrek Forever After
13,grantss,Good fun,8,14 May 2016,"Good fun. While this probably got the worst reviews of the four Shrek movies, I enjoyed this the most. The humour seemed cleverer, and the whole plot seemed darker and edgier. Maybe it was the fact that it had an over- the-top bad guy, Rumpelstiltskin, and he made the movie for me.Great graphics, and a decent, though a tad derivative, plot. The plot was never the main selling point of the Shrek series anyway...The old crew - Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz, Eddie Murphy (especially) and Antonio Banderas - deliver in spades, but as, indicated before, it is Rumpelstiltskin, voiced by Walt Dohrn, who makes this so enjoyable.",Shrek Forever After
14,Calicodreamin,Fantastic!,8,25 February 2020,"Surprisingly heartwarming for a Shrek movie. The animation is well done, the storyline has good flow, and it has all the classic Shrek charm. Though it deviates from the direct storyline, I find this to be one of my favorites in the series. Love seeing badass Fiona!",Shrek Forever After
15,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Wolfie... do you have a wig that signifies that I'm pretty content?,7,25 July 2010,"I should perhaps say right off the bat that I did not catch the third one(I love the original, and I like the second a lot). Everything I heard about it indicated that it was crap, so I skipped it. I'll be honest and say that this didn't grab my attention. At first, I wasn't going to go to the theater for it(I don't often go out of my way to watch anything animated, anyway). People told me it was worth it(if they weren't necessarily ecstatic about it), and the rating is decent on here. I'm glad I went. First off, the 3D is great, it doesn't get gimmicky so often that it's bothersome and it is an overall pleasant viewing experience. I would definitely say to go for that version. There is flight and similar things, as well as build-up of atmosphere, establishment of tone, etc. where it adds that extra layer, and these are quite effective. You feel like you're along for the ride, never overwhelmed and certainly not bored. The drama works throughout. When this goes for getting us emotionally involved, it nails it. It is exciting when it means to be. Sweet, not sappy, when that is appropriate. The relationship between Shrek and Fiona just works. You may already know the plot. It's your basic It's A Wonderful Life concept, one of the popular ideas(having appeared in a ton of shows with relatively little alteration to it), where our favorite ogre is suddenly in a world where he doesn't exist, and thus no one recognizes him. Overall, it's predictable, but there are surprises along the way, and it's not dull at any point. The comedy works two times out of three, and relatively seldom does anything fall embarrassingly flat on its face(there are some forced ones, mind you), if it isn't uproarious laughter that often. It's about as you'd expect, with cleverness and verbal material, plays on words, silliness, the occasional gross-out gag or anachronism joke, popular in many of these, I guess since Aladdin. The cast returns, and the new ones are good(first time I've found Robinson amusing, though it is also my first real exposure to him, other than trailers and interviews, where he leaves me cringing), if it is criminal to give Jane Lynch, and, to a lesser extent, Kathy Griffin, so few lines! We meet a handful of new characters(including one or two memorable ones) as familiar ones are pushed into the background. This is a nice way to end the series. I don't think there is anywhere interesting left to go(and if they write in more Faustian deals surrounding if Fiona is rescued from the keep or not, I demand that they file creative bankruptcy). To anyone else who may be cautious because this is done by the director of Deuce Bigalow and Surviving Christmas(which I hear is horrible; the novel's fine), don't worry. This is actually less dirty than the 2nd one. There is a bit of cartoon violence and a little mild language in this. I recommend this to fans of the first two who want a dependable closing chapter. 7/10",Shrek Forever After
16,george.schmidt,A fitting final chapter to the fabled franchise in this never-ending- story!,8,24 May 2010,"SHREK FOREVER AFTER (2010) *** (VOICES OF : Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, Antonio Banderas, Julie Andrews, Jon Hamm, John Cleese, Craig Robinson, Walt Dohrn, Jane Lynch, Lake Bell, Kathy Griffin, Mary Kay Place, Kristen Schaal, Meredith Viera, Ryan Seacrest, Larry King, Regis Philbin, Conrad Vernon.) Better-than-anticipated 'final chapter' to the never-ending story of the lovable titular ogre and his brood that finds the not-so-jolly-green-giant in a funk wishing he was living his old days of yore which leads to runty Rumpelstiltskin to enter the picture – with a vendetta – to offer him a wish come true ala ""It's A Wonderful Life"" with predictable yet entertaining results. Once again Banderas steals the show as Puss In Boots but this time as a fat cat (literally) and Murphy's braying jack-ass Donkey having a field day and chewing the animated scenery. While it wouldn't be terrible if the powers that be do intend to close the nursery rhyme book on this fabled franchise it wouldn't hurt if they had one more verse to throw in for good measure (note: the IMAX 3-D version works yet it is not a must-see by any means in this medium).

17,neil-476,Had its moments,7,7 July 2010,"I enjoyed this 4th trip to the well, particularly the 3D (which was very effective), but there were things to point out which were less than positive.Rumpelstiltskin didn't really seem to work. I could see what they were up to but, to me, something wasn't quite right. Maybe it was the voice performance (Wally Dohrn, whoever he is), maybe the trade-off between superficially charming but inwardly villainous was slightly off, but on some level it didn't work.Puss was woefully underused. Limited to a series of fat gags, most of which had been used in the trailers, he may as well not have been there.The ogre babies, potentially great characters, were also underused.The story, though good, was essentially a retread of the first movie, albeit complicated by alternate realities causes and effects which may have been over-confusing for younger children.Far fewer gags than in previous efforts.But I did enjoy it.",Shrek Forever After
18,anaconda-40658,Forever Dull.,4,4 June 2015,"Shrek Forever After (2010): Dir: Mike Mitchell / Voices: Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, Antonio Banderas, Walt Dohrn: While the fairy tale spoof theme is still active, the series is clearly running out of steam. Shrek yearns for one more day to be a real ogre away from marriage, family and responsibility. He gets his wish when the evil Rumpelstiltskin tricks him into signing away the day he was born. Directed by Mike Mitchell who previously made such dread as Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo and Sky High. The one element that works here is the fine animation. Shrek basically repeats the first plot where he must unite with his friends. He is voiced again by Mike Myers who seems tired. Only Fiona who is seen as a warrior, has any depth but we know the outcome. She is voiced by Cameron Diaz and seems like the one character worth watching here. Donkey and Puss-In-Boots are also reduced to cardboard. Eddie Murphy voices Donkey whom almost seems exhausted from the whole thing. The whole Donkey-got-the-female-dragon-knocked-up thing is getting old and a little creepy. Antonio Banderas who voices Puss-In-Boots deserves better material to an otherwise appealing cat. Walt Dohrn voices the villain Rumpelstillskin and outside Shrek, seems to be the one other character to pay off in this pathetic sideshow. The creative department seems drained and only seems to function as an opportunity to ring every last dime out of the franchise. The original film was fresh and creative with ideas but with this fourth entry they should forget it forever and ever. Score: 4 / 10",Shrek Forever After
19,HotToastyRag,Thanks for nine years of fun!,5,29 September 2021,"The fourth movie in the Shrek franchise is the last of the feature-length cartoons. But don't despair, because you can always watch the Halloween and Christmas specials! Speaking of Christmas, Shrek Forever After is pretty much the fractured fairy tale's take on It's a Wonderful Life. While bogged down with domestic burdens, Shrek yells at his wife and kids and storms out of the house in a huff. He meets up with a mysterious magical being who makes it so that he was never born. Sound familiar? Alright, so in this movie, Shrek makes a deal with Rumpelstiltskin, not with Clarence the Angel, but it's still a similar premise.That's where the similarities stop, though. Instead of a touching tribute to family life or the love he really feels for Fiona, Shrek is thrust into more fighting, kidnapping, underground rebels, and weird futuristic time problems. Pretty much all audience members agreed that the fourth installment was the weakest, which might be why Dreamworks stopped before making a fifth. But I don't feel too bad about it, and I hope you don't. It's pretty rare for a series to end in a way that pleases everyone, and we can always go back and watch our favorite ones from earlier, can't we? And let's all remember how much joy and laughter Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, Dreamworks studio, all the assorted screenwriters brought us throughout the past nine years. A big thank you all of them!",Shrek Forever After
20,FlashCallahan,'My angry wig'...........,5,16 July 2010,"Shrek is back and this time he's three dimensional, just another gimmick to get the crowds in to a film that may not do well due to other competition.Shrek is living the perfect life, he has Fiona, family and his friends, but soon becomes aware that life has become very repetitive and boring. After an argument, he meets with Rumpelstiltskin and makes a deal so he can be an ogre for a day.Unbeknown to him, the day from his past that he wanted to lose, was the day he was born, so he has no family, no friends and no wife. He has until the end of the day, to snatch a kiss from his true love, but Fiona is different now and it will take a lot for him to convince her....During the first ten minutes, we see Shrek become increasingly aware of how boring his life has become, he looks bored, and one can only assume that Myers had the same look on his face whilst doing the voice over.Even though this film is purely about Shreks quest to get back everything, he seems to be playing second fiddle again to other characters, and it gets apparent when it becomes boring whenever Shrek is Alone on screen without a sidekick (which is a scary notion when you become of the titular character).The story just makes Shrek seem selfish and ignorant, and there were times in the movie when i hoped he would fail his mission.Rumpelstiltskin is very annoying too, he looks and acts like a reject from the X factor who thinks he could win.on the plus side, Donkey and Puss-in-boots are fantastic and provide the few laughs the film has too offer.It's a shame that this supposedly final film is just as bad as the third entry.And the final love in during the credits showing parts from the last three movies is stolen from Lethal weapon 4.I bet Mel would be straight on the phone to complain.",Shrek Forever After
21,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Shrek Forever After,4,21 May 2010,"It was 2001 since the first Shrek burst onto the screen, providing us a mean, grumpy and really green ogre as the reluctant hero counted on to save the day, and within this decade spawned a series of shorts, videos and even an amusement park feature. It's probably - and I say probably because box office receipts dictate whether another feature is worthwhile - the final chapter, and how gimmicky can it get to also jump onto the 3D bandwagon?Some of you will already know I'm giving 3D films a miss because frankly, I need to conserve funds. Moreover, the downside of 3D films is already widely publicized, coupled with the cheater-bugs who convert 2D to 3D during post production which I say is a poor man's cousin of the real thing. Unless a film really warrants it, 2D in a digital format will suffice, and so Shrek Forever After falls into this category. Which I thought was still nicely done up since the film has no lack of animated detail, though I shudder to think that because of the plenty of dimly lit, night based scenes, that in 3D format it'll prove disastrous.Anyway, Shrek as a trilogy worked, where we have our protagonists Shrek and Donkey fall in love (not with each other of course) and by the end of the third show, it's happy families all round. But profits dictate that another film be made, and Josh Klausner and Darren Lemke's story seemed to pull out the cheat sheet in now knowing how to move forward with the story, and hence, why not do a little time travel backwards cum alternate universe jig no thanks to the main villain Rumpelstiltskin (Walt Dohm) harbouring an opportunity to rule Far Far Away back in the first installment, if not for our hero's rescue of Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz).The story taps on the mundane existence of our every day lives, devoid of adventure which Shrek (Mike Myers) yearns for, becomes something quite unbearable as he goes through the motions of a routine from dawn till dusk, having to perform the same chores all over again, listen to friends Donkey (Eddie Murphy) and Puss (Antonio Banderas) recount their past adventures ad nauseam, and not having that all important personal Ogre time to relax in a mud pool, or have human beings tremble and run at the sight of him, becoming more of a celebrity hero instead.The themes cannot find the leeway to break out of the formula of learning to appreciate what you have before they're lost, and what true love really means since destiny has it all planned out, no matter how meandering or different the journey now becomes. For Shrek fans, watching Shrek Forever After is like a test of your trivia knowledge, since events and characters start to turn up albeit differently from originally conceived, and fans will likely have a kick out of knowing intimate details on the differences between what's canon, and what has tangent off from the original.As far as laughter and spoofs go, the film adopts a relatively darker mood and tone, with comedy being void of the physical approach, and the smart-alecky modern day references quite absent in this installment. The objective by director Mike Mitchell seems to be one of reinforcing the themes behind what Shrek and friends stand for, rather than to tell a tale of new adventures with new fairy tale characters. After all, this film is an attempt to milk the trilogy one last time through a rehash of premise and characters, so hopefully, Shrek the Ogre can finally find some much needed rest rather than to become a dead horse who's flogged way past its shelf life.",Shrek Forever After
22,siderite,"A funny fairy-comedy, but not very Shrekish",7,28 November 2010,"The essence of Shrek movies was parody of fairy-tales and the Hollywood world alike, making it a fun and ironic comedy for all ages. Instead, the fourth chapter of the Shrek story was a simple hero-saves-all tale, with all the references going back to previous Shrek films. All in all, a funny what-if remembrance of the whole franchise, but more than anything else, pretty obvious.That doesn't mean Eddie Murphy wasn't a perfect ass, that Antonio Banderas wasn't hilarious as a fat spoiled cat and that Myke Myers wasn't the same hopeless romantic ogre he portrayed in the first three films, but the comedy was situational at best, the story linear and the characters rather plain. I mean, Dragon acted as a dragon, the pigs ate everything, even in the ""good"" universe and the witches behaved as perfect German soldiers in American movies about World War 2.Bottom line: fun as a stand-alone movie, but a but of a disappointment as a Shrek film.",Shrek Forever After
23,namashi_1,Time to say Shrek Good-Bye...,4,22 May 2010,"Shrek has gone down a cult film character... so has Donkey, Fiona and Puss in Boots, thanks to the film that these characters became such a craze. Shrek was awesome, Sherk 2 was legendary, but the last one before this one 'Shrek The Third' was a yawn. Now comes 'Shrek Forever After', which ends the Shrek series... well if there is one more left, then I guess I won't be looking forward to it! The problem with 'Shrek The Third' and 'Shrek Forever After' are it's script. The writing is bland, you except a lot from Shrek, due to the wholesome entertainment we've witnessed before. The Final Chapter has it's share of funny and light moments, but they are far and between! What saves this disappointment is it's characters. Myers as Shrek is as good as ever! Diaz gives Fiona the voice she needs. Donkey and Puss-In Boots voiced by Icons like Murphy and Banderas are the life of the show. They are funny and spot-on. Walt Dohrn as the evil-head Rumplestilskin is just about okay.All n all, It's truly time to say Shrek and his friends Good-Bye. Thanks for the entertainment you gave us in the first 2 flicks, now you guys are getting wasted in poor scripts. So, Have a nice time at Far Far Away!",Shrek Forever After
24,Smells_Like_Cheese,It's a Wonderful Life... with Shrek!,7,29 May 2010,"Good ol' Shrek. Just when you think the series was done, we got another sequel as I like to call it ""The Search For More Money"". But it's actually a fun series, even though the third Shrek wasn't exactly that good, it's still a fun story to get into. The characters, the love, the romance, the comedy, the animation is all in good fun. So I saw Shrek Forever After last night with decent hope that this would be better than the third, it actually was, it was a good step up. But it seems like this could be more of a TV series now, you know how every Christmas most sit-com's have a ""what if It's a Wonderful Life"" type of episode? This is just like Shrek Forever After, Shrek has hit his mid life crisis, true, even fairy tale characters hit a mid life crisis. Which is funny because I discussed with my friends about what does happen after the ""Happily Ever After""? Did Sleeping Beauty and her prince ever have trouble paying off the castle? Did Snow White and her prince ever disagree on disciplining the kids? Shrek answers those questions finally.Shrek has grown tired of his life being a local celebrity and his overwhelming family and friends, as well as the fact he feels he isn't a ""real ogre"" anymore. When they arrive at Far, Far Away for the ogre babies' first birthday, an angry mob become fans and asks Shrek to autograph pitch forks and torches, a boy asks him to do his roar, and the three pigs eats the birthday cake. All this makes Shrek roar in frustration and everyone applauds; he smashes a new cake and angrily leaves the castle. Outside, Fiona talks to Shrek about his anger and his wish to be a real ogre again. Fiona tells Shrek he has everything, but doesn't see it, and she heads back inside the castle. Shrek sees Rumpelstiltskin, who has been vowing vengeance against Shrek who he feels took the kingdom away from him. Rumpelstiltskin offers him a day to feel like a real ogre again, in exchange for a day from Shrek's childhood. Shrek agrees and signs the contract. He sees how Far Far Away has been turned into a slum and Fiona, now taking lessons from Xena the Warrior Princess, along with other ogres are to be captured by Rumpelstiltskin, the only way to break this awful curse is the kiss of true love before sunset.Is Shrek worth the ticket price? I would say this is more of a matinée, it's very cute and has some good jokes, but nothing to get excited over. With the 3D price, no, I saw the 2D version and was perfectly happy with it, so you don't have to pay the extra price, there was nothing ""eye popping"" about the movie. The only thing that makes this movie a step down from the first 2 Shreks is the side characters. In the second Shrek we were introduced to some wonderful side characters like the Fairy God Mother, self centered Prince and my favorite, Puss in Boots. Now it seems like the side characters were just thrown in randomly for sake of them being there. I wished they had a little more to add to the story than they had, like I said it felt more like a TV show vs. a movie. But I have to admit the fat Puss in Boots nearly killed me, I couldn't stop laughing how we see him in a pink bow instead of his typical outfit. Shrek is definitely worth the watch, this was a good movie, maybe made more so for money, but a big step up from the third Shrek.7/10",Shrek Forever After
25,Rainey-Dawn,Great Final Chapter,8,6 September 2021,"Good final chapter! Shrek didn't realize he had it all, he decided he wanted to be an ogre again for just one day.

26,KineticSeoul,Weak finish to the Shrek journey,6,22 August 2014,"After the third installment that just wasn't nearly good as the first 2. Now comes a 4th installment that doesn't add much to the franchise, despite it being the final chapter in the Shrek story. There is no charm or wits to this one. It's like they rand out of ideas and now resorting to the what if scenario. They just don't show the after after forever ever after for a reason. I know it tries to delve into the reality of these stories, but this just falls flat. I was just bored with this one. It's like the failed 3rd installment, they just tried to make it up and finish the story. This is a franchise that had a strong start and just went downhill from there. It's another watchable CGI animated movie, but easily forgettable. And lacked the charm and substance to make it memorable. It's a movie worth watching to finish up the journey though, even if it ends weak. Well at least they tried to finish with at least something somewhat passable. I give this movie a 6 and that is being generous. It doesn't necessarily completely end with a whimper, but it came pretty darn close to that travesty.6/10",Shrek Forever After
27,sddavis63,No Better Than OK,5,10 June 2010,"I'm not in particular an aficionado of the Shrek series. I saw the first one and enjoyed it, but haven't actually seen 2 or 3. My daughter, though, loves Shrek, and so we went to see the fourth and final instalment tonight. Although the first movie was enjoyable enough, I was frankly tired enough of the lovable ogre when it was over that I didn't want to watch him again, and by now apparently Shrek feels that way too! In this movie, he's tired of the whole lovable ogre image and wants to return to the times when he was feared as an ogre, and he works out a deal with Rumpelstiltskin to allow him to do just that, but he hadn't considered that with his brand new life came the loss of his old life - including his family and friends. Fiona no longer knows him and, of course, their children don't exist. Not even Donkey knows who he is, and the world is a pretty bleak place in this new life. Rumpelstiltskin has taken over Far Far Away from Fiona's parents and all the ogres are imprisoned. In this sense, the movie has a bit of similarity to ""It's A Wonderful Life."" Obviously, the point of the movie is to put things right.This was no better than OK. Not having seen Parts 2 and 3, I can't really compare them, but it's certainly less fun than the first movie. My daughter - the Shrek fan - enjoyed it, but also found some parts quite scary, and it is a rather heavy movie at times. There's a revolving door of fairy tale characters, of course - Pinocchio, the Three Little Pigs, the Ginger Bread Man, Puss In Boots, etc. I suppose the message was good - learn to appreciate the life you have, because the alternative might not be that pleasing. As a farewell to the series (as I understand it there are no more Shrek movies planned) I didn't really see any particular closure involved with this - it didn't seem like a good way to say good-bye to the characters. Surely that was a serious missed opportunity.",Shrek Forever After
28,Buddy-51,definite uptick in quality,8,7 July 2011,"As ""Shrek Forever After"" opens, the warmhearted ogre is suffering through a bit of a midlife crisis. Having been firmly ensconced in marital and domestic bliss for quite some time now, Shrek suddenly finds himself pining for the days when he could be a real, full-time ogre, roaming the countryside and terrorizing the general populace - instead of changing diapers, pushing strollers, and signing autographs for fans who remember those long-gone glory days when he could still strike fear into the hearts of men.In the ""be careful what you wish for/you don't know what you've got till it's gone"" scenario that Josh Klausner and Darren Lemke have concocted for this fourth entry in the series, Shrek (Mike Myers) allows himself to be tricked into essentially signing his life away to the dastardly Rumpelstiltskin (the excellent Walt Dohrn) in exchange for a chance to once again become a full-fledged, undomesticated ogre for a day. We then get a new spin on ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" as Shrek learns what the world would have been like had he never been born. He also has to get Fiona (Cameron Diaz) – the beautiful princess by day/ugly ogre by night who, in this alternate universe, is now the leader of a band of freedom-fighting ogres – to fall in love with him all over again.Though a definite improvement over the drab and disappointing ""Shrek the Third"" from 2007, ""Shrek Forever After,"" directed by Mike Mitchell, never quite achieves the level of cleverness and wit that the first two installments did – which is a high bar indeed for anyone in this business. Still, the mix of Fractured Fairy Tale revisionism, pop culture references and recognizable pop tunes remains a winning one for the most part, and there is just enough sentiment to lift our spirits without stranding us in a puddle of goo. Plus, all the great sidekicks are back, including Donkey (Eddie Murphy), Puss In Boots (Antonio Banderas), and Cookie (Craig Robinson), and the voice work and animation are, as always, first-rate. In fact the voice-over cast reads like a who's-who of well-known actors and performers: Julie Andrews, John Cleese, Jon Hamm (""Mad Men""), Jane Lynch (""Glee""), Kathy Griffin, Mary Kay Place, Meredith Vieira, Ryan Seacrest, Regis Philbin and Larry King. Not a bad little group that.",Shrek Forever After
29,Lejink,Second rate Shrek,3,27 December 2010,"A shame to see what was once so original, both in terms of graphic representation and slick but sharp comedic chops reduced to this really rather tawdry, hopefully ""final chapter"" as its US title would have it, in the Shrek franchise.It's only 90 minutes long but seems greatly padded out, with a plot that fatally and unoriginally owes more to ""It's A Wonderful Life"" crossed with ""Harry Potter"" than the toon world which inspired the original prototype.It's basically all plot and almost no laughs, only one line - Donkey's ""Time-share"" quip - broke my silence, nothing is added to our knowledge or empathy with the characters and you couldn't care less about the denouement. There's nothing new in the art department, ditto the use of soundtrack music, in fact the whole thing reeks of formula and cash-in.Time to retire the big guy and all his entourage. When the inevitable Christmas boxed set hits the shelves, this is the one you'll never play more than once.",Shrek Forever After
30,ElMaruecan82,"Shrek coming full circle with himself, to be happy, and live happily ever after... once and for all...",7,8 August 2016,"Concluding my review of ""Shrek the Third"", I wondered what was awaiting the green ogre for its fourth adventure. After meeting his true love, her parents, getting ready for and having children, a fourth part could only let me expect something on the level of a midlife crisis. Granted the animators have enough imagination to create something satisfying, if not overwhelming, I still didn't think I would get so close.In ""Forever After"", Shrek is in the same state we left him at the end of the third opus, enjoying his role as a father, teaching his triplets how to properly burp, waving at the tourists who visit the swamp and inviting Donkey, his hybrid kids, and Puss to tell their adventures' stories. But while his life seems to be governed by the same routine, his enthusiasm slowly fades out, he starts to question the meaning of his life, remembering the time when he was a 'wanted' ogre, not a local joke, and when he was alone and free, basically, being the Shrek we meet one decade before. In a way, he echoes the sentiment of some angry fans who miss the good old Shrek.That self-questioning Shrek reflects the way his long journey has transformed him on the surface, but not much in reality, and that's the closer you can get to a midlife crisis in animation's language. And as predictable as this premise sounds, it was perhaps the best one to conclude the monster's existential journey. In the first, he had to to discover his value as a person, as someone capable to love and be loved, and Fiona was the key to this discovery. In the second, he had to learn to love himself. In the third one, , he had to accept to be a father, to engage in a serious relationship. But this issue had less to do with his status as an ogre and this is why I failed to connect it with the previous opuses and I don't think the characters of Charming or Arthur were worthy additions.But in the fourth, we touch the essence of Shrek's personality: being an ogre, scaring people and children, living alone in a remote place, enjoying mud bath and not roaring because a chubby creepy kid asks you to do so (I admit that ""do the roar"" line stuck in my mind and became an instant favorite from the whole franchise). The two middle films questioned the 'happily ever after' assumption but with too mature issues (responsibility, family etc.) Now, an ogre who'd love to be an ogre again, that's the kind of stuff even a kid can get and enjoy, I think it was the only one that could have a fourth film work especially when it tells you that it is the final chapter, so we enjoy it even more because we know this is the last time we see this gallery of characters who visited us every three years, as it became a sort of tradition.Of course, now that Shrek has kids and all must end well that ends well, we know the journey must end with Shrek realizing how lucky he is, and to get the point, he must lose first what he took for granted and this is where the villain Rumplestitk let's just call him Rumple, makes his entrance. Rumple makes a Faustian deal with Shrek: he gets one day where he is unknown and can scare people while Rumple can take any day of Shrek's life. The problem is that ever since ""Back to the Future"", we know that Shrek is signing his own death warrant through this contract. And while Shrek isn't the brightest bulb, it's a bit frustrating not to see the scam.So what must happen happens, he enjoys a day of anonymity before realizing that life has changed for worse Biff Tannen, I mean Rumple became the king of Far Far Away. Alternate reality, that was the trick, how to make new stuff with old one. Shrek must conquer back Fiona's heart to cancel the curse (no curse without an antidote). But that's not as easy as it looks, Fiona became the leader of a group of revolutionary ogres, Donkey works for the witches who are to Rumple what the hyenas were to Scar, and the purpose of the whole second act (the less exciting one) is to allow Fiona to fall again in love with Shrek, so that Shrek can celebrate Christmas with his friends, and ""gives his petals back to Zuzu"".The second act left me a bit cold, I liked the way the usual characters behaved differently by still being true to their nature (fat Puss in Boots was fun to some extent), but it's only the third act that brings all the emotionality, the ending that the third one needed to have. I won't spoil the final lines, but they were so beautiful I wished no one would speak after that, and no one did. It was also a great nod to the first film to have ""I'm a Believer' concluding the last one, as to remind us of this 2001 year where Shrek became a cultural phenomenon, an achievement from a non-Disney character.And it's a deserved reputation because there's a Shrek in all of us, we all have personal issues, we all wish to be different, taller, skinnier, and we all question our past. I myself spend my life wishing I hadn't made this or that mistake, but then I realize that all my mistakes, one leading to another, made me meet my wife and have a beautiful daughter. So it was all worth it. I don't know if I'll live happily ever after that, but it just allows me to look forward to the future with sheer optimism.And now that Shrek has learned the lesson, we can wish him to live happily ever after, once and for all.",Shrek Forever After
31,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Shrek goes fourth.,7,22 February 2018,"'Shrek Forever After (2010)' is perhaps the least funny in its franchise, but it makes up for this by having an inventive 'what-if?' story that explores sappy but successful themes and ultimately rounds out the series in style. It's better than 'Shrek The Third (2007)' because of this, with its engaging narrative and inventive action sequences setting it apart from that likeable but generic entry, but it isn't a patch on 'Shrek (2001)' or 'Shrek 2 (2004)'. The reinvention of its core dynamic really is what makes it so successful, as it's sometimes surprising and often inspired. It also absolutely nails its ending.

Plus it wasn't as good and had a really short run time at well under 90 minutes. Nothing made me laugh in this, but I'm sure kids will still love it. This time, Shrek signs a deal with Rumpelstilskin to erase a day of his life so he can be a scary orge again. What he doesn't know is Rumpelstilskin has plans to take over Farawayland and be king. To do this, he must see that Shrek never saved Fiona from the dragon. So, Shrek is taken to an alternate world where he never met Fiona and must get her to fall in love again or disappear forever.

He meets the Rumpelstiltskin and he grants Shrek's wish. However all the creatures he knows don't exist anymore and he has 24 hours to set everything right.Well we all know what to expect from the voice actors.

They live in their wee cottage in the woods, with their darling, burping baby ogre triplets. Each day is pretty much the same as any other, as the happy couple feed their children, take out the soiled nappies, and deal with repairs. At supper, they break bread with their good friends, Donkey (Eddie Murphy) and Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas). But, one day, at the triplets first birthday party, Shrek reaches a breaking point. Why he, Shrek, used to scare villagers with his roar and reek havoc and now he's changing diapers? So, he walks out and heads to the home of Rumplestiltskin. What the frustrated ogre wants is ONE day to be his old, fearsome self. Rumpy is happy to oblige, for he always has a contract with fine, fine print. Thus, when Shrek signs the agreement and happily goes off to scare a few towns, he doesn't realize that he has given Stilts the power to erase the day he, Shrek, was born and complete a long-ago contract he almost made with Fiona's parents to take their castle in exchange for finding their daughter a husband. Got that, everyone? So, in a very short period of time, Shrek is captured and held prisoner at the castle that is now Rumpy's, Donkey is a beast of burden for the dwarf's witchy companions and Fiona has become the fearsome leader of an underground liberation movement against the midget. Only another ""true love's kiss"" from Fiona will make things the way they were. Will it happen? This is a fun fourth sequel to the original and quite imaginative in animation and dialogue. The cast is wonderful, as always, with Myers, Diaz, Banderas, Julie Andrews and the rest doing fine work. Especially noteworthy is Murphy's turn, for he is just flat-out great as the fast-talking, excitable donkey. Then, too, the look of the film is gorgeous, with vibrant color and excellent animation, a true visual treat. As for the storyline, it has plenty of zest and originality and works characters from the fairy tale repertoire into its situations with ease. What child or adult, after seeing Rumplestiltskin, the Pied Piper, and Oz's witches, wouldn't clamor for the originals? That, of course, is the hidden treasure of the Shrek series, for the flicks invite viewers to get those volumes of folklore off the shelves of the library and into their hands and minds.

He is unhappy and longing for something more...or maybe even something less...For the series to end, we go back to the very beginning. The film so cleverly explores the 'be careful what you wish for' scenario. 'Shrek Forever After' is much more mature than its predecessors. Thankfully the film lacks the silly humor of 'Shrek the Third'. The antagonist is Rumpelstiltskin, who is by far the best villain yet in the series. He truly is evil.Donkey is hilarious again, as is Puss in Boots. The film paints an interesting picture we can apply to real life, and drew me in like a magnet.

41,filipemanuelneto,An honorable outcome for Shrek.,7,18 January 2021,"After three box office hits (with ""Shrek the Third"" not justifying half the ticket money, to be honest), DreamWorks bet on a fourth production. Truth be told, the producers seem to have learned from the mistakes of the third film and reinforced their attention to the script this time, but there is no way to solve the wear and tear of the material and characters. Without something really different or new, it is just another film to add to the sequence, and the ticket office reflected that, regressing in comparison to the previous film.The script is relatively simple: a year after the birth of their three children, Shrek and Fiona are organizing a grand birthday party for the little ones. They are happy and everything is going well but, to Shrek's dismay, his life has never returned to what it was: instead of the quietness of the swamp and feeling threatening as an ogre, he feels that he has become a tourist attraction that it doesn't scare anyone. Wishing to change everything, but not quite knowing how, he is deceived by the dwarf Rumpelstiltskin, who is an expert in fraudulent and deceptive magical contracts. So, with a signature, he sells him the day he was born, allowing the dwarf to change his whole life and create an alternative reality, where Shrek is sent, and in which he never lived in the swamp, never saved Fiona... and never was born.Honestly, the film seems to me satisfactory in that it does not seem as confused and as absurd as ""Shrek 3"". The story is good, but it can still be somewhat confusing for young people, who may not understand the paradox created in the film. Another problem with the script is the choice of the villain: in fact, unless we are avid fans of fairy tales, few will know who Rumpelstiltskin is! He is an unknown villain. In contrast, the film carries a very didactic message about the importance of valuing what we have while we have it, and not just when we no longer have it. And Fiona has never seemed so heroic to us or so distant from the regular fairy tale princess! We know the rest, we've seen three films in the franchise, and it's hard to do anything else that surprises us. The material is worn out.As has been the rule in this sequence of films, the voice actors have been retained and are almost the same as we have heard about since the first film ""Shrek"". In general, their work continues to be impeccable and, if there are failures, they are due more to the writing of some dialogues, and there are some that are quite cliché and loaded with sentences-made, but this ends up being a lesser evil, compensated largely by the general improvement of the jokes.At a technical level, the film is very good and does not lag behind the first two. The animation was very well done and the visual is excellent, with great colors and an excellent use of light and contrast. The film is much faster than its predecessors, with a lot more action and fighting scenes, and that helps a lot to make the film more appealing and interesting. The soundtrack is good and back to betting on pop music hits like ""Isn't It Strange"" by the Scissor Sisters, as well as a beautiful and welcome cover of the song ""One Love"" in the unmistakable voice of António Banderas.",Shrek Forever After

Many fans will see this as proper closure to the franchise, but that's the closure *they* need, not that the films needed. ""Forever After"" feels much more like a side venture than a full-circle exclamation point for the 21st Century's most beloved animated character.This grand finale follows the classic ""see what your life would be like if nothing ever happened"" plot of ""A Christmas Carol"" and ""It's a Wonderful Life."" Shrek (Mike Myers) is a daddy ogre now whose life has become repetitive and devoid of personal free time. When he finally bursts, a crafty Rumpelstiltskin (Walt Dohrn), the notorious deal-maker of fairy tale lore, strikes up a contract that in exchange for one day of Shrek's life, Shrek can have a day of being a regular ogre again. Shrek signs and suddenly ""Far, Far Away"" is turned upside down and Rumpelstiltskin has become the ruler.The ""don't know what you've got 'til it's gone"" theme gets exhausted early because we've seen this several times before.

The only plus to this story line is that it changes up these characters we know and love just enough to make the fresh again in our minds. Fat kitty Puss in Boots, for one, is quite entertaining. Yet the film never shakes us of the feeling that all this is happening just for the sake of having another ""Shrek"" adventure.Of all the new additions, necessary or not, Rumpelstiltskin is by far the best. Voice actor/writer Walt Dohrn shines in this elevated spotlight. He strikes up the right blend between bad guy we can pity and wacko villain and he's animated in a way that follows suit. Unfortunately, his character mutates from crafty magical underling to eccentric Napoleonic dictator once Shrek signs the contract and he becomes like most other animated despots.The other characters are up to the same tricks that DreamWorks Animation knows worked before and that we're apt to fall for again. Most everyone has at least one funny moment here or there, but ""Shrek Forever After"" is much less hysterical on the whole than previous installments.More significantly absent, however, is the sense of adventure and camaraderie. Previous films took us on actual journeys with these characters and showed us the ups and downs along the way, especially between Donkey and Shrek. In this film, Shrek attempts to make good with all his friends even though they don't know who he is. He's very much on his own and we don't feel all that bad for him because we all knew signing the contract was a bad idea. Certainly this lesson should be heard by children, but adults have learned it already and ""Forever After"" doesn't put a new spin on it.There's no shame in revisiting old friends in the form of familiar and lovable characters, but ""Shrek Forever After"" offers little more than those comforts. A handful of good jokes hit and some things surprise such as Rumpelstiltskin, but if this truly is the end of Shrek, I don't think any of us, fans or not, will have trouble living happily ever after.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",Shrek Forever After
44,lisafordeay,The worst film of 2010 so far,1,21 September 2010,"As much as I loved the other 3 but this was like watching Cinderella III: A twist in time it was so bad. Shrek is now a family man but there is one thing that he misses the most,being a grumpy ogre again so what happens a ugly man named Raspunkin makes a deal with him and suddenly he ends up being in an alternative version of Far Far Away. Now Shrek must find Fiona and make her kiss him or else he will be gone forever. The charcthers were boring,Eddie Murphy wasn't interesting as Donkey anymore and it just wasn't good enough as I would have thought. Some things have being bugging me about this film like why isn't Fiona not a human and why is Puss in Boots a household cat. This and Spiderman 3 is crap. Not worth watching and avoid at all costs.",Shrek Forever After
45,DarkVulcan29,All good things have to come to an end.,8,25 May 2010,"I like Shrek 1 and 2, but part 3 was so annoyingly bland. But Shrek Forever After makes up for that, it had great animation, and a great story also.Shrek and Fiona are settling in family life with there three kids. But the stress of everyday family life begins to catch up with Shrek. And he begins to miss the old days. Ends up running into Rumplestillsken and makes a deal to have a day to himself, but Shrek quickly discovers that he signed his whole life away, and that Donkey, Puss N' Boots, and Fiona don't know him. And Shrek has a whole day to get his life back or he will be erased out existence.Mike Myers is always good, as the voice of the lovable but cantankerous ogre Shrek, Eddie Murphy Cameron Diaz and Antonio Banderas are good in there returning voices as Donkey, Fiona, and Puss N' Boots. And not mention Walt Dornm, Jon Hamm, Craig Robinson, and Jane Lynch, are memorable also. It's a shame that this is the final chapter, but I like I said all good things have to come to an end.",Shrek Forever After
46,freemantle_uk,A massive improvement on Shrek the Third,6,21 May 2011,"When the original Shrek film came out in 2001 it was seen as a revolution, an animated film that looked pretty realistic (realistic in the context a fairy tale setting), a film that was funny, action packed, able to appeal to adults as well as children and most importantly, challenge Pixar's domination when making CGI animated films. But slowly Dreamworks and the Shrek series itself became a shadow of its former self, whilst Shrek 2 was just as good as Shrek but they also made slowly made weaker films like Flushed Away, Shark Tale, Bee Movie and Shrek the Third. But Shrek Forever After is better then Shrek the Third.Starting with a prologue the magical conman Rumpelstilskin (Walt Dohrn) very nearly got his hands on the crown of Far Far Away, when Shrek (Mike Myers) saves Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) and ends up ruining Rumpelstiltskin. Years later it seems that Shrek and Fiona are living a perfect live with their children in the swamp but slowly Shrek gets bore of the routine and being a celebrity. He longs for the glories days of being a true ogre, feared and ends up making a deal with Rumpelstilskin. But of course Rumpelstilskin tricks our hero into a world where he is not born, that Rumpelstilskin is king with witches as his enforcers and ogres are hunted. None of Shrek's friends recognises him and Fiona is leading the resistance. There is only one way to break the curse, true love's kiss.The basic plot is the same as A Wonderful Life, a message about be careful of wish for and that the grass always seems greener on the other side. It is a story that has been done to death in both film and television, particularly in children's programs. But it also serves as a way to get round the fact that Shrek is meant to be a family man and should be content with his happily ever after.Whilst the plot is rudimentary Shrek Forever After is better then Shrek the Third. It is a faster paced film, the jokes are better and its most impressive feature is the action. Shrek has quite a few fights with the Witches who have some really good weapons, like the skull chains and the poison apple gas grenade (a little play on fairy tales, particularly Snow White). On of the keys to Shrek has been the pop-culture reference, but it went stupid by the third film with the medieval school. Likely Shrek Forever After tones it down a bit (since it has done everything possible) with the only major twists being the witches' nightclub and a few film reference, like the Gingerbread Man in a Gladiator parody. The best jokes involve my favourite character Puss in Boots, who turned into a flabby tabby and pampered cat, as he declined from a deadly assassin to a house pet. He has the best lines and the physical humour. You got to love the little guy. Some of the comedy did not work, like the ogre dancing and Shrek's attempts to woo Fiona. But at least the film was more focused then Shrek the Third and Rumpelstilskin is a better villain then Prince Charming, but still not as good or interesting as the villains in the first two films.Like the previous films the animation is crisp, looks realistic and great following movements. Director Mike Mitchell is a live action director, but he adapted to animation and provided family friendly action scenes. There was some dodgy moments, like a witch prostitute (because that what children's films need, sex workers). Mitchell ensured that there was a emotional heart to the film, Shrek trying to woo back Fiona, something lacking in the third film.Shrek Forever After is meant to be the last film of series, but I don't believe it. We all know how Hollywood works, keep making films until the money runs dry. We already got a Puss in Boots spin-off on the way.",Shrek Forever After
47,dfranzen70,Please be the last one,4,9 June 2010,"The Shrek series is ending at least two movies too late. The first two were plenty of fun, but the third one was merely okay and this final one is just tepid, sleepwalking through its own milieu with a script that seems to have had all the jokes removed.As movie series progress, the makers must come up with new situations for their protagonists to experience. So here, Shrek makes a deal with Rumplestiltskin that alters the timelines of him and everyone else in Far, Far Away: he gets one day in which to live as a regular old ogre, just like before he met Fiona and Donkey; in return, Rumplestiltskin gets one of Shrek's days for himself. Turns out he chooses the day the big green fella was born, which (obviously) means a new timeline in which he never saved Fiona from the castle (among other things).It's almost a crutch, having a main character live his life in an alternate timeline, because that way you can have that main character re-meet all his friends. It's like getting a second origin story. And sure enough, we meet several of the characters from the earlier films, such as Pinocchio, the Gingerbread Man, and the Three Little Pigs, not to mention Donkey's red-dragon wife. And naturally, because everyone in this timeline is used to a world in which Rumplestiltskin is large and in charge, Shrek needs to do a little convincing. Not the least of which is to Fiona herself, because – as the ironclad contract with Rumple notes – only true love's kiss can break the deal.The thing I liked most about the first couple of Shrek movies was the unending patter of jokes. Lots of pop-culture references (anachronistically), many of which worked. Lots of gross-out gags, too. And great chemistry between characters, even though they'd just met. It all sort of clicked then, but none of that is apparent in this fourth installment. The humor is, at best, scattershot – and not in the Airplane! style, either, where characters make seemingly hundreds of jokes a minute, with some working and some not. It almost feels as if there were a joke quota here, only it's a maximum of two per reel.Shrek 4 is charmless, too. I know we're supposed to root for Shrek (and the ending isn't unsatisfying), but his adventures trying to get his true love's kiss are sometimes tedious and uninspired. The problem here is that Shrek the character is supposed to be a grouchy bastard, but he's typically offset by the wild extrovertism of Donkey and the sweetness of Fiona. And since this alternate timeline indicates that neither has met Shrek, neither gets to balance out his irascible behavior.There were plenty of little tykes in the theater this morning, and I didn't really hear a lot of oohs and ahhs or laughs. It could be that Shrek Forever After failed to be broad enough in its humor and yet too intense in its action to appeal to its core audience. The series can finally rest.",Shrek Forever After
48,GiraffeDoor,I feel sorry for the Goose but otherwise...,8,18 August 2019,"I re-watched this today and it was better than I remembered.The thing with a sequel is that it's easy to hold it to a particular standard rather than judge it fairly on its own terms. Shrek 1 sort of captured lightning in a bottle and Shrek 2 was a great sequel because it answered all the questions that Shrek 1 raised. Shrek the Third was a little bit of an embarrassment albeit a passable embarrassment but you can tell it did not come from a good place creatively. The complete absence of Arthur in this movie is testimony to that.The set up here is a lot more captivating than ""third"". Rather than the formulaic progression from married to pregnant the franchise steers into its skid by having Shrek lament his own new life, a shadow of his former self, nostalgic for his care free bachelor days. It's a little gross but I can't say it isn't contextually justified even if I don't have a lot tolerance for flatulence of any type.It annoyed me how the movie seems to want me to think Shrek is wholly in the wrong with Fiona not being very supportive. Quick rant: it's important to let parents feel comfortable saying that parenting, though the best job they've ever had, is still the hardest and it can be a bit much. It's indeed a story of how sometimes we need perspective to see how good we have it but it does it well. It's uncomfortable how the ever accumulating list of little frustrations lead to a crescendo of trouble on the kids' birthday bash and it really puts you on Shrek's side.I remember being a bit put out to see a new antagonist out of the Blue but Rumple makes a delicious baddie. He follows the series' trend of effeminate villains but at the same time he is somewhat of a double subversion to see a fairytale villain be the actual villain, not the princes and fairy god mothers we've had so far.I feel I short changed the movie when I though of it as desperately inverting its own characters for cheap laughs but it really isn't that at all. Not only is is good fun to see Ogres as a race, not just limited to the Shrek family, we get to see the real Fiona of sorts in full warrior ogre mode and she is badass. Donkey is funny and classic and Puss...well I liked him and he has some great moments with Donkey.The animation and visuals are as stunning as you'd expect, it stands out from the other chapters with its rich yellowish apocalyptic color scheme and a lot of witches who have some choice moments. The action sequences are there and the gags are never as excruciating as in ""third"". The music is marvellous: not only are the pop songs brilliantly selected the original score will enchant you and thrill you, with all the familiar motifs expertly timed.It will tug at your heart strings as it truly earns its moments of sentimentality. It could not have chosen better closing lines, I'll say that much.I'm truly glad this movie exists. Not only is it pleasant viewing in its own right (clearly below part one and two but a heap above part three) it turns the Shrek sage from a misguided trilogy to a neat tetralogy.Do not get your hopes up or hold in your mind what you think a Shrek movie is supposed to look like and you will not hate this. Well you might, this is just my opinion, the point is this is a tick from me.",Shrek Forever After

50,3xHCCH,A More Mature Shrek - A Worthy Last Installment,7,21 May 2010,"Our favorite ogre Shrek is back for its final installment, and this was presented in 3D. 3D is getting to be norm nowadays, it seemed already ordinary. There are only few scenes in this movie that the 3D actually inspired awe. Maybe watching in 2D would be enough, in retrospect.In Shrek Forever After, Shrek is getting bored with his routine family life and misses his terrorizing ogre days terribly. After his emotional breakdown during his triplet's birthday party, Shrek signs a deal with the devious and cunning Rumpelstiltskin to experience to become real ogre again for a day. However, in return, the contract makes Shrek lose more than he bargained for -- everyone he loves. To break the spell, Shrek to make Fiona fall in love with him all over again.The theme is definitely more mature. The scenes where Shrek was trying to reconnect with the warrior Fiona were actually heartwarming and charming. The lines towards the end about love and family were very nice and touching. Shrek's very last words were a most meaningful parting message to the dads and moms in the audience.Donkey and Puss were there to provide effective comic relief, as always. I did not really like the look of the main villain, Rumpelstiltskin, so that detracted from my total enjoyment. I thought their interpretation of the Pied Piper, however, was quite smart.I thought the Shrek franchise went the wrong direction with its insipid third movie. The first two were really animation classics in terms of comedy and action. This fourth one fortunately went back on track in the correct path. While not in the same caliber as the first two, this was certainly a very good last episode of the franchise.",Shrek Forever After
51,aidanratesmovies,It's a Wonderful Shrek!,8,31 May 2021,"A fun and wildly entertaining addition to the franchise- Shrek Forever After may not meet the same quality as the first two flicks- but it sure is a joy to watch. After watching the third film, I thought there was little that could still be done with this franchise- let alone anything of quality. But despite my doubts, I really did enjoy this film. The animation, for the most part, is incredibly well done- looking clearer than ever- and with a much darker undertone that fits the film perfectly. The animation on the king and queen throughout the film, although they are not shown much, feels a bit unfinished- similar to some other outdated video game graphics of the time. I was never bored during the film, in fact, the only issue I have with the pacing was how fast it could move at times. The story can be a bit predictable at times, but it's very interesting to watch, and it's both heartbreaking and heartwarming to see Shrek in this kind of situation- almost like the film It's a Wonderful Life. The humor is great in this film, so many moments where I couldn't help but laugh- far from the tedious and dull slapstick humor of the last film. In the end, Shrek Forever After is an underrated sequel that allows us to truly sympathize with these iconic characters again- in a way that's both creative and oddly refreshing- despite some obvious inspired marks.My Rating: 8.5/10.",Shrek Forever After

Shrek is missing the good ole days when he wasn't a celebrity, his home wasn't a tourist attraction and his life weren't just chaos. One night he meets Rumpelstiltskin, a tricky little man crafty in magic deal. Shrek signs a deal that he can go back for one day, but of course Rumpelstiltskin has made his own terms. Shrek comes to a reality were Rumpelstiltskin is king and Fiona is the resistance leader of all the repressed ogres. To save them all Shrek must once again woo Fiona.Comments: The fourth installment of the Shrek series, and now it seems the series have come to an end. Or so I hope. Shrek Forever After is still a good movie, still funny, but the concept seem to be a little watered down now. This story stands more on its own legs, an adventure in its own rights. But it doesn't have all the more or less hidden references and homages to different fairy tales and more modern movies, stuff that elevated the previous movies from very good to stellar. So this seems like the time to end the series, while things are still good.Because this is a good movie, it is funny, but is more prominently a movie for the kids than the previous were, which everybody could enjoy. I still enjoyed it, but it wasn't as hilarious as the others, and simply didn't meet the high expectations. The only that seemed to get better, and the best in this movie, was Donkey and Murphy's portrayal of him. Added to that was quite a lot good jokes or just fun situations, but nothing really spectacular. So it's time to put the ogres to sleep for good this time (before anybody does something we all will regret) 6/10",Shrek Forever After
53,ShootingShark,Fourth Shrek Film Is Enjoyable But Undistinguished Animated Fare,5,12 July 2010,"Bored with his family life Shrek yearns for the time when he was a fearsome ogre, and signs an ill-advised deal with Rumpelstiltskin to get his old life back for a day. But this changes history, makes Rumpelstiltskin the King of Far Far Away, and Shrek must figure out how to turn back time and win his true love Fiona's heart all over again.The fourth movie in the Shrek series is affable, pleasant and as beautifully animated as the previous films. I like the way these movies are slightly less wholesome than Pixar's, with plenty of bodily functions and more neurotic characters, and the kingdom of Far Far Away is always a funny place to visit. However, as always with sequels, there is a law of diminishing returns. The movie has some funny twists, like making Puss In Boots a big bloated fatso, and the romantic theme has plenty of heart, but it's just not as much fun as the original picture. The voice cast all return and enjoy themselves, and as usual Murphy steals the show as the lovable Donkey. There's also a fine score by series composer Harry Gregson-Williams and as in the previous films some amusing pop song interludes mixed in - notably Top Of The World by The Carpenters and For Once In My Life by Stevie Wonder. A good movie for kids and undiscerning animation enthusiasts, but I think this particular fairy tale might come to an end now. Shot in digital 3D with a big 2.35:1 aspect ratio for an animated feature; this review is of the conventional print since I don't think I believe in all that 3D gimmickry.",Shrek Forever After

55,SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain,Shrek Forever After (2010),6,14 December 2011,"Usually an alternative reality plot is just a gimmick used by lazy writers. Imagine if Puss was fat, if Shrek had never been born etc. Such ideas leave limitless ideas for writers, and they don't even have to try. Shrek has always leaned toward the obvious ""what if"" scenarios. Part 2 saw Shrek and DOnkey become handsome, part 3 had Donkey and Puss trade bodies, and so on. Now an entire film is based around this idea. It shouldn't work, but it kind of does. This is certainly a step up from 3. There are more laugh out loud moments, and I even got 3 big belly laughs. The action scenes are exciting, but too concerned with 3-D, making it distracting. Like the other Shrek films before it, it has too many songs playing over the scenes. Probably hoping to shift as many copies as the fantastic Shrek 2 soundtrack. The film starts off with some great examples of Shrek's growing frustration. It's easy to see why Shrek wants his life back to normal. The quick cut montage, followed by the birthday party from hell, leads us into a believable situation where Shrek signs the deal. We also have a wonderful villain, voiced perfectly by Dohrn. This wont gain any new fans. Nor is it a satisfactory end to the franchise. What it is, is an enjoyable spin on the characters with some nice jokes.",Shrek Forever After
56,Matt_Layden,"Pointless addition, but is better than third.",5,28 March 2011,"My biggest problem with this so called final installment is the fact that the entire movie does not need to exist. The plot itself is something that screams 'no more creativity'. Let's take a look shall we? Shrek feels empty inside as he has to do the same old chores over and over again, his life has become so redundant he ends up hating it. He wants things to go back to the way they were before he became and father, met Fiona and knew any of his friends. He wants to be a lonely Ogre again. So he makes a deal with Rumpelstiltskin and he gets his wish. Now we are thrust into an alternate reality where he never met Fiona, Donkey, or his friends. There is a catch though, if he doesn't kiss Fiona before a certain time, he is stuck in this alternate reality. He now must get Fiona to fall in love with him again in order to put things back to the way they were before he was tricked. To me, once you are telling stories about alternate realities and what ifs...you know the series is done for. For some strange reason they all thought there was one more left in them, sadly the answer is no. I will say this though, the 4th one is indeed better than the garbage known as Shrek the Third, but that isn't saying much. It fails to capture the magic that the first one had, or even the second, which I am also not a big fan of. To me, Shrek was always a one film story. Three sequels later, we are treated to a slowly dying franchise. The animation is great, as always, if still a bit behind Pixar outings. The kids will no doubt be entertained by it, it's colourful enough to keep their attention, which seems to be the case with every kids movie. It's the adults that have to see it with them (or on their own) who will be the disappointed ones.",Shrek Forever After

This is even better than the original.Everything about it hits the mark. Pace, character, humour, setbacks, tension. If there's a standout it's the hilarious Puss in Boots.A few tiny reservations. Animation for the dance scenes could be even better - the witches rave is an awesome idea and should blow the roof off. Overall there should have been some darker touches in the music selection. About halfway through the tension slacks off a nudge, I think because it feels like the Kiss is inevitable - but they pile on the trouble after that and nothing is certain.Huge entertainment. I luvsed it.",Shrek Forever After
58,moviewizguy,A Surprisingly Dark Finale for the Franchise,8,23 May 2010,"Shrek is feeling over-domesticated in the fourth installment. He has lost his roar. It used to send villagers running away in terror. Now they run to him and ask him to sign their pitchforks and torches. To regain his ogre mojo, he strikes a deal with Rumpelstiltskin. The pact goes awry and Shrek must confront what life would be like in Far Far Away if he had never existed. That translates into Donkey being forced into cart-pulling duty, fat and lazy Puss in Boots trading his sword for a pink bow and the underhanded Rumpelstiltskin ruling the kingdom.It's official: Dreamworks has crap marketing when promoting their movies. As some of you might have noticed, the marketing for the final chapter of Shrek seemed lukewarm and tepid, to say the least. Fortunately, the film is anything but that. In fact, I have to say that SHREK 4 is a surprisingly dark finale for the franchise. SHREK 4 plays out like IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE with Shrek being the protagonist. The main reason this film succeeds is because there is a strong story to be told, unlike part 3. The story plays out as straightforward as it could be, which works really well. There are no twists and turns and unnecessary subplots. This way, we feel more connected with Shrek and his goal.The heart, which was lacking in the last film, is back in here, which is more of a welcome. There are a lot of depressing and serious moments in here as well as some very moving scenes that will make some people cry. However, all is not somber. There are plenty of hilarious moments in here too, most of which are coming from Donkey and Puss in Boots, as well as some new ogre characters. Other new characters include Rumpelstiltskin, a fantastic and devilish villain, and the ingenious use of Pied Piper.I would also like to point out the fantastic soundtrack by Harry Gregson-Williams. He incorporates the previous themes in the series and made them much more personal and heartfelt than ever before. The use of the 3D is also put to good use, rather than have things pop out for every five minutes. Maybe the only complaint I had is that the climax battle is a bit weak, much like IRON MAN 2. While not as great as the first two, I much prefer this film to be the ending to the series than the disappointing third film. With a strong story, great characters, and a good moral, SHREK 4 may as well be the first great film of the summer.",Shrek Forever After

The images and visual effects are gorgeous, the puppet characters magnificent in their expressions almost human and Shrek himself maintains vivid the idea that unlike the clichés according to which only beautiful is good, ugly can also be good and even an ogre can be virtuous. The story is worth what it's worth being almost a mere pretext of the image show. In this movie the good Shreck becomes tired of domestic life and does the mistake of asking a mischievous sorcerer to put him back for one day in his past life of typical ogre. He pays a high price for this mistake and endangers his way of living which was happy after all, according to the principle that we only value what we have after losing it.

Heads Off to Eddie Murphy and Antonio Banderas who brought a incredible and much needed humor which was totally missing from the Shrek 3. John Meyers and Cameron Diaz did fantastic job as always with their vocal talents. The graphics & colors of the movie was simply mind blowing.

62,Troy_Campbell,Shrek and co feel stale today.,5,17 June 2010,"This fourth instalment tries hard to bring something fresh to the franchise, however Shrek and co just feel stale today, nine years on from their glorious introduction. Donkey has gone from causing belly laughs and sprouting quotable one-liners to being annoying and repetitive; not overly great for the character which has always been the true drawcard for the series. Though it is the big green man himself who has become the most tiresome; his constant whinging and heavy Scottish accent the source for serious boredom. Especially since this sequel has amped up the seriousness and soppiness, majority of which comes from Shrek. There are a few supporting players which snare a laugh here and there, Puss-in-Boots and Butter Pants – a manly looking child with a memorable voice – being two worth mentioning.Fortunately the in-charge Mitchell has a solid handle on the action sequences. There are a number of set pieces – Shrek and Fiona's climactic escape from Rumpelstiltskin's clutches is a highlight – that are exciting and enjoyable, but they act like a double-edged sword and also serve to emphasize how dull the slower, talkative scenes really are. If only the cast and crew could inject the familiar characters and run-of-the-mill story with the same amount of energy and enthusiasm, perhaps Shrek Forever After could have been a more fitting closure.The one (and only) thing improved upon since the first movie – the animation – is delightful to look at mind you. The picture is crystal-clear and the third dimension has been utilised properly. There are a handful of instances where the 'coming-at-you' gimmickry rears its ugly head, which the kiddies don't seem to mind, however for the most part Mitchell grasps the true effectiveness of 3D quite well and adds depth to the visuals which in turn allows his on screen universe to expand.Dreamworks has said for a long time that this will be Shrek's last adventure, if this is the best they can come up with for the famous ogre and his friends then let's hope they stick to their guns.2.5 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)",Shrek Forever After

Shrek only has 24 hours to figure out how to return his life to normal, and get Fiona to fall in love with him again. It all comes down to this.

65,IonicBreezeMachine,"While it has some story issues, Shrek Forever After marks a decent conclusion to Shrek's story.",7,21 August 2021,"Now settled into family life, Shrek (Mike Myers) goes through a year as a father raising his three triplets with his wife Fiona (Cameron Diaz). As the days wear on, the repetition and tedium of reliving the same exact day dealing with constant demands from his children, tourists and fans who don't respect boundaries, and unannounced visits from Donkey (Eddie Murphy) and Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) begins to wear on him. Things come to a head when at his children's first birthday party a series of mishaps and annoyances pile up to the point Shrek releases his frustration punching the cake and yelling at Fiona expressing how he missed the days where he was a ""real ogre"" who was feared by villagers and without responsibilities. Overhearing Shrek's frustration, Rumpelstiltskin (Walt Dohrn) sees an opportunity and concocts a plan to make a deal with Shrek as a way to seize power over Far Far Away as he had failed to do years earlier with Fiona's parents. Shrek although initially hesitant accepts the deal that will give him one day as a ""real ogre"" in exchange for a day he won't remember. After Shrek accepts the deal he gleefully starts reliving his pastime of terrorizing villagers but soon his fantasy becomes a nightmare when he realizes the day taken was the day he was born which has resulted in Rumpelstiltskin turning Far Far Away into a tyrannical nightmare with Ogres hunted down by his witch armies. Now Shrek must navigate this strange unfamiliar world to undo the spell in 24 hours or cease to exist.Following the success of Shrek 2, Dreamworks executive Jeffrey Katzenberg made plans to expand the Shrek franchise with development on Shrek 3 and 4 and tentative plans for Shrek 5. Shrek 3 (Shrek the Third) while pulling in decent box office was down from the gross of Shrek 2 and had taken a major hit critically in what was probably a tell tale sign of the franchise. With Holiday specials like Shrek the Halls and Scared Shrekless, not to mention the avalanched of merchandise and commercial tie-ins, it's easy to see how Shrek became of victim of its own success and corporate greed diluting the charm of its once novel approach. Now of course movies are both art and business, but if a movie is good enough you won't think about the business side, and in Shrek the Third's case it really felt very calculated and passionless and only existed for the sake of making yet another Shrek movie. Shrek Forever After while not the highest point for the series, is a fitting and enjoyable, albeit slightly rough and uneven, send off to the franchise.When we meet Shrek this time around we see Shrek going through something of a midlife crisis as he lives each day in a near identical manner with the same jokes, observations, occurrences, and visits losing their novelty and eventually Shrek ceases finding charm in them and instead meets the days with a mixture of dread, tension and annoyance. It's a really good character performance from Myers who gives us a more aged and world weary Shrek who although he may not look it personality wise carries the weight of time. While the impetus of what sets Shrek off on his emotional blow-up is well built, Shrek's reaction to Fiona where he basically says he wishes he didn't have a family without explicitly saying it is maybe a tad too heavy with Shrek not even registering a momentary expression of regret or shame for having expressed something that hurtful, while its understandable why Shrek would be feeling the way he does, I think the blow up could have been refined so it felt in line with the character.The selling point in Shrek Forever After is definitely in how it plays with the Alternate Universe/It's a Wonderful Life type scenario where the animators get to play around with the world of Shrek if Shrek had never been born. There's not only some creative visual jokes based around how different the characters are (such as a gladiator Gingy who fights against living animal crackers with a lollipop), but there's also a strong sense of dread in the atmosphere as the once colorful land of Far Far Away has been turned into an unsettling run down version of itself. We see the same landmarks and settings from the previous films (save for Shrek the Third) but they're made new again thanks to some creative takes on their presence in this world. Walt Dohrn's Rumpelstiltskin is an amazing villain more than making up for the lackluster Prince Charming from Shrek the Third and gives us a weaselly, conniving, opportunist who gleefully swindles, cheats, and extorts with a sneering grin upon his face.The only downside with the plot is while we do see most of the Shrek universe in an intriguing ""What if"" fashion, we don't get to see all facets of it. For example the villains of Farquaad, Fairy Godmother, and Prince Charming are never addressed in terms of what happened to them in this world and I feel like that could've made for interesting reinterpretations of these characters that could've been played around with. And while it's a minor point, the lack of Justin Timberlake's King Arthur is head scratching as while he wasn't the best character, he was still the king of Far Far Away and had a relationship with Shrek and probably deserved at least a line of acknowledgment. There's also some new Ogre characters played by Jon Hamm, Jane Lynch, and Craig Robinson who are fine I suppose, but it feels like it defeats the purpose of an alternate universe introducing a barrage of new characters when the whole appeal of this premise is seeing how fan favorites are in a new unfamiliar setting. With that said I did enjoy the take on Fiona.Shrek Forever After is flawed, but unlike the third film it does feel like there's an attempt to do justice to these characters before sending them off. With a stronger villain and tighter pacing and direction the humor and heart lands more often than it stumbles and while the alternate universe gimmick isn't taken as far as it could've, it does just enough to make itself a worthy entry to the franchise. Much better than Shrek the Third, but doesn't quite reach the level of Shrek 2.",Shrek Forever After

Also makes us aware how some things appear much more worthy when we are left without them, then only we become aware of their true value. Bit abusive and disgusting, but even that is good when used only as a joke and in fantasy.",Shrek Forever After
67,Beta_Gallinger,I agree with those who say it's not as good as the first two but better than the third,7,28 December 2010,"Released nine years after the first installment in the ""Shrek"" movie franchise, ""Shrek Forever After"" is the fourth and final installment. I've seen all the films in the franchise through the years, starting with the first one in late 2001, in the home video format. ""Shrek 2"" was the only one in the franchise which I saw in the theatre, and that was a memorable experience. In 2008, I revisited the first two films, having not seen either of them in several years, and thought they were still impressive, but then watched ""Shrek the Third"" for the first time, the year after its release, and found it to be mediocre, not unlike many other viewers. There was a good chance the fourth installment wouldn't be any better than the third, but now that I've seen it, over two years after I last watched any of the previous ""Shrek"" movies, I would say that it is.Shrek now lives in his swamp with Princess Fiona and their three ogre children, but he is now experiencing a midlife crisis. He is constantly getting unwanted attention, with nobody afraid of him anymore, and feels that he isn't much of an ogre anymore, missing the days when he could scare people away and have his privacy. The evil Rumpelstiltskin, whose plans to become king of Far Far Away were ruined when Shrek rescued Princess Fiona, tricks the ogre into taking his offer for him to live like an ogre again for one day in exchange for one day of his past erased. Shrek soon finds himself in an alternate world, where he is happy to find that he can scare everyone around him again. However, he then learns that in this world, Rumpelstiltskin is now the oppressive ruler of the kingdom, and ogres are used for slave labour! It turns out that the day the con artist erased was the day the ogre was born, so his whole existence has been reversed, and he will disappear tomorrow at sunrise! Shrek manages to escape from the castle with Donkey, and soon learns that the only way to save himself and return to where he was before he signed the contract is through true love's kiss, but he will have to do this before the next sunrise, so he doesn't have much time! The first part of this movie, showing Princess Fiona's parents almost signing the kingdom over to Rumpelstiltskin before learning that their daughter has been rescued, is a memorable beginning, and shows that the animation in the ""Shrek"" franchise is still great. It's funny when Rumpelstiltskin angrily tears out pages of a book while narrating. There are some good laughs as we see Shrek's current living situation, though the ogre children's bodily functions may not always be that funny. The story looks very interesting around this point, and the entertainment continues as Shrek enters the alternate world, but may go downhill a little when the witches first appear. However, throughout the film, the plot is intriguing enough for the most part, a story in which Shrek realizes he didn't know how good he had it until it was too late, and the animation is still unsurprisingly amazing. Rumpelstiltskin, voiced here by Walt Dohrn, isn't the best antagonist, but he can be funny at times. The ogre's adventure is a fairly exciting one with some notably touching scenes. I also have to give ""Shrek Forever After"" credit for the times when it made me laugh (such as Shrek telling Donkey not to touch the waffles in the forest, but Donkey won't listen), even though the movie as a whole could have been much more consistent with the laughs.Since I watched this fourth and final installment in the franchise over two years after watching the third, and my memory of ""Shrek the Third"" isn't as clear as it could be, I can't explain everything that makes this one the stronger effort of the two, but two reasons might be the absence of the fairy tale princesses who were introduced in the 2007 film, and the fact that no characters in this final chapter are voiced by Justin Timberlake. There are obviously other reasons as well. While not all ""Shrek"" fans consider ""Shrek Forever After"" to be a very good way to end the franchise, I'm one of those who thinks it's not the best installment, but not the worst. In terms of quality, of the four movies, I would say this one comes in third, with its immediate predecessor in last place. Also, as a film starring Mike Myers made after ""The Love Guru"", it sure is better than that lousy 2008 comedy. I don't suggest you watch this fourth installment thinking the franchise ended as strongly as it began, but you could still find that it's decent family entertainment for fans of the very popular computer generated ogre.",Shrek Forever After
68,vip_ebriega,"As happily ever after's go, this one ain't half bad.",7,11 June 2010,"The final chapter in the SHREK series recalls that familiar term ""Be careful what you with for"". I too was careful at what I wished SHREK FOREVER AFTER would be. After the disappointing SHREK THE THIRD, the bar isn't set high for this supposedly final chapter. It's never going to compare with the superior first two, but if Dreamworks Animation really wanted to conclude their beloved property with this, they might as well give it all that it has. SHREK FOREVER AFTER, while certainly more elaborate than its immediate predecessor, is not the most original of the series, but if this is really a happily ever after for Shrek, at least he went out on a good note rather than a disappointing one.The story is basically IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE with Shrek (voiced by Mike Myers) trading places with George Bailey. Shrek's life couldn't be better: he has his loving wife Fiona (voiced by Cameron Diaz) and three kids, best buddies Donkey (Eddie Murphy) and Puss (Antonio Banderas) are current visitors, he's got his swamp back, and above all his days as the flesh-eating ogre are way behind him. But everyday of the same day-to-day rituals can get too routine for our big green ogre. If only he could wish he could be that flesh-eating ogre again! His wish is granted when he meets the crafty Rumpelstiltskin (voiced by Walt Dohrn), but it at a terrible catch. Before you can say ""Happily Ever After no more!"", Shrek is trapped in a depressing alternate universe where he was never born and none of his pals know who he is.The real treat of the premise of FOREVER AFTER is that it gives us a chance to warm up with these characters again and recall why we loved them in the first place, and then find out a few new reasons to like them all over again. We already know these characters and we have met them before, and this might just serve as a reunion after the occasional slog of the previous follow-up. Unlike its immediate predecessor as well, this one actual has a storyline instead of the simple premise to be used to hang pop culture reference and in-jokes. It's not a great storyline and certainly not anything original, but it's a step on the right direction. Director Mike Mitchell has at least put Shrek right back on track, and not a moment too soon. If this is really the series' finale, the creators have at least done a credible job at reminding us of the appeal that these characters. In a way, SHREK FOREVER AFTER is a satisfying conclusion, if not a grand one.Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.",Shrek Forever After
69,jon.h.ochiai,Shrek Gets It Right,8,4 June 2010,"""Shrek Forever After"" is actually a return to the engaging storytelling of the first and second movies. Granted the story by Josh Kalusner and Darren Lemke is a take on ""It's a Wonderful Life""—not entirely original. Shrek 4 is better than the last sequel and not a great as the first two movies. It is about falling in love all over again. So I was on board with that. Eddie Murphy is hysterical returning as Donkey. Mike Myers and Cameron Diaz also give their best in this clumsy sweet story. Director Mike Mitchell does a great job of capping the pop culture gags—some of the hip-hop Pied Piper jokes are inspired. Eddie Murphy is amazing with his renditions of retro classics.In ""Forever After"" Shrek (Myers) has become disenchanted with domestic life and the tedious routine. Life is good—he has a loving wife and 3 beautiful ogre kids. However, Shrek flips out at the 1 year Birthday party for his kids. He misses the days when he was the feared ogre. Fiona (Diaz) tells Shrek, ""You have everything. You're the only one who doesn't see it."" Rashly Shrek signs a deal with Rumpelstiltskin (funny Walt Dohrn) where he trades a day in his life so that he can spend a day as the feared Ogre. However, the forfeit day is the day he was born.Shrek soon realizes what has happened. Fortunately, Donkey (Murphy), who doesn't know Shrek in this alternate universe, points out there is a loop hole. Shrek discovers that since he never rescued his beloved Fiona from the Dragon Castle, she rescued herself and has reinvented herself as the Valkyrie ogre leading the resistance against the tyranny of Rumpelstiltskin. Fiona has no idea who Shrek is. Can Shrek and Fiona fall in love all over again? There is a hysterical ""rock-um sock-um"" robots fight scene with both. At the story arc Shrek confesses to Fiona that ""The best part of the day was that I got to fall in love with you all over again."" ""Shrek Forever After"" gets it right in the end. And is really worth seeing.",Shrek Forever After
70,Benjamin-M-Weilert,Adequate closure without being too original.,7,19 May 2019,"Once again, we see the effect of Moore's Law over the last decade. A beautiful looking film that is incredibly realistic in its scenery, but cartoonish enough to not fall into the uncanny valley.Not many new characters in this fourth iteration of the Shrek franchise, which probably helped keep the plot from gaining too many sub-plots. And yet, with a classic ""It's a Wonderful Life"" storyline, it can glide into some adequate closure without having to be too terribly original.",Shrek Forever After
71,fernandoschiavi,ninety minutes of reasonable entertainment in which the audience smiles sporadically due the familiarity with the characters,6,20 May 2021,"Shrek's first film was cool for making fun of all the clichés used in Disney films for decades, with its beautiful and innocent princesses who sang with the birds. The second was able to repeat the same formula, inserting good elements into the universe created by the previous one, but without advancing too much narratively. Subversive, politically incorrect humor and a positive message about alternative beauty standards continued. Although slightly higher than the previous one, this fourth part of the franchise remains an exhausted exercise in revisiting the most successful episodes. The source of ideas dried up and along with it the agile and ironic humor, giving way to action and gags that are not always funny.When the third came, the expectation was so great that the disappointment was predictable. And behold, we are faced with the fourth film, Shrek Forever, the final chapter. Shrek continues his midlife crisis, already experienced in the previous film. His married life is in a worn out routine, every day seems identical to the previous one. Nobody else fears the swamp ogre, on the contrary, it becomes a tourist attraction. When the opportunity arises, Shrek ends up discovering what his life would be like if he had never been born.In this fourth chapter, director Mike Mitchell (Sky High, Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked) makes his debut in computer animation, postponing a little the happily ever after of the once loathed Green Ogre and his family. It is interesting to note that the character Artie, who was the motto of the past film, is not even mentioned here, with the only references to the past tape being the children of the title character and the absence of King Harold from the events that take place in the ""present"" of plot. If Shrek the Third (2007) already seemed an unnecessary addition to a franchise that featured two good films, Shrek Forever makes Dreamworks' insistence on recycling its most profitable animated series even more evident. In a film that already begins at a point where the central characters live ""happily ever after,"" the way found by writers Josh Klausner and Darren Lemke to create any kind of conflict was to turn Shrek into a character bored and tired of his quiet life with Fiona and their three children.Almost every franchise, at some point, decides to make an alternative universe story, in which someone was never born or some other circumstance is changed. Blame the fantastic ""Happiness is not bought"" for this narrative thread. The problem is that it is difficult to tell this type of plot in such a limited space of time and still want to put more stuff. ""Shrek Para Semper"" is exactly 93 minutes long, already counting on the credits, making it impossible to explore the various premises that the film has in an organic way.The premise is sufficient for the new adventure to focus on the idea of recycling the original episode, paying homage to other elements along the way. In the reunion with Burro, the scene is basically identical to the original of 2001, with the difference that Ogro now remembers his friendship. Furthermore, in the musical moment when Shrek again enjoys the life of a monster, the scythes, pitchforks and hoes flying towards him while he happily runs through green fields allude to the opening of the second episode. And if it's funny to know the alternative versions of classic characters, like the Puss in Boots Garfield mode or the Biscuit a ""Cream Cracker"" version, others are uninteresting fulfilling only a specific narrative purpose like the Dragon and especially Fiona, totally depersonalized, which it is a surprise, as he leads an army of ogres while regretting not having been saved from the tower by a prince. Rumpelstiltskin, on the other hand, the human version of Gollum obsessed with wigs, lacks the evil of the Fairy Godmother of the second episode to be the great villain announced.Although nothing original, the plot opens up some interesting possibilities for fans of the series, such as new perspectives for well-known characters and some games with elements already established in previous films. Another big problem in this fourth part is the excess of ""dramatic"" scenes and the very syrupy tone of the production, typical of this type of alternative story, contradict the whole spirit of the franchise, in a gigantic ball by screenwriters Josh Klausner and Darren Lemke. What still holds the film are Shrek's two great partners. Donkey and Puss in Boots are hilarious as always and can really remind us that this is a movie from the series. Scenes like Donkey ""meeting"" Shrek for the first time or asking about his children in the real universe are great! Already the Cat has been giving a beautiful fat in its alternative version and lost its fighting spirit, at least to a certain extent, giving us fun moments.Like every film in the series, Shrek Forever has its share of montages packed with pop songs, various references and games with fairy tales, but the humor that used to be one of the greatest attractions of the franchise ends up losing strength. The writers, apparently, inserted a joke or visual gag every five minutes of projection just to remind the viewer that they are facing a comedy film. Humor also oscillates between clever and completely silly jokes, in an attempt to please both adults and children, who are probably not very interested in alternative realities or in the protagonist's midlife crisis. There are also some action sequences that only serve to ensure that the audience is not bored and to show the effects in 3D. And at this point the DreamWorks Animation animators get it right by balancing action scenes in which 3-D shows its great differential and the depth between the different planes.The great asset of Mike Mitchell's film is the bet on the viewer's affective memory. A trip to the first film, with details that please just remember the fun that was in its origin. Not that the new film ceases to entertain. There are quite fun moments, like Shrek's outbreak in the face of routine and the first appearance of Puss in Boots. But there is also little new in the story. The soundtrack itself follows this path, when reusing music from previous films. In addition, a good part of the supporting actors only shows up in this film, without really participating in the story. A mere appearance to, once again, use the viewer's memory in relation to his previous presence in the series.In contrast, the look of the feature is great, with emphasis on the textures of the characters and objects and the wonderful digital photography, which is perfect. The art direction is happy to show a more abandoned, so distant, apocalyptic and ruled by Rumpelstiltiskin and abuses the darker scenes in the ogres' refuge and several night scenes, but with enormous merit for the director who did not turn into a ""heavier"" film, maintaining the traditional lightness of the story. The soundtrack, both incidental and orchestrated, does not stand out.Overall, the film is a great journey of redemption and shows that sometimes we don't really know what we have until we lose it. The whole film is about valuing: true friendships, the great love of our lives, children who are everything to parents, the respect they receive from everyone, in short, a life that we often do not perceive, but that is happy and practically perfect. Clearly, what is noticeable is that after the third film in the series, humor and sarcasm was lost and gave way to more emotional scenes, with a huge concern with the dramatic arc and ending with great moral and life lessons.There is also a feeling that this is really the final chapter of the saga. The end of the film suggests this, although it is not at all difficult to imagine a fifth film being made. Regardless, Shrek Forever is a kind of tribute to the entire series. A revisit to what was shown in the previous films, in order to emphasize the importance of everything that happened. Although there are no major innovations, nor the clever humor of the first two features, Shrek Forever at least guarantees the franchise a more dignified ending than ending in the third film. In general, it is a pleasant and entertaining film, but completely forgettable. Like several other unnecessary blockbuster sequels, it provides about ninety minutes of reasonable entertainment in which the audience smiles sporadically due the familiarity with the characters. At the end of the day, Shrek Forever is a story that seems too small for the cinema, something that might fit in a spin-off, a TV special.",Shrek Forever After

The opening sequence of the movie see's shrek in domestic bliss but longing for his former life. The stupor is a fairly good analogy for the film itself.

And it was my mom's first 3D movie.The film starts where it left off from the ""The Third."" Shrek starts to adjust to domesticated life with his wife Fiona and their ogre triplets. But he started to miss the old days when ogres were feared and hunted. And things got out of hand at the triplets' first birthday party, when the famous ogre goes into a beastly rage. When walking home, Shrek encounters Rumpelstiltskin, who offers him a day to feel like a real ogre again, in exchange for a day from Shrek's childhood which Shrek wouldn't remember in the first place. Suspicious but happy at the prospect of a relaxing vacation, Shrek signs the contract, and abruptly lands in a world where he is still feared by villagers. Shrek enjoys causing ogreish mischief before he sees wanted signs for him and Fiona and discovers that his home has become a deserted tree stump.Shrek is attacked by a group of witches and knocked unconscious. Shrek wakes up in a cage being hauled by an ungroomed Donkey, who does not recognize Shrek. Shrek is brought to Rumpelstiltskin, now king of Far Far Away. Rumpelstiltskin reveals that the day Shrek traded away was the day he was born. Since he was never born, Fiona was never rescued, and Queen Lillian and King Harold had signed a contract (as they were about to do in the flashback in the film's beginning) that would make ""all of their problems disappear,"" causing them to literally disappear; thus, Rumpelstiltskin took over, and has enslaved the ogre population. Rumpelstiltskin then reveals that when his day is up, Shrek will be erased from existence as well. Shrek then steals a broom and escapes with Donkey. Though Donkey is initially afraid of Shrek, he reveals to him the escape clause of Rumpelstiltskin's contract later: if Shrek receives ""True Love's First Kiss"", the contract will be rendered null and void. And that is all I am telling you folks - you will have to see the film for yourself how it ends, and also, I think it is an excellent finish to the Shrek series.",Shrek Forever After
74,itamarscomix,"Please, make this the last one",5,20 December 2011,"Considering the quick deterioration the Shrek franchise went through in it first three installments, the most incredible thing about Shrek Forever After is that it isn't any worse than Shrek the Third. In some aspects, actually, it's slightly better. That's not saying much though. Like the previous movie, Shrek Forever After is stale, repeats old jokes and basically, doesn't justify its own existence. Unlike the second and third movies, this one doesn't introduce any new characters that are in the least big interesting or funny. Rumpelstiltskin (they're really reaching for fairy-tale characters) is a dull and unimpressive lead villain, a disappointment in the series that produced excellent villains in Prince Charming and Lord Farquaad.Shrek Forever After is, in fact, the least funny of all four Shrek movies. The story is somewhat better than the previous entry, though, and the one thing that the movie does well is present a satisfying and conclusive ending to the series.

Even though this story's not new, it's still enjoyable to watch. It's not as witty as the original three but it still gets a few laughs here and there. Shrek Forever After's the darker of the four (not that it's a bad thing just a huge shift from what we know).It may not be a must watch but if you're interested in wrapping up the shrek series than I'd say go ahead and watch it.",Shrek Forever After
76,bellino-angelo2014,The final chapter of a great movie series,7,18 September 2017,"This is the last of the four SHREK movies, and it's a great conclusion of the saga.Here Shrek lives a regular life with Fiona and their three sons, but every day is always the same again and again, and he is nostalgic of his good old days, when he was feared by everyone. After exploding of anger at their sons' birthday party, he is tricked by the evil Rumpelstilskin that makes Shrek signing a deal that he would have lived just a day like a real ogre.At the beginning it's all OK, feared and hunted by everyone, but he soon discovers that he ended in an alternative reality, where he wasn't even born. Consequently Donkey doesn't know who is his best friend, Fiona never met him and Puss is fat. And, Rumpel rules supreme Far Far Away, with witches (and then the Pied- Piper) at his orders. Soon Shrek befriends a group of fighting ogres with Fiona as their commander, and with Puss and Donkey's regained friendship, they all fight Rumpel's kingdom and Shrek can share his true love kiss with Fiona, and the spell is broken.This movie follows the footsteps of ''It's a Wonderful Life'', with Shrek in the James Stewart role, only in a darker way and with no custodian angels. And in the ending credits there is a brief summary of the previous three movies, with some scenes mixed with the names of the crew members.The first Shrek was excellent (and I also wrote a long review on it), the second was funny and enjoyable, the third... I found it also amusing and funny, although it received poor reviews by different websites and newspaper critics, and this is also highly enjoyable.The animation is always great in every detail, the soundtrack is always outstanding (and the movie ends with Weezer's cover of ''I am a Believer'', the hit song of the first movie), and the actors are, as always, well suited in their roles, especially Walt Dorn as Rumpelstilskin and Eddie Murphy as Donkey, my favorite character.I recommend this movie to all fans of the series.",Shrek Forever After
77,gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297,"While not a classic, Shrek Forever After improves on the 3rd film by concluding the ogre's journey",8,22 May 2020,"After how disappointing the third film was, Shrek Forever After is a good fourth entry of the franchise. Yes it's not a perfect movie as it does have some problems. The beginning of the film felt pretty rough and it may not be as hilarious as the first two films. However, it improves over the third by providing a neat conclusion to the adventures of our lovable ogre.The story does borrow from It's A Wonderful Life, but at least it delivers on the idea of what life would be like without Shrek and at least it had a villain involved. It also gives some new character arcs for Shrek and Fiona. Shrek signs a contract from Rumpelstiltskin that would help him go back to his life as a terrifying ogre only to realize that Far Far Away and everything else is in ruins and has to fix his mistake. Fiona spent her entire life waiting for a true love that never came to rescue her from the Dragon's Keep which results in her becoming a tough stoic warrior. Donkey and Puss in Boots, while not given much to do, still provide some funny moments especially the fat Puss in Boots gag. The other side characters, while also not given much to do, also provide some funny moments and contribute to Fiona's goal to fight back against Rumpelstiltskin who now rules Far Far Away. Rumpelstiltskin, while not in the same league as Fairy Godmother, is entertaining enough thanks to Walt Dohrn's solid voice work.Everything else is done very well. The animation is great with nicely detailed settings including the ruins of Far Far Away, the expressions are very real, the voice work from everyone involved including Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz, Eddie Murphy, and Antonio Banderas is superb, and Harry Gregson Williams reprises the same iconic theme from the previous films while introducing new motifs which enhances the darker atmospheric gothic tone very well while giving emotional beats throughout the film.Overall, Shrek Forever After isn't a classic movie and I understand why critics and some people don't like it as much, but as for me who loved the Shrek franchise ever since I was a kid, this fourth entry is a good conclusion in it's own right. Thumbs up. :)",Shrek Forever After
78,jdkraus,"Though not the best, ""Shrek Forever After"" is a good wrap-up for the series",8,16 December 2010,"I didn't see this in theaters, fearing that it would be lame like ""Shrek the Third"". Learning that my cousins had rented ""Shrek Forever After"", I thought why not kill an hour and a half. To my utter surprise, I found myself laughing on almost all levels as in the first two Shreks. The Disney spoofs, sense of ridiculous (such as bringing back the gags of exploding birds and frogs being blown up as balloons), and a good villain is all present.The cast is there, delivering witty lines at their brilliant best. Will Dohrn as Rumpelstiltskin tops all of them. I've never heard of the actor but he should definitely consider doing more work in voice talent. His inflection brings life to the petite, annoying, and menacing Rumpelstiltskin. In short, the voice fits him perfect, like John Lithgow as Lord Farquaad in the first Shrek.The animation is brilliant in all aspects, ranging from the intense action sequences to the emotions that the characters display through their facial expressions. Well done. And once again, the humor is there and clever. But what this Shrek lacks is a witty plot. It falls into a ripoff of ""It's a Wonderful Life."" If I could live without my family in existence, what could possibly go wrong? Only trouble. We've all heard the same mumble jumble. The ending does lead to one dark direction, but it pulls off a surprise happy ending. It makes sense for this, I mean, it's Shrek. He has to win.In short, though not the best, ""Shrek Forever After"" is a good wrap-up for the series. Let's hope this is the last Shrek.My rating: 3 out of 4",Shrek Forever After
79,Hayden-86055,Not very enjoyable and rather weird. My least favourite Shrek film,5,12 March 2021,"Shrek 4 isn't great, it's an ok film but very disappointing for a Shrek film. Cameron Diaz and Antonio Banderas aren't in the film much, in fact I somehow feel every character including Shrek is sidelined!Plot wise it's the worst of the bunch, especially since by the end of the film absolutely nothing has changed except Shrek learns to enjoy his life more, ok that's nice I suppose. Rumpelstiltskin is not a very threatening, funny or clever villain, he's the villain but he shouldn't have been.5/10: Pains me to put it so low but I didn't really enjoy this at all, it has some good acting and nice visuals but overall it's forgettable and incredibly disappointing",Shrek Forever After
80,nicholls905-280-546911,Bloated conclusion,5,25 January 2020,"Shrek just became a typical franchise that was ballooning with support characters. It ended too late. This wasn't an epic conclusion or a heartfelt storyline like Pixar, it's just an ending of sorts. Shrek and friends just lost their way, this and the previous film lack humour. The first Shrek is incredible at the time of release, but like all films, they need to evolve to stay relevant. This was a large ensemble and it lack ambition. I don't believe they created a mediocre film on purpose, but with it being a concluding chapter, where's the quality storyline? Glad it's over, unlike Ice Age which was steadily degraded from the first sequel.",Shrek Forever After
81,Likes_Ninjas90,In three feature films did Shrek really learn nothing about the meaning of true happiness?,3,30 June 2010,"In the kingdom of Far Far Away Shrek (Mike Myers) is at a crossroads in his life. He is unhappy with his marriage to Fiona (Cameron Diaz) because of the endless cycle of having to look after his children and the constant interruptions at the hands of the likes of Donkey (Eddie Murphy) and the village townsfolk. Shrek's home has also been turned into a tourist attraction because people do not find him scary anymore. At his kid's birthday party Shrek has a meltdown and wishes that he could go back to before he rescued Fiona. His wish is granted when he meets the evil Rumpelstiltskin (Walt Dohrn), who promises Shrek one day from when he used to be a scary ogre in favour of giving him one day from his childhood. Rumpelstiltskin chooses Shrek's birth and thus Shrek is swept back into an alternate time period where Rumpelstiltskin has become the ruler of Far Far Away. Shrek, with the help of Donkey, must break the deal by sharing true loves kiss with Fiona who is now the warrior of an underground ogre rebellion plotting against Rumpelstiltskin. The most troubling problem for Shrek is that Fiona does not recognise him and simply sees him as just another desperate ogre.In three feature films did Shrek really learn nothing about the meaning of true happiness? From the very first Shrek film in 2001 the coda of the franchise has remained the same: to love yourself and others for who they are. Shrek Forever After is the fourth and apparently last film in the series and the material here is disappointingly tiresome at best. It might have made for a much better second film than a fourth entry. Persisting with the same character for this long requires the urgency to find new conflicts for them to solve, which will allow them to realise something they have not already discovered in themselves in the previous entries. With each new chapter this becomes increasingly difficult. Shrek's domestic problems and parenting issues are not particularly funny. They just lend the film an initially awkward and harsh tone that makes one question how the jolly green giant became this naive. Isn't this the same Shrek who came to realise that you don't know what you've got till it's gone nearly nine years ago?There are echoes here of Frank Capra's classic film It's A Wonderful Life (1946), in which George Bailey was shown by a guardian angel what life would be like in an alternate world if he was never born. But even the mirroring of this great film can do very little to spark the charm here as many of the once likable character have now lost their appeal. This is largely the fault of the screenwriters Josh Klausner and Darren Lemke, not just because the same thematic material is recycled but also because the film just isn't particularly funny. There are very few laughs in the opening quarter and the wit of the first two films just seems absent. At just ninety minutes the film is mercifully brief and there are a few sweet moments towards the end shared between Shrek and Fiona but the journey here still feels oddly compressed. Limiting Shrek to just a day of happiness is problematic because it means that most of the events of the film are crammed into almost a single evening, making it feel rather small and insignificant. Despite the lack of sight gags, director Mike Mitchell has done a credible job with the visual aspects though. The film is regularly beautiful to look at with the various 3D effects and touches of depth. Yet once this novelty wears offs, it is still an expensive price to pay for lazy, albeit pretty, sequel.Shrek Forever After is a really disappointing finale for what was once a landmark in animated pictures. It's an example of the way a very clever and charming idea has been laboured far too often by the studio system. The plotting here is predictable, unfunny and derivative; a complete contrast to how one would describe the first film. Very small children who might not be particularly fussed about what they have already seen may enjoy it but to the parents who will have to take them it is sadly difficult to recommend the film for them in either 2D or 3D.",Shrek Forever After
82,Christian_Dimartino,"To me, on par with Shrek 2.",8,23 May 2010,"Lots of people were disappointed with Shrek the third. I was a little too. Because it didn't compare to the first two. So I went to see the new one last night,and it was a breath of fresh air. This one was at times hilarious, and like the good older ones, lots of fun.We open to Shrek(once again voiced by Mike Myers) going through kind of like a crisis. He's not the ogre he once was. And He doesn't like it. So after an outburst at his child's birthday party, Shrek bumps into Rumplestilskin(Voiced by Walt Dohrn), who kind of has a beef with Shrek cause he ruined his business.Stilskin tricks him into a deal.The deal: Shrek will be an ogre again for one day.As it turns out though, in this new world, ogres are hunted, Rumplestilskin is king, and everything is bad. Donkey(voiced by Eddie Murphey) is a slave, Puss(voiced by Antonio Banderas)is fat, and Fiona(voiced by Cameron Diaz) is an ogre resistance leader and Shrek has til midnight to make Fiona fall in love with him again otherwise he's dead.I just gave you the whole plot. Now Shrek forever after isn't as exhilarating as Shrek but to me it is on par with Shrek 2. I laughed numerous times,even if it was kind of strange. And for a fourth part in a series, it's not a disappointment. So, thumbs up for Shrek 4.Shrek forever after: B+",Shrek Forever After

85,sashank_kini-1,Everybody! It's a Celebration!,9,7 April 2012,"Shrek Forever After is a testament to the mega success of the Shrek series – it will not be appreciated by those expecting something radically different from the previous installments or those who are new to the ogre. It brings everything that we have come to adore, love, hate, laugh, cry and celebrate watching tales of Far Far Away. It can be categorized as a 'Best of Shrek Series', along with a few new exciting additions thrown in the mix. Watching Shrek 4, we big a final goodbye to the green, uncouth, bawdy, grumpy ogre who also is compassionate, protective, noble, kind-hearted, funny, diligent and very gullible.Shrek Forever After does not have an innovative storyline – Shrek signs a deal with the malevolent, shrewd Rumpelstiltskin that makes him live the life of a true, nasty ogre for a day, except that the deal has its own causes. Rumpelstiltskin is a known for deliberately distorting meaning and therefore Shrek has to fight all over again for what he had already conquered in an alternate universe. In this world, Fiona is a Che Gueveva like revolutionist who leads an army of ogres to fight off the despotic ruler Rumpelstiltskin and his lair of witches. It is a good versus evil situation between the ogres and Rumpelstiltskin, and Shrek has to break the spell in all this chaos before it is too late.Shrek 4 is not without predictabilities; the entire 'being dad is boring', 'got to save my love', 'sacrificing for my beloved' is done to death before in movies. What makes Shrek Forever After stand out is its commitment to make Shrek, Fiona, Donkey, Puss and all these fairy tale characters a part of our culture. Who would really care for Pinocchio or the Gingerbread man or the three little pigs had they not been revamped in the series? Shrek Forever After brings them all together, tells us to brace ourselves for our final journey and gives us the goodies.The voice acting is like the previous installments, except that there are a additional ones for Rumpelstiltskin, the witches, the extra ogres. The writing is a marked improvement from Shrek 3 because it does not become to self-referential. The gags come at various points, such as when donkey asks Shrek how he knows his name (which is donkey!), or when the Shrek impostors are brought in front of Rumpelstiltskin for rewards. In Shrek 3, it was more about getting surprised at how naughty Rapunzel or Cinderella was. It is good they were not brought back.Shrek 4 is a reminder of Shrek's relevance in pop culture and I raise my glass to it.My Rating: 8.8 out of 10",Shrek Forever After
86,mfellipecampos,Good,7,3 September 2020,"Shrek's big difference was the way he deconstructed the characters from fairy tales. The inversion of positions within the traditional plot, coupled with a good dose of sarcasm and neat dubbing, made the film a success. Shrek 2 came at the same pace, bringing several quotes to the contemporary world and one finding: Puss in Boots. From the third, the series fell. The satires stood aside and, although there are still innovations and new characters, it no longer had the same strength as before. Shrek then entered a new stage, that of adventure with already established characters. If on the one hand it was financially attractive, on the other it was artistically risky. Accommodation is a constant risk.To prevent this from happening, Shrek Forever chose to return to the past. More precisely to the first film, essential for a good understanding of the plot. It all starts with Shrek in the midst of a crisis, thanks to the sudden change in his life. Now the father of three babies, married, a local idol and a tourist attraction, there was little left of that fearsome ogre that frightened everyone with the simple presence. Routine is also murderous. Shrek is increasingly irritated by the situation he is experiencing, to the point of making the most serious of mistakes: regretting that everything has happened. That's where Rumpelstiltiskin comes in, the villain with the complicated name that the film itself soon starts to call by two nicknames.Rumple, or Stilskin, offers Shrek an advantageous deal. The ogre has a chance to regain his former life in exchange for a day of his childhood. Of course, he accepts and of course it doesn't work. Shrek is thrown into an alternative life, where he did not save Princess Fiona and did not meet Donkey. In other words, nothing shown since the first film happened. It is the chance to follow what would become of the characters in this situation and recall several elements that gave charm to the series.Shrek's great asset for always is the bet on the spectator's affective memory. A trip to the first film, with details that please just for remembering the fun that was in its origin. Not that the new film ceases to entertain. There are quite fun moments, like Shrek's outbreak in the face of routine and the first appearance of Puss in Boots. But there is also little new in the story. The soundtrack itself follows this path, reusing music from previous films. In addition, a good part of the supporting actors only shows up in this film, without really participating in the story. A mere appearance to, once again, use the viewer's memory in relation to his previous presence in the series.There is also a feeling that this is the final chapter of the saga. The end of the film suggests this, although it is not at all difficult to imagine a fifth film being made. Regardless, Shrek para Sempre is a kind of tribute to the entire series. A revisit to what was shown in the previous films, in order to emphasize the importance of everything that happened. After all, as Charlie Kaufman well taught in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, one must not forget what has been experienced. It is the memories that also shape who you are.Film seen on the 1st to the 2nd of September 2020.",Shrek Forever After
87,LazySod,Be careful what you wish for,7,26 July 2010,"Being the fourth part in the series the characters are well known by now: Shrek the Ogre is bored. He's not completely happy in his life, being locked between a loving wife and three kids, as well as friends with their families. Shrek wants to live again, wants to be a real ogre again. Lucky for him, there's someone that can help him with just that.Following up on three previous films - that have been gradually getting worse - this fourth film was expected to be the lowest point in the sequence. It fails to live up to that expectancy - IMO it's better than the 2nd and 3rd part added together (and only slightly worse than the 1st). The story plays out rather nicely, using (again) several fairy tale characters and their tricks and treats to set for a rolling story and a mission that needs solving before the world ends.The animation is great, I especially liked the ogre village. The 3D addition is pretty good as well - there are a few scenes that are clearly designed for 3D viewing and they work well. But it must be said that this really should be the last in the series - continuing on where this one stops really wouldn't make much sense.7 out of 10 ear shattering horns",Shrek Forever After
88,cinemamoviecars,"shrek franchise is the best, besides cars",10,23 September 2021,"This movie have jokes, heart and alot of funny scenes. Even the dramatic moments works
shrek forever will be the best animation franchise(besides cars)",Shrek Forever After
89,diac228,"Makes you forget and forgive the existence of the third Shrek, even when it still falters against the original",6,4 June 2010,"The Shrek franchise has risen from a good competitor against Disney and Pixar to a mere joke that still makes money because it appeals to the kids. By the time the third Shrek rolled around, the green ogre went from a clever family comedy with subtle adult humor to an unfunny kiddie flick with very little entertainment whatsoever. This is why I was prepared to shun and practically avoid the fourth and final installment beyond any means necessary. Unfortunately for us moviegoers though, the month of May offered practically nothing outside the Iron Man (and maybe Prince of Persiamaybe) realm. And with the next major major release not happening until mid-June, Shrek Goes Fourth was the final option. Now, there are some good news and bad news with the final installment. The good news is this film redeems itself for the rather mediocre sequel and the repulsive third one. The bad news is, the film still is weaker than anything Pixar (and quiet third party Blue Sky) has produced, and even weaker then some of Dreamworks' greatest hits. At least the sentimental value and heart of the original is duplicated here, even if the wit and nonstop humor disappeared. The pop culture references aren't as rampant but aren't as good either, while the random musical numbers and dances just don't cut it like they used to. Despite all that griping, it still remains a ho-hum ending to a ho-hum quadrilogy. In Shrek Forever After or whatever it is called nowadays, we follow Shrek (Mike Myers) as he is becoming quite bored of his watered-down lifestyle of being a father, husband, and town hero. In the midst of the frustrations, he makes a deal with Rumpelstilskin, resulting in him creating a world in which he was never born---resulting in Rumpelstilskin being king of the land. In this alternate universe, he must win the heart of Fiona (Cameron Diaz) all over again before his existence begins to deteriorate. One funny note though, there is no mention of Artie and his new reign of king.The script is a small retread of the original, mixed in with It's a Wonderful Life and even unexpected parallels to Beauty and the Beast. In other words, the script isn't very original, but does offer a chance to inject some heart into a franchise that lost all of it a couple of years ago. Written by John Klausner (Shrek the Third) and Darren Lemke (Lost), this final chapter has a lot of references to the original Shrek and its sequel, while avoiding all the Disney-bashing the first three were known for. Sadly though, outside the Disney bashing, Shrek didn't have a lot of humor, which makes this Shrek one of the weaker ones in terms of humor. The laughs are mildly there, but mostly coming from the supporting cast (Once again, Antonio Banderas as Puss in Boots stealing the show). With Shrek losing his main love and struggling to win her again, the heartstrings are tugged a bit. Director Mike Mitchell paces the movie well by quickly showing the source of Rumpilstilskin's rage as well as the source of Shrek's troubles. While American Beauty jump-started the middle aged-crisis thing to holy heaven back in 1999, Shrek Forever After still remains a bit fresh by giving us a little time and alternate universe travel. While I was never a fan of Dreamworks trying to infuse heart into any of their movies (I see them more as the antidepressant of Pixar's excellent but heart-destroying films), Shrek is a definite exception. The core of the four films has been the characters and their love for each other, so when the climax approaches, expect to be a bit moved, even when you haven't been laughing. Bottom Line: Shrek's final trip into the movie theaters was better than I had expected, but still wasn't as funny as the first two, which is what I did expect. You can run on competitive bashing and pop culture humor for so long before you quickly run out of steam. While I believe this fairy tale ran two movies too long, the finale is definitely worthy of a viewing if you love the green ogre and all his friends. The supporting cast provided the laughs, while the main characters provided the heart. This is by no means a triumph, but isn't a total toad wreck either. Dreamworks however really needs to lay off the pace-breaking and unfunny and uninteresting musical bits. Let the spin-offs begin!",Shrek Forever After
90,Majikat76,Forget all you know about the first 3 ...,6,23 June 2018,"Possibly one too many Shrek installments, should've stopped at three, but is still worthy of a watch. It seems to go off on a sideways tangent, which has a moral, but doesn't quite fit with the others.",Shrek Forever After
91,Puroo,We needed more of this; it's a pity this is the last movie,8,14 July 2021,"Shrek is one of the most popular animated movie franchises of all time because of the characters. Everything that happens in the story is a result of the actions that some character take senate takes in it. Shrek wants to be left alone and does not care about anyone, because of which the first movie happens. Fiona wants her father to accept her husband for what he is because of which the second movie happens. Prince charming wants to take revenge for his mother's death and motivates evil character to do what they do, so the third movie happened. Basically Shrek is the Shrek of all animated movie franchises.Here also the movie is driven by Shrek's reluctance. In spite of getting everything one needs in the life Shrek is not happy. As a result he sells away the day he was born to Rumpelstiltskin. This causes him to disappear from the timeline thus making him realise his true self worth. It is only after he loses Donkey and Fiona that he realises how much he loves them. And not just him, he even realises how much the ogres mean to the fairy land.The thing I really like about Shrek movies is that they are set in the same world as all the fairy tale characters who stories we heard of as children. Fairy tales are something we emotionally relate to because of our childhood, and also don't get offended if someone makes fun of it. This is used very nicely in Shrek movies except the third one where they just make jokes that could have worked in literally any other film. Here I really liked how Shrek and Donkey met each other for the first time in this new life and how Shrek tries to meet Fiona again (though I didn't like that ""My donkey fell in your waterhole"" joke).The thing I didn't like about this movie is that it did not work too much over the franchise. It just reiterated the same Fiona story. This is a problem with the last two movies. They haven't established more of the world other than what was done from the first two movies. And even if it did it wouldn't have really mattered. This movie played it very safe after The Third's failure by making all the events disappear, just in case the movie isn't liked that much. This wouldn't have been a problem, except this is supposed to be the last movie of the franchise.It's a pity this is the last movie of the franchise, because the franchise could have been revived if there were more such movies. I hope if there is a fifth Shrek movie, they make it about Shrek moving to Far, Far Away so that their children have a better upbringing. So they behave in an ogre manner at school and Shrek learns to be a better person so that his children have a good role model.",Shrek Forever After
92,barrys82,A very decent ending for Shrek,8,6 October 2010,"Shrek 4 or Shrek Forever After is the latest and final chapter of this Shrek's series. In this one, we found a Shrek bored with his present life, no one fears him anymore, that's why he makes a deal with Rumpelstiltskin to have at least one day of the life he had but with catastrophic consequences and realizing that he already had all he wants in life. In my opinion this 4th movie is way better than the third one but not as good as the first two. It is better developed, has more adventure and it is funnier. The story is more interesting and original and it doesn't have unnecessary characters. It has a good rhythm that will keep you entertain for the entire movie. As usual the animation is perfect and with the plus of 3-D even better. The cast of voices is great. Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz, Eddie Murphy and Antonio Banderas return as Shrek, Fiona, Donkey and Puss in boots, everyone with excellent performances and as the villain Rumpelstiltskin we have Walt Dohrn with a convincing job. In conclusion, Shrek Forever After is a enjoyable and entertaining movie for all the family and a very good ending for the series.",Shrek Forever After

Shrek Forever After is mediocre but now this series must come to an end. The new car smell of the series has worn off, and it just feels like they're doing the same thing over and over and over again. This is just disposable family entertainment meant for parents to spend $10 to take their children to it, and this movie is alright enough so that if the kids like it, the parents won't mind. All the old voices (Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Antonio Banderas, Cameron Diaz) return, along with new voices like Jane Lynch, Craig Robinson, Kathy Griffin, Kristen Schaal, Mary Kay Place, and scene stealing Walt Bohrn as Rumpelstiltskin, the mean, cynical man who cons Shrek into never being born. This is basically an animated, ogre-filled version of It's A Wonderful Life. That might of been a good idea if the execution were actually good, but it's dull, bland, and forgettable. The Pied Piper comes in as a character playing a bounty hunter role, and he's awesome, but the good outweighs the bad and unless you have kids begging you to see Shrek Forever After, then you'd be better off just skipping it.",Shrek Forever After

96,eshwarmail,Strictly for the fans of the series to see it all happen just once more,6,8 January 2017,"Reviewed January 2012One way to come out of the bad vibe the third installment created is to give the fans exactly what they want. This one does just that by revisiting all the familiar places and times. To an extent it succeeds in holding the attention of the viewer but could not sustain all the way through. Shrek is in a midlife crisis and looks for a chance to have his untamed life back once more and meets up a sorcerer who offers him one day of his wish if he gives up a day of his past. This past day ends up being the day of Shrek's birth making him nonexistent for the entire past except for today. So the alternative universe he now traverses through has Fiona he never saved or the donkey he never met. The entire setup was a ruse for the sorcerer to take away the kingdom Far far away. There is a rebellion head by Fiona to end this tyranny in which Shrek joins to get close to Fiona. So it all starts back again as Shrek once again tries to make Fiona fall for him, learns the value of friendship and such. It is exciting and boring at the same time. It has it's heart at the right place but the execution gives away the makers attempt to win back it's audience by trying too hard. Shrek should be contempt that he hopefully got a better ending than his previous outing and they should stop making anymore of it. Strictly for the fans of the series to see it all happen just once more.",Shrek Forever After

This paradox that would be welcome in quantum physics is the premise for a children's film that, despite not pretending to be a science guide, prepares children for situations that will appear in many other films. Here the villain changes his design in relation to a previous film in the saga where he appears; there was no need for such a change.

98,Quebec_Dragon,Shrek's Wonderful Life gone forever more ?,6,25 May 2010,"I must be either growing too old for this or this seems like the weakest entry in the Shrek film franchise. Don't get me wrong, it's OK, most of the characters we love are in there, but it feels less inspired. It's as if some of the magic was gone. My mind wandered a few times especially during the action scenes. I smiled a few times but I didn't laugh out loud like in the others. The best joke was a recycled one from previous instalments. To be fair, the audience laughed at regular intervals but nothing crazy like at the best comedies. The jabs at popular culture, political correctness and Disney in particular seemed to be mostly absent. The new characters weren't as memorable as the ones previously introduced. Then again, it's really tough to beat Donkey and Puss'n'Boots for sheer enjoyment. As a matter of fact, the moments involving them were the ones I preferred. The actors voicing them were in fine enthusiastic form. Mike Myers as Shrek was equal to himself, complete with slightly annoying Scottish accent. The 3D animation (in actual 3D with glasses this time) was nice looking, dynamic but didn't blow me away. The story lacks a bit of suspense because it's basically an alternate universe story if Shrek's involvement in important matters had changed, somewhat similar to the movie ""It's a Wonderful Life"" (was that vague enough ? ;-). Throughout the film, you keep thinking things cannot stay that way because it would invalidate the 3 previous films but you don't care very much about that because Shrek is more about fun than mortal danger. I admit that at some point it was clever how the ""easy"" solution was avoided prolonging the shenanigans. Some good humor is found in the new first meetings between Shrek and old friends who don't remember him. Some of the humor falls a bit flat. The movie does have some heart and touching moments. All in all, the supposedly last Shrek movie is watchable and pleasant enough but fails to impress. It also pales compared to previous efforts (ok, not so much compared to the third that a few will argue is worse). If I lowered your expectations just a little, then you can thank me later when you're pleasantly surprised watching this entertaining film ... :-)Rating : 6 out of 10 (good)",Shrek Forever After
99,Rindiana,Shrek the Last?,6,30 November 2010,"The first two Shrek movies were not as brilliant as most critics said and this fourth installment (after the weak third part) is not quite as bad as they say.Yes, there's a certain slackness to all the calculated proceedings, but the basic premise is quite intriguing, though hardly original. At least, the pic moves reasonably well, some jokes are great and despite a rather lame showdown, which is a weakness of all the Shrek movies, the story (with its dark undercurrents of existential crises) is told effectively, with Rumpelstiltskin being a first-class villain.The many, many pop songs on the soundtrack grow tiresome after a short while.6 out of 10 hissing geese",Shrek Forever After
100,Olicosmic,A pretty good supposed end to a mostly amazing series,7,31 January 2020,"As a lover of the first 2 films, I didn't know if I was ready for another disappointment like the third, since it was very forgettable and sloppy. I didn't hate it, as there were good things about it, but ultimately, it was a massive letdown in the grand scheme of things. Even as a kid, I knew some crucial things were missing. So, you can imagine my fear for this film and my almost as big surprise after the credits rolled. This movie finally gets the series back on track, and while it's far from a classic like the first 2, it retained a decent number of magic that the third simply had little of. For one, the villain wasn't lazy. In fact, Rumpelstiltskin is just awesome, as he's not only funny, but well written with the narrative. The premise behind this movie is pretty interesting, too. It's essentially another take on the story used in ""It's A Wonderful Life"", but, of course, with some twists like meeting a whole other colony of ogres. The humor, overall, is pretty good. I wouldn't say I was ever busting a gut, but I was chuckling more than I was with the third film. Overall, this film is a massive step in the right direction. With that said, though, this still isn't a great movie, as it does falter hard with a few things. For one, the pacing and buildup is a bit sloppy. I never really felt like anything really transitioned that well, which makes the film feel uneven at times. Also, this movie is predictable as all hell. It takes plot elements from the first 2 movies, and while that's not a terrible thing on its own, the lack of any big pizzazz to the story structure can lead to little surprises, which is a bit disappointing. So yeah. It's a bit harder to digest than the first 2 films, but it shows the studio learning from some of their mistakes from the third one, even if they haven't learned them all quite yet. It's a pretty good, but not great supposed end to a mostly amazing series. Recommended if you want a somewhat fun ride with the characters you love from the movies. If your standards have been lowered from the third, you may be pleasantly surprised here, as I was.",Shrek Forever After
101,paudie,Enjoyable but not much originality,7,7 July 2010,"Shrek 4 is enjoyable but it is clear the franchise has reached the end of its tether. There are a few good gags and the affection we have for the main characters almost wills us to enjoy the ride but we are going over very familiar territory.Shrek becomes bored with mundane family life and does a deal with Rumplestiltskin for a day as a ""real"" ogre. In return Rumplestliltskin gets to erase the day Shrek was born which means (the details aren't really important) that Mr R now rules Far Far Away. As a character Rumplestiltskin has a few amusing quirks, such as having a different wig for every occasion and having witches for henchmen. However he isn't as entertaining as the original characters.The rest of the film involves Shrek trying to get out of the deal as well as convincing Fiona (who now doesn't know him) that he is her true love. We also meet alternative reality versions of Puss and Donkey.The kids will enjoy the slapstick and funny voices but accompanying adults will realise early on that this film was really only made for the money.",Shrek Forever After
102,robert-710-767167,Almost perfect way to end the Shrek series...,7,27 January 2011,"Dreamworks style.Shrek 1 was perfect. Beyond a doubt. Funny, original, unique, emotion, and so on. The plot was perfect, the characters were awesome, the love and the humor tied in perfectly. A first (my opinion) for Dreamworks.Then came Shrek 2. Even better. It continued the story, and still had a ton of uniqueness as well as keeping the original feel of the idea. The humor was very well done, and the love was just as great. I dare say it almost was better than the first one! Shrek 3 comes and you can see Dreamworks trying a bit too hard to keep the series going. You can start to see the new characters introduced starting to loose their originality. The original characters don't improve too much, they just keep learning the same life lesson. The emotions start to lessen.Shrek 4 finally comes and attempts to end the series. This was in competition with Toy Story 3. To be honest, Toy Story wins the ""finish the series award"" but if I were to focus on just Dreamworks, then it's not to bad.The new characters, to me, come out of no where. They lack the originality, they still have humor but they don't really seem ""scary"". Puss in boots instantly becomes a classic to the story. But they start to loose the characters at that point. I mean, the main evil character in Shrek 4 isn't that much of an addition.But anyway, it was an okay way to end, it could have been better, but it could have been worse.Rated 7/10",Shrek Forever After
103,ScottDMenzel,"""Shrek Ever After"" ends the franchise with some dignity.",7,10 June 2010,"I really enjoyed the first ""Shrek"" film back in 2001 and was an even bigger fan of ""Shrek 2,"" which came out just three short years later. Then ""Shrek the Third"" hit theaters and I couldn't believe what I was watching. Not only did the third film have a horrible story but the charm and wit of all the original characters was gone. I was actually angry that I paid money to see the third film and really didn't want anything to do with the ""Shrek"" franchise any longer. To my surprise even after hearing nothing but complaints about the third one, the final chapter of the Shrek saga was still being made. When I saw the trailer for ""Shrek Ever After"" I was less than impressed probably because I was still angry about the last film. Regardless of how I felt as well as many over movie lovers, ""Shrek Ever After"" was released into theaters just three weeks ago and received average reviews. This past weekend, I decided to go see the film with my girlfriend just to see how the final chapter ends...""Shrek Ever After"" picks up right where ""Shrek the Third"" left off. Shrek and Fiona are now married with kids. They are the most respected and sought after family of Far Far Away and everyone in town loves them. One day after going through what seems to be a midlife crisis, Shrek becomes flustered and flips out at his kids birthday party. He makes a deal with Rumpelstiltskin to give him one day of his life in order for him to feel what it is like to be free again without having kids, a wife, and of course being respected instead of feared. This is where the plot thickens as Rumpelstiltskin tricks Shrek into signing the contract that states he has never been born. The only way to break this contract is to make Fiona, who has no clue who Shrek is, fall in love with him all over again.As soon as the credits began to roll, my first response was that wasn't too bad. Given the fact that ""Shrek the Third"" was a slap in the face to the Shrek franchise, I was somewhat impressed with the final entry. I wouldn't say I was blown away with it but it was like a masterpiece compared to the third film. The character Rumpelstiltskin was actually a fun character and I liked his personality. That was one of the main things that really made the film work especially since Prince Charming in the last film was such a boring and uninteresting character. I also thought the whole reliving the earlier chapters of Shrek's life worked well and I liked what they did with Fiona in this film. They made her a much tougher character. Then of course last but not least Puss in Boots, who is the best character in all the films.Even though I enjoyed this film, I have to admit I am glad this was the final chapter because I can't see this franchise surviving another film. While the storyline about the midlife crisis and appreciating what you have was good especially for this type of film, it just seemed like the writers were pushing it a bit. I don't know exactly why it seemed that way but I guess its just that most of it seemed like more of the same. The charm was there unlike in the third but it wasn't as potent as it was in the original two films. That's probably my main complaint about the film, this felt like a movie that was just made as a good bye to the franchise. It wasn't truly necessary but almost served as an apology for the 3rd film. I loved how they never even addressed the main character from the 3rd film. It was like he never existed, which I have to admit was pretty funny.In the end, I can't really say anything too harsh about the film. I think kids will like it although it is a bit more dark and depressing than the other chapters. I would say out of all of the films, this one is geared more towards adults than anyone else. The movie was also deeper than all the other entries. It was a decent final film and I applaud the writers and director for trying to redeem the franchise. I wouldn't say its a must own but for those who enjoy these characters and enjoy Shrek as a whole, I recommend seeing the final chapter at least once. Sure its no where near as unique or fun as the original two but if you want to pretend the third film never happened this one would be a good filler for that. It's not on a Pixar level as far as quality goes but in terms of a decent animated flick at the box office, ""Shrek Ever After"" is a good choice.MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""Shrek Ever After"" is a 7 out of 10. Take the kids, the family or who ever else likes the franchise and just enjoy the simple yet fun final chapter.",Shrek Forever After
104,thekyles99,Not bad definitely better then the third one!,4,18 June 2010,"i liked it a lot better then the third instalment of this series thats for sure, however even though i have heard that there is no need to worry about a fourth chapter to this because the creators etc, are done. This chapter had at least a mildly entertaining storyline that has Shrek at a crossroads in his life...married children wife,donkey and the rest of his clan however he dwells on the fact of the days when he lived alone in his swamp and frightened everyone. After a breakdown he ventures off on a stroll to cool down accidentally bumping into Rumpelstiltskin on the way, Rumpelstiltskin befriends him and offers him a way to go an be a scary ogre all he has to do is give him a day of his life he cant remember. What ends up happening is he gets thrown back in time having to get Fiona to fall in love with him all over. Can he win everyone back ??? Moral of the story is be careful what you wish for..you just might get it. We didn't have the chance to see this in 3d format however it was enjoyable all the same. All these chapters of the Shrek story are missing one huge element that the first instalment contained... comedy.",Shrek Forever After

106,snowfre,A lot of fun but far from reaching the quality of the layered predecessors,6,29 June 2020,"""Shrek Forever After"" is basically Shrek in an alternate reality, a world he ends up in after signing one of Rumpelstilskin's contracts, and his struggles to restore the world back to usual. It is effective when it comes to revive the romance between Shrek and Fiona, but the lovely supporting characters, mainly Donkey and Puss in Boots remain in the background for the majority of the film. As always with Shrek, however, there is a lot of fun, jokes, and hidden innuendos, and the animation is sparkling. The humor can nevertheless not lift ""Shrek Forever After"" to the high standards of its prequels, as it lacks both emotional depth and witty references to fairy tales, leaving the Final Chapter of the Shrek story as a bit of a disappointment.",Shrek Forever After
107,priyantha-bandara,Shrek is back,8,21 December 2010,"If I ask 10 people the question "" Are you a fan of Shrek??"" , 9 would eagerly reply ""YES"". Shrek has become one of the most ugliest yet interesting animation characters in recent times, loved by many which again and again proved by the box office numbers. If I rate the 4 movies of Shrek up to now Shrek 1&2 holds the first two positions and 4 will be in 3rd place. Shrek the 3rd was not quite up to where we wanted it to be. However the final installment ""Shrek forever and after"" has something's good about it.""Shrek forever after"" takes the story further ahead. Shrek being a father of 3 ogre kids and slowly drifting in to a monotonous life while loosing time for all his earlier favorite life style. Ultimately he reaches his boiling point and start to think that if nothing ever happened the way it did he must have being better off. At this moment the evil deal-maker Rumpelstiltskin steps in and strikes a deal with Shrek. Shrek accepting his deal without knowing the risks get trapped in the past while Rumpelstiltskin wins the land far far away and turns it in to his empire with his evil Witch army.Out of all the characters in this edition for me Rumpelstiltskin is a wonder. From his concept to the animation and voice is wonderful. A pure bred evil in a small sized package! Not to mention the soundtrack of this movie is also quite the thing like in all other Shrek movies. And this time it includes hits like Hello from Lionel Richie , Top of the world from Carpenters and I'm a believer by Weezer. And the stunning animation quality just like always will keep you at the edge of your seat from the very beginning.Don't think you have to real think that hard decide if to watch this or not.

108,Simon_Says_Movies,"An entertaining diversion, even if the series is no longer magical",6,21 May 2010,"After three films of diminishing quality, more than anything, Shrek Forever After begs the obvious question: why? Unfortunately the answer is also all too obvious with the franchise having grossed one billion dollars domestically and oodles more overseas. For what it's worth, this instalment is better than the last but fails to hold a candle to Shrek 2 and pales to the point of apparition when compared to the original.The characters that populate the ""Shrek"" universe remain as endearing as ever in principle, but after four movies there is little that can be done to keep them animated, so to speak. That is why it comes as no surprise that the plot of this film has the mythical land of Far Far Away being turned on its head by the devious Rumplestiltskin, morphing all familiarity into a bizzaro world of sort, and I'll admit, it does add an iota of charm to the proceedings. Shrek (Mike Myers) finds himself tired of family life with his ogre wife Fiona (Cameron Diaz) and longs for his bachelor days of terrifying townsfolk and signs a contract with 'Rumple' as he is less than affectionately called. Things don't turn out nearly as he imagined and Shrek must fulfil a loophole in the contract to turn things back to the way they were.The original gang all return along with Shrek and Fiona. We have the swashbuckling Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas), the chatty Donkey (Eddie Murphy) and Julie Andrews and John Cleese as the Queen and King respectively. There are also a number of celebrity voice cameos including Larry King and Regis Philbin and all add up to a lively time at the movies. In the movies defence, the lack of freshness never translates to boredom.The biggest issue with Shrek the Third was the weak attempt to inflate the voice cast, making things more monotonous yet. DreamWorks has clearly learned from this mistake and in addition to tweaking the familiar character's personas in this alternate reality, find a decent villain in Rumplestiltskin (Walt Dohrn) along with great comedians the likes of Craig Robinson and Jane Lynch. The animation is as stellar as ever and it never ceases to amaze how lifelike a film can look that has a talking donkey at its center.What makes this descendant of Shrek somewhat distinguishable is that it presents itself more as homage then adhering to the spoof ideology that characterized the others. Shrek Forever After is part Aladdin, part Bedazzled and more than a sprinkle of It's a Wonderful Life. There are also many more laughs in this film than the previous, and can often be attributed to site gags sprung from the new universe (an obese Puss in Boots provokes more than a few guffaws).What everyone has to remember, first and foremost, is that the ""Shrek"" franchise is meant for children and I don't believe any of the four instalments could disappoint an eight year old. It is the accompanying adults that need to be wary of the growing tedium in the franchise, but thanks to a plethora of talented actors and a significantly more satisfying storyline, Shrek Forever After makes for an entertaining diversion, even if it's no longer magical.",Shrek Forever After

111,jonnyfendi,"Cat-tastrophe, ri-Donkey-lous and un-Shrek-able!",5,26 May 2010,"What is the first reason that makes you go to see Shrek? For me, I expect cheerful atmosphere all over, that simple! In thiz fourth installment of Shrek, everything becomes darker and gloomier. I think the key factor that made Shrek franchise so successful all these times is Andrew Adamson. Adamson was the Director of two early ones ""Shrek"" (2001) and ""Shrek 2"" (2004). And he also contributed writing credit in ""Shrek the Third"" (2007). Thiz time to continue thiz three years occasion without his involvement, Shrek is just about get into the nightmare. The directing is handed to Mike Mitchell. Mitchell is previously known as the Director of ""Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo"" (1999) and ""Sky High"" (2005) which are not animation features. The story tries to reset everything from the beginning. It tells Shrek (Mike Myers) travels to the past and faces the new alternate universe, where Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) is a warrior, Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) now is a fat lazy cat, and Donkey (Eddie Murphy) doesn't even know Shrek at all. All happens because of a bad intention of a new villain named Rumpelstiltskin (Walt Dohrn) who has an ambition to rule Far Far Away Kingdom. Thiz character is not developed well. The only funny moment is only when he eventually changes his silly wig. It's not comparable to Lord Farquaad's character in the first ""Shrek"". If we look back the Shrek series in overall, it has been already downhill since the second one. The first ""Shrek"" was amazingly fun, ""Shrek 2"" was still impressive and we had ever thought that ""Shrek the Third"" would be a real forever after. I describes thiz one as no need extension. However, Shrek movies always are filled with joyful Soundtracks. If only they have a fresh idea, they can continue thiz franchise, but if they don't, please just left thiz franchise behind for a little while. The thing is they don't realize that they may kill thiz franchise forever after. One thing is for sure, thiz one really becomes a ""Cat-tastrophe"" and ""ri-Donkey-lous"" movie.",Shrek Forever After
112,MovieProductions,3D Review: I hope this is the final chapter,6,22 January 2011,"**1/2 out of (****)Going into the 2001 family adventure extravaganza known as ""Shrek"", I was quite skeptical despite its rave critical reception. After coming out of the theater, I had such a blast and had even a greater time watching it on Blu-ray 3D. ""Shrek 2"" was three fourths as good as its predecessor, which was good enough. It still retained ""Shrek""'s charm, witty humor, and enjoyment factor. ""Shrek the third"", or should I say ""Shrek the turd"", was like a bullet to the chest. It wasn't funny, it wasn't entertaining, and it was just uninteresting. The Good News: Forever After is a refresher over the third installment. The Bad News: It kind of stinks.First and foremost, the acting. Strangely, I did not care about any of the characters except Donkey. It seems like everyone was so angry all the time. They just weren't fun. At all. As for the script, I thought it was very uninspired. It was like a leftover script from ""Shrek 2"". Furthermore, the biggest flaw of this movie is that it's just not fun. The same problem its predecessor shared, ""Shrek the third"". There's just no charm, no fun. It's just a very average family adventure flick that just so happens to top its last installment. Anything good? Well... the 3D is solid. The depth is amazing, there's a sufficient amount of gimmicks, and overall it adds to the experience. Speaking of enhancing the experience, visually, this is the best Shrek movie. There's a plethora of color, especially at the end, and the atmosphere is just so rich. It doesn't even feel like a Shrek movie. And, I did like the message. There are some animated movies that are melodramatic (intentionally too), and lay on morals very thick and syrupy. This film isn't one of them.All in all, I really tried to like this movie... but I just didn't. While it's not a chore to sit through, I could've done something more productive. I just hope it's really the final chapter. While it's not a disgrace to the franchise, it's not a highlight either. It seems like these sequels get more uninteresting and less involving. Actually, I might think that my ""6"" rating is a little generous. This isn't a bad movie, it just could've been better given its potential.",Shrek Forever After

It's not the classic like the first two especially the second one and it just wasn't all that memorable. This story has been done to death now and is no longer fresh anymore and sometimes it came off ass generic and the 3D aspect didn't do much for me just took more of my money and it just didn't have much heart and spunk this time. I will have to say that the star of this animated feature will have to go to Rumpelstiltskin because he stole every scene and brought some kind of life to it but everything else seemed rushed, forced but it still had a good soundtrack again. For having final chapter in its title it doesn't seem like their story is complete and the ending felt very anti climatic so I have a feeling that this isn't the last time we will see these characters on the big screen. Overall it's a good film to take the whole family to but anyone hoping to see a sequel that is just as good as the first two shreks look elsewhere. Wait for DVD.

115,DonaldDooD,The Definitive Example of Sequalitis,4,6 August 2014,"Shrek was a giant hit back in 2001, pleasing kids and adults with its parody of fairy tales. It had great 3D animation for the time and even had a little heart. Shrek 2 is one of the few animated sequels to be better than the first, actually developing the characters instead of simplifying them. It has funnier jokes, a larger scope, and genuine suspense.Me, my sister, and my mother went to both Shrek 3 and 4 in the theater. For a long time, Shrek 2 was one of our favorite family movies. Even 7 years ago, we realized that Shrek 3 was a clunker. We fooled ourselves into seeing Shrek 4, but alas, the series was essentially dead.The best part about the first two films were the character's relationships. They defied expectations, and somehow made the grouchy Shrek and annoying Donkey funny and lovable. You get to see some buildup in Shrek and Fiona's relationship, as well as their personal conflicts and tension with Fiona's royal family. Shrek 3 dropped the ball on the humor and character development, and Shrek 4 certainly didn't catch it.By being a time travel movie, all the development in the previous films is essentially thrown away. Shrek no longer has a personal problem to overcome. His biggest transgression is wishing for a day's vacation. That's it. If it weren't for the villain, his life would be fine and he'd be a well-balanced ogre.Its just an adventure movie that isn't particularly fascinating, and not even that funny. Most ironically, Shrek and Fiona's relationship has become the very thing the original was satirizing. ""True love"" isn't built in this film - its simply there, awakened if you play the role of fireman and save your lover's life. In the original, Fiona was shocked that her knight in shining armor was an ogre. They have to spend time together on their journey back to realize their true feelings. In Shrek 2, the Prince Charming is a spoiled, selfish brat, who only wants love to satisfy his own needs. Our lovers get into a big argument, but ultimately show they're willing to make sacrifices for the other's happiness, and make amends. Shrek 4 has none of this depth or awareness, and forgets that love by heroism only exists in fairy tales.Considering the wealth of options out there, there is no reason for you to see Shrek 4. It fails to capture the magic of the first two films, and is overshadowed by dozens of even mediocre animated movies. How the mighty have fallen...",Shrek Forever After
116,C-Younkin,Shrek has lost a step,5,15 May 2010,"Another summer, another ""Shrek."" This time Shrek (Mike Myers) is unhappy with the monotony of marriage and fatherhood and goes to Rumpelstiltskin (Walt Dohrn), who promises to magically give Shrek a day in his old ogre lifestyle if Shrek willingly gives up a day in his childhood. What Shrek doesn't know is that Rumpel has been after the throne to Far Far Away ever since Fiona (Cameron Diaz) was locked in the tower and Shrek signing his life away is the perfect opportunity for the crazy little dwarf to take power. Not only that but since Shrek technically never existed, nobody remembers him, not even Donkey (Eddie Murphy) or Puss (Antonio Banderas), the kingdom has been ravaged by Rumpel, and Fiona has given up on finding a knight in shining armor and become one herself. This all amounts to some harmless stuff for the kids basically, which is kind of sad since the first two were such clever fairy-tale satires. This fourth and last installment in the series plays out predictably, relies on the same stale themes (love conquers all, life was never meant to be a fairy-tale), goes for the easy jokes (poop, pee, belch, and Puss has let himself go for the fat gags), and also relies way too much on characters with funny voices or who sing and dance to pop culture songs. This is also the first in the series to be presented in 3-D but the unremarkable action doesn't even come close to warranting a 3-D viewing.

121,petit76,Not bad but is not as good as the first two predecessors,7,27 May 2010,"It's not really cool to like Dreamworks Animation anymore. Sure, they're not Pixar. Sure, they're too hung up on star power and pop culture references. But I've still enjoyed the majority their films more than I have a lot of what's out there. And I love the first two ""Shrek"" movies. Their funny, entertaining, terrifically animated, and, too me, some of the best animated love stories that have been made. Most fairy tale romances perpetuate the idea that love is for beautiful people (even the masterpiece ""Beauty and the Beast"" has it's cake and eats it too on this point), and Princes and Princesses are better than common people. ""Shrek""'s idea of finding happiness in who you are was much more palatable to me. i found the first film a delight, and the second even better.But the third was only okay. The humor wasn't nearly as clever or funny, and the heart just wasn't there like it used to be. ""Shrek Forever After"" isn't as good as those first two. But it's a big step back in the right direction.The story begins with Shrek getting used to being a father. He loves Fiona and the kids, but he misses his old life as a menacing ogre. He's seen more as a lovable tourist attraction now, and he doesn't like it. So, he makes a deal with the mysterious Rumpletiltskin (surprisingly NOT voiced by a name actor) to get one day back in his old life. In exchange, he gives up one day from his past. A day from his childhood that he doesn't even remember.Unfortuntaely, that day turns out to be the day he was born, and this leads to an ""It's a Wonderful Life"" scenario where Shrek doesn't know Fiona, Donkey, Puss-in-Boots, or any of his friends, and Rumplestiltskin rules the Kingdom with a tiny iron fist. The resulting story is a great deal of fun, with Fiona now a warrior leading an ogre rebellion, the Gingerbread Man fighting as a gladiator against Animal Crackers, and so forth. The humor isn't back to it's highest heights, but there are a good number of genuine laughs. And the heart is back bigtime. I found ""Shrek Forever After"" surprisingly touching..Okay, it's not as good as ""Toy Story 3"" is likely to be, nor is it as good as ""How to train your Dragon"". but I had a blast with ""Shrek Forver After"" Evren Buyruk",Shrek Forever After
122,Mccadoo,"Heavy on sentimentality, light on laughs",6,1 June 2010,"I must begin by saying that I was really looking forward to this movie, even after having been somewhat burned by Shrek The Third, so my expectations walking into the theatre may have been a bit high. That being said, I walked out of the theatre disappointed, and I must admit, feeling a bit tacky for having that reaction to this movie. Mike Meyers and company obviously were going for sentimentality in this, the reported last installment of the series, and that's fine, that's their right and their call. It is not however, the reason most adults would go to see this movie. Shrek has always been about smart comedy, about cutting wit and social lampooning, about characters you love and love to laugh at, or with. While that all slipped a bit in Shrek The Third, it was almost totally absent in this film. And that's fine, if that was what Mr. Myers and company were going for, it's not why I ponied up nine bucks to go see it. There were brief, very brief glimpses of what this movie could have been, of what made the Shrek franchise so well loved; Rumplestilskin screaming ""chimychangas"" in horror as the ogre chef launched them at him in the climatic final battle. The two witches standing on the parapet above the ogres and pointing out; ""We can hear you you know"". Rumplestilskin prancing on the table with the glass of water while his witch minions look on in terror. There were a few others that escape me at the moment but only a few, a very few. The jokes in this movie were glaringly apparent in their absence, or maybe it was that those that were there totally missed the mark, like the two wagon witches whipping Donkey to make him change tunes, I know that was meant to be funny, it wasn't. As I've said, it appears that Mr. Myers and company chose to go the sentimental route in this final film and that's what they did. This movie was dripping with sentimentality, to the point that I felt as if I'd developed diabetes by the time it was over. I didn't go to this movie to bid a tearful goodbye to the Shrek franchise, I went bid a hilarious farewell with bits like the white bronco chase, or Puss in Boots catnip bust, or the Gingerbread Man torture scene, or countless others. I went to enjoy one last look at a group of funny and likable and sweet characters. That was what Shrek has always been about. Instead they went for the sentimental goodbye and I left the theatre feeling a bit tacky because I felt like I should have jumped on board, that I should have joined in on the tearful, touchy feely goodbye to the franchise. But I just couldn't because as I said, that's not what Shrek was ever about and that's not what I went to see. Instead of going out with a tear they should have gone out the way they came in, with a laugh.",Shrek Forever After

Then I decided that I should watch this sequel . I watched previous movies so why won't watch this movie ? That was my question about watching this movie . 3D as worldwide popular technique was pretty good . As movie started it seemed that it will be just as other parts but it was really special .

It was funny and I like that everything was greatly connected . Whole team was here . Shrek was again in center but it wasn't something like previous performances . It was pretty desperate . Fiona was finally great but it wasn't like other animated characters from this movies . Donkey again in really funny performance but Puss in Boots was unbeatable .

124,d_art,'Shrek Forever After' is a glass half-empty,6,5 September 2010,"In the 3-D (and stereoscopic) animated film, Shrek Forever After, Shrek, the green ogre, has become bored with the domesticated life of raising children with his wife, Princess Fiona, along with the fact that no one treats him with any fear or respect. One day, Shrek feels he has had it and makes a pact with Rumplestiltskin, a deal-making magician of sorts, to feel like a real ogre for a day. When he finds out he's been duped and sent to a twisted version of Far Far Away, where Rumplestiltskin is king, ogres are hunted, and Fiona doesn't know him, he sets to get his life back and reclaim his true love.This one is the fourth installment of the Shrek series. I haven't seen the third one, as I had heard many horrible things about it. I have seen the first two, which I've enjoyed immensely. First film offered a clever, humorous twist on fairy tales. Second goes farther with the twists by adding pop-culture references re-imagined in context of the fairy tales. Both were very inventive and full of energy and details. This version, unfortunately, feels like all of that has been reduced by half. In general fun and humor, it's straight-to-DVD quality, although you can't get the stereoscopic view. The jokes aren't as funny as it used to be. The details and environments also feel somewhat desolate this time around. The subtleties are gone.The stereoscopic 3-D aspect of the film feels like it's been tacked in there. The flying scenes inside the castle are kind of neat, but during most of the film, I didn't even notice that it was in 3-D. Don't expect anything as grand or beautiful or clever as How To Train Your Dragon.I suppose by the fourth film, it is inevitable that much of the joy of the first and second film will have been drained out. I assume the storytellers are running out of ideas when sequels revert to a time-travel idea (I'm reminded of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 3: Turtles in Time) or a ""reboot"" of sorts. Yes, it's essentially a reboot because much of the film is an alternate timeline, and Shrek has to meet his friends all over again who don't recognize him. It's kind of like getting re-acquainted with Arnold Schwartzenegger's T-100 in Terminator 3. It also doesn't help that the plot concept has been done before, such as in It's a Wonderful Life and Mr. Destiny. The plot progression is essentially by-the-numbers, and so is a good chunk of the humor. It never feels quite organic. There is more slapstick than jokes. Sadly, in my theater, I couldn't hear any kids laughing at any of the jokes, which wasn't a good sign.However, there are some good moments in the film. Despite the overused plot, Shrek is still a likable character. Eddie Murphy's Donkey is still around. Conrad Vernon's Rumplestiltskin is a mean yet somewhat dark character, reminding me of John Lithgow's Lord Farquaadalmost. The Pied Piper as a baddie is an ingenious idea—how I wished the film centered more on this guy! A scene involving Rumplestiltskin's ""half-full"" glass of water is also excellent. I even liked the fact that Shrek goes through something like a midlife crisis. I only wished it was handled in a way that wasn't so familiar.Overall, it's not a bad film. It's just doesn't live up to the potential set by the previous films I saw. If there was no Shrek 1 and 2, it may've been considered a pretty decent film--of course, it also means there shouldn't be other good 3-D animations to compete with. Nevertheless, friends have told me this installment is still miles better than the third one. I guess I won't be seeing the third one for sure. I give Shrek Forever After ** out of **** stars.You can also follow my more recent reviews on twitter.com/d_art",Shrek Forever After
125,montera_iulian,Familiar but not refreshing...,6,4 June 2010,"What can I really say? It wasn't disappointing as I thought it would be but it was neither good or anything it was just mediocre. Better than the 3rd shrek? Probably or Yes! but still with all the story and characters relationships and all, while we are familiar with Shrek the feeling or the atmosphere that once we all enjoyed disappeared with this fourth and hopefully last movie. It should just rest as it is and should be remembered for it's first 2 parts. We strangely don't feel any emotion towards shrek in this movie besides the fact that we already know this character and we like him for the smile he gave us with his first two parts but now it's just dull and at times it got me bored. As for the script I might admit that it has it's flaws and the dialogue seems old and not something refreshing in many times. The funny moments were not that many in this one, and most of the jokes like I said felt old. It's a near perfect ending though for Shrek and would have been far more better if this was the 3rd movie instead of that failure. The soundtrack itself didn't raised the bar of the movie as well since it was not something that you would normally enjoy unless you're watching a mediocre movie and with all these I'm convinced this might be a good shrek movie but overall is just mediocre though it's well executed. So... watch it once if you're a Shrek fan, if not? ... don't bother because you won't lose anything... It's sad actually but the interest in Shrek actually died I think long before this movie considering even the box-office at the moment which is disappointing... By the way, forgot about the 3d experience; it was fine overall but nothing compared to Alice in Wonderland.Storyline: 7/10. Voice-Acting: 7,5/10. Art Direction: 7/10. Cinematography/Editing: 6,5/10.

126,aaronjbong,Shrek Forever After: Enjoyable!,7,22 May 2010,"Shrek Forever After is said to be the final chapter of the Shrek series. Well, perhaps the final installment is a good installment to finish the Shrek series.Pretty much like the previous series, Shrek Forever After has those fairy tale themes. In this installment, it still has the guts to make you laugh. It can still be called good (although it's not very good). I like the alternate version of Puss in Boots.The story was also quite smart. Well, I still enjoyed it.The appearance of Rumpelstilskin is the thing I like the most. His actions are pretty much laughable. For me, he's the best movie villain for children. Shrek Forever After is more exciting than the previous installments. But, the problem is that it's too short. If you compare it with 'How To Train Your Dragon', 'Dragon' (even though with approximately with the same running time) has many more scenes than 'Shrek' does. It all happens so quickly. It's like having a normal pace in the beginning and then hurrying up in the end. But, Shrek Forever After can still be called an enjoyable film. 7 stars!",Shrek Forever After

With Shrek Forever After this is the case, still packed full of gags, funny moments and hilarious one liners its a good end to a fun enjoyable franchise. We all hoped it would also end this way, in a positive way as the last 11 years has been Shrek sequels some better than others. With this final adventure, old characters are reunited and new ones enter the fray.Plus we also get a fresh new setting for this latest and final tale, some good dialogue too and of course improved animation. Considering this was always gonna go up against Toy Story 3, we knew it would be a close fight for the throne of the summer blockbuster. Otherwise, however Shrek Forever After has done a good job of grabbing it for me until I see Toy Story 3, until then I believe this is the best animation summer blockbuster of the year.If you want quick gags, laughs and family fun Shrek Forever After is for you and also for fans of the franchise.",Shrek Forever After
128,Thunderbuck,A Welcome Surprise,8,30 May 2010,"While ""Shrek Forever After"" may not recapture the biting wit and comedy of the original, it may just have the strongest story of the series.I think we can all agree that the third instalment of the Shrek series was mailed-in, and while there was a surprisingly good Christmas special last year, I wasn't holding out much hope for this film.As a mid-40s dad myself, I had no problem relating to the setup, that Shrek had become mired in the routine of family life and had started to question the choices he's made. After a birthday party outburst, he's offered a deal by Rumplestiltskin that give him a chance to be the feared, powerful ogre he was in younger days.Of course, there's a catch, and Shrek finds himself with the opportunity to see a world where he'd never been born a la Frank Capra. Sure, it's been done before, but the script uses the conceit well and the creative choices generally make sense.No, ""Shrek Forever After"" isn't as funny as the original ""Shrek"" (but what is?), but it's the story that's more important in this one anyway.Dreamworks has said this will be the last ""Shrek"", and it's a high note to end the series. Surely, we'll see more TV specials, and perhaps a spin off or two, but it's nice to see the writers do something worthwhile with these characters.",Shrek Forever After
129,Paul-271,Decent If Not As Fresh as 1 or 2,7,31 May 2010,"A good deal of the critical complaining about this one is simply that it's derivative of a well loved Jimmy Stewart classic - _It's a Wonderful Life_'. In a modest way it is, but it also goes its own way enough that it's hardly a duplication of that flick.What bothers me about that complaint is simply that most Hollywood movies today - those loved or despised - are remakes of something which came before. It seems that for maybe 80 years or so, Hollywood was capable of coming up with original material, but lately that has waned. Perhaps the movie makers have become as script conservative as they are politically liberal. I'm not sure.There were perhaps five coming attractions before Shrek 4 started. Of the five, four were clear remakes, some bearing even the same title as the original. One example is the newest _Karate Kid_ which based on the previews probably uses the same script word for word as the original. On the way out of the theater we saw a poster for the upcoming _Predator_ which showed a monster identical to the one which threatened Arnie maybe 25 years ago.So complaining that Shrek 4 borrows thematically from a well loved movie is hardly valid unless you choose to see no movies at all because they all do it today.On the positive side, the movie is engaging. We enjoyed the 3D and I found the textures and animation as good as I've ever seen. I'm wondering if movies such as this have put paid to live human actors. I suspect it's close.No, this one isn't nearly as fresh as the first simply because it's fourth, not first, but it's fine family entertainment with a terrific look and a message which, if not original, is still quite valid. Just sit back and enjoy it.",Shrek Forever After
130,byrann_gowan,"Still not as good as the first two, but better than the third, and a great way to end the wonderful series!",7,26 November 2011,"While it definitely feels like it's a rehash that's trying to go for the jugular and try to pack some jokes that mirror the first movie, Shrek Forever After is definitely an improvement from Shrek the Third. The plot is that Shrek is bored with his family life, and he decides to sign a deal with Rumpelstilzkin, so that he can become a feared ogre for one day. Did I spell Rumple's name right? Anyways, it turns that the be-careful-what-you-wish-for theme comes true for Shrek, because he has to give up a day of his past in order for the deal to work. Rumpel, being the evil genius that he is, decides to give up the day Shrek was born, so if Shrek can't share true love's kiss (guess who it has to be with), he will no longer be existent.There are definitely a lot of good things to look at here, but I will just focus on the voice acting and the plot, seeing as that's what truly gives the movie away. Myers proves that, despite being a decade older than he was when he first started out as Shrek, he still has the it factor for Shrek. Murphy is just as funny as he was the first time around. Diaz is great as the Princess Fiona, although in this film, we don't see her as being much of a Princess. Banderas is still one of the greatest things to happen to this saga as Puss in Boots. All the other voice actors do their thing, as well.The story works here, too. I personally found this story to work because, well, Shrek has had more at stake here than he had in the previous three movies. In the first two, it was just his love to Fiona that was at stake; from what I remember from the third movie, his life ended up being at stake; in this one, well, not only is it his life, but it's everything about his life that's at stake. Fiona, his children, his friends; if Shrek does not share true love's kiss with Fiona, he will cease to exist, as will the world in which he comes from.The main flaw, however, is that this film relies on too many things from the first movie. First of all, there's the fact that he wants to be a real ogre again. While this does work, it's not as effective as when he is a real ogre in the first film. Secondly, he goes to visit the castle to see if Fiona's still there. Third, the whole true love's kiss thing was the main theme in the first movie, and it's the same here. While I do applaud the makers of this film for successfully coming up with this stuff, it's also the movie's main flaw, since it is too dependant on sources in which those themes work better.Overall, though, I do recommend this movie to all Shrek fans. It's a great ending to the series, and despite the fact that I don't want to say goodbye to the characters, I think it's time. I felt the same way with Toy Story 3; they were about Andy's toys, and since Andy gave them away, it's time to put that series to rest now. But, Toy Story and Shrek, you guys gave me some of the best times of my childhood when I was growing up. I thank you so much for everything that you had to offer. This movie deserves an 8/10 for me.",Shrek Forever After
131,Mork_the_Borg,Wow - was that a huge disappointment,4,14 January 2011,"I so loved ""Shrek - the original"" and even scored it 10/10. The original had everything a movie needed to have, but I never anticipated that the last installment would be nothing more than a very weak battle between ogres and witches. Shrek Forever After doesn't have any good jokes or sense of humor in it, let alone a storyline, or script! I'm glad I only rented it from the video-store for $3 and didn't buy it! This makes me realize even more how I dislike cash-cow sequels. The worst thing of all they've already announced 2011 as the year of sequels and superhero movies. Jesus Christ - how low can we go. From a positive side, I do like the idea of alternative realities, as it matches with some of the multi-verse theories that go around in the world of physics, but putting those in Shrek? It all seems a bit too far from being a fun movie to me!",Shrek Forever After
132,zactac,Not better than the first two but a nice end to the series.,8,23 May 2010,"Shrek one and two were some of the best animated films ever made. Filled with an all-star cast, great animation, and an original story with a well-written script perfect for its great cast. While the third one didn't live up to the expectations of the first two the fourth one is in ways an improvement.Shrek has always been visually stunning and the characters have always been loving so that isn't the issue. It is the script that could be a problem. While the third one showed a lot of promise it wasn't able to do much with it. However the fourth movie starts showing the promise in it and ends the film series on the right note.Here in Shrek Forever After Shrek is now a domesticated family man who seems to be living the dream. But things start changing when his seemingly perfect life becomes to predictable and boring for him. Now on his children's first birthday he loses it and wishes he was a regular ogre for just one day. Then Rumpelstiltskin comes and says that he can give Shrek what he wants and to get the day he has to give a day. In other words he has to give up a day in his life and what Shrek doesn't realize how it will change his life. Now he finds himself in an alternate reality where Rumpelstiltskin rules and the only thing he can do to change it is to get true loves kiss and break the contract.The story matches up to the better films of the Shrek franchise. It even has some good laughs and action as well. Mixed with 3D making this a fun installment in the Shrek film franchise. However it doesn't mean it doesn't have its flaws. Maybe if the film was a little longer you could have more feel for Shrek when he goes to the alternate reality. It begins showing how miserable he is except it doesn't give us the time to get reacquainted with these great characters. Maybe that's its greatest flaw and that keeps us from truly enjoying the film like we enjoyed the first two films. While it did better than the third film it wasn't able to live up to first two. The 3D makes this film a treat to the eyes while the moments it has can keep you happy throughout the film making this a nice finale to the series about every ones favorite ogre.",Shrek Forever After

134,Knewsense78,"Well, it's better than part 3.",6,18 June 2010,"SHREK FOREVER AFTER or SHREK THE FINAL CHAPTER (or whatever you want to call it) is better than SHREK THE THIRD but that's not saying much.Seems Shrek is sick of the new life that he has and wants to go back to his old life where people are still afraid of Ogres and he doesn't have to deal with the baggage that comes with being a parent. Hey, if that is the case, you should of wrapped your Ogre dong up with an Ogre condom and your problem should have been solved.Anyway, Shrek makes a deal with Rumplestiltskin (an annoying voice if I ever did hear one) and suddenly Shrek is swept back to a day when people ARE still afraid of Ogres and he doesn't have the responsibilities of dealing with his offspring. Plus, he no longer has Fiona has his devoted wife. I say devoted cause she made the choice to stay an ugly Ogre instead of the beautiful Princess that she ""sorta"" was cause she knew that she loved Shrek and that she would pretty much do anything for him. That shows devotion. For Shrek to make a deal with Rumple-dumbass so that he could live his old, so called ""normal"" life for one day again just shows ignorance on his part.So, like I have to say it, Shrek realizes that he wants the life back that he had with his wife and his kids and his old friend Donkey and all those other asses. Only thing is, in order for Shrek to get the life back that he had, he must break the deal he had with Rumple-foreskin by kissing Fiona cause in the fine print clause on the deal he made with you-figure-it-out it says something about ""True Loves Kiss' or something along those lines. It's only ""true love"" if Fiona actually loves him. Of course other things happen along the way and of course Fiona does love him by the end of the movie. I don't necessarily consider that a spoiler cause if your reading this and you couldn't figure that out than, well, your an idiot. lol.Anyway, once again, this movie is better than the 3rd one but, like I said, that's not saying much.

136,benm-41751,Unnecessary 4th installment? Maybe. Worth it? Yes!,8,20 January 2019,"Shrek Forever After has been dismissed as an unnecessary continuation to the Shrek movies, as a typical DreamWorks cash-in because they knew that someone would go see it no matter what. And to some extent this critique is fair. There weren't really any lingering questions or storylines by the end of the third movie which warranted a fourth movie to come after. And it shows, because the story in this movie is a bit of a tangent - as in, they invent a whole new conflict and a new villain to make ti happen.But beyond that, I don't think there's much bad to say about this movie. It continues to be funny, charming, inventive, and heartfelt. In fact, I felt like the relationships of the characters became stronger in this movie as it had more of a cinematic, dramatic tone rather than just being a long sarcastic farce (although there's plenty of silliness and dark humor). More importantly, I think the movie did actually address an issue with the past movies. Did you ever have trouble buying that Shrek, the lonely grumpy ogre, had suddenly become a happy family man after meeting Fiona? In this movie, he confronts that contradiction and is faced with the question of what really matters to him - whether he can really embrace this new life or if it goes against who he really is.Personally, I was very pleased with this movie and fully entertained by it. It's not exactly a ""necessary"" watch following the other Shrek movies, but in a way I think it takes the characters and the world we know and makes a great new story which stands on its own.",Shrek Forever After
137,cpbadgeman,Best Shrek yet,8,31 May 2010,"This is the best ""Shrek"" movie since the first one and is easily the funniest of the lot. This time around the plot revolves around Shrek developing a mid-life crisis and making a deal with the devious Rumpelstiltskin (the villain of the piece) to have one day of his single life back, he gets his wish but loses the day he was born in exchange. The rest of the movie follows how Shrek tries to get everything back to the way it used to be.All the ingredients that have made this franchise so popular are retained- particularly the clever pop culture references and the sharp interplay between all the main characters. The soundtrack is also very well-chosen and some of the selections are used to hilarious effect. All in all this is a very funny film from beginning to end and a top choice if you are looking for a lighthearted night out. Highly recommended.",Shrek Forever After
138,TheUnseenMovieLover,Happily Ever After,8,5 July 2010,"I'm a big fan of the first two Shrek movies. The first Shrek, in particular, was a hilarious, heartfelt and original delight. Whilst Shrek 2 couldn't match the first film's originality, it was still a hugely enjoyable piece of entertainment. With Shrek The Third, the franchise ground to a halt. I don't hate Shrek The Third; I just find it sluggish, stuffed with too many characters and lacking ideas. So, it was with some trepidation that I approached Shrek Forever After.Thankfully, Shrek Forever After is a fitting finale for the franchise; it is very funny, sweet and, through a nice Wonderful Life-like twist, it shows us the characters we all know and love in a different light.Shrek (voice of Mike Myers) is having a midnight crisis. Despite living happily with his wife Fiona (voice of Cameron Diaz) and their three children, Shrek longs for the days when he was feared by the townspeople, instead of the tourist attraction that he has now become. After Shrek's pent-up anger is unleashed during his daughter's first birthday, he is tricked by the devious Rumpelstiltskin into signing a deal which will allow him to live as a real ogre for one day at the expense of one day from his life. In his ""ogre"" day, Shrek realised that Rumpelstiltskin has stolen the day he was born; this means that Shrek never met Donkey, Puss in Boots or any of his other friends, and he didn't save Fiona from the tower. Shrek soon finds his friends, but they're not how he remembers them. Together, they must battle against Ruimpelstiltskin, who has taken over Far Far Away, and Shrek must find a way to reverse Rumpelstiltskin's magic before his day is over, or he will disappear from existence.Shrek Forever After succeeds where Shrek the Third failed because it returns to the charm of its characters and its story. Shrek the Third relied more on its (admittedly eye-popping) visuals, hit-and-miss pop-culture jokes and stunt casting (hello, Mr. Timberlake) than on creating a strong story or in taking its characters on an entertaining, interesting journey. Shrek Forever After rectifies all of these mistakes; the pop-culture gags are few and far in-between, with most of the film's humour coming from characters and their situations. There is no obvious stunt casting here, but that works to the film's advantage. Ever heard of Walt Dohrn? No, me neither. But he damn near steals the film as the tricky Rumpelstiltskin, his vocal performance a blast of snivelling razzmatazz. Plus, new director Mike Mitchell and screenwriters Josh Klausner and Darren Lemke do funny, new things with familiar characters. For example, whereas Puss in Boots was a swarthy swashbuckler, in the alternate universe he resembles a balloon covered in fur, who can't move without it being an Olympian task (one moment where he's struggling to, um, lick himself leads to the funniest use of his famous ""ahhhh"" eyes in the series). Whereas Fiona is a tired housewife in Shrek's real universe, in the alternate universe she is the tough, sexy (hey, I'm a hot-blooded male) rebel leader of the Ogre resistance against Rumpelstiltskin. Mitchell, Klausner and Lemke clearly have a lot of fun twisting our expectations of what the characters will do or what will happen to them, and I had a lot of fun with them. There is one death scene (shock!) which comes out of mid-field, and is even more hilarious as a result.The vocal work is strong. Mike Myers excels here as Shrek; he brings a real sense of human weariness and sarcastic wit to a fairytale character, which grounds him in reality. Shrek's midlife struggle with the loss of the spark in his life before he met Fiona will ring true with many viewers; many people, in the middle of a marriage, will look back on their freer days with a sense of nostalgia and wish they could re-live them again. Shrek's fault is that he doesn't realise what he has until he loses it. Cameron Diaz excels in both personalities; the tired but loving wife and the Xena-like warrior, the latter in which she particularly seems to be letting loose and having a lot of fun. Eddie Murphy and Antonio Banderas are their usual hilarious selves, both of them taking advantage of their characters and their new situations, with Banderas relishing his character's pampered lifestyle as Fiona's pet and Murphy still getting big laughs out of his chatterbox sidekick. The supporting cast is filled with talented actors, most notably Craig Robinson, Glee's Jane Lynch and Mad Men's Jon Hamm as members of the Ogre resistance.The animation here is beautifully done and highly detailed. One caveat; as anyone who has seen the advertising knows, this film is being shown in 3D. The 3D isn't a distraction, as in Alice in Wonderland and (from what I've heard) Clash of the Titans; it's just doesn't necessarily add anything either. It's just there. In Avatar and How to Train Your Dragon, the 3D deepened the sense of immersion into an imaginary world. Here, it seems more perfunctory than anything else. So my advice is to see this in 2D and save your money.Shrek Forever After erases the disappointment of Shrek the Third. There is a familiarity to the story which stops it from reaching the heights of the first film, but it is enjoyable enough to be on the same level as Shrek 2. This is a thoroughly entertaining conclusion to the Shrek legacy, and I'm going to miss the big guy.",Shrek Forever After
139,colm-hearne365,A nice ending to the Shrek series,7,10 April 2017,"Granted Shrek Forever After may not be as good as the first two movies but it's an improvement of Shrek the Third which disappointed many fans. But Shrek Forever After gave a nice ending to Shrek and I think it deserves more credit and a higher rating on IMDb because it has a good story, good comedy and a good villain (Rumpelstiltskin). I like how it starts off with the King and Queen of Far Far Away almost making a deal with Rumpelstiltskin in order to break Princess Fiona's curse but the deal is interrupted when they find out the Shrek saved Fiona. Rumpel becomes vengeful because of Shrek and wishes he was never born. Then we see that Shrek misses the days when he used to be a real ogre even though Fiona tells him he has everything. Then Shrek meets Rumpelstiltskin and is tricked into signing a contract with Rumpel thinking that it will give him just one day to be a real ogre. At first, Shrek is thrilled because villagers are afraid of him and he can do whatever he wants. But then Shrek finds out he's been taken to an alternative reality and sees how things would've turned out if he was never born. Like Donkey is afraid of Shrek, Shrek and Fiona have never met, Puss is fat and Rumpel is in charge of the Kingdom of Far Far Away. And the only way Shrek can get his life back is sharing True Love's Kiss with Fiona.Granted Shrek Forever After uses the same kind of story as It's a Wonderful Life but I think it deserves more praise because I like how it shows what everything would be like if Shrek never saved Fiona from the Dragon's Keep. And I like in the end, Shrek realizes that his life is perfect because he has friends and family.",Shrek Forever After
140,tripxyde,Shrek 4: A Flawed Comedy but a Perfect Final Chapter,7,20 May 2010,"When I found out that a fourth Shrek movie was being made, it made me frown because it seemed pretty needless, especially that the last movie was such a bore. But then again, if you take the storyline into consideration, this becomes a fitting final chapter to formally close the Shrek series. The movie is originally entitled SHREK FOREVER AFTER, but in other regions of the world including ours, it is entitled SHREK: THE FINAL CHAPTER, so it's obvious.First we go to the more unpleasant aspects; this movie works more as a fantasy-adventure movie rather than a comedy. That's because the humor factor of Shrek has gone old already. This movie seems to squeeze the very last drop of what is left of the Shrek series' dried out desert of humor. Sure, it may make us give out a chuckle here, a chuckle there, but this Shrek movie cannot make us laugh out loud anymore. When you look back at its title ""Shrek the Final Chapter"" you would realize that this movie does seem to apologize with the fact that this'll be the last and probably an admission that they could not squeeze any more decent thing out of the Shrek saga after this one; it's a final effort to make one last buck.On the other hand, Shrek's main story aspect is a little more interesting than its humor. As I said earlier, this movie is better as a fantasy adventure because we do get to see an alternate reality where Shrek is back into being an outcast Ogre and everybody else who was originally part of his circle of friends has not met him yet. Eventually, they get into an adventure wherein he must face a new enemy, a new problem, and he even gets to meet other ogres and an ogre resistance army that pretty much reminded me of Warcraft (the old-school Warcraft 2 to be exact). In this bizarro world, Donkey has not met him, Puss has become obese, and Fiona is the leader of the Ogre resistance. Shrek must go through this alternate universe and survive it before the day passes and a curse will consume him for good. Shrek gets to have some action with a horde of witches and must face the dragon once again. I could not say that the action was impressive but it has its little cool moments. I particularly loved the chain skull weapons that the witches use.In addition, this movie works also as a family domestic drama where it maturely deals with the simple family issue of boredom and being sick of how repetitious family life can be. I daresay that the film can work as a satire or perhaps a metaphor that some married men can learn from. There is one sequence in the movie that does capture this crisis; I am talking about the scenes where we see Shrek realize that despite the fact that he does live a happy life, it can get pretty dull and annoying at times, but then again that's life.Perhaps it becomes boring because many of us choose not to grow up; many of us choose to not let go of what our past lives were. That is what happens to Shrek in this movie. To escape the mediocrity of a family life, he wishes to relive the moments when he was still just a normal ogre again. And because of this, he puts his family life in jeopardy. Shrek 4's tale comes full circle in the sense that it questions if Shrek did have a ""happily ever after"" ending in the past three movies, and puts one last fantastic circumstance to let him live out a reality that this never happened.And lastly, Shrek 4's main potential lies in its romance. With an alternate reality story, Shrek faces a Fiona that has never met him. Therefore, Shrek must find out some way to make Fiona fall in love with him all over again. If you ask me, the romantic aspect of this movie is as innovative as the first Shrek movie, in ways that it tells mature subject matter in the guise of fantasy. The Fiona of the alternate reality mirrors the plight of women who gave up on romance, and one scene certainly negates the falsity of most fairy tales with a line that goes something like: ""a mere kiss does not solve everything"" It negates other fantasies like ""Sleeping Beauty"" or ""Snow White"" because it destroys the superficial aspect of those obsolete fairy tales with a more realistic approach, because indeed, a kiss is nothing if there is no true love that goes with it. In my opinion, Shrek 4 succeeds in this aspect.Shrek may not be the best movie this summer, or it might not be the funniest Shrek movie, but it certainly is one that is very rich story-wise. Just as his line in the first movie went ""I have layers"" and there certainly are deeper layers to this story rather than one that will just make you laugh. Of course, this works out as a great family movie, but it is certainly perfect for couples, most especially married couples, and parents alike. I give SHREK FOREVER AFTER a.k.a. SHREK: THE FINAL CHAPTER a Matinée rating for single serving; and a Full Price rating for family servings.",Shrek Forever After

It's so fine , so emotional ! Shrek has undergone through a lot of changes as the years passed , and now he's a little bored with his middle class life ... Genius script , perfect animation , a little dark (for good !) , very existentialist , amazing soundtrack , and this parallel universe touch aways works for me ! I only hope it's not the real end for the green monster saga .. The new characters are also captivating , and the cast as usual has made a very fine work . Shrek is intelligent life on animation planet , no doubt about it.

142,rockinkettles-1,The best of the Shrek sequels.,10,24 May 2010,"Everyone has different taste when it comes to movies, but myself being a fan of Shrek since the first one, I think the newest chapter is the best sequel of all. I honestly did not think very much of it at first when I saw the previews and other reviews. I always like when a movie turns out better than you expected. The newest chapter finds Shrek getting bored with his married life, so he turns to Rumplestilsken to give him what he wants. One day to be the ogre he used to be when people were afraid of him. One day of not knowing the life he does in the present like being married and feeling smothered by everyone around him. But the evil Rumple has Shrek sign a contract with a trick clause that will change Shrek's life for the worse. In his new life no one knows who he is.Not Fiona, donkey or even puss in boots. The only way to break the curse is to make Fiona fall in love with him again and make everything go back to the way it was.The final Shrek has moments of action and humor like the first three movies, but I think the story is the best of the sequels. It of course makes you realize in life to love what you have. You may not always be happy with the way things are but at least you have friends and family around you who love you for who you are. You don't have to be a kid to enjoy it. I think adults will like it as well. And as far as the summer season goes with it's new batch of movies, you can't go wrong with Shrek. It is definitely a good start.",Shrek Forever After

While all the other usual cast were well on form.There was as always a moral to the story and Shrek's philosophical reflection to Fiona at the end cleverly turns the tables on our previous ideas of the film .This is far better than Shrek 3, a laugh out loud film that does n't fail to deliver a feel-good response .

The second was when I was a teenager. The second one was just as good as the first one. Third one was a huge let down for me. As was this one.Part of the reason why I liked this was because the whole cast return to do their character voices. So it's great that no one pulled out, fantastic! The problem with this movie is the humor falls flat as does the plot and characters. The first two we would understand and feel something for the characters. in this one you just don't care not one little bit. I wont explain the plot, but you will see what I mean. The whole plo9t just seemed pointless. It all ended up being predictable and you knew exactly what was going to happen. SOMETIMES things can be predictable and fun, in this one it's just predictable and stupid.I really don't know what else to say. The script was badly written. Only thing I can recommend this for is if you are Shrek Die hard Fans who will love the characters no matter what! 4/10",Shrek Forever After
145,ungy357,A very welcome almost return to form,8,15 May 2010,"It's not really cool to like Dreamworks Animation anymore. Sure, they're not Pixar. Sure, they're too hung up on star power and pop culture references. But I've still enjoyed the majority their films more than I have a lot of what's out there. And I love the first two ""Shrek"" movies. Their funny, entertaining, terrifically animated, and, too me, some of the best animated love stories that have been made. Most fairy tale romances perpetuate the idea that love is for beautiful people (even the masterpiece ""Beauty and the Beast"" has it's cake and eats it too on this point), and Princes and Princesses are better than common people. ""Shrek""'s idea of finding happiness in who you are was much more palatable to me. i found the first film a delight, and the second even better.But the third was only okay. The humor wasn't nearly as clever or funny, and the heart just wasn't there like it used to be. ""Shrek Forever After"" isn't as good as those first two. But it's a big step back in the right direction.The story begins with Shrek getting used to being a father. He loves Fiona and the kids, but he misses his old life as a menacing ogre. He's seen more as a lovable tourist attraction now, and he doesn't like it. So, he makes a deal with the mysterious Rumpletiltskin (surprisingly NOT voiced by a name actor) to get one day back in his old life. In exchange, he gives up one day from his past. A day from his childhood that he doesn't even remember.Unfortuntaely, that day turns out to be the day he was born, and this leads to an ""It's a Wonderful Life"" scenario where Shrek doesn't know Fiona, Donkey, Puss-in-Boots, or any of his friends, and Rumplestiltskin rules the Kingdom with a tiny iron fist. The resulting story is a great deal of fun, with Fiona now a warrior leading an ogre rebellion, the Gingerbread Man fighting as a gladiator against Animal Crackers, and so forth. The humor isn't back to it's highest heights, but there are a good number of genuine laughs. And the heart is back bigtime. I found ""Shrek Forever After"" surprisingly touching..Okay, it's not as good as ""Toy Story 3"" is likely to be, nor is it as good as ""How to train your Dragon"". but I had a blast with ""Shrek Forver After"" and can't wait to take my niece and nephew",Shrek Forever After
146,puffball97,Indescribable,1,6 June 2010,"Over the years, the megalomaniacal geniuses of the Dreamworks animated movies are getting unfunnier and unfunnier with star power and pop culture references; they think they are smart to lure unsuspecting moviegoers and families into thinking their movies will sell to the world and will be just as good as the first ""Shrek"" or even ""Shrek 2,"" which is sad to say, the only two good Dreamworks movies there ever was. Everything else is all the same. Get a roundup of actors. Draw them to how they look like in their human forms. Give personalities to the characters that match their acting styles, only to exploit those actors. Add some stupid pop culture references out of nowhere to make the adults laugh, and they never do. And then the movie rakes in the money, but adults get bored and think it's just another ego vehicle, and small children are too young to notice a thing.So is to speak of ""Shrek Forever After,"" which they say will be last ""Shrek"" movie, and hopefully so because it is simply the worst and worse than ""Shrek the Third,"" where the series was starting to outwear its welcome. So has the dumb Dreamworks animation studios, and I hope I'll never see another one of their animated movies, just sticking with Pixar, like all other smart moviegoers. Adults and children all love Pixar, and it has never failed on gone on an ego trip even once.In my best overview, Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz, Eddie Murphy, Antonio Banderas, John Cleese (who died as the frog in ""Shrek the Third, and appears in a flashback in the first scene), and Julie Andrews return, getting their paychecks, but little payoff. Walt Dohrn is the new villain, a creepy character named Rumplestiltskin, and he isn't convincing, just dark and creepy. This is without a doubt the darkest of all the Shrek Movies, with the darkest settings and elements. Bored with his life as a family man, Myers as Shrek wants to go back to the glory days as an ogre, so he makes a deal with Rumplestiltskin, foolishly signs the contract, and gets into so much trouble in his alternate reality world. He is not born, and Rumplestiltskin is the head of Far Far Away. The gnome has captured all ogres but Shrek. Diaz as Fiona, who looks like a warrior, is captured, and in this reality, she doesn't know who Shrek is. Murphy as Donkey tags along and jabbers as always. Banderas as Puss in Boots does nothing but look fat. The witches are Rumplestiltskin's henchwomen who try to capture Shrek and don't let him go, and like all the other characters, they are creepy.If you think that's enough, rats (not the cute kind rom ""Ratatouille""),slugs, and eyeballs serve as sight gags. A bratty young boy chants in a gurgly voice, ""Do the roar"" to Shrek, in a cheap attempt to get laughs at the opening scene of the birthday party. Cakes are smashed.This movie was made in 3D, and this is the biggest ripoff of the year. I'm lucky I got in with discount tickets. Save your money everyone. And this has been the highest grossing movie for four weekends, but has the lowest and weakest box office record of all the ""Shrek"" movies. Hey, I'm a fan of Ralph Bakshi's ""Wizards,"" and this is no small comparison, but where one would think ""Wizards,"" or more appropriately, his ""Lord of the Rings"" the next year, was dark and murky, I thought ""Wizards"" was hilarious in a Mel Brooks mode. ""Shrek Forever After"" holds the record for the least cute, dreariest, and murkiest animated movie I've ever witnessed, and more so than Bakshi's ""Lord of the Rings"" and Disney's only PG-rated ""The Black Cauldron."" Some things have to move on, and ""Shrek"" is one of them after a delightful start.",Shrek Forever After

But this movie does have its strong points, it was quite funny and entertaining.

Shrek 2 was an absolute marvel. I loved a majority of the film and it's intense and great scenes. Shrek The Third turned the series into trash with it's unoriginality. Lazy villain choice, and the same setting as the 2nd movie, Far Far Away. But Shrek Forever After is actually a movie that piqued my interest. This is easily the 2nd best Shrek movie. Only one flight away from Shrek 2. So let's get out the Pros & Cons list, shall we?Pros:
A Shrek movie that finally has actual heart and emotion.
I love the addition of more ogres.
The story is interesting.
Although Rumpelstiltskin was in the 3rd film, at least he is a better villain than Charming.
The way ogres blow on their noses to make horn sounds is quite cool.
The dialogue is quite decent actually.
The film pretends Shrek The Third doesn't exist.
Cons:
Far Far Away is the main setting AGAIN!
4 movies in, and Shrek is still not being very nice to people aside from Fiona.
Everyone in the alternate universe has to be a slave, besides Rumpelstiltskin.
So, I think this is a decent movie. Not the best, but slightly better than Shrek 1, and way better than Shrek The Third. 9/10.",Shrek Forever After
152,wjeffer,This one was definitely better than the . . .,6,24 June 2011,". . . third installment, but ""Shrek 2"" definitely remains the best of the four. At least, they took their time with ""Shrek Forever After"" to devise a pleasant twist on the tale of ""Rumpelstiltskin"" and incorporate that story into Shrek's and Fiona's. They didn't make very good use of Donkey this time around, however, which was unfortunate. Overall, it was good, as compared to the less than satisfying ""Shrek 3"", which suffered in large part from the creators rushing to capitalize on the masterful ""Shrek 2"" (which remains the best of the four). At least, the creators were able to end the story with a good one!",Shrek Forever After

154,wolfcub7,Entertaining and a great closure to the series,10,13 July 2010,"That is me hoping there won'r be more Shreks. Because this part's story and morals truly made a perfect closure from where and how it all begun in the original ""Shrek"". Also, I think this part gave a whole new depth and meaning for the theme song ""It Is You I Have Loved All Along"".I don't think a 3D version has anything to offer, you might as well watch this in 2D. (But I think the whole 3D thing is pointless anyway. Movies ARE meant to be watched and not ""lived"". That's why they are movies and not real life experiences. That's why we don't NEED them at our face.) Anyway... This is totally worth the price of the movie theater ticket, if you can look at the film from a little bit new perspective.I understand why some might think this not as good and magical as some of the earlier parts as this does lack action and fairytale feel, relatively seeing to them, but I don't think this needed any of it, to be as great as they. Because I see this as a closure, which needed to focus on the morals rather than magic and fairytale elements. And the moral of this part, in my opinion, is the deepest and most important of them all. Count your blessings before they're all gone and don't throw them away for something you already chose to give up, because what past choices seem insignificant for the moment, may have make all the difference in the world. This is combined to the lesson of how you should always read any contract before signing it. ""You took the day I was born!"" ""Correction: You GAVE it to me. Since you were never born, you have no wife and no kids. And when this day ends, your life will end."" No Shrek movie has ever taken its morals to this utter level and meaning. I find it completely fascinating and extremely well portrayed in the story.I didn't find the humor remarkably childish or in any way changed seeing to the earlier parts. At least, not during most of the movie.Also, I don't care if the entertainment relied much on the beloved characters, because the characters were put in completely different situations than they had ever been in, which caused them to have developed some new feelings and characteristics. Especially Fiona, and Puss.And one of the new characters I find relatively outstanding. Rumplestiltskin. All the other versions I have known, portray him as a rather helpless dwarf, who only pops up here and there and demand a mother to give him her baby, while he perhaps cracks some supposed-to-be-good jokes. But here, they portrayed him as a clever, cunning, bitter, angry fellow with a new obsession and turned him into downright a little sh*t. And the way they had drawn/animated him reflected every bit of that. I think he's a wonderful character in this film.Perhaps there is less for kids to enjoy than in the earlier parts, but can you even say that any of the Shrek movies have been targeted essentially to kids anyway? I never thought they were.This fourth Shrek is officially one of the most inspiring movies I've seen for quite a while and does stand strong ground next to earlier parts of the series. Warmly recommendable to a Shrek fan, and to anyone who's out for good entertainment.",Shrek Forever After
155,pcongleton-1,"Returning to what made Shrek fun, but did it work?",8,17 June 2010,"What was so great about the first Shrek film was the relationship between the characters and the world that was created for this film. The relationship between Shrek, Donkey, Fiona and all the other characters was ironclad in its design. The world created for Shrek – the fact that he is an Ogre, lives in the woods and is feared by most, but not by his friends, was just wonderful fun. I feel the Shrek Franchise made a mistake, when they went away from what they established in the first film, by moving the Shrek ""family of characters"" into a new setting, which is being King and Queen of the Kingdom of Far Far Away, with the supporting cast falling in line behind them and changing the setting from the woods to the Kingdom. In the second and third films I felt we lost some of what Shrek was all about. It seemed to take on a form that had been seen time and time again in other films. It lost its luster and became boring. So, it was nice to see this film (#4), try to recapture that magic by channeling elements found in the first film, by using a unique-device (I have been calling it the J.J. Abrams approach), by having Shrek's past changed by a devious ""bad guy"", thus removing the King and Queen scenario and creating a situation much like the first film. How would it do? Even though the second and third films had problems maintaining my interest, what they did have was laughs and great animation. Well the laughs have been all used up by the time we get to this film. Donkey's character almost was invisible. The bad guy, in this case was Rumpelstiltskin, seemed to be a carbon-copy of all the other antagonists from the previous films and the supporting characters, including the ridiculous Dragon, have run out of gas. We have an idea that starts out great, but is mired down by a tired formula, with not many laughs. I did enjoy the army of witches that Rumpelstiltskin had at his command. The animation does look fantastic and that is boosted by the witches appearances. They actually were scary. I was disappointed with this film because of it not being funny, but the great animation, the witches and rehashing what made Shrek great makes it the second best film of the series.",Shrek Forever After

157,xenomorph_uk,The second best one... so far.,6,15 July 2010,"In a nutshell, better than the second and third movies, but not as good as the first.It wasn't nearly as funny as I expected. At first I figured this was due to a fairly empty auditorium (you know how infectious laughter can be). Then I began wondering if perhaps I was just becoming too old and long in the tooth for that particular brand of humour. Finally it dawned on me that much of my own amusement was diluted by the fact that I'd seen most of the funny bits already... on the movie trailers.Shrek 4 is yet another victim of the trailer curse, which definitely seems to ruin comedies more than any other movie type. As per usual, the two trailers I'd seen before finally catching the movie, seemed determined to show all of the laugh-out-loud moments.Have you ever noticed that comedies such as Knocked Up and The Hangover are so much more successful and talked about simply because the trailers show far less (in Knocked Up's case, they used just one scene).Anyway, Shrek 4 was entertaining enough despite the afore mentioned issue. I did laugh out loud a couple of times as did most others in the cinema. The story is fun and quite clever. The voice acting is top notch as always and the animation is as fantastic as you'd expect.So if by some miracle you can avoid the movie trailers then I expect you'll enjoy this movie more than I did. Otherwise, watching this fun bit of animation isn't a bad way to spend an afternoon :)",Shrek Forever After
158,nmanwarren,Shrek Forever After Wasnt as Great as the others,7,14 February 2019,"Shrek 4 was not movie-worthy and definitely didnt live up to its name.Shrek: Forever After is the ""final"" movie in the Shrek movie series, ""ending"" the Shrek story. However, the entire movie just felt pointless. It begins with Shrek's firstborn's birthday party. Then it ends with Shrek's firstborn birthday party. The entire movie is just how Shrek learns about family and then everything goes back to the beginning. This movie definitely was NOT a cinematic conclusion, it would have done better as a mini-movie and not a feature film.However it is still a Shrek movie and it included the classic characters and still had the same good jokes. I guess its fine for kids but honestly people who are dedicated Shrek fans will be dissapointed by this movie.",Shrek Forever After
159,cchires,Shrek goes out on a low note:(,4,23 May 2010,"It's sad to watch a fall from greatness and that's what can best be described for the 'Shrek' films. The series started out strong with the first two movies and began to stumble into routine with the third. Now all the novelty and energy is gone and with 'Shrek Ever After' the audience gets a predictable, by-the-numbers, formula movie.I think the main problem has to do with the fact that Shrek, Donkey, Fiona and Puss have lost all of the chemistry that made the earlier movies fun. The comfort in their interactions drains all of the opening scenes of life. The main crisis in this film is also a little weak: Shrek has grown tired of his life as a celebrity ogre (this plot point is handled awkwardly in the opening scenes) and makes a deal with Rumplestilskin to go back to when he was feared by others. You know the movie's in trouble when this ""It's a Wonderful Life"" scenario is inserted to try to breathe some novelty into Shrek's story.This wouldn't be a problem if the movie had fun with this situation. Sadly, it focuses more on action scenes to show off the 3-D effects rather than focusing on the alternate realities of the characters. There is an extended scene of Shrek flying a witches broom to escape from Rumplestilskin's castle, which is cool, but really exist for no other purpose than to give the audience a roller-coaster simulation. The same can be said for a drawn out flying dragon scene in the beginning of the film as well.This movie also has less of the pop culture references that made the other films in the series enjoyable for adults as well as kids. The first film, in particular, seemed to be taking a lot of jabs at Disney, now it seems like Dreamworks is less hostile towards their competitors. Ultimately, The film wastes opportunities to have fun not just with the series regulars but also with the new characters: the Pied Piper, Rumplestilskin, the witches and all the other ogres. This was disappointing way to say goodbye to Shrek:(",Shrek Forever After

It has good humor if we compare to Shrek Third it is better than it.Shrek bored with his life ends up in the treachery magical contact which makes realize his mistake and importance of family , love and friends He has to once again have to kiss Fiona and there kiss will broke the contact but he has one night to do that and Fiona no longer remembers him, he have to make her realize about them.But still it is nowhere near to first two installment of the series. But movie has good parts and better moment than third.",Shrek Forever After
162,Karlamon,Not the best Shrek film but a fine closure for the series,7,14 October 2010,"Since 2001, Shrek has touched our hearts with humor and charm and has become a major icon in the animation industry. The first two Shrek films were great fun delivering amusing fairy tale satire and memorable characters. Shrek the Third however, never got my attention and I herd it was pretty bad so I decided to skip it.Now we have Shrek Forever After (aka, The Final Chapter), the four and final film in the series. I didn't get interested in this one either. But when I saw that this movie was playing on a Qantas flight I was on to Sydney, I decided to give it a chance.The plot in the final installment is fairly interesting. Shrek has grown tired of being a father and a celebrity and wishes to live the days of an ogre again. He is later scammed into a deal with Rumpelstiltskin to become ""ogre for a day"" and finds himself in twisted version of Far Far Away where Rumpelstiltskin is King and Shrek is known to nobody (not even Fiona who is now an hunting ogre). Shrek must stop Rumpelstiltskin's evil deed before it's too late. It's a decent presentation.DreamWorks gives out plenty of action in this entry (which the second one lacked) and this does bring the memories of the first film. Speaking of previous films, Forever After has a good number of connections with past events in the series. There aren't as many laughs as there were in the previous films, but it does deliver it's funny bits quite well such as break dancing witches.Visuals are a big treat in this installment as they have improved a lot over the years. They're fantastic. All the main cast are back and they deliver a reasonable performance for their characters. Walt Dohrn however, does a great job providing the voice for the antagonist Rumpelstiltskin showing a great expression of wit and evilness.Overall, it's a fun entry for the series. But is The Final Chapter the best of the four Shrek films? Not exactly, but it doesn't have to be. Shrek 4 may not have the magic from the first two films but what it does do is improve over it's poor predecessor and end the once doomed series with charm and dignity. ""B""",Shrek Forever After
163,sjd615,"The Shrek series is done, but don't be surprised if there is a fifth one.",7,30 May 2010,"After a full decade, the popular Ogre series is finally coming to an end. The ride was a great experience but did come with some bumps along the way. The first one was a classic that many still have on VHS like myself, and the second one was a welcoming sequel that also became a classic. However, in 2007 the third installment came in where many people did not like it at all where Prince Charming was not a liked character at all. It was a bland story and seemed like a bridge type movie just to get to the fourth one. The last one Shrek Forever After in my opinion was a pretty good final installment. Shrek began having many problems and issues like many new fathers have and cannon handle it. He just wants to get away from everything just for a day but of course everything goes wrong. After the sort of annoying beginning it was a great story and ended really well reminding us of interesting points form the first movie. Overall, even though it was offered in 3D it was not a great 3D movie. Yeah the characters and scenery stuck out like it was in in HD but there was no real distinct WOW points that looked like something was jumping out at you. In the end, it was cool to see in 3D but if your not the biggest fan, and want to save a few bucks then you can just see the regular. It was a great era of Shrek where they are ALREADY talking about a fifth installment about Puss in Boots.",Shrek Forever After
164,taylormorgan12,Finally it ends.,5,26 May 2010,"Shrek Forever After is a great movie to take your kids to go see. It has the dry humor, the silly moments, and of course every fairytale melted into one. It is not as entertaining for the adults as it was during the first two Shrek movies. There was nothing original about the humor as if we had already heard all the jokes before, and the repetitive themes were a little too much.The effects were spectacular though, and would be even better to see in 3-D, as I did not. I recommend this to families-- and families only. If you are a teenager going with a bunch of friends, you probably won't like it as much, same to young adults. I give it a 5/10 due to lacking a passionate script.",Shrek Forever After
165,wryterz,The worst in the bunch of good films.,4,25 August 2010,"For a long time I've heard and read very negative things about Shrek the Third, which I enjoyed, a lot, but I was still looking forward to this supposed final chapter in the very popular series by DreamWorks Animation.Shrek has grown tired of his family life and longs to be that monstrous and wild feared ogre he once was. His reputation has gone down the drain and now his swamp is a tourist attraction sight, and he is constantly tired out by family commitments and chores. Desperate to live his old life for one more day, he signs a contract with the scheming Rumplestiltskin but in return lives a day where Donkey works for evil witches, Puss is a fat overfed cat and Fiona is the leader of a group of freedom fighting ogres. The problem is that none of them remember Shrek, at all.This should have been the ultimate Shrek movie, but it is not. The problem with this is that surprisingly, the characters have no scope, except Shrek and maybe Fiona, who is a, feisty and somewhat pleasing to eyes, ogress. All the beloved characters from Donkey and Puss to Gingy and Pinocchio have nothing to do but appear briefly. The emphasis here is on Shrek's journey of realisation. Though Mike Myers is great as Shrek, the character himself was never the strong point in the series and therefore to have him roam around for the majority of the film trying to fix things was not appealing.The animation is awesome and supersedes anything we've seen before in a Shrek film but that is just not enough for me. My 4-year old son laughed, jumped and cheered at all the right predictable places but I managed to smile maybe once, if that.Of course it's really good to hear Murphy, Banderas and even Julie Andrews familiar voices but the jokes are dry and like I said before, Donkey and company really don't have all that much to do. And we don't even know what happened to that famous character Arthur. Remember him? Another downer in this film is that we don't see much of Pinocchio or Gingy, both of which are extremely enjoyable to watch. But the biggest let down of all is Rumplstiltskin. First of all, in the previous film he looks totally different to what he looks in this, even though his one line cameo in Shrek the Third may go unnoticed. Secondly, the voice for this character is so cringe-worthy I had trouble keeping a straight face every time he spoke, and believe me, I was not laughing.Once this is over, there are many things that pop into your head and none of these are in favour of this tripe. I honestly tried to like this film because I enjoyed the previous three immensely but when you wish that this had now never been made or that Dreamworks should have brought back Prince Charming and Justin Timberlake's ""Atrie"" you know then that this is not the best film to come out of this studio.It's not Dreamworks worst film but it surely is on par with the worst, which in my opinion is Shark Tale, though I have not seen that Bee Movie.On a more positive note, I have mentioned that the animation is very good but the expressions of Rumplestiltskin are excellent. From his sparkling and pleading eyes to his ever so grim and maniacal snort, you cannot complain that visually he is a marvellous character to view. And then we also get to see a whole army of ogres, all of which are strangely and positively different from one another. Their secret hideout and their vastness I appreciated and though very predictable, I did enjoy how Shrek tries to make Fiona remember who he is. Also, the ogre babies are extremely adorable.BEST SCENE: There isn't one, honestly. I did however giggle when warrior Gingy starts to attack Shrek's boot.FINAL VERDICT: Unfortunately, Dreamworks have thought about the money and not much about this very poor story. Animation aside, this film is very weak and if it wasn't for the characters we all know and love, I'd say this was really, really bad. Whoever says this is better than Shrek the Third seriously needs their head checking out.4/10 – Average",Shrek Forever After
166,mamoon-nader-688-804158,Waaay better than the third Shrek...,7,20 May 2010,"To be honest, I was expecting to watch something that would make me laugh like I did in the first two parts of shrek hoping that dream works learned from their mistake after the epic failure of the third installment, but it still didn't reach their level of awesomeness, but you can say that shrek did it again....Partially.In general, the movie is cool, it's funny and entertaining, it has its hilarious moments and the story is pretty much satisfying, Way better than the third shrek if that's what you want to hear.So in the end, I recommend you just go and watch it with your popcorn and drinks and prepare to enjoy it enough but expect that much.",Shrek Forever After
167,mcfjr42,"Far from being a failure, but Far, Far Away from being great",7,1 January 2014,"The Shrek series seemingly comes to its conclusion in this movie, and this is probably for the best; the series really lost its touch with the third movie, and sadly this movie, despite being okay, just can't recapture the magic and hilarity of the first two Shreks.The plot is simple: Shrek is fed up with fatherhood and his life as he is no longer taken seriously as an ogre, so he sells a day of his life to Rumpelstiltskin so he can live one day of being a feared ogre again. Unfortunately, Rumpelstiltskin took the day Shrek was born away, meaning Shrek never existed. He's in a race against time to find a way out of this mess or he'll disappear forever.The plot seemed to me to move by really fast, and I don't necessarily mean that as a positive; for instance, Shrek gets in with the ogre resistance rather quickly, giving no time for any of the other ogres to really be developed. This also doesn't leave much room for the alternate timeline Shrek is in to be explored; we see characters like Gingy and Pinocchio but they don't contribute much aside from a couple of joke scenes.The Pied Piper shows up at one point, but after his one scene he's never mentioned again. I was rather disappointed he wasn't used in the final battle.The biggest problem this movie has is the comedy: it's just not as funny as the first two. Yes, it's leagues better than the third, but that's not saying much. There are a few laughs to be had, but they aren't as consistent.Overall, this is a harmless and forgettable outing for the grumpy green giant. Though Shrek probably deserved a better sendoff than this, it's still okay for what it is. I'd say check it out if it's on TV, but otherwise you can just skip this and watch the first two and Puss in Boots instead.",Shrek Forever After

So Shrek tried to make things right again. Shrek found a way to get things right the massage was a true love kiss will break the spell. Shrek met a man called Rumpelstiltskin who offered him a deal for three days only. My favourite part My favourite part was when the pied piper made the ogres dance.

170,nilbogman,Did the writers even SEE Shrek 2?,1,4 June 2010,"It's not a HUGE spoiler, but I'll check the box just to be safe.So anyways, Shrek 4 movie had all the visuals of a great movie. Outstanding animation, great digital cinematography, an entire world created by the animators, great directing, etc. Heck, I'll even go so far as to say the story line was pretty good-it had its twists and turns, almost like the original two Shrek films!If the writers of Shrek 4 see this review, they'll definitely slap themselves silly on how they missed such a HUGE plot hole caused by Shrek 2. In Shrek 2, Fiona's parents arranged her marriage with the Fairy Godmother's son, Prince Charming. So, if Shrek hadn't come to rescue Fiona from the tower, Prince Charming would soon enough. She wouldn't escape by herself. Besides that infuriating plot hole, the writers lacked the magic of the original two Shrek films. It may be that kids movies writers nowadays would be afraid to have a line saying ""I can get you a prince with a sexy tush!"" but part of the magic of the original two Shrek movies were the original, if sometimes on the dirty side, gags which Shrek 4 almost totally lacked.If you were a fan of the original Shrek movie and you hoped from the reviews that this movie was a departure from Shrek 3, I'm sad to say that in some ways it is (i.e. plot line), but in most ways it's not (i.e. unoriginal gags). In comparison to other recent kids movies (Monsters vs. Aliens, Bee Movie) this is quite a bit better, but still don't expect much. I'm in a good mood so I'll give it a 6.",Shrek Forever After

Sure the jokes were Clichéd and the plot was a bit unoriginal, sure its not better than the first two. Although its definitely better than the third. But I still had fun watching it and laughed out loud the whole way.The Last Scene was a bit disappointing, I thought we would see another Puss and Donkey Sequence just like Shrek 1,2,3 but I was disappointed by the lack of magic the final scene had, its supposed to be the final scene where you see Shrek and friends for the last time.

It's still good but not as great as the first and the second. The previous ones were masterpieces. Shrek 4 is not original unlike the first. I must say that it was more mature than the others but is that what you're really looking for in Shrek movies? I came to see some pretty good jokes. In addtion, some of the jokes were pretty similar to the previous ones. Its conflict was pretty boring unlike the smashing conflict of the 2nd. But it is absolutely better than the third but only because its story makes much more sense. Of course it isn't the worst movie ever, and not the worst Shrek films. Should you watch this in the theaters? My advice is wait for it to come out on DVD. You will not waste your time watching this, but you won't have a blast either.",Shrek Forever After

I did enjoy this movie.The major problem with this movie was that it just was another Shrek movie. Similar plot line, same jokes as the other ones, same resolution.As a movie, it was alright, but it failed to stand out as anything. It didn't do anything to make it stand out from the rest of Shrek movies, or in movies at all. It was ""Just another Shrek Movie."" That is how I felt about it. It was an interesting concept, adding to Shrek's life story, but by the end of the movie, I thought to myself ""Well, at least I didn't pay to see this.""So, I would say it's worth a watch, but don't expect anything exceptional.",Shrek Forever After

Boo Hoo poor Shrek can't go out and get into trouble anymore and rape and pillage the village like he did when he ran solo. Now, he has responsibilities, domestic responsibilitiesjust like us women have and he can't handle it. He wants to yell, kick, and scream, just like every little boy, or man, going through his mid-life crisis; and when he gets what he wished for—that 'man' freedom—he realizes that he blew the best thing he had going for him, his wife and kids. Of course, it's a fairy tale so he's able to snap his fingers and the world goes back to the way it's supposed to be. I think every man should be forced to watch Shrek 4, the melodrama or the treachery of a man's life when he can't go out hooting and hollering with the boys at night anymore, because, in the end, the jolly green giant realizes there is no place like home, and that's where he belongs.

179,jpwarton,Depressing end to a creative series,5,3 July 2010,"It's unfortunate that the Shrek series ends here. Not because it should continue, but because this film could've benefited from another year in script development and actually done the saga justice. Attempting to deconstruct the daily reality of a life lived 'Happily Ever After', this final chapter goes into some really depressing territory that is anything but kids' stuff and where the laughs are scant at best.Shrek, finding himself domesticated and beloved by people, grows weary of the day-to-day monotony and wishes for the salad days of a pre-Fiona life. Enter Rumpelstiltskin, voiced by GENUINE VOICE ACTOR Walt Dohrn who, as the Machiavellian imp, is perhaps the ONLY shining light in the film. Shrek makes a deal with him to have a day where he was once again feared and free of responsibility, and gives him a childhood day in exchange as payment. Rumple takes the day of his birth, sending Shrek into a skewed reality in which he was never born (ála 'It's a Wonderful Life') and where Fiona leads a band of ogres against the tyranny of Rumpelstiltskin's rule over Far Far Away.The film's bleak tone is made worse by its dark colour palate (since most of it occurs that night), seedy atmosphere (e.g. a 'cock' fight between the Gingerbread Man and a pack of animal crackers), and skewed characters – beloved characters – that just aren't themselves. Without the laughter or the love, 'Shrek Forever After' leaves half the family out of the equation. My kids were utterly bored, and sad to say, I don't blame them.",Shrek Forever After

The movie helped the franchise gain some of its heart back that was lacking in the third film and had some terrific action scenes. The first time I saw it I didn't think it was very funny, but when I went back to see it a second time I was laughing plenty of times.

But this movie is definitely great. The music is average and the song choices are complimentary but that's fine since it wasn't a terrible score like the thirds. The new characters are good and they don't feel like forgettable characters like all the ones in the Third.
Rumpelstiltskin is a great villain. He doesn't feel like a prince charming. Prince charming was an awful character but this one was not. Because unlike the other characters, He won. He didn't fail unlike every other villain and certainly felt like a threat.
The story is amazing. This is the best version of Fiona because she actually had meaning. Fiona in 2 and 3 didn't really feel like a vital character because she did nothing vital. In this one she did and I love it.

Sadly, I didn't think it was funny at all! If anything, it was too dark and serious as Shrek, unhappy with his married life, sets off to go rediscover himself in a bleak alternate universe. The characters felt like nothing new, we've seen them 3 times now and there's nothing much interesting about them this time around. No one had anything funny to say, and most of the jokes were already seen in the trailer. The new villain was decent, Rumpelstiltskin, but other than him there weren't any new characters at all, at least not any memorable ones.I'd put this one in the ""wait to see it on DVD"" category if you're a big Shrek fan.",Shrek Forever After

I also would have loved to see the older characters as well. I feel that would have completed it. I mean, needless to say, Puss-N-Boots and Donkey made me LOL, and the storyline was great, but if I took a step back and just looked at the whole movie, it did not meet expectations. It was not as funny which took away from the whole experience. To me the movies got progressively less funny. Despite the negative review, I did not hate it, and if you've never seen the other 3 Shrek movies, you might actually enjoy this.

He strikes a deal with the sneaky Rumplestiltskin which results in him entering a world where he was never born. As a result, Rumple is now the king of Far Far Away and none of Shreks friends know him. He must reverse the evil curse before the day runs out, which will result in him being erased from existence forever.As with most Dreamworks films, Shrek Forever After boasts fluid, detailed CGI animation. It still does not look as vibrant or charming as a Pixar film, but the detail packed into the scenery and characters makes this a beautiful looking film. The 3D is a waste of money in my eyes. I payed £17 for two 3D tickets and all it did was subtract from the colour of the film, and it was not put to good use. It just gave the film some unnecessary depth, which did nothing to enhance the experience. I don't want films to be made exclusively with 3D in mind, but if you're not going to put it to good use, then don't con people into buying tickets for it. So be warned viewers: buy a regular ticket for a cheaper price and watch the movie more vibrantly without those daft glasses.My main criticism with this film is how it does nothing to build upon the Shrek storyline. Shrek The Third could have been a better film in my eyes, but it completed the story. Shrek had married his true love, the kingdom of Far Far Away had been restored, and Shrek lived happily ever after. Shrek Forever After continues the story in an unnecessary fashion. Calling it The Final Chapter made me expect an epic conclusion to the story. Instead, the film feels more like a spin off, and does not conclude the franchise. I'm glad the plans for Shrek 5 were scrapped, because this is where this dying series had to end. I also felt this film wasn't well structured. The growing love between Shrek and the now war hungry Fiona felt rushed and unrealistic, and the film kept fluctuating between emotion and humour. It seems Dreamworks cannot master animation like Pixar can. They have to resort to unnecessary comedy a lot of the time, and it's annoying.The voice acting was good. Eddie Murphy did a funny performance as Donkey and the rest of the actors also did well. The voice for Rumplestiltskin, Walt Dohrn, did a fabulous job at an evil yet comedic villain voice, and it was awesome.Overall, Shrek Forever After is a good film worth seeing if you like the Shrek series. It does nothing to the series and feels more like a spin off but on it's own it's a reasonably entertaining comedy. Just don't expect it to be as a good as the first two films, which I loved. Also, save your money and watch it in 2D. The 3D is there to con you into spending more money to watch a less colourful, layered film. I give this film a 6/10.",Shrek Forever After

193,chezestudios,Oscar? Most likely NOT!,4,24 May 2010,"Firstly, let's get straight to the review. THE MOVIE was dull. What've they done. They ruined a great franchise. From the classic Shrek; to this little rubbish movie. The movie is just a joke, the animation is great but the story plot is wrong. It doesn't even follow the time line of the other Shrek. The voice of Ruplestukins was great, his voice screeched which made me WOW. The movie should thank the voice cover. Sorry i have no idea who. Shrek Shrek Shrek, its just a disgrace, the movie was so bad; i slept through the last part. Not trying to insult that much but. Shrek Forever delivers with the great animations and voice, But the bad story and dialogue. Will they make the Oscars. Probably Not. i would be surprised if they even got a animation3.6/10 Sorry shrek fans-. You won't like this one.",Shrek Forever After
194,Nick_Dezzy,An excuse for blockbuster,3,20 December 2012,"We all hate comparing things , but when a worldwide famous franchise as ""SHREK"" appears on your nearest theater , not putting the previous Dreamworks efforts into question is probably a daunting task. The first two ones were awe-inspiring and a milestone into animation films.The voice acting was superb , the characters were deep and the audience could relate with them , the OST was excellent disregarding whatever your musical taste is , and the plot was indeed an Oscar-worthy script. With the third one all those elements seemed to be there , but diminished and somewhat blurred and somehow far from the original idea.In Shrek Forever After , all those elements that made the franchise a world-class filmi are totally gone.Not a single trace of them. Shrek has turned into a dumbed-down story with clichés overused into Hollywood filmi.Putting aside the fact that Shrek 4 is carrying a heavy weight on the shoulders , on it's own it's not even an OK film , simply a forgettable summer-carry-along-your-kids blockbuster. Sure , the animation is better than ever and surpasses the other 3 filmi , but animation relies on technology and it improves and becomes better with time so the visual aspect is not a positive thing.Shame on you Dreamworks , shame on you.If you enjoyed the first 2 filmi and liked the third: A)If your expectations are low :give it a try B)If your expectations are modest:forget this one. C)If your expectations are high :forget this one.",Shrek Forever After

While I watched the movie in a Hong Kong cinema I recall maybe 3 times that viewers, of which 50% young children, really had to laugh, I mean this belly shaking, tears rolling over your cheeks laughter. The idea itself is not bad, but the execution is mediocre and worst of all they took out the fun part. I wonder if the creators had to laugh about it themselves. I really tried to have an enjoyable 93 minutes, but Shrek did not deliver. I wouldn't say it is a complete waste of time, but unless you are an true Shrek addict or like 3D effects, you may spend your time on funnier movies. I hope the makers will have a look at Shrek 1 one more time, before they might create another part in this 'everlasting' series.",Shrek Forever After

The movie wasn't THAT bad, but I thought they could've done ten times better than what I have just watched. The animation was good, the actors were good, blah blah blah. Plot wasn't too bad either. A little dark, but not bad. And they also make some references from the older movies, which I loved.Granted that I had high expectations for it (mostly because I've been told that it was the best one for the series). It wasn't at all funny as I thought it would be, except for a couple moments, and Shrek was so cheesy, it was embarrassing. I mean, even Donkey and Puss weren't that funny, and they usually make the movies.Oh, and I've read about someone saying how it's so horrible of Donkey to call Gingy a ""cracker"", and they said how racial it was. For me, it was hilarious. I don't think they intended for it to be bad, just to make a joke, since Gingy is, in fact, a cracker, and most of the kids wouldn't know anyways.Overall, I gave this movie a 7/10, due to the lack of jokes (that I'm used to seeing from the Shrek series) and Shrek's cheesiness. If you've seen the last three, then I recommend to just finish it up. Like I said, it's not THAT bad, but I wouldn't buy it.",Shrek Forever After

The plot focused too much on the first film, and didn't focus enough making an original plot with comedy. It was a bore to watch and genuinely shouldn't be allowed to go ahead with a 5th.The film seems to focus on using the script and storyline of the first film and rewriting it slightly. It was a short, boring, badly acted, badly written and badly everything film. The only thing giving it a little magic was the experience of the people making it, as this was the 4th one.

206,markz-8,A return to form to end the franchise,9,21 May 2010,"Shrek Forever After (and yes, that's the official title as seen in the first real shot of the film) is a welcome return to form after the disappointment of Shrek The Third, which LOOKED beautiful but hit all the wrong notes. This one has recaptured the fun of the franchise while potentially being the darkest one in terms of plot. Alternate universe stories have been done to death, but the appealing nature of so many of the characters makes this one work, as well as the fact that the filmmakers are clearly trying to wrap up the story (which includes a small bit of retconning at the beginning, but it pays off toward the end). The 3D occasionally falls into the trap of throwing things towards the audience, but the characters and sets are so beautifully animated in all dimensions (the textures of Shrek and Donkey, particularly, have improved even on the wonder that was Kung Fu Panda) that the 3D actually adds to the enjoyment. The first two remain the crown jewels of the franchise, but this is a worthy addition and a suitable end to the... well, saga is too strong a word, so storyline will have to do. And the bonus? Eddie Murphy gets to sing SEVERAL songs WITHIN the movie!",Shrek Forever After

Fiona is a badass in the alternate world, and it gives Shrek a wake up call. He's wants to be hated again, but instead he's hated in an entirely new, scary way. Overall, the whole movie is amazing and is just passed over because it's the 4th movie and the 3rd one was absolute trash.

Shrek has finally has a happily ever after, he has a wife, kids, and Donkey, but being a parent is hard and Shrek has only recently become accustomed to it after being alone all his life, and suddenly he has family and friends. Its a real shock to him. Shrek loves his family, and friends but does miss the simpler times. He feels stressed and escausted, so when everything goes wrong at his kids birthday he lashes out at Fiona and says that he wishes that everything would go back to the way it used to be when Fiona was locked away in a tower. This was aggressive of him, but when people are mad and stressed they act and say things they wouldn't mean. Besides Shrek is still an ogre after all. Shrek soon bumps into rumplestillskin (sorry if I said his name wrong) who grants shrek to be a ogre for a day, but in return Shrek gives him a day from his past. Shrek lives it up being a ogre until he discovers a wanted poster of Fiona, and when he goes to his swamp its dry and barron. Shrek gets kidnapped by witches and gets sent to Far far away which has been conquered by Rumplestillskin. Along the way he meets Donkey. We see that everything has changed and that the world is now brutal and dark. Shrek meets Rumplestillskin again, and is told that Rumplestillskin has taken the day Shrek was born. Shrek and Donkey break out of Far far away in a awesome action sequence, and are in the WOODS. Donkey is scared and runs away from Shrek. Notices his daughters doll and for the first time Shrek cries, realising how horrible it was to say what be did and abandon his family. Donkey sees this and now trusts Shrek. They then discover through folding the contract, that to break it Shrek needs to do true loves first kiss before midnight. Shronk and Dumpling rush to the dragons castle which is now dried up with no lava or dragon. Fiona is gone with just her hancicheef she was going to give him there. Shrek and Donkey leave and just wander around hopeless, but donkey falls into a hole, and now we are in a hidden Ogre society. We meet a warrior Fiona who is now embracing her ogre form. Shrek gets rejected. The Ogre alliance is trying to take down Rumplestillskin. Shrek tries win over Fiona, and they do start build some chemistry, and when Shrek kisses her it doesn't work.it wasn't real.Im too lazy to write the rest of the review, but trust me its good.",Shrek Forever After

Puss in his gigantic new avatar proves that he does not have be the normal jumping jack he is, and donkey for the first time after the first shrek shows that he does have an individual role to play. the story still feels afresh to me and they do live happily ever after.all in all a must watch.",Shrek Forever After

I don't want to give away too much but the violence and weapons have a very real, non-cartoonish quality to them. There is a point where Shrek gets captured and what happens to him is so horrible my daughter turns to me with tears rolling down her cheeks and asks ""Daddy, is Shrek going to be okay?"". My heart sank. I regret taking her to it. It continued with the violence until the last 5 minutes of the movie.

I am appalled and saddened that DreamWorks Animation would allow this racist name calling. To think it was suppose to be a ""joke"". Do you think using insulting words about someone's race is funny? Do you think this is appropriate for our children? If so, then DreamWorks Animation should change its target audience and movie rating because it has no business entertaining our children. Our country has come too far with easing racial issues to use it as a punch-line. Or maybe because it was making fun of Caucasians, it was considered okay. We all know that if the N-word was used that this movie would not have been produced. However, this is not about the double standards our country has about racism, but about the mere fact that a slang word was used to make fun of someone's race. The public deserves an apologize. It deserves an apologize from DreamWorks Animation, Jeffrey Kalzenberg (CEO), Mike Mitchell (Director), Josh Klausner (Writer), Darren Lemke (Writer), and the cast. Each and everyone of these individuals mentioned above had an opportunity to stand up for what was right and say that this is unacceptable.

It was nice seeing some of our old favorite characters and some new ones. After watching the film I actually wished it wasn't the last.

My question is, if, in Shrek 2, King was involved in the plot with Prince Charming and Fairy Godmother to rescue Fiona and have her marry Charming only to have had Shrek beat him to the castle, then why were they at Rumpelstiltskin's to begin with? If Shrek didn't exist anymore then wouldn't it be safe to assume that Charming would have arrived at the castle and rescued Fiona?

But for such a film, like Shrek Forever After for example, to actually be sorta/kinda decent... well, what more can a parent who has to sit through the thing on a Saturday afternoon hope for? Make no mistake: That's what Shrek 4 is primarily designed to be, one last cash-in on the popular character by DreamWorks that is less art than it is commerce, a milking of a concept that serves as a cold reminder that the studio's critically praised How to Train Your Dragon is the exception, not the rule, for the house that Jeffrey Katzenberg built.This latest adventure is a spin on an age-old concept, one we've seen in everything from Star Trek to Buffy to It's a Wonderful Life. When the titular green ogre (voiced once again by Mike Myers, in what may be his last viable gig) becomes frustrated by his new domesticated life of changing diapers and being henpecked by his wife, he stumbles into a deal with Rumpelstiltskin (Walt Dohrn), the trickster of legend who, well, tricks Shrek into wishing himself into non-existence.",Shrek Forever After

The story is very clever and engaging, yet at times feels rushed and careless. It's as if they simply didn't care about making Shrek go out on the same level it came in. On the other hand, it was a very interesting idea and there were some times when we got a glimpse of an almost return-to-form for the series, as short-lived as these moments were.My biggest complaint about the movie involves the characters. One of the key factors to the success of the previous movies were its fun and unique array of characters (especially Donkey, who is arguably the most popular character in the whole series). However, in this entry into the franchise, it seems as if these characters were pushed to the side, and the movie seemed to solely focus on Shrek. Now, I know he's the main protagonist and the namesake of the films, but the element that kept the entire series so fresh was its variety of characters. I was pretty saddened when I saw great characters like Puss in Boots and Donkey go from co-leads to minor characters. Even when they were on screen, the chemistry just didn't seem to be there. In the previous films (even in the third one), there is very strong chemistry between all of the film's main characters. In this one, it all feels a bit forced and doesn't have the same kind of emotional appeal as the others did.The lack of chemistry may also stem from a rather lackluster performance from some of the leads, most notably Mike Meyers as Shrek. I was very disappointed in his performance, to say the least. Having just recently watched the first two, it's impossible not to compare them all. I may not be able to speak for everybody, but in my opinion, Mike Meyers has considerably less enthusiasm and emotion with his character as he did before. He has turned Shrek, a disgustingly funny, yet lovable, character into a droll and lifeless shell of his former self.However, though some of the actors fell short of expectations, some actors shined. Walt Dohrn was absolutely BRILLIANT as Rumpelstiltskin. He put a fun and interesting twist on an old character and made him fresh and entertaining. He had just the right voice and attitude for the character, and it was obvious he was very passionate about the role and put a lot of emotion into it.So, all in all, Shrek Forever After was a welcome step-up over its immediate predecessor, yet a rushed story, lack of chemistry, and a less-than-stellar performance by Mike Myers kept it from coming anywhere close to the bar set by the first and second films in the series.I guess Shrek was right in the movie; he just isn't the same ogre he was before.",Shrek Forever After

230,shrekever,Best Shrek Forever,10,5 April 2018,"Best Shrek. It is a special movie, one of the best movies of all-time. It is a masterpiece on par with the mona lisa. What is so masterful about Shrek is its ambiguity. We never are certain if Shrek really did believe in the values that he professed. At the same time that he sets himself up as above the world, he longs for the affection of the common people. This is symbolized by his exploitative, and patronizing love for a chorus girl, Fiona. Her character is given a paper-thin characterization, the closest thing to a flaw in a perfect movie. Despite the film's pessimistic outlook, it is studded by moments of joy, beauty and emotional truth. The supporting cast of characters, most of them regulars from Wells' Mercury Theater are also superb. So many scenes in this movie linger forever in the memory, one is left with a stirring vision of the frailty of the human condition, the film gives us no easy answers and while being fiercely critical of many of it's characters is universal in it's compassion and sympathy, this is perhaps the most vital ingredient for great art. It's influence, was immediate, incalculable and mostly unacknowledged, the film was a box office and critical failure due to Hearst's efforts and it was not until years later that this film got the respect it deserved. Nowadays there is not one living film director of serious artistic intent that has not been deeply influenced by Shrek 4ever after. It's not just a masterpiece it's a creative touchstone.",Shrek Forever After
