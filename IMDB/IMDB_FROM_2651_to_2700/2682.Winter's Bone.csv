0,MartinHafer,Far better than I'd expected but also very difficult to watch--and clearly among the very best of 2010.,10,10 April 2011,"This film might easily scare the crap out of the viewer. It's a very unflinching view of a subculture most of use don't want to think about--the clannish country folk who run meth labs and have a very, very distorted and scary set of values. Apart from the recent documentary, ""The Wild and Wonderful Whites of West Virginia"", it's a group you just don't hear much about if you don't live in Appalachia and the Ozarks. Watching the film is almost guaranteed to be unsettling.The movie begins in an unnamed region in America. While the movie was filmed in Missouri, it could have well as on been made in Kentucky or Arkansas. A 17 year-old (Jennifer Lawrence) is taking care of her 6 and 12ear-old siblings as well as her mother--a woman who has lost her mind and is unable to care for herself let alone her kids. So the oldest girl has dropped out of school and has way too much to worry about--when she learns she now has an even bigger problem. It seems that her long absent father has disappeared while out on bail--and he's apparently not to be found anywhere. This is serious because to get bail, the man signed a note giving the bail bondsman the family's home! So, unless he is found quickly, the four will be out on the streets with no where to go.Normally, you'd think in a situation like this that the extended family and neighbors would chip in to help--however, not in this sick culture. That's because her family is made up of other low-lifes who run meth labs and adhere to a sad code of ethics--SHUT UP and DON'T ASK QUESTIONS. Each time she approaches one of her kinsman, you sit in your seat on edge--not knowing if they'll kill her or beat her senseless just for asking. Eventually, this DOES occur--and the scene is quite brutal. But Lawrence's character is determined--she and her family can't survive unless they either find the man or his corpse. What has happened to him and how she is able to possibly save their home is just just something you'll need to see for yourself--just be aware that it's very, very tough viewing.While the film was indeed unpleasant, I admire many things about it. First, Jennifer Lawrence did a fantastic job and might have won the Oscar for Best Actress most years. Unfortunately for her, Natalie Portman was such a strong candidate for the prize this same year. This made the recent Oscars quite impressive, with Lawrence (at 19) and the 13 year-old Hailee Stanfeld (who was nominated in the WRONG category of 'Best Supporting Actress'--even though it WAS a starring role) delivering amazing performances. Second, John Hawkes delivered an amazingly menacing and terrific performance. While he lost to Christian Bale in the Best Supporting Actor category, he sure made it close with a great role as Lawrence's VERY scary yet complex uncle. Third, I adored this film because it was what I would consider the 'Anti-Hollywood' nominee. It had a very small budget, no-name actors and a dismal location shoot--and managed, in my opinion, to be better than most of the films nominated for Best Picture--mostly because it featured fine acting and writing and no crazy special effects of insane budgets. I sure hope more such films are recognized in the future.My only quibble, and it's very tiny, is the use of the 'unsteady cam'--a recent trend that has been way overused. While it's reasonably appropriate for a movie like this one, I just hate the notion that a non-steady picture is somehow artsy--while, for some, it's actually nausea-inducing! Still, it's an exceptional film...provided you can stand to see such misery and depravity.",Winter's Bone
1,SnoopyStyle,quiet determination,8,31 January 2016,"Seventeen-year-old Ree Dolly (Jennifer Lawrence) is struggling to keep her family together with her wits and tenacity. Her meth making father put the family home up as collateral for his bail but has gone missing. Ree must find her daddy before the family loses the little they have left. As she searches, she encounters unsavory elements that threaten to end her young life.This is noteworthy for Jennifer Lawrence's indie breakthrough. She delivers a performance of quiet determination. There is something behind that look and it was obvious the first time I saw it even before her bigger blockbusters. The rundown rural setting gives a foreboding tension to the film. This announced the arrival of a new Hollywood star.",Winter's Bone
2,Prismark10,In the tough old mountain community,5,31 October 2014,"Jennifer Lawrence is Ree, a determined young woman trying to find her father who needs to answer bail or else they would lose their home.Ree is dissuaded by various members of the family, her uncle (John Hawkes) is violently opposed to her poking about and some distant relatives are even more irate.It seems her dad was involved in some drug running before he got caught. It seems he might have been silenced in case he spilled the beans to get a lesser sentence.This is a rough-hewn drama set in a rural mountain community. The acting is raw and tough, even the army recruitment scene will have you believe that its actual soldiers recruiting. Acting aside the plot is rather flimsy.Ree and her young siblings are in danger of losing their home and may end up in care, surely there was a better way to resolve the situation. All the bail bondsman wants is their dad or a body and the perpetrators could had given a helping hand much earlier.",Winter's Bone
3,claudio_carvalho,Dangerous People in a Poor Area,7,2 July 2011,"In a wilderness and poor area of the Ozarks, the seventeen year-old Rhee Dolly (Jennifer Lawrence) raises her younger siblings Sonny (Isaiah Stone) and Ashlee (Ashlee Thompson) respectively and takes care of her catatonic mother alone, since her father Jessup Dolly is absent in prison. When the local Sheriff Baskin (Garret Dillahunt) arrives at her poor house, he tells that his father, who is a meth cook, put their house in collateral for his bail and if he does not appear in court, the family will lose the property. The determined Rhee decides to find her father and walks to the houses of his father's friends, relatives and associates but is advised to stop snooping around. Desperate, Rhee tries to enlist the army to get US$ 40,000.00 for five years service but she is minor and needs the agreement of her parents. Rhee discovers that her father might have been murdered by his dangerous associates, but she is unable to find his body. When Rhee is hopeless to keep her real estate, she receives visitors that offer her father's bones.""Winter's Bone"" is a powerful drama about a teenager that supports her sick mother and her two siblings and has to face dangerous people in a very poor area in the United States of America to know the whereabouts of her father. It is impressive the courage and maturity of Rhee in a very realistic story. This low-budget film is supported by magnificent performances and Jennifer Lawrence is awesome. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Inverno da Alma"" (""Winter of the Soul"")",Winter's Bone
4,nogodnomasters,BRAVO!,10,7 December 2018,"The plot is fairly simple. Ree Holly (Jennifer Lawrence) is at home taking care of her mother, who takes happy pills and is menatlly out of it. She also cares for her two siblings. She is 17. She goes to school and chops wood too. Clarence Carter's ""Patches"" lived in a dream world compared to her. Her father is missing and it appears he will miss bail. The family farm has been put up for bond. Ree searches for her father, who made and sold Meth.The movie is shot on location in Southern Missouri, Jesse James country. It captures impoverished rural America. The accents are remarkably well done and not overdone like so many films. Jennifer Lawrence gives us an Academy Award performance. The movie also captures the independent spirit of the people, their general disdain of law enforcement, and their willingness to help each other in a time of crisis, in spite of a certain code of silence.Like many small isolated communities, most folk are somehow kin. Ree uses the kin card to elicit help. Her uncle, who refused to help her, eventually does so after Ree displays bravery and persistence. Remarkable performances by the entire cast, including the child actors. There are no super heroes walking tall or high action scenes. It is realistic, which translates into scenes some might consider boring, although I personally found them interesting as we worked with Ree to unravel a simple mystery, one which everyone seems to know the answer, but no one is telling.There is no sex or nudity, but it does show people with a meth spoon up their nose.",Winter's Bone
5,kosmasp,Bones to pick,8,14 August 2015,"The movie that made Jennifer Lawrence famous for more than one reason and put her on Hollywoods radar. You may come to find her acting or characters annoying, but you can't fault her passion and commitment to the craft. Not to mention her choosing roles. Yes even Katniss in Hunger Games or her role in X-Men.But this is a completely different beast (no pun intended), a more serious one, where she has to pull off drama. And she is very good in it. Showing how tough it can be too not only be a child but female, is not an easy task. Especially in the world that surrounds her. The pace is nice (but slow) and the camera is amazing in this one too. If that sounds like something you can ""enjoy"", watch :o)",Winter's Bone
6,classicsoncall,"""Something real wrong was going on.""",9,10 September 2014,"Well I don't know that I'll be going down to the Ozarks any time soon. This is definitely not the type of film you'll want to pick up for some light entertainment or a simple diversion for a couple of hours. The picture gets pretty intense with it's look at how mountain folk conduct their day to day affairs that allows no interference, even if it's family. In a way you have to admire the honor code that the Thump Milton family lives by, dependent on strict loyalty and a devotion to secrecy. Though there's such a thing as going just a bit too far to keep the outside world at bay. I can understand how some viewers might be repulsed by the life style depicted and how things progress in the story, but I wouldn't go so far as to say that something like this could never happen. We're talking about an entirely different mind set with folks you'd never run across at your average card party or high school basketball game. In her portrayal of young Ree, Jennifer Lawrence gives every indication that she's a talent to be reckoned with for a long time to come. It was also cool to see able support provided by John Hawkes (love that name Teardrop) and Garret Dillahunt as Sheriff Baskin. If you're not too repulsed, be sure to stick around for a creative way of collecting forensic evidence to solve a murder at the end of the story. It's bound to stay with you a long time.",Winter's Bone
7,gavin6942,Absolutely Underrated Film of 2010,8,28 February 2011,"When he critics came out for 2010, they first came out for ""Winter's Bone"", then ""Social Network"", and finally ""King's Speech"". As we now know that ""King's Speech"" was the big winner at the Academy, I have to suspect it all comes down to timing. ""Network won bigger at the Golden Globes which were a month earlier... would ""Bone"" have done better if the awards were earlier still? I think it really deserved to. The film is gritty, real and has a way of telling you just enough of the story that you get it, but not so much that it is all revealed. That is a realistic way to tell a story -- if you enter a situation midway, you should not be expected to know the full story but only pick up pieces as you go.I have nothing bad to say about the movie at all. Great plot, great directing, Jennifer Lawrence made a solid lead (and maybe could have won if Natalie Portman had not been in the running). The actor playing Teardrop should have won supporting actor, though losing to Christian Bale is not really an insult -- Bale is an acting powerhouse.I am very tempted to read the book now, so if that was part of the film's goal, it succeeded on me. I loved it, would gladly watch it again, and urge others who overlooked it to check it out.",Winter's Bone
8,lee_eisenberg,wretched existence in the Ozarks,10,20 September 2016,"The movie that brought Jennifer Lawrence to my attention casts her as a teenage girl having to look after her impoverished family in rural Missouri. The movie is shot in a naturalistic style to give a real feeling of the miserable existence that the characters lead. In her quest to find her father, the girl is forced to confront people who have had tension with her family over the years, but she is determined to press on.I've seen a number of Jennifer Lawrence's movies over the past few years, but this is the first Debra Granik movie that I've seen. I am truly impressed. I hope to see more of her work. ""Winter's Bone"" is among the best that cinema has to offer. I highly recommend it.",Winter's Bone
9,jboothmillard,Winter's Bone,7,14 May 2011,"I only really heard about this film when it was nominated the numerous awards, it was obviously not one of the films that would have as much as The King's Speech, Black Swan, 127 Hours and the others, but it looked like something to be tried. Basically Ree Dolly (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Jennifer Lawrence) is the seventeen year old girl living in the Ozark back country, forced into looking after her two younger siblings, twelve year old Sonny (Isaiah Stone) and six year old Ashlee (Ashlee Thompson) due to her mother being depressed, mentally ill and catatonic and her father Jessup absent. The father is a known Methamphetamine 'meth' cooker, and according to the local Sheriff Baskin (Garret Dillahunt) he is due in court in a week, and it is also revealed he has put the family home up as collateral for his bail, so if he is not found they will lose it all. So Ree starts a journey to find her father, dead or alive, in order that she and the remaining family can stay, and knowing that he is involved in the drug trade she starts by asking all others involved. She asks many of the locals, and her father's brother Teardrop (Oscar nominated John Hawkes), who all claim that they have no idea where Jessup is or what has happened, and at one point she is warned away and threatened if she returns. Of course Ree ignores the warning, and as a consequence she is brutally beaten by three women of the clan, they had discussed killing her but they cannot find it themselves to do it. After pleading her case, Teardrop comes to the rescue and assures the drug involved clan that she does not want to make trouble, and the region's patriarch, Thump Milton (Ronnie Hall) is satisfied enough to let her go ahead. When it looks like Ree and the children are going to lose their home, in desperation she tries to join the army in order to be paid the $40,000 for five years service, but she is refused and she changes her mind due to her situation. One night, the three Milton women who beat her finally reveal they may in fact know what has happened to Jessup, and blindfolded she is taken to a pond where rumours of a body have been spread. Paddling in a rowboat to a shallow part, they do indeed find a pair of arms belonging to a dead arm, and Ree is forced to hold them while they chainsaw through to take the hands to the police. In the end, DNA evidence confirms they are the hands of a dead Jessup, the family are allowed to keep the house, Teardrop gives away his brother's old banjo, and the final scene sees Ree on the porch with her siblings and the new instrument. Also starring Kevin Breznahan as Little Arthur, Dale Dickey as Merab, Sheryl Lee as April, Lauren Sweetser as Gail, Tate Taylor as Satterfield, Valerie Richards as Connie, Shelley Waggener as Sonya, William White as Blond Milton and Casey MacLaren as Megan. Lawrence gives a superb mature performance as the struggling girl doing whatever she can to keep her home, and Hawkes does alright as her father's brother, it is rather a gripping story with many eye-catching moments, especially the nasty beating scene, it is certainly a thriller to see. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Motion Picture of the Year and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published. Very good!",Winter's Bone
10,ccthemovieman-1,"A Haunting, No-Nonsense Story",8,7 May 2012,"Other reviewers have labeled this film as ""haunting,"" and I would agree that is a good adjective to describe this story. It's one who think about afterward, that sticks with you for awhile.It's not a pleasant film, and there aren't a lot of laughs here. In fact, it's somewhat sordid in many parts but yet I found it strangely alluring. I was unable to divert my eyes from the screen.Part of that can be attributed to the lead actor in this film: Jennifer Lawrence, as ""Ree."" She plays a strong character, a tough 17-year-old girl with big responsibilities, trying to take care of two little kids and near comatose mother. The family is dirt-poor as are almost everyone in this story. It takes place in the Ozarks and the most of the poor folks, quite frankly, are inhospitable. They come across very short, uncooperative and downright mean. There are some acts of kindness, however.All the story is, is this girl trying find her father so he can testify in court. If he doesn't show up, the girl and the rest of family will lose their house.""Ree's"" father was a drug dealer, and that's one reason people don't want to tell the poor girl anything as she goes from house-to-house trying to get information.No sense telling the whole story, but it's recommended. Just don't expect a happy kind of tale. The acting is good and the photography very good.",Winter's Bone
11,rmax304823,Successful.,7,24 May 2014,"It's something of a surprise. It appeared first, to me anyway, on Lifetime Movie Network, a channel that mostly presents us with intrigues and melodramas shot on a budget in Canada, with dialog like, ""We have to talk."" A substantial number are downright silly.And here is this evocative slice of Appalachian life that's written and directed by women for what's essentially a woman's network that compellingly captures the grim reality of rural poverty.The story itself isn't much. Jennifer Lawrence's naughty father gets into trouble with ""the laws."" (Every other character seems to snort coke, smoke weed, or take as many ""strong pain killers"" as they want. Where do they get those pain killers? I want some too. Do I have to move to the Ozarks?) It's evidently not big news that Dad got into hot water. The trouble is that he posted bail -- well, part of it -- by putting up his shack and his farm as collateral. Now he seems to have skipped and the court is about to sell the house and land from under Lawrence's feet, and she has no way of supporting her two younger siblings and her sick old Grandmother. Why, that shore were enough to bring a tear to the most hardened eye.The plot has Lawrence going from one relative or neighbor to another, trying to find the whereabouts of her Dad so she can talk him into going to jail rather than allow his family to be booted off their miserable acreage. She finally locates him but he's in no mood to help her so she has to hand him over to the cops, so to speak.It's the image of the quality of life that is outstanding in this story. The farms are dilapidated wooden shacks with a few muddy farm animals and a yard full of junk cars and mattress springs. It's a cloudy, cold winter. The neighbors don't get on with each other. Most are pinch faced and violence simmers just under the surface of each interaction. There are guns galore.The writers have encapsulated the sentiments of Appalachia in one tense scene. A decent young sheriff pulls over a truck driven by Lawrence's doper uncle, with Lawrence as a passenger. The cop wants to ask some questions. ""You'll have to get out of the car, Teardrop,"" he says. But Teardrop won't take no orders from no cop no how. Furthermore, he casually and openly slides his rifle into his lap. The cop shines his flashlight into the cab and sees Lawrence. He draws his pistol and taps the door with its muzzle. ""Get out of the car, Teardrop."" In a gentle voice, Teardrop says he ain't getting' out of the car and asks, ""Is this how we gonna end?"" Then he put the truck in gear and pulls slowly away into the night. It's a tense scene but it reaches for more than just tension. In a later encounter, the sheriff tells Lawrence, ""I saw you in the cab. That's why I didn't shoot. Teardrop never backed me down."" Replies Lawrence: ""It sure looked like he did."" Those two exchanges tell us a great deal about the character of Appalachians. It's a culture of honor. Nobody tells me what to do. Two men are ready to kill one another over the question of whether a driver should get out of his car when ordered to do so by authorities. (And Jennifer Lawrence, in twitting the sheriff, endorses these values.) Think it's crazy? So do I, but we can see these same values reflected in some of today's fringe political groups. ""Don't Tread On ME."" The writers have done very well in projecting the importance of blood ties, which have always been more important in Appalachia than most other subcultures, with the possible exception of the Mafia. At one point, begging for help in finding her father, Lawrence questions a distant relative, rattling off some consanquineal ties that make as much sense as the priests' explanation of why Henry V should invade France. ""That makes at least SOME blood between us. Don't it count for nothing?"" And the viewer can't help thinking -- Hatfields and McCoys.Jennifer Lawrence undergoes all sort of misadventures, being beaten up, and insulted. Nobody likes anybody else. Maybe you'll get help when you need it desperately, but it will come reluctantly, if it comes at all. Everyone seems matter-of-fact about their mutual hostility. It must be a hard life for all of them. It must be a complete bitch to be poor among all that paranoia.",Winter's Bone
12,Tweekums,A bleak drama that is well worth watching,9,31 March 2013,"Set in the bleak Ozark Mountains of Southern Missouri this film follows seventeen year old Ree Dolly as she searches for her father. He is due in court in a week and if he doesn't show up Dee, along with the younger siblings she is looking after and her unwell mother will be made homeless. She starts asking various friends and family if they know where he is but nobody is willing to help; in these parts nobody does anything that could help the law. As time passes it looks as though he must be dead but that is of no help to Ree; unless she can prove he is dead she will still lose everything and the more questions she asks the greater the danger she is in.This film is intensely atmospheric; you can almost feel the cold and the sense of danger in the rugged Missouri setting. Wherever Ree goes there is a sense that this is a place beyond the reach of the law. Jennifer Lawrence is brilliant in the lead role and is ably supported by a cast who make these people and their way of life seem real. For the most part the tension remains just below the surface but occasionally it boils over into real violence in a couple of fairly gruelling scenes. Overall I'd say this is well worth watching unless you expect to have every question answered at the end; then you might be a bit disappointed as there are some unresolved matters at the end.",Winter's Bone
13,Quinoa1984,"a merging of film-noir and neo-realism, with a big dosage of ""white trash"" in America",10,14 June 2010,"Debra Granik doesn't compromise in Winter's Bone. Not for a moment does she let a character get an easy way out. Even by the story's end, when things seem to at least be stable and at peace, things are not entirely happy. How could they be? The story is set in rural Missouri, where at best people have a working car, and at worst, you see that burnt down Crystal-Meth house over yonder. What is so absorbing in Granik's film is not just the main character, the one character we have to stick with in order to navigate the dangerous and ugly backwoods folk (sort of a Redneck Mafia if you will), but the locations. A good lot of time is given to these winter locations, where broken down tractors, shooting squirrels, and mountain music performed in living rooms are common, not to mention the Meth cooked up every which way. We're transported to a place that many of us (i.e those of us who live in suburbs and cities) wouldn't want to go near. And yet, this is America, where good people have to struggle and the bad thrive on fear.The story is something out of a 'noir' story: a 17 year old girl (Jennifer Lawrence in her breakout performance) is told by the local Sheriff (Garrett Dillahunt, who previously played 'the law' in No Country for Old Men) that her father is wanted, but also put up the house and assets for collateral, and that if he doesn't show- in one way or another, live or dead- the house will be taken away. Ree's mother is in a daze on medication, and she has two little siblings she has to take care of, so starts a search for her father. Nobody wants to help her really; her most sympathetic ally is her uncle, who doesn't know where his brother is, and doesn't much care (there's a great exchange at one point between the two: ""You know, you've always scared me."" ""That's because you're smart,"" he says, eyes turned down), but everyone else is abrasive, and could at best care less and at worse tell her to get off the property... or else.There's a pervading feeling of something really, really bad going on, which Ree can only slightly comprehend. She is smart, and resourceful, and teaches her little brother and sister to shoot, if nothing else for protection (that's the subtext anyway in shooting squirrels), but she's also not wanted, certainly not by the locals who she should count on but look at her, as Jessup Dolly's daughter, as a threat. More is revealed about what happened to him, and the sense of terror is really way up by the third act. Who knows what will happen to Ree or the kids, especially if Jessup isn't found, in one way or another. The discovery of Jessup, as the climax of the picture, is filmed in such a way that it is truly gruesome; I can't reveal it here, but it outranks most horror movies that only come close to the personal terror that is felt by the discovery.Winter's Bone is bleak but not so much so that we leave the theater in all tears or total dread. There's some little moments of hope for Ruby and her siblings, and while her conflict with Thump Milton and his clan (aka Redneck Mob) leaves her scarred and more on her guard, and she knows to definitely never trust that Sheriff again, what makes it worthwhile is surviving the quest of it, the mystery. Nothing feels fabricated in the film- many of the actors come right from the region and are non-professionals- and this is reflected in the material. And for such a hard story, of a girl on her own with little resources and backup, there's some great talent here. Lawrence, as noted, should become very hot (that is a talent-to-see on the radar) from this film, where her Ree is the hero in more ways than one, but from her strength shows her vulnerability from time to time very well (there's a scene where she brings her mother out into the woods to ask her what she should do, tears in her eyes, and I couldn't recall a scene quite as powerful as it since Nicholson's Bobby Dupea had a similar scene in Five Easy Pieces).The other actor who really shines here is John Hawkes. We've seen him in character parts from time to time (I first saw him in From Dusk till Dawn as a store clerk), and his character is given the most complexity of anyone. While it's arguable that Ree and the other backwoods folk are black-and-white in their morality (even when a woman character finally comes to help Ree in the third act it's by a lot of conditions- the aforementioned 'gruesome' scene), Teardrop is an unabashed drug addict and will most likely kill if he has to. But he's also compassionate in ways that matter, and Hawkes shows this gray area of the character with depth and wisdom; he doesn't make this guy a total hick (matter of fact no one in the movie is too over-the-top, just believable enough without being like 'Deliverance), but a torn man who has no real future but can be of help to Ree in this time of need. And he also gets an exceptional showdown scene with the Sheriff while in the front seat of his car that is among the best scenes this year in film.This is the indie film that people love to talk about, the 'go see this' wonder that will probably barely play 100 or at most 200 screens, but lights up with drama and consequence more than most films you'll ever see. Or, to put it another way, it's what Sundance is good for: shining light on real independent product that is about something, or someone, and isn't tethered by Hollywood conventions.",Winter's Bone
14,edwagreen,**,4,25 October 2016,"Jennifer Lawrence received a best actress nomination, her first, for this 2010 film. To me, she did a nice imitation of the way a Holly Hunter or Reese Witherspoon would have handled the role.The film takes place in the backwoods of Missouri, essentially a poverty row, where Lawrence is taking care of two younger siblings and a mother who barely talks. Daddy is out on bond and it never is totally clear what his offense is all about-apparently, it's drugs and he has talked to the authorities about his associates and this leads to his mangled demise.To save her home which has been placed on the bond, she desperately seeks out her father only to learn the sad truth. He has a brother and who is that woman who slaps her around and then tells her where her father may be found?A totally unsatisfying film.",Winter's Bone

At 16, Ree is raising her little brother and sister in one of the poorest regions of the Missouri Ozarks. Redneck mindset with crank cooking a way of life...and death. Manufacturing crystal meth seems to be one of the only things to pass on to the next generation. When the sheriff(Garrett Dillahunt)shows up looking for Ree's father for a court appearance , she has precious little time to find her dad or his body in order to keep her house. Ree's hunt gets harsher and uglier the deeper she searches the dangerous backwoods. Her Uncle Teardrop(John Hawkes)is reluctant to help her, but goes up against a violent drug cooking hillbilly ""brotherhood"" in order to help the stubborn and head-strong teen in her search for her deadbeat dad. Bleak, frank and haunting. Miss Lawrence is absolutely sensational and heart-touching. She no doubt does writer/director Debra Granik proud. Also in the cast: Kevin Breznahan, Dale Dickey, Casey MacLaren, William White, Sheryl Lee and Ronnie Hall. This is one of those movies you talk about.",Winter's Bone
16,Hey_Sweden,An excellent little film.,8,8 April 2012,"""Winter's Bone"" is a potent gem: a genuinely affecting story that captures one's attention right away. It has the kind of perfect backwoods atmosphere and relentlessly somber mood that just pulls the viewer right in. Jennifer Lawrence here showed off real star quality before her recent ""Hunger Games"" success, starring as Ree, a fiercely independent teenager taking care of two young siblings with a mom who can't help as she's not all there. She learns that her father, a no-account type, had put up the family house as bond and then disappeared; if he doesn't show up for his court date, then they lose a place to live. So she's obliged to try to find the guy. The trouble is, so many of her relatives and neighbours are either unwilling or unable to help. It becomes clear that with her inquiries that she's ""opening a can of worms"", as the saying goes. The story, based on a novel by Daniel Woodrell, is compelling every step of the way, receiving a respectful adaptation and confident direction by Debra Granik, who co-wrote the screenplay. Granik marshals a fine cast, chief among them John Hawkes, finally elevated to co-starring status after years of small and supporting roles in movies as well as his time spent on the TV series 'Deadwood'. Grim, sometimes uncomfortable, and in the end pretty damn creepy, ""Winter's Bone"" mostly avoids bright colours, keeping things fairly limited in terms of its palette. Emotions are strong and scenes are intense, but things never veer too far into melodrama. The music score (by Dickon Hinchliffe) and songs used merely add to the flavour of the material. Performances come off as absolutely authentic; the actors may not be ""name"" actors, but they're just as good as any Hollywood types. The cast includes Garret Dillahunt as the local sheriff, Lauren Sweetser as Gail, Kevin Breznahan as Little Arthur, the striking Dale Dickey as Merab, Sheryl Lee of 'Twin Peaks' fame as April, Tate Taylor as Satterfield, and Ronnie Hall as Thump Milton. The movie never gets too explicit, but it never needs to. Its power of suggestion is strong enough on its own. The scene where all is revealed to Ree is as good as anything in any horror film.

It was a lot of people standing around talking, with an occasional break for something else. Its got a good sense of place but outside of that it seems like someone melded the inde mumblecore with something it it should never have met up with. Frankly that it won the Sundance is hardly surprising since the film seems to have that Sundance feel.I'm being a snot,but to my mind its just like any other inde film that seems made for a certain select audience-that of Sundance.It wasn't worth the 100 minutes I out into it.(if you're a mumblecore fan go for it)",Winter's Bone

Where she takes care of her siblings, ages 12 and 6, and her catatonic mother. Everyone tells her not to search for him, and she presses on, in spite of the danger. This is neo-noir set in the deep South, and it's an excellent addition to the genre, with what I believe to be a unique setting for it. The environment is established impeccably, with both positive and negative aspects. You get a sense of how this world works, this small community where everyone not only knows each other, but is, in fact, related to one another, where food may be easier(cheaper) hunted than purchased, and where the law is in the hands of civilians. The acting is phenomenal, I'm very surprised to find that some of these people, including some of the stars, have not performed before. Adding to the substantial authenticity, the cast has completely normal-looking people, and in general no one comes off as ""the name"" who was added to attract an audience, everyone looks like they belong there. This builds tension with hardly any guns, and the plot is gripping. You find yourself really trying to figure out what happened, and though the ending of this is ambiguous, there is a satisfying conclusion to it. Some will find this to be a tad slow - I wasn't bored at any point. The tone is bleak if not devoid of hope. There is disturbing, brutal, bloody and violent content in this if it tends to be hinted at(and is certainly never gratuitous). I recommend this to anyone who likes the concept. 8/10",Winter's Bone
20,neil-476,Grim but impressive,8,9 March 2012,"In deepest backwoods Missouri, where your cousins are likely to be closer blood relatives than your siblings, 17-year old Ree looks after her brother and sister (12 and 6) and her mentally impaired mother. Her father, deeply involved in the local cottage industry of producing illegal substances, is due to appear in court next week, having pledged the family house in order to secure bail. However, he is missing, so Ree sets out to find him: if she is unsuccessful, the family will be made homeless.This drama is filmed in fly-on-the-wall documentary style and evokes very well the sense of closed in community, where outsiders - including the police - are unwelcome. The law has no place here: there is a strict code and a strict pecking order, and those at the top of that order are very, very scary men indeed. And those are the men to whom Ree's search leads: they may well be responsible for her father's disappearance and, if she pushes the matter too hard, for hers also. She is definitely (and justifiably) fearful, but her sense of responsibility is stronger, and pushes her into places where no 17 year old should have to go.The story, like the location and the people, is harsh and, in some ways very sad - Ree's family doesn't have anything, and is in danger of losing even that. The documentary style adds a huge sense of realism.All the actors are excellent, but they surround an astonishing central performance from Jennifer Lawrence. She is in nearly every scene and, at 19, commands the screen. You never lose sight of the fact that Ree is only a child herself as she pursues her search no matter where it takes her. The award nominations earned for this by Lawrence were well-deserved.I have two criticisms: one, the dialogue was often difficult to understand (although the film was easy to follow) and, two, notwithstanding the power of the performances, this wasn't an easy film to like. I don't think I shall rewatch it often.",Winter's Bone
21,evanston_dad,"In This Movie, Blood Is Not Thicker Than Water",8,17 November 2010,"Based on what I'd heard in advance about ""Winter's Bone,"" Debra Granik's uncompromising portrait of life in a dismally poor area of the Missouri Ozarks, I'd expected the people in it to be creatures straight out of ""Deliverance"" or ""Tobacco Road."" I was somewhat surprised, therefore, at the start by how much better off, at least in terms of literal living conditions, these people seem to be. I don't live in an area like the one depicted in the film, but I've seen them, so it wasn't out of the realm of my experience. But then the movie began to slowly unfold, and I realized that what's most alien about the environment is the culture, and when it comes to that, I felt like I was watching a movie about people from another planet.Ree is a 17-year-old girl struggling to provide for her two younger siblings in the literal absence of her father and the figurative one of her mother, a nearly catatonic basket case who's checked out on life. Ree finds out that her dad, who was released from jail, has disappeared and has put up the family home and property as bond. If he doesn't show up for court, or if Ree can't prove that he's dead, as she suspects he is, they'll lose the only thing they have left.As Ree goes from home to home, we begin to get the picture of an almost tribal culture, where everyone seems to be related yet clans have formed that hate one another. Production of crystal meth is the primary form of subsistence, or in some cases simply a way to alleviate the tedium of being poor and bored, and there's no such thing as a neighborly call. Everyone is suspicious of outsiders and visitors, and murders don't even seem to be notable.Yet for all that, there is a weird code of ethics governing these people's lives, and though some women who Ree comes across aren't afraid to beat the crap out of her to teach her a lesson, they're just as apt to offer their help afterwards as a way to make amends. The film sounds like it would be too dismal to bear, but it's not. It certainly is grim, and its last moments become outrageously horrific -- you laugh because you don't know what else to do -- but there's something noble and heartwarming about Ree and her ability to persevere in a world that you think would make it impossible.The young actress Jennifer Lawrence gives an astonishing performance as the taciturn Ree. Her portrayal is so authentic you almost think she's a non-actress from the area the filmmakers found to star in their movie.A bleak but also bracing film.Grade: A-",Winter's Bone
22,ferguson-6,Bread and Butter,9,27 June 2010,"Greetings again from the darkness. A double award winner at the Sundance Film Festival, this film is based on Daniel Woodrell's novel and is directed by Debra Granik. It's opening sequence slaps the viewer with the bleak unforgivingness of life in the backwoods of the Ozarks. This is land of people that time has passed by.The basic premise of the story is that 17 year old Ree Dolly (played by Jennifer Lawrence) is responsible for raising her brother and sister and caring for her mentally-blank mother while maintaining a mostly positive outlook on the present and future. Reality strikes again when the local sheriff arrives to inform her that her missing, meth-lab running father has an upcoming court date. He used their land and house as collateral for his latest bond. If he fails to show, they will lose their home. Instead of breaking down, Ree pledges to find him and starts out on a hazardous journey, unlike we have seen on screen.This community of mountain people are distrusting of outsiders, but stunningly, are just as paranoid around insiders and even family members. Their way of life seems to depend on pure independence, even though they all seemed intertwined in the same illegal activities and daily quest for survival. Some kind of odd code exists - ask nothing, give nothing and get rid of any obstacles.The driving forces of the story are Ree and her constant hope and courage, and her bond to her dad's only brother, Teardrop played chillingly by John Hawkes. Teardrop tries to toughen up Ree and get her to accept her plight, while Ree constantly shows his there is reason to plow forward.The film is very well written and the local filming brings a harsh reality that was crucial to the film's success. Additionally, I was stunned at the fierceness displayed by Jennifer Lawrence as Ree. Her performance reminded me of my first exposure to the talents of Meryl Streep (The Deer Hunter) and Evan Rachel Wood (Thirteen). Talk about powerful and exciting ... what she did with this role vaults her immediately into a very small group of actresses who can carry a movie with their presence. I am anxiously awaiting her next appearance - a Jody Foster project.I also want to mention the music in the film. The vocalist, Marideth Sisco, is also the vocalist in the living room band who makes an appearance in one scene. Her voice truly captures the balance of hope and acceptance of plight. This is not a movie for everyone, but it is fascinating and hardcore.",Winter's Bone
23,Wuchakk,"Realistic, melancholic backwoods drama",6,22 September 2015,"Released in 2010, ""Winter's Bone"" stars Jennifer Lawrence as Ree Dolly, a 17 year-old in the Ozarks of southern Missouri who's about to lose the family homestead because her father jumped bail. The story revolves around her desperate search for her dad and the mysterious silence she gets. John Hawkes plays her Uncle Teardrop.One reviewer fittingly said ""There is Barely a Smile in this Study of the Backwoods with its Hypocrisy of Clannish Detachment"" while another succinctly summed it up as ""Hillbilly Corleone Family."" That's ""Winter's Bone"" in a nutshell, an independent film hailed by critics everywhere. It's a grim, desperate rural mountains drama. While the story's one-dimensionally bleak and filled with mumbling ambiguities, I appreciate the film because it provides a window into illegal methamphetamine manufacturing in rural communities, the drug version of moonshine. I also liked how unpredictable certain parts were, like the tense stand-off with the Sheriff and the macabre chainsaw sequence. My wife, however, thought it was a bore because it was TOO one-dimensional and bleak. Needless to say, if you need cheering up, avoid ""Winter's Bone"" like the plague. This was supposedly Jennifer's break-out movie. While I give it a marginal thumbs-up, it's overrated IMHO. An independent movie with the same tone and more redeeming qualities is 2008's ""Frozen River.""

24,gradyharp,When all that is left is family and blood,10,27 October 2010,"WINTER'S BONE is as quiet and insidious as a stem cell carcinoma. Based on the successful novel by author Daniel Woodrell who explains the choice of title explain at the back of his book: ""The 'Winter's' part of the title is obvious, and the 'Bone' part comes from slang. It can be stated wryly, sarcastically, even tenderly, when throwing a sop to someone, 'Oh, give him a bone.' In this case, it is winter itself giving a gift, a bone, to Ree Dolly. The season knows she has earned it, and the term suggests the double-edged aspect of the gesture and is suited to the novel,"" writer Anne Rosellini and writer/director Debra Granik have adapted this story for film and in doing so have presented one of the finest artistic successes of the year. The setting is contemporary Missouri Ozarks where people barely survive, especially during the winter. Ree Dolly (Jennifer Lawrence in a stunningly sophisticated performance) is seventeen years old, living in a shack with her clinically depressed mother and her brother and sister: her father Jessup is missing, having been arrested for his dealings in making Crank (crystal meth) - the only source of income for many of the folk in the area, folk who also are users - and posted bail using his house and land as collateral. Ree has a tough time as the only responsible person for her family and when the local sheriff (Garret Dillahunt) visits to inform Ree that Jessup has skipped town and that if he doesn't show up for his court date, Ree's home and land will be absconded, Ree is devastated. Ree seeks advice from her many relatives who adamantly refuse to help her out of fear of discovery of involvement in the drug business: Ree sets out to find her father. She turns to every member of her family (it would seem that most everyone in this pitiful area is blood) she is turned down for help - especially from her father's brother Teardrop (John Hawkes) who hesitantly warns her that her father is dead. She finally gains some assistance through her perseverance only to discover that that Jessup is dead and she is forced to dredge his body from the river to cut off his hands to prove to the court that her father is dead and the threat of evacuation is nullified. The casting of this film is a little miracle: down to the smallest role each actor is exactly right in creating the sullen and desperate atmosphere of this story. There are rare moments when the tale is not grim, moments such as the gathering of banjo and guitar players in a Pickin' Session to accompanying the singing of a Marideth Sisco. The cinematography by Michael McDonough and the musical choices made by Dickon Hinchliffe recreate the desolation of this pitiful community of people living on the edge in the Ozarks. But towering above all of this is the performance by Jennifer Lawrence who will undoubtedly now rise to prominence. Grady Harp",Winter's Bone
25,zetes,Very good,8,27 June 2010,"One of the best reviewed films of 2010 so far. I can't say I'm as in love with it as the critics, but it is one of the best films of the year so far (probably my third favorite). Jennifer Lawrence stars as Ree Dolly, a 17 year old girl from the Ozarks of southeastern Missouri who is forced to care for her two younger siblings as well as her invalid mother. Her absent father went to jail for cooking meth. The sheriff (Garret Dillahunt) shows up to her home one day and tells her that her father's bond has been posted, and that he put his house up to cover that bond. Ree doesn't know where he is, and, if he misses his court date, she and her family are homeless. She decides to go looking for him among the methheads around town, most of whom are related to her in some way. The film is generally described as a neo-noir, and that's pretty accurate. It can also feel like a horror film. The way Granik films these desolate locations make it seem like a post-apocalyptic wasteland, and I was frequently thinking of John Hillcoat's recent The Road. I also thought of Frozen River from a couple of years ago. At its worst, it plays like that kind of ""poverty porn"", which is a critical buzzword nearly all of Winter's Bone's detractors use. Jennifer Lawrence's performance is most certainly going to be much recognized early next year. She's wonderful. John Hawkes and Dale Dickey, playing her uncle and, well, some other undefined relation (Dickey, a woman, for the record, is pretty much the film's major villain) are also great. All three are better known as TV actors. Lawrence's most major role to date was on The Bill Engvall show. Hawkes co-starred in two HBO shows, Deadwood and Eastbound & Down (I'm a big fan of the latter), and had a large role in the final season of Lost and Dale Dickey played Patty the Daytime Hooker on My Name Is Earl (I recognized both Hawkes and Dickey, but couldn't place them at all). Garret Dillahunt also co-starred in Deadwood, as well as The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford and No Country for Old Men.",Winter's Bone
26,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Winter's Bone,6,15 February 2011,"It's quite uncanny that director Debra Granik's feature films to date all have to do with drugs, dysfunctional families and a strong woman as the protagonist who has to make lemonades out of the lemons given out by Life. A dark horse in the upcoming Oscars competing on four major fronts, this film had already won The Grand Jury Prize ad the Waldo Salt Screen writing Award at last year's Sundance Film Festivals, amongst others, and clearly its release here only now is positioned to gain from the publicity of its Oscar nominations.Based on the novel of the same name by Daniel Woodrell, Winter's Bone is extremely bleak, in its subject matter, themes and the kind of characters in the story. It deals with misery, uncertainty and poverty, all stemming from an irresponsible father who makes meth, suddenly disappears, and in the meantime has put up his house and land as personal bond. If he absconds, this will mean his family will have to stay in the streets. The family's no better off too, with Jennifer Lawrence's Ree caught in the centre of this storm, being the sole provider to the family now made up of a mentally ill mom, and two younger siblings yet to fend for themselves.Not only is the wintry landscape a dampener on moods and feelings, having the kind of relatives that Ree has, is something of a major downer as well. Through the most parts in the first half of Winter's Bone, it's about Ree's quest to find her father, to try and appeal to his good sense not to skip his bond and to attend his court hearing. To do so means to hit the road and check if he's at any relatives' house, and my, if any of you think your relatives are nightmares from hell, you haven't seen nothing yet. There's absolutely little love demonstrated by these folks to Ree's plight, and while small doses of compassion get dished out, it's more of an aftermath of something nasty to have taken place.Debra Granik deliberately moves this at snail's pace, preferring to test your endurance as we sit through with Ree trying to figure out her next move, as she hits the brick wall ever so often. You feel that secrets are being kept from her on her father's whereabouts, yet fearful for that bit of truth to reveal itself, especially when it seems that there's a hint of an elaborate, staged cover up amongst the many relatives that she encounters, each preferring to stay mum, except for the frightening uncle Teardrop (John Hawkes) who provided the first jolt on screen after too many minutes of moroseness.But the gem in this film is undoubtedly Jennifer Lawrence, who shows her acting mettle with the role of the determined Ree, balancing nerves of steel in knowing what she wants and desires, and balancing that out with pragmatism in what's good for the family first. At the same time, she has this teenage vulnerability since she's still a minor (and hence the fleeting broach of the subject of her joining the military solely for the money), and an incredible reveal toward the end that will just hammer in multiple, heartfelt emotions that reflect the irony of being hard on the outside, and soft on the inside. I suppose this film will open doors that she's a credible actress in her own right, and her role as Mystique in the upcoming summer blockbuster X-Men: First Class will provide that required wide exposure.It doesn't spell out everything, and you'd have to piece it all together since words said are few, and certainly in manners most nasty. It's emotionally draining and taxing given the many negative traits and emotions, and has one extended family with characters that you do not want to cross for whatever reason. A film you'll probably want to sit through nevertheless so that you have a much better picture of the Oscar contenders in order to have that good chance of winning the office betting pool.",Winter's Bone
27,christopher-underwood,it is as if we ourselves had stumbled through those Missouri forests to espy these desperate folk,8,14 November 2020,"I really should have seen this film before Leave No Trace (2018) for it is clear watching this earlier one that director Debra Granik has really honed her craft in the intervening years to absolute refined perfection. Here is a very good film that simply pales a little by direct comparison. The marshalling of her professional and non-professional cast is exemplary and it is as if we ourselves had stumbled through those Missouri forests to espy these desperate folk living their interconnected but lonesome and desperate lives. As in the later film Granik realises the importance of allowing contradictions, the bittersweet coming together for a musical evening, banjoes to the fore or the sudden and unexpected hand of friendship. But overall this is a terrible picture of a lost and forgotten, not to say despised people, trying one way or another to maintain some level of existence. Comparing this to a South Korean film I watched the night before I was struck that, astonishingly, it was this American film set in the Ozarks of Missouri that seemed the more alien, the hardest to comprehend, despite or perhaps because of the absolute believability of this struggling and isolated community so very realistically portrayed.",Winter's Bone

The film has been gaining Oscar buzz since its release this Jan. After almost one-year campaigning, I think it will embrace its munificent fruit in this coming Oscar, especially for Jennifer Lawrence, a Best Actress nomination is seizable now, John Hawkes and Dale Dickey are also likely to get some recognition after being in the shades for quite a long time. Also Debra's script, directing are both Oscarworthy, maybe a Best Picture nomination is not a pipe dream as well. The photography is bleak and heart-wrenchingly beautiful, it lures viewers to unconsciously be submitted to the bewitching future of the protagonist. A precious quality of this film is that it offers us warmth in spite of the tough background, through the whole film, we can hardly assert that some characters are pure evil, there are plenty of stories and room behind every character, if one wants, many films could be derived from it. It's a truly pleasure to watch this film, it instantly becomes my No.3 film of 2010 (after Inception and The Kids Are All Right), one thing I have to mention is that the branch of John Hawkes' character is a tad moot, but I can sense a self-doom destination hinted in the end.

A few years ago it was my bewilderment at the nomination for Best Picture for ""The Hours."" The only award ""The Hours"" should win is ""Most Boring Nominee Ever."" ""Winter's Bone"" won't take that prize away from it, but it's still a head-scratching choice for an Oscar nomination.As I watched it, and now that it's over, I found myself desperately searching for a reason for the nomination. Could it have been the dull and slow moving story? Could it have been the passionless performances? Could it have been the less than spell-binding dialogue? What could it have been? There's so little here. The basic story has a largely unknown (to me at least) Jennifer Lawrence playing Ree. Ree is 17 and pressed into service as caregiver to her two younger siblings and her apparently mentally ill mother because her father has disappeared. One day the sheriff shows up and tells her that they're going to lose the house because dad, who was facing a trial, put the house up as bond and if he doesn't show it's going to be forfeited. So Ree sets out to find him. In the process she runs across various unpleasant people - most of whom she seems to be related to, because this is set in some sort of hillbilly area where everyone seems to be everyone else's cousin at least - who don't like her asking questions. So there's a mystery - what happened to dad? It finally becomes obvious that someone killed him (the family seem to have been involved in drugs) but obviously that piece of information isn't going to be shared. I've heard people refer to this as a wonderful study of humanity and human relationships. If so - God help humanity! It's a nasty piece of business, filled with people (including Ree, although she is the most appealing of the bunch with her devotion to her family) who you really wouldn't want to associate with in real life and who I didn't particularly care to be associating with on the screen.

34,Hellmant,Jennifer Lawrence shines in every scene and really makes the movie memorable!,8,15 September 2010,"'WINTER'S BONE': Four Stars (Out of Five) Twenty year old Jennifer Lawrence turns in a star making performance in this crime mystery / drama based on the novel of the same name by Daniel Woodrell. It's adapted for the screen by the film's director Debra Granik and co-writer Anne Rosellini. The cast is mostly filled with unknowns other than popular character actors John Hawkes (possibly most known for a small turn this year on 'LOST' as Lennon) and Kevin Breznahan. I hadn't seen any trailers or advertisements for this movie and knew very little about it prior to seeing it (which is rare for me) but the buzz is huge, especially for actress Jennifer Lawrence. She shines in every scene and really makes the movie memorable. There's already talk about a possible Oscar nomination come award time, she would deserve it.The film tells the story of a seventeen year old girl named Ree (Lawrence) who's been raising her twelve year old brother Sonny (Isaiah Stone) and six year old sister Ashlee (Ashlee Thompson) for several years now single-handedly. Her mother is depressed and mentally unstable and her father has been cooking and dealing meth or in prison for the last several years. So without her parents around Ree has been forced to raise the children on her own at their mountain home in the Missouri Ozarks. She relies on the kindness of their friendly neighbor for extra food and such and the three have been able to scrape by but as the movie opens she gets some bad news from the local sheriff (played by Garret Dillahunt). He informs her that her father is due in court the next week and his whereabouts are unknown. The problem for Ree and her siblings is that her father put their home up as bail for his release and if he doesn't show up in court the house will be seized. Fear of her brother and sister being left homeless she goes on a mission to find her father but everyone she asks tells her to stop looking and forget about it. It's obvious that people know more than there letting on and as Ree investigates further she puts herself into grave danger.The movie is an interesting and compelling character study and the directing is impressive. The cinematography is beautiful and the score is almost non existent, which is a fitting touch. The acting and dialog is all very believable and natural, especially like I said Lawrence but Hawkes is also impressive and memorable as well. The movie is depressing and very ugly at times but the strength and willpower of the lead character is extremely touching and inspiring. That's where the heart of the movie lies and a lot of it is due to Lawrence's portrayal. The film takes a while to get going though and although it leads to an impressive and satisfactory third act the first and second get repetitive and a little uninteresting. We see Ree go to too many different house holds asking the same questions and getting the same answers. It certainly takes it's time developing it's story and at times it almost feels like it's not going to lead much of anywhere but the conclusion is worth the wait. The acting and scenery is always impressive as well and so is the lead performance.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsKmmH2ftXQ",Winter's Bone
35,Buddy-51,When setting becomes character,9,19 January 2011,"The milieu the characters of ""Winter's Bone"" inhabit is truly a world unto itself: a rural land where grinding poverty rules, where clannish ties run thick, where guns and hunting are an integral part of daily life, where acts of brutality and violence alternate with simple acts of charity and kindness, and where outsiders are viewed with suspicion and paranoia.In this richly atmospheric film of the Daniel Woodrell novel, Jennifer Lawrence plays Ree, a 17-year-old girl who lives in a dilapidated shack with her mentally ill mother and a younger brother and sister, whom Ree is essentially raising. When the sheriff comes to inform her that her father, who's been arrested for crank production, has put up the family's home and land as bail, Ree goes in desperate search of him to ensure that he doesn't skip out on his court date. However, as the young woman journeys through the area seeking information as to his whereabouts, she finds herself involved in a situation fraught with far more mystery and danger than she could have imagined when she first set out. All this leads to Ree having to decide between strictly adhering to the ""code of the hills"" - in which the ties of blood trump all else - or of violating it and doing what is right for herself and her immediate family.Writer/director Debra Granik and co-writer Anne Rosellini immerse the audience so thoroughly in the Ozark setting that it takes us awhile to fully shake off the experience and to reorient ourselves to our own environment once the movie has ended. It's a beautifully observed landscape of gnarled trees, car tires, chopped wood, rusted-out vehicles and hay bales, where the sounds of cattle lowing and coyotes howling compete with the twang of a banjo and country music songs playing mournfully on the radio. Indeed, so cut off does this place seem from the outside world that many of the modern conveniences the rest of us take for granted - computers, cell phones, the internet - seem almost completely absent from the setting.In terms of storyline and drama, the filmmakers scrupulously avoid resorting to melodrama or clichés to get their points across. The events in the movie arise organically and naturally from the setting, and the understated performances add to the verisimilitude of the piece. Lawrence carries the film with her insightful, dignified performance as Ree, a morally upright girl trying to do the right thing in a world almost totally devoid of resources and help. Yet, it is Ree's determination to not give up and to try to make something decent out of her own life and the lives of her siblings that gives the film its overall tone of hope.Special note should also be taken of the stark, spare, haunting score by Dickon Hinchliffe that perfectly reflects the film's bleak and dreary background.""Winter's Bone"" is a harsh, unsparing film, but a memorable, mesmerizing experience all the same.",Winter's Bone
36,thesar-2,That Was Winter?,8,30 January 2011,"Oh, I'm sure it was cold; the main character of Winter's Bone kept putting on a knitted hat. But don't expect the snow from Fargo, The Shinning or even, my personal choice of the four mentioned: A Simple Plan.This is unusual, I have to immediately digress for getting off subject in paragraph one. Anyhoo, this movie was very, very good and one I yearn for throughout the year: a well-written yarn of suspense and character-driven heroes.And along side that, put on your own thinking cap, whether knitted or knot. You'll have sixteen dozen (okay, maybe just sixteen) characters to keep up with. That said, they certainly know how to keep a movie realistic for the town/lifestyle these people live.Young 17-year-old Ree (Jennifer Lawrence in an EXCELLENT performance) must take care of her two much younger siblings and her spaced mother with barely pennies to their name. They're making it work though, through school, the winter and helpful neighbors with meat and bread to spare.Unfortunately, what's holding them up is just that: a house that the children's idiot father put up for bail once he got caught – again – for making drugs. He's skipped out and it's up to the heroine and enormously tough (on the inside) Ree to locate him for court in order to save the one thing that's saving everyone: the house. See? Full-circle.Ree must go from point A-to-B-to-hillbilly to find him and no one either wants to help or wants her around.I'm guessing this is supposed to be some big mystery because no one's a'talking'. Chances are, that's what happens in the backwoods world they live in. And that's fine. I accept that. But the payoff's on the whereabouts of said dead-beat-daddy isn't an enormous shocker.Perhaps that's just what keeps the movie real, genuine and a well-written tale of courage and hope.Okay. Positives. The performances all around are great and thoroughly believable, but, again, Lawrence's is EXCELLENT. I hope to see more of her. The cinematography, despite the lack of snow, was wonderful. And the score very nicely done.The fault of the movie, for me, at least, was as real as they were trying to keep it, they overshot it by a mile. I had more trouble keeping up with who's who, where they were located, why they were mad, or who would be mad or who would want to help, that I felt strongly that I just watched an entire season of a TV drama, à la Twin Peaks.One movie this reminded me of, though not the content – just the feel and similar drive, and I felt had a higher impact on me, was Frozen River. Though I gave the same rating (4/5 stars), I'd much rather watch that again, than invest in the puzzle of characters in Winter's Bone.Nevertheless, it's worthy of a viewing. Best picture from the Oscars? No and neither will she win the best actress award – although, any other year that Portman or Bening aren't nominated, she might have. See it, at very least, for Lawrence. She will win you overthe next 100 minutes from the beginning.",Winter's Bone
37,ThomasDrufke,Jennifer Lawrence's Coming Out Party...,7,13 March 2014,"This is a film that I have heard a lot about but also next to nothing. Every major film fan cites this as when Lawrence became a star. John Campea, of AMC Movie Talk, constantly raves about Jennifer Lawrence's performance in this movie. I have only heard good things about her, but I really didn't know the plot, and basically none of the other actors involved. After viewing I can say John Hawkes should be considered as good as Lawrence's. They both received Oscar nominations, and deservedly so. Lawrence is good in everything, but her performance here is so different compared to Hunger Games and the David O Russell movies. Its a strictly dramatic role, in which you see Ree (Lawrence) doing whatever she can to protect and provide for her family. As you watch, you begin to wonder what exactly did her father do to get them into this mess. You don't get much resolution to that, but that's okay, because of the intensity behind one of the late scenes, you really don't want to know. Its worth noting, how beautifully shot this movie was. As I believe it was shot entirely on location. Reminded me a lot of 'Out of the Furnace', with a similar grim tone and depressing feel. Overall its riveting, and deserves attention specifically for the performances. 7.2/10",Winter's Bone
38,g-bodyl,A Tense Character Study!,9,25 March 2015,"Winter's Bone is a very tense character study about an unflinching young girl who sticks her nose where it doesn't belong in order to keep her family safe. The title is aptly named because the tone of the film is chilling and winter-like. The film was badly marketed as a thriller, but this is more of a slow-burn character study that has some thrilling scenes, but not enough to justify it as a thriller. That being said, this film is a well-acted, well-written film that deserves the Grand Jury prize it received at Sundance.This film is about a 17-year-old girl named Ree who cares for her younger siblings and her depressed mother in the absence of her father, a meth cook. One day, she receives a message from the sheriff that her father used their home as collateral in case he does not show up for his court date. Taken aback, Ree decides to find her father and is met with unrelenting social tension, especially from those whom had close ties with him.One of the highlights about the film is the really great acting. Before she became Katniss, Jennifer Lawrence was Ree and this was the role that put her on the map so to speak. She was absolutely amazing, and this role began her love streak the Academy has for her. Also amazing and often overlooked was the performance of John Hawkes as Ree's uncle. Hawkes played a very tough guy, and he had several fantastic scenes.Overall, Winter's Bone is a very tense character study and a film that is worthy of lots of praise. The tone is dark and chilly, but it also has a realistic tone. This is something that would be true in the Ozark region of the United States. This film is something that succeeds thanks to the wonderful acting by Jennifer Lawrence, one of my favorite modern actresses.My Grade: A",Winter's Bone

But with no source of income and a lean against the house, she desperately needs to find him, or at least his body.Unfortunately, her hayseed uncle (John Hawkes) and local drug dealers don't take kindly to her nosy questions and persistent attitude.While it starts off sluggish, once this mercurial movie gets rolling it really comes alive with some strong performances and audacious acts of disfigurement.And while searching for your missing Pa is commendable, as a teen, wouldn't it be more appropriate to throw a killer house party in his absence?

42,Bored_Dragon,Disappointing,5,12 April 2017,"Jennifer Lawrence is a really good actress who unfortunately acts mostly in lousy movies. Beside ""Poker House"" and ""Silver Linings"" that are great, all the other movies I saw so far were really lousy: ""X-Men"", ""Joy"", ""The Hunger Games"", ""Winter's Bone""...

43,tabuno,Overly Forced But Powerful Drama,7,18 January 2019,"18 January 2011. What would this movie have been if it could have been transformed into an Ozark Mountains documentary instead of a mystery thriller with the Ozark Mountain as the constant, persistent, and dominating backdrop. The sharp, clear, and quite authentic, visceral experience of this movie in many ways was also its primary distraction, much in the same way that IN THE WILD (2007) had its own cinematic difficulties. The storytelling was interrupted constantly by the extended effort to remind the audience how well it captured the Ozark community and its people, it was almost a richly photographed sociological travelogue. The movie suffered as THE HURT LOCKER (2008) in its attempt to portray the real culture and setting of its people, but at the same time blurred the likely drama of the story and details by its intensity versus overlooking the more likely subtle details behind the real characters. A number of editing, script flaws or weaknesses arise in this movie, the omission of the actual monetary exchange amounts in an early and later scene, the underdevelopment of the mother's character, perhaps even stereotypical portrayal, the politically correct avoidance of the physical violence and the unspoken and lack of explanation of the female violence versus the male violence shown in the movie, the abrupt transition of the girl's uncle's attitude and behavior, and also the absence of a better understanding of the background and explanation of the setting of the primary conflict that is likely known to most of the characters in the movie but not the audience and is only inferred, and the inclusion of the unnecessary black and white imagery dream scene, and the use of a flashlight towards the end of the movie when it was apparently not needed. The movie's high point is the boat scene later in the movie which in same ways saves this movie from itself. A much more emotionally interesting, believable, and perhaps more powerful but under-rated movie is WHERE THE LILIES BLOOM (1974).",Winter's Bone
44,kenjha,Intriguing but Disappointing,6,8 April 2011,"A teenager goes in search of her missing father. The cinematography is effective in evoking the cold, gray atmosphere of the Ozark Mountains. The premise of the story is intriguing but the execution leaves much to be desired. The plot is rather repetitive, with Lawrence going from door to door searching for her father and getting a cold shoulder from everyone. It feels like it's building up to something but the payoff just isn't there. However, the acting is good. Lawrence is quite impressive in what appears to be a star-making performance, earning her a well-deserved Oscar nomination. Hawkes also makes a mark as Lawrence's disgruntled uncle.",Winter's Bone
45,Rodrigo_Amaro,Extraordinary!,10,24 March 2011,"""Winter's Bone"" was one of the delightful and magnificent surprises of 2010, and we must thank all the critics, syndicates and awards that selected this as one of the finest films of the year, it is really a wonderful and thrilling experience even being similar to another recent indie film, the equally great ""Frozen River"". The similarities between ""Frozen River"" and ""Winter's Bone"" are very visible and clear: both independent films dealing with women trying to save their houses and their families, and both of them are living in the wilderness, dealing with the roughness of the place and of the people too, and both are searching for someone who might help them to solve their problems; in the case of Melissa Leo in 2008 film she was looking for her husband; here, the amazing Jennifer Lawrence seeks for her father, a drug dealer on parole who disappeared mysteriously, and left the young Ree (Lawrence) taking care of her brothers and sisters, and a sick mother, plus their house as a guarantee for his bail. In the story, Ree besides of taking care of the family and looking for her father, which involves talking to people who don't want her near them, dangerous figures who had problems with her father in the past, she has a pursue in join the army in order to help her family and save the house, a choice exclusively made to get money fast, as she thinks. Selling the woods of her territory seems out of the question, and counting with the help of some friends sometimes works, other times it's not so great. But, her father's brother, the mysterious Teardrop (John Hawkes) might be the only one who really cares for her, and the one who'll always be with her trying to save her of possible problems with enemies of the family. But the biggest mystery continues: what happened to her father?""Winter's Bone"" is a story of a girl's struggle in becoming a woman in the middle of the hardness of life and hardness of people in a desolated place trying to give her best while protecting her family and the only valuable thing they have, the place where they live. The contours of thriller in the story where everything can happen makes us unsettled, fearing for what can happen to the girl and we know that she feels the same way too, in moments where she teaches her younger brothers to hunt and to use a gun, just in case she's not there for them. Everything falls on her to solve, but she has guts, she has audacity, lot of nerve and always find a way to make things better, yet she's not a superhero coming out of a comic book or a perfect person. Here's a character that most of us can relate with it, and here's a extraordinary figure for Jennifer Lawrence to play, a remarkable and balanced performance, a true revelation of the last years.Another extraordinary performance of this film comes from a inspired and very different John Hawkes, combining a quality that resembles Harry Dean Stanton and Sam Shepard and the kind of roles these guys had in the past. He's the man who gives the best moments in the film, the one guy who'll make you want to see more and more in the film, and the more his character grows in the story the better the film gets. He and Lawrence, both Oscar nominated for their roles here, are responsible to the greatest scenes of ""Winter's Bone"".I'm glad and disappointed with one thing with the film's conclusion: It disappointed me a little for not giving the expected bloodshed that seemed to be the whole premise of this thriller, something that I was expecting in a way, and due to that it killed all that tension coming from the main mystery of the story that end up unsolved and we get a nice ending for the characters. It disappointed me but at the same time I enjoyed it, it was original, surprises are good and makes us say: ""I wasn't ready for this. What a twist!"" and avoided clichés which is always a great and rare thing to do.Director Debra Granik delivers a spectacular film that conquers us all with its simplicity, outstanding dramaticity, a realistic and plausible story, inspiring performances from the cast and a beautiful cinematography.

46,Thanos_Alfie,And then...,5,17 March 2020,"""Winter's Bone"" is a Drama - Mystery movie in which we follow a girl trying to find her drug-dealing father in a very hostile and dangerous place while she has to keep her family safe. She is the only one responsible for it since she hasn't got any other person to help her or to trust.I have to admit that I had high hopes for this movie and unfortunately I was a bit disappointed by it. Despite the very good interpretations of Jennifer Lawrence who played as Ree and John Hawkes who played as Teardrop, this movie is just another average movie and nothing more. The plot wasn't interesting and in the last twenty minutes I felt that we were in a hurry in order not to leave any plot holes, something that wasn't succeeded. Thus, as it can be easily understood the direction which was made by Debra Granik who is also one of the writers was poor and I believe that she could do better than this outcome. I don't recommend anyone to watch this movie but if you want to then I advise you not to have high expectations from it because I am sure that you are going to be disappointed by it.",Winter's Bone
47,zkonedog,Too Bleak (Even Though I Know That Is The Point),3,4 March 2017,"After Jennifer Lawrence's absolute explosion into super-stardom over the past couple of years, I wanted to go back and see the movie that gave her a start. While I was expecting great things, I was disappointed by how bleak the proceedings were.For a basic plot summary, ""Winter's Bone"" is set in the deepest reaches of the Ozark Mountains, where everyone is related to another in some form, crystal meth is the business of choice, and the law even stays out of the way. When the father of 17-year old Ree (Lawrence) does not make his bail and sets up his family to lose their house, Ree must venture into the most dangerous families in the mountains to locate him.Perhaps the biggest overall problem with this movie is that you almost need to have subtitles on to understand the dialogue (and I'm not hard of hearing whatsoever). Besides Ree, everyone else either mumbles or talks in such a back-woods accent that it makes it very difficult to navigate many scenes. For example, Teardrop (John Hawkes) has a key scene at one point with Ree, and it took me a couple of tries to fully understand what is going on.Another shortcoming is the fact that no one really gets to emote in this film besides Lawrence. I know this is supposed to be a bleak movie, but I still believe that films need to give the audience some sort of overt dramatic material to really care about. ""People just living their lives"" is supposed to be enough to carry this flick, but for me it isn't.About the only redeeming value of this movie for me was how it shows the life of some people in the Ozark Mountains. Much like a more-recent ""Out of the Furnance"", it is interesting (eye- opening?) to see that there are communities who create their own kind of law and justice.Thus, while I can see why this film rocketed Lawrence the individual to stardom, the overall film itself is no classic. Even in what are supposed to be its most dramatic moments, it failed to really suck me into the story or make me care one way or the other.",Winter's Bone
48,Floated2,Slow off setting drama,3,8 May 2020,"Winter's Bone is the film which relatively helped put Jennifer Lawrence on the map.

Based on a novel (perhaps why it is so praised) the acting is great, realistic and authentic but overall the film is just off setting and doesn't bring much entertainment or thrills. It is strictly a slow moving drama.Nothing quite grabs you, save for some scenes and it's pacing is rather slow. The characters feel somewhat one dimensional and we don't exactly care for them. Doubt would watch again, as had very little interest.",Winter's Bone
49,johnnyboyz,"Really well played, biting drama about one girl's upsetting of a backward, rural-set patriarchy that does well to encompass thriller elements and stark character studies.",7,24 October 2011,"Winter's Bone unfolds amidst a landscape that looks as if it was plucked directly from John Hillcoat's recent adaptation of the Cormac McCarthy novel, ""The Road"". The surroundings are desolate and bleak. It might be the middle of the day, and yet there is a morbid darkness throughout the locale; the trees are tall and bare and stand rock-steady in the presence of no wind.They are located not too far from the beaten track, they are plentiful and bunched up over small stretches of land making for a wooded labyrinth of wildlife and dead wood.American director Debra Granik here shoots what is her third filmic directorial effort and doing a fine job in telling the disturbing tale of a young American girl, local to these ruralised pastures of modern day Missouri, trying to balance her life in what is a fine Oscar-nominated independent drama. We are asked to deduce, going on the opening shots, that the lead character has already grown up a fair bit and taken on her share of responsibility. This lead is played by the remarkable Jennifer Lawrence, an actress around about nineteen at the time of the shoot and here playing the seventeen year old Ree Dolly; a girl with a humble one storey wooden shack within which she lives along side her two infant siblings as well as a mother whom has a condition that sees her occupy a somewhat permanent vegetative state. Around her lies a window into a world of drugs and guns that she has so far avoided, while Granik manages to juxtapose a world set on the farming-orientated lands of where we're at with this inherent aura of a gang-culture sensibility; a harsh juxtaposition of a place often depicted as 'safe' or upstanding blended with a mean spirited, sordid undertone of gangster-like hierarchy involving casual drug use; GBH and gun play.Lawrence does a remarkable job. She juggles frailty and aggression in equal measure in a manner that more broadly syncs up with the fact her character is juggling the bringing up of her little brother and sister as best she can on top of the looking for her missing father, whom desperately needs to be found. She is an empowered and independent presence in a ruralised world of farming; bovine auctioning; the manly process of wood cutting; animal skinning and trailer-park owning, truck driving cutthroats doing their utmost to get by and doing even more to blot out anybody else. We sense the world in which Ree lives is as real and as frightening as it is constructed. It is established very early on that her younger siblings have difficulty spelling words as routine as ""House"", whereas simple addition takes a while to figure out. At nearby community colleges, we observe through Ree's pained gaze that of young men getting involved in mother-care tuition classes and, in another workshop hall, females just as young engaging in U.S. Army marching drills. Just as school girls enjoyed football practise and young men made for good cooks in Bill Forsyth's 1981 film Gregory's Girl, this is very much the sort of piece resisting the need to categorise; a film resisting the adhering to place limits on what someone of a specific gender may achieve.Ree's father, a man with a chequered history in relation to an array of local people making up families, some of which he is indeed related to, has gone missing. This is not news to the family whom he walked out on however long ago, although the pinch to the situation this time is that after being caught for something by the authorities and let out again on bail, he placed the family home up as collateral meaning if he dodges his court date, a repossession will have to take place. Cash is scarce as is, but with nowhere else for Ree and co. to go, something needs to be done in not an awful lot of time. Around Ree's quest is the indelible presence of the Academy Award nominated John Hawkes, playing a character rather ironically named Teardrop; a grizzled character romping through these gaunt, sparsely populated nether-regions - a spiteful, often easily enraged rancher whose being in the film acts as the principal character study along side Ree's story. In a film in which the male characters the lead often comes to interact with are depicted as aggressive and unkind, whilst the other females are either mothers or considerably caring and understanding, the film skirts any issue to do with sexism by taking Teardrop from this equally dismissive; unshaven; hulking individual with a penchant to strike someone if it means getting their point across, and developing him into a helping ally working the case with Ree after a change of heart instead of standing egotistically opposite her.The film wonderfully balances these character studies with the meatier central narrative of finding Ree's father, as well as some touching other content to do with Ree mentoring her infant brother and sister in the art of hunting and maintaining their lodgings, in what is an exciting depiction of Lawrence's character attempting to upset the established norm - these agricultural patriarchies, in her looking for her father. Winter's Bone is a persistently engaging thriller made with real guile and maturity, a film without several millions worth of money thrown at it and instead built on good, solid foundations resulting in a memorable exercise.",Winter's Bone
50,Red-125,The must-see movie of 2010,10,20 July 2010,"Winter's Bone (2010), co-written and directed by Debra Granik, is this year's must-see movie. Jennifer Lawrence plays Ree Dolly, a young woman who has had to grow up fast. She has two younger siblings to care for. Her father is missing, and her mother is an invalid. Ree is keeping the family together in their home in a remote corner of the Missouri Ozarks.When the film opens, the key plot points are set out for Ree and for us. Her father was arrested, and then released on bail. He's put up the family's house and land in order to obtain his release. Now that he's gone, the house and land will belong to the bond company. Realistically, Ree has to find him or the family will be destroyed.Into the mix comes Ree's uncle, called Teardrop, portrayed by John Hawkes. He has a frightening presence. Everyone respects the potential for deadly violence that Teardrop represents--the local sheriff, Ree, and the hard-bitten meth producers who inhabit the region.This is a film that is better seen than described in a review. The acting is incredible without exception, but Lawrence and Hawkes are extraordinary. We saw this film at the Rochester 360-365 Film Festival, but it's now in commercial release. It's a tense, taut movie that takes place in small, tight places, even when the scene is shot outdoors, so it will work on DVD.Seek it out and see it!",Winter's Bone
51,leplatypus,"Twin peaks, 20 years later, after the crash (rental)",7,16 November 2013,"With no DVD left to watch (except my rated ones), I'm free to watch either TV or to get some by rental. That's what I have done and to open this new stage back from my trip to Sweden, i picked the movie that Kajsa, the friend of my Swedish friend Tati recommended. I don't remember clearly why we talked about this one but i kept the memory of Kajsa telling us the unexpected meeting about stray dogs on her jogging and that i was looking for an American movie about poverty, as I'm fed up with those privileged families we always see.So, yep, it's indeed a poor America that appears here. ""Winter's bone"" is an accurate title as it pictures well all the atmosphere of the movie: for me, winter's bone is the skeletons of the trees in that season, having lost all their leaves and that we see all along the movie but it's also all those derelict houses and even the main subject of the story as it's about finding the remains of the father. For me, it was like coming back to the little town of Twin Peaks but this time, without the varnish and facing the harsh realities of the world today. So i was really stunned to see Sheryl Lee because the Laura Palmer has aged as well and it validated my feeling. It was thus great to see at last one American movie turning the camera toward the dark side of America and its lost territories. But it doesn't shock me as i expected because it also recalls my old past: My aunt and uncle was living a bit like this (and going in vacation out there was a nightmare as a kid) and frankly, the French countryside is similar: old houses never started, never finished, grumpy hicks and dark secrets and habits! Maybe this is the reason i ran off to the city of lights, Paris where I found another taste of decay.Maybe the difference between those two crippled countries is what appears clearly in the movie: drugs, guns and military. You always see them in America while in France, it's not usual: Soon forty, I have never hold gun, drug and military isn't an exit for lost people! In such a gloomy world, i was first happy to see, as in ""Voces Inocentes"" and like the real kid I knew, that young children seem to escape the tension as they are still to little to really understand: the little girl was just happy to jump, play hide and seek, be with her siblings. On the contrary, Jennifer Lawrence as her big sister took all the crap that life could throw at her. I found that her performance was great because she never loses her sprite of fragility and humanity. Sure, the story is a bit hard to follow as there isn't a real introduction and almost everyone imply things instead of telling them clearly but it was an gripping tale.If it's cool to notice its 4 Oscar nominations as it's well worthy, it's also a shame to learn that the Academy preferred validate a story about a stuttering British king. I suppose that the mighty aren't called like that for nothing and that truth about its own country is always difficult to accept! But, for me, between taking re-education lessons and supporting a family when you have nothing, I know at once where courage lies!",Winter's Bone
52,howard.schumann,"A rich, satisfying film",9,27 June 2010,"It is quite astonishing what people are capable of when their survival or way of life is threatened. In those moments, they are somehow able to employ a level of courage, perseverance, and high intention that they never knew they had. Such is the case for young Ree Dolly (Jennifer Lawrence) in Debra Granik's The Winter's Bone, winner of the Jury Prize for dramatic competition as well as the Waldo Salt Screen writing Award at the Sundance Film Festival. Newcomer Lawrence, a Kentucky native, is completely convincing as the 17-year-old Ree who has endured much in her brief lifetime and has plenty of obstacles yet to overcome. Living in poverty in a small house in the rural Missouri Ozarks, near the Arkansas border, she has to cook, chop wood and do whatever is necessary to care for her twelve-year old brother Sonny (Isaiah Stone) and her six-year old sister Ashlee (Ashlee Thompson) as well as look after her mother who is catatonic.Based on the novel by Daniel Woodrell and co-written by Granik and Anne Rosellini, The Winter's Bone depicts how young Ree's life is changed when the local sheriff informs her that her dad, Jessup, on the run after being arrested for ""cooking"" methamphetamines, has put the family's house up as bond and that, unless he is found and convinced to turn himself in, Ree's family will lose their house. Insisting to the sheriff that she will find him, the young girl begins a search among friends, family members, distant relatives, and the community of small-time crooks, dope dealers, and kingpins that dominate the male-dominated rural society. No one wants to talk and Ree is met with silence, hostility, and even violence. One neighbor tells her that her questioning is, ""a real good way to end up et by hogs."" When someone asks her, ""Ain't you got no men folk to do this?"" the answer is an emphatic ""no."" (at times, the film seems to be challenging Juno for the most quirky one-liners).Ree's main antagonists are her father's terrifying older brother Teardrop, played by John Hawkes, and Merab (Dale Dickey), the wife of Thump Milton, one of the local bosses. The performance by Dickey conveys an overbearing sense of intimidation that is both real and frightening. As Ree navigates through this hostile environment, we grow to admire her determination and her willingness to confront danger in order to protect her siblings. Winter's Bone is a film about poverty and desperation but it never exploits its characters or engages in manipulation or sentimentality. Though it can be hard to watch at times, it is not as some critics have said ""poverty porn."" There are lighter moments as well that include authentic Ozark folk music sung by Marideth Sisco and scenes of Ree teaching her brother and sister to spell, count, and perhaps more important for survival, how to shoot a rifle. She also tells her younger brother about the culture in which they live saying ""Never ask for what ought to be offered."" Though I was riveted by the unfolding story, perhaps because of the film's high degree of stylization, I stopped short of full emotional involvement and was often conscious of the fact that I was watching a movie. Yet The Winter's Bone is a rich, satisfying film that more than deserves the accolades it has been receiving. Though it is stylized, it has an authenticity derived from using local residents as actors and from the director having immersed herself in the culture for two years before shooting the film. Jennifer Lawrence conveys a stoic and hard-edged individual, yet one with integrity who has somehow avoided getting sucked into the soul destructive way of life that seems to be endemic to the area. In Ree, Granik has created one of the strongest female characters in cinema in memory, one who, by her sheer will, suggests what could be accomplished if all of us could live each day as if our life depended on it.",Winter's Bone
53,Tweetienator,The True Underdogs,8,12 October 2021,A great movie and a fantastic Jennifer Lawrence.

54,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Cold, brooding film lacks intensity but is beautifully understated",8,17 January 2011,"A harrowing portrait of a teenager forced to be an adult out in the Ozarks, the epicenter of crystal meth activity, ""Winter's Bone"" feels more harsh and real than anything that brief summary evokes. Debra Granik's film seems unequivocally true, so while I'm sure Daniel Woodrell's novel paints an extremely accurate portrait of these white rural communities devastated by drug trafficking, there's no question that Granik's turned his story into something truly lifelike, not ""Hollywood"" lifelike.Nothing in ""Winter's Bone"" gets over-dramatized. Even the film's most jarring events have a modesty about them. Granik prefers to let the characters and the gravity of their situations brood rather than add some extra suspense to get our blood pumping. Throw everything you know about poor white trash drug films out the window as there's nothing even resembling shock and disgust tactics. We are simply meant to watch Ree Dolly (Jennifer Lawrence) struggle against a number of common and uncommon forces and observe the mostly cold demeanor of those around her whose lives have presumably been battered by drug abuse and peddling.Jennifer Lawrence makes as big a splash as a 19-year-old possibly could here. She exudes Ree's confident and responsible attitude. Although Ree possesses a definite naivety, it comes wrapped in a determination and willingness to accept the consequences. She's in a desperate situation having to take care of her ill and incompetent mother and her two younger siblings, yet she remains self-assured. The film follows Ree's mission to find her father at risk of losing her house and being left homeless with her dependent family. Her father has been in and out of prison and has been missing the last few weeks. The sheriff informs her that if he doesn't make his court date they'll take the house to pay bond. The only way she knows to track him is to stick her nose into some dangerous places and she nearly loses it.Yet ""Winter's Bone"" does not uncover the horrors of crystal meth cooking in Central Missouri. The story focuses on Ree and causes us to wonder about those she seeks out in search of her father. We don't see them engaging in drug use or behaving all that recklessly, but there's an unspoken seriousness in all of them and consequently fear pervades the film.Granik beautifully creates a barren, isolated, cold and uncomfortable mood as suggested by the title. The colors of the film are faded and bleak and the performances introspective. One might lament that John Hawkes, who plays Ree's uncle, never gets to fully flex his dramatic chops despite the underlying tension that could justify an over-the-top scene, but his performance remains powerfully understated. Forced to blend together tones of anger, fear, responsibility and love, Hawkes stirs it up just right as the film slowly plods on.Those who can appreciate a film that aims mainly to be a character-centered mood piece will find so many beautiful things in ""Winter's Bone"" albeit things hard to digest. There's also nothing completely tragic or gut-wrenching about the film and some might wait the entire time for the lid to burst and never be fully satisfied. Yet there's no doubt that some wonderful talents assembled this troublesome film and created a mood that will somehow settle with you even if its plot points go forgotten.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",Winter's Bone
55,jzappa,Natural Beauty Cloaked Beneath Primitive Dismay and Human Injustice,8,5 November 2010,"Ree Dolly's 17 and acts as the homemaker for her younger siblings in the backlands of the Ozarks. Ree's mother sits all day of no use, in short mental supply. Ree's father, who was locked up for cooking meth, is gone. Ree struggles to raise the kids and feed them, scouring along on welfare and the benevolence of neighbors. The children are lively and active, and love to play. They have not gathered they are underprivileged.This world is set up with sorrowful thrift in the opening scenes of Debra Granik's combustible, almost dismal slice-of-life, which titled much in the way it feels. Distinctly filmed on location, it concentrates on an abandoned culture. The unreciprocated uncertainty is how Ree matured in this world and became resilient and self-sufficient. She didn't get it from her parents. The sheriff comes to call. Her dad's jumped bail. To meet his bond, he put up the house, maybe the single asset he had. If he doesn't turn himself within a week, the family will be ejected. Out of the blue. But, ""I'll find him,"" Ree says softly and resolutely. And that's what she embarks to do.She's played by Jennifer Lawrence, a 19-year-old tenderfoot from Louisville, who personifies a stern, static axis that is the resource of her bravery. She sings no praises of herself, deals no warnings, relies on nothing. The movie has a knack for making us rely for her sake on a relentless hope that people will do what's so clearly the right thing, even when no one we meet seems to merit that hope. ""Don't ask for what's not offered,"" she tells her little brother, even while the lives of her parents appear to be a drill in asking and not offering. Did she raise herself? With a visage as coolly fine-looking as the terrain she plods through, Ree's a heroine you won't put behind you. Resolute and painfully sober, she holds her own in a colloquial speech that's even shares hayseed and case-hardened.Everyone in the region knew what her dad did. He's a contemporary Legs Diamond, a truly real-world Walter White. What's evident is that crime doesn't appear to have made him much money. Maybe its indiscretion is its draw, and its marketplace is among people he feel at ease with. Ree's actions in pursuit of her father lead her to his brother, Teardrop, whose subsistence wreaks a lesion on the endowment of living.The script, by Granik and Anne Rosellini, based on the novel by Daniel Woodrell, is like a circular pilgrimage. At its end will be Ree's father, dead or living. Odds-on the former, she starts to reckon, however if there's no body, her family will be destitute and separated. She hikes through a countryside that gives a devastated impression. While it has pick-up trucks, telephone poles, gym shoes, kitchens, cigarettes and TVs, these look like residue of a better-off past generation.There's a peril of misrepresentation here, but Granik's austere, poignant, and yet still somehow positive drama doesn't live above these people, but amongst them. Her protagonist lives as one of them and doesn't view them as substandard, just tight-fisted and discouraging. In her father's world, everyone's a felon, governed by a felon or trades with felons. That they're entrenched in illicit activities makes them susceptible to anyone who cops a plea, so they're plausibly distrustful. The formula'd be that they distrust interlopers. These characters distrust natives, even relatives, of which they have many.More or less a genre film, this earnestly naturalistic indie picture, like Rian Johnson's Brick, illustrates that estranged teenagers make excellent noir protagonists. Like Philip Marlowe or Jake Gittes, Ree can depend on only herself in this despicable adult world. Except Ree doesn't live in a sordid city, her world is a grotesque bucolic America, where limbs surface in marshes at night and incinerated meth labs function for sinister manses. However, as Ree's voyage takes her from one character to another, Granik almost completely concentrates on each one's humanity, more often than not in ruins. Played by a keenly and understatedly selected supporting cast of fine contemporary Nameless Face players, they aren't geek show oddities, just the remains in a consensus reality. Do they see Ree as a poverty-stricken girl and a family in danger of eviction? They must see the threat of their own poverty and eviction. It's almost unanimously safer to hold one's tongue and put up one's shutters.So the film hinges on Ree, offset by Teardrop, violent in his loathing rather than dutiful in corruption. The story nearly becomes immersed in desolation, but Ree's hopefulness and nerve are what drives it, and it does not manipulate us or contrive hope-and-faith clichés to cop out of its desolate atmosphere. It remains committed to what it's about: How did she become how she is? We begin with rose-colored glasses, while life can be a vast deterrent.",Winter's Bone
56,Turfseer,Meth replaces Moonshine in this updated tale of hillbilly stereotypes,4,20 February 2011,"Wikipedia informs us that the classic 'hillbilly' stereotype began during the Great Depression. The image was one of ""the poor, ignorant, feuding family with a huge brood of children tending the family moonshine still."" Filmed in the Ozark Mountains, 'Winter's Bone' continues to advance the same stereotype--this time however, the 'hillbillies' are not making moonshine but rather cooking up the more deadly brew of methamphetamine.When we're first introduced to the film's protagonist, Ree (Jennifer Lawrence), she's taking care of her almost catatonic mother and two much younger siblings. The family is so destitute that at one point they shoot squirrels and eat them. One wonders why no social services agency becomes involved with this family. After all, the local sheriff is quite familiar with the family's situation--that Ree, a 17 year old minor, is caring for the younger siblings and the mother is a virtual basket case. Wouldn't the sheriff have been obligated to report the family situation to social services so they could be placed in foster care? After all, if something happens to those kids and law enforcement was found to know about it, they could be held liable along with the county for not calling in various helpful authorities.The inciting incident occurs early on when a bail bondsman informs Ree that she has a week to find her meth-selling father who has used the family home as collateral to be released on bond. Ree seeks help from various relatives including 'Teardrop', her uncle, who at first wants nothing to do with finding brother Jessup, Ree's dad. Teardrop's strategy is to intimidate his niece, so that she won't get into trouble when the meth dealers get upset over her snooping around trying to find her father. It's established early on that people in town are scared of Uncle Teardrop due to his deep-seated anger management problem (Teardrop likes to smash car windows and refuses to get out of his own vehicle when ordered by the police).Ree eventually contacts other members of the community who she is supposedly distantly related to. One of these men is Thump who heads a group of meth-dealing bad guys. He gets the word out that Ree should not be snooping around but she won't listen. Because of the hillbilly code, he ends up sending the womenfolk to beat Ree up. Finally Teardrop levels with Ree, explaining that her father was killed because he was an informer. I had a hard time believing that Thump and his men didn't kill Ree outright as she was doing all that snooping around. You would think that meth dealers wouldn't give a hoot about some old hillbilly code about not hurting a woman. And then despite the fact that they outnumber Teardrop, Thump and his men somehow accept his word that Ree won't snitch. Unlikely. And then they capitulate and send the womenfolk to cut off Ree's father's hand, as proof that he's dead. And here his daughter accepts that? The point I guess is that people are so intimidated by meth dealers, that their spirit is completely crushed.So Ree makes a 'deal with the devil' in order to save the family. You've got to assume that law enforcement is so totally corrupt that they look the other way in every case. Here, Ree assumes the police know about what's happening and will take no action. So there's not one good person in law enforcement who might try to do something? So they're all completely intimidated and ineffectual? No higher authorities become involved in cases like these? Sure there are cases where people are intimidated and refuse to cooperate with law enforcement. But if everyone did that, the vast majority of criminals would get away with their crimes. So you have to buy this whole scenario and I have trouble doing that.The problem with 'Winter's Bone' is that most of the hillbillies are creepy, malevolent figures, reminiscent of some of the unpleasant characters in the film 'Deliverance'. Ree comes off as hardly heroic, refusing to rat out her father's killers in a desperate bid to save her family. It's understandable but nothing to cheer about. Similarly, we're asked to sympathize with Teardrop too as he's saved his niece from the clutches of murderers--but he too is complicit in his brother's murder.'Winter's Bone' was directed by Debra Granik, a Columbia film professor. She is to be admired for using some local talent during the filming and does a fine job in getting good work out of her director of photography and editors. Nonetheless, her big mistake was deciding to adapt the source material, a novel which apparently promotes the idea that there is a community in the Ozarks who are completely unlikeable and have little or no redeeming qualities, due to their association with the methamphetamine trade. Even if we accept the idea that there is an underclass of such people, how about humanizing those characters by giving them some kind of personality, instead of depicting them as suffering from a terminal case of uncontrollable hostility?",Winter's Bone
57,freemantle_uk,A Bleak Drama,8,17 December 2013,"Winter's Bone was the film that brought Jennifer Lawrence to attention of the world, being her first leading role and earning her first Oscar nomination. Lawrence gives a fantastic performance as lead character Ree Dolly, a tough as nails 17-year-old who does everything she can to protect her younger siblings, teaching them to hunt in this film set in rural poverty and it is clear to see why this film helped Lawrence get the Hunger Games role.Winter's Bone superbly acted film as Ree searches for her father, crossing the criminal underbelly of community and their refusal to talk, as well as tackling other themes, such as a lack of employment, leading to the army being the only option for some people, the culture of America that people refusal to seek help, that you need to be able to stand on your own two feet, a distrust of the police and the focus of a character on the crossroads between teenhood or adulthood.",Winter's Bone
58,dfranzen70,Chilling Bone gathers no moss,8,2 February 2011,"Although bleak and darkly realized, Winter's Bone is a gritty, realistic tale with a resounding message of resilience, perseverance, and honesty. As the moral center of the movie, Jennifer Lawrence's Ree Dolly isn't the type to back down, even in the face of violent backwoods discipline.Ree's dad, the elusive Jessup, has gone astray. Again. This is a particularly bad problem now, because he had apparently just put up his house – the one in which Ree, her two younger siblings, and her nearly catatonic mother live – as collateral for a bond. His court date's coming up, so if he doesn't show the house will be seized. Ree, of course, can't let this happen; she aims to hunt her father down. He's nothing to him, not since he wandered off to make and sell meth, but without that house she, her mother, and her two youngsters will be left with nothing.It's no mystery that something bad has happened to Jessup, a bad-seeming guy if there ever was one. Ree's challenge isn't just to find her father, though; it's to find her father while trying not to run afoul of the various clans in the area, many of whom don't take kindly to her poking around. And I don't mean in the almost-benign Scooby Doo or Hardy Boys way, either; these people mean business, and business happens to be cooking meth.One of the greatest difficulties in acting, it would seem, is for the actor to make his or her character relatable to the average viewer. The more removed the character is from mainstream society, the tougher the role. Ree Dolly is backwoods and dirt poor. She is strong willed and physically tough. She can hunt, she can chop wood, she can do a lot of survivalist tasks just to get by. She has the burden of caring for three people. And she's all of 17 years old.Lawrence is spellbinding as Ree, a young lady who won't take no for an answer if doing so means not only losing her home but ensuring the doom of her sister, her brother, and her mother. She isn't aggressive all of the time in her pursuit, and this measured action serves her well, for the most part. Even so, when she gets too close, the consequences aren't slight.There's a little more than meets the eye to the plot. We do know that Jessup is missing. But why is he missing? His bail was paid not just from the home collateral but also by some mysterious patron – who overpaid the bail. Did someone bail Jessup out just to kill him? Whoever knows sure isn't keen on telling Ree or her dad's brother Teardrop (John Hawkes), who ""ran with"" Jessup prior to his disappearance. It's Teardrop's help that proves to be the tipping point, the missing ingredient to solving the mysteries.Both Hawkes and Lawrence have been nominated for their work here (same for director Debra Granik and Anne Rosellini for their screenplay), but I thought the cinematography was amazing as well (by Michael McDonough). Stark contrasts are used; moonlight, in a key late scene, is as much a part of the scene as the actors themselves. The lighting is dark and hopeless, much like the plight of the barely living denizens of the West Virginia community. It's an arresting movie.",Winter's Bone
59,meeza,Jennifer!!!!!!!!,8,26 November 2010,"The RATY (Rising Actress of The Year) could very well go to Jennifer Lawrence this year. OK, I was being a rat there, there is no such thing as a RATY, but there is such thing as a rising actor or actress and Jennifer fits the bill for 2010. Her natural demeanor and look is a thing of artistic and aesthetic beauty. Lawrence stars in the slow-paced but well-executed ""Winter's Bone"" as Ree Dolly, an Ozark Mountain girl who is the primary caretaker of her younger siblings. Dollyworld (their small cabin in the mountains) is also inhabited by the Dolly mother, but she cannot be much help to Ree due to her nervous breakdown condition. Where ""Winter's Bone"" gets its biggest plot chew is on Ree's quest to find her meth-dealing father who is a fugitive from the law. If Ree cannot find her father or prove that he is dead, the law (as she calls the police) will take Dollyworld away from the Ree clan. Ree's bravery and will is tested several times throughout the film and she does get unexpected support from her drug-addicted uncle nicknamed Teardrops. Writer-Director Debra Granik marvels in presenting an authentic picturesque of the people, the mood, and the aura of a small mountain town where ""everybody knows your name"" and ""everybody knows what's cooking in the meth kitchen"". Granik's screenplay does try to go the complex route midway through the film where it did not need to go to, and her narrative might be a little bit in the melancholy ""Debra downer"" side; but all in all, it still delivered its potency quite well. Jennifer Lawrence's performance as Ree was a ""reevelation"" and should garner her a Best Actress Oscar nomination. John Hawkes mastered his Teardrop character like a hawk with his brawny performance. I am going to shed a few teardrops if he is not considered for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nom. There were other winning supporting performances in ""Winter's Bone"" to note: Dale Dickey as the mean-spirited Merab, Ronnie Hall as the meth granddaddy-of-them-all Thump Milton, and Kevin Breznahan as the ""don't meth with me"" Little Arthur. Also, Michael McDonough's cinematography was a practical component of the movie that was character in itself. I make no bones about it that ""Winter's Bone"" is not for those who take a liking to fast-paced movies. But there is no legitimate reason to be bad to the ""Winter's Bone"" because it still showcases a part of America that is hardly ever presented in movies; and for no better reason, the Jennifer Lawrence effect. So don't throw this bone away, and season yourself to ""Winter's Bone"". **** Good",Winter's Bone
60,drqshadow-reviews,A Quietly Disturbing Bit of Backwoods Inquisition,8,29 January 2013,"A young, willful teenage girl conducts a desperate hunt for her father, amidst the grey skies and brown, snow-kissed hills of an Ozark Mountain winter. It's a tough, winding trail that traverses thorny conversations with her cold, lip-zipped relatives as well as the bleak, desolate Missouri wilderness. The selfish restraint of nearly every face in this young girl's world is infuriating - by the closing chapters I wanted to see them all brained with a baseball bat - but it's not that kind of a story. Instead, the film takes a note from its young, headstrong protagonist and simply endures, waiting for the storm to blow itself out to see what's left behind. Jennifer Lawrence shines in the difficult leading role, balancing responsibility with determination, and enjoys plenty of help from a rich, convincing supporting cast. It's also quite appropriately shot, with a focus on rural poverty and a permeating lack of color. Bleak, dark and emotionally exhausting, it's a powerful bit of cinema, but not something I could bear to watch multiple times.",Winter's Bone
61,Chris_Docker,Tasty all the way down in Missouri and chilled to the bone,9,28 June 2010,"Not quite your average day out in the Ozark Mountains. This gutsy, hard to categorise, steadily paced, noir-ish thriller set in the rural badlands of America could even be an early Oscar contender. Gruesome murder-mystery or girl-makes-good-against-the-odds, the inscrutably titled Winter's Bone maintains a sense of deep menace as it weaves its way towards a suitably restrained yet gruesome conclusion. Seventeen-year-old Ree Dolly tries to track down her father, who put their house up for his bail bond and then disappeared. If she fails, Ree and her family will be turned out into the Ozark woods. Challenging her outlaw kin's code of silence and risking her life, Ree begins to piece together the truth.The carefully drawn characters and dense plot are drawn from a similarly creepy book of the same name by Daniel Woodrell, who coined the phrase 'country noir.' The pacing reminded me of Mystic River, but the unusual location and strange people persuade me it is something new. Many of the adults in the local community live in disgusting conditions, often using drugs quite openly. But they are not stereotypical drug users. There have clear-cut rules and codes of honour, as strong and enforceable as any mafia network. This is good entertainment, with sufficient plot complexity to keep serious viewers on their toes. There are endless questions to which you need to know the answers. Such as how to avoid ending up eaten by hogs (which mostly involves not asking awkward question of the people who feed them). The humdinger that keeps the end-stage of the movie on edge is, How do you prove you are dead?You are, of course, meant to enjoy it without asking too many questions, just like the man says. For instance, how does a girl like Ree, whose mother is insane and whose father is a druggie, come to be an ideal teenager? She has every decent quality you can imagine, combined with humility and guts. I wonder where she learnt those if not at America film-script central? She's no dumb cookie, raises siblings of six and twelve years old, teaches them everything from spelling and arithmetic to how to shoot a gun and skin a squirrel. The perfect character for audience identification and who will uphold decency, family values and lead us to salvation from the filth and corruption all around. It's well acted, and just the story we want to hear. But apart from exposing the conventional structure beneath its seeming indie exterior, there's not a lot to find wrong with the film. It boasts high production values, a haunting, outstandingly atmospheric score by Dickon Hinchliffe, perfectly evocative of the region. The best spin is making the chief protagonist a young girl. The basic plot would be a western with a strong minded man triumphing over evil, whereas Ree transforms it into a rite of passage to assert her adulthood. It might be the stuff of fantasy, but it's still a fine movie about surmounting your fears.Some people have asked what the title means. By way of just one possible explanation, I'd like to quote from the book, which will maybe also give you a good taste of the film: (vegetarians look away now)""Three halt haggard houses formed a kneeling rank on the far creekside and each had two or more skinned torsos dangling by rope from sagged limbs, venison left to the weather for two or three nights so the early blossoming of decay might round the flavour, sweeten that meat to the bone.""Fancy a taste anyone?",Winter's Bone
62,estebangonzalez10,A walk in the Ozarks,6,2 February 2011,"¨Never ask for what oughta be offered.¨ Winter's Bone is director's Debra Granik's only film that I have had a chance to watch (she also directed Down to the Bone, so I guess she must have something for bones), and I was really expecting much more from this picture considering it won the Grand Jury Award at Sundance and it has recently been nominated for four Oscar awards (Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Actress for Jennifer Lawrence, and Best Supporting Actor for John Hawkes) with which I only agree with the two acting nods. Without a doubt the highlight of this movie is Lawrence's breakthrough performance as Ree Dolly. She is great in this film, especially with all the non-verbal communication she conveys with her silence and facial expressions. She is one tough girl who hasn't been corrupted by the world in which she was raised and manages to take care of her mother and siblings and she's only 17. The other highlight of the film is John Hawkes performance as Ree's father's brother, Teardrop. He is excellent as a supporting character, but Lawrence is the true star of the film. The screenplay was adapted by Granik herself along with Anne Rossellini from Daniel Wodrell's 2006 novel of the same name and I have to say the pace of the film is rather slow. There is a real authenticity and reality to the film, and poverty is depicted in a very natural manner, but at the same time the movie moves along at a very sluggish pace.The story takes place in the Ozark Mountains, a very poor Southern rural area where all the locals seem to be involved with illegal drugs (cooking and consuming crystal meth to be more precise). Ree Dolly (Lawrence) is a 17 year old girl who has had to mature beyond her years and raise her two younger siblings on her own because her dad is constantly away from home due to troubles with the Law and her mom is mentally ill. Somehow Ree has managed to grow up strong and apart from this drug environment and manages to support her family. One day the town Sheriff (played by Garret Dillahunt) shows up bringing some more bad news for Ree. Her father has put their home as a guarantee to pay his bail and if he doesn't show up in court in two weeks they will lose their home. The problem is that her father hasn't showed up for a long time and no one seems to know his whereabouts or at least don't want to talk about it with Ree. She tells the Sheriff she will find him and sets this as her primary mission. She begins asking questions to several people from the area that were involved in the same crystal meth business her father was, but no one seems to help her. The name Thump Milton (Ronnie Hall) shows up, but she gets into trouble for trying to speak to him. Finally her father's brother, Teardrop (John Hawkes) decides to help her out after refusing to help at first. The problem is that there seems to be a code of silence between the people in the Ozarks and no one is willing to break it.Winter's Bone is not actually a mystery film, the main focus of the movie isn't really trying to find out where Ree's father is or what happened to him, the issue Granik is really trying to get at is portraying a real and authentic environment involving poverty and responsibilities a teenager shouldn't have to carry at such an early age. Ree's character is the center piece of the film and it is a wonder she turned out so strong in the midst of such a bad environment. She doesn't seem to belong with the rest of the people from the Ozarks and yet she is still willing to find enough courage to stand up against them and their code of ethics. Lawrence delivers a very strong performance and Hawkes is also a great supporting character as he has to confront himself with the fact of helping out his niece or keeping up with the code of silence he has always sworn too. None of the characters of the film are one dimensional, they are all real characters and Granik manages to stay away from stereotypes. Ree's neighbors offer help at some points and at others they turn their backs on her. Winter's Bone is well balanced, it is also beautifully filmed, but somehow I didn't think it was such a great film as many critics have pointed it out to be. For me the pace was too slow and the 100 minutes seemed an eternity. The movie still is a pleasant experience, it is good, but I just don't think it's great or Oscar worthy material for Best Picture. I would have preferred Affleck's The Town to have been nominated in this category, a much stronger film in my opinion.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",Winter's Bone

64,barnabyrudge,"Low-key, slow-burning noirish thriller with strong performances and powerful scenes.",7,27 October 2010,"Mainstream Hollywood of late seems to have gone down the route of big spectacular action films, broad mass-appeal comedies, sci-fi blockbusters and soulless remakes of older (and better) films. Those of us yearning for more low-key and character driven films – let's call them slow burners with a degree of artistry – must look to the indepedents for our kicks. Winter's Bone was one of the leading independent films of 2010. The critics showered it with accolades and awards, while small pockets of the public championed it as a understated masterpiece. I don't quite find it the amazing, life-changing experience that it has been hailed as in some quarters but on the whole I'd say Winter's Bone is a unique, original, well-made and frequently riveting ""country noir"".In the Ozark Mountains, the Dolly family – 17 year old Ree (Jennifer Lawrence), her younger brother and sister, and their mentally incapacitated mother – receive word that they may be about to lose their home. The absentee father, Jessop Dolly, has put up the family home as a bail bond to guarantee his appearance at a court hearing if he fails to turn up, the house will be taken from them. Ree desperately tries to locate her father but she is just a young girl treading through a close-knit community where men and elders call the shots, and the intrusions of a kid – a female at that – are not deemed acceptable. Aided by her edgy and dangerous uncle Teardrop (John Hawkes), Ree presses ahead with her search and enrages other members of the family who are determined to keep Jessop's affairs – and, indeed, his fate – a secret.Winter's Bone is perhaps most effective for its sense of authenticity – the ramshackle houses, the perpetually secretive and suspicious characters, the harsh living conditions and the extreme measures required to eke out an existence in the Ozarks, are all captured very convincingly. The scene where Ree teaches her younger siblings how to kill, skin and cook a squirrel would come across as gross and exploitative in most other films, but here it's done with a sense of detached matter-of-factness which beautifully complements the film's authenticity. The performances by the largely unknown cast are uniformly excellent, especially Lawrence as the resourceful girl who breaks every established code of her people to do what's best for her family. There are moments where the dialogue is rather unclear and others where the narrative builds to a head but then stubbornly refuses to provide a pay-off. However for most of its duration Winter's Bone is a very sure-footed and intriguing film which rises to some particularly memorable moments.",Winter's Bone
65,drownnnsoda,Atmospheric and raw,8,25 December 2018,"""Winter's Bone"" follows a teenage girl in rural Missouri who goes on a hunt for her missing father in order to save her home and care for her family. Her journey takes her through the inner circles of the dangerous, drug-addled backwoods Ozarks.Widely lauded when it premiered nearly a decade ago, ""Winter's Bone"" remains a raw and unflinching drama; the strength of the film, like many of these slice-of-life stories, rests on the performances, which are uniformly strong. A pre-fame, baby-faced Jennifer Lawrence carries the film on her shoulders as a headstrong young woman simply trying to survive; John Hawkes is alternately domineering and endearing as her brash uncle, while Dale Dickey turns in a performance that is borderline-terrifying; again, however, there is a humanity embedded in each of the characters that at times belies their hardened exteriors.The cinematography is phenomenal here; the winter gloom is laid on thick, and it adds an ominous touch to the downtrodden shacks and hollowed-out farmhouses that make up the bulk of the sets. In terms of pacing, the film does walk itself in circles in the first forty minutes, with Lawrence's character walking to and from various residences to no avail; while it rings authentic to real-life, it does grow redundant. However, it redeems itself as Lawrence's character finds herself in situations that ring increasingly dangerous to the audience-it's these moments that generate the most tension, leaving the viewer shuddering at her own chances of escaping.Overall, ""Winter's Bone"" is a strong, well-pieced-together backwoods take on film noir. While the pacing is ho-hum in the beginning, the films tightens as it progresses, growing leaner and meaner as it lurches toward a conclusion. Most importantly, the characters here feel real, and the sense of incipient danger is omnipresent. As someone who grew up in the Pacific Northwest, the types of characters Lawrence encounters recall real-life people I've encountered and known in off-the-grid towns forgotten in time. 8/10.",Winter's Bone
66,3xHCCH,"Worth to Watch, If Only For Jennifer Lawrence's Spectacular Debut",7,6 January 2011,"In ""Winter's Bone,"" director Debra Granik brings us to the Missouri Ozarks, where its hillbilly inhabitants have a culture of its own. For roughly and hour and a half, we get to live the desolate and violent world in the poverty-stricken part of America we foreigners do not really get to see. Ree Dolly is only 17 years old. However, she needs to grow up fast to take care of her two kid siblings and mentally disturbed mother, as their meth-cooking father disappears. However, Ree faces her toughest dilemma as their very home is threatened to be repossessed by the government if their father fails to show up for his trial. Ree's brave hunt for her father brings her (and us) deep into the Ozark underworld. Can she find her father in time to save their property, alive or maybe, dead?Jennifer Lawrence is a young new actress, and she successfully carries this movie on her tender shoulders. Everything about her is authentic and natural. Her scenes where Ree teaches her siblings about squirrel- gutting and shooting a rifle were so realistic. As for the supporting cast, we really cannot tell who among the other characters were actors as everybody looked like they came from there. It is as if we are watching a documentary about life in the Ozarks. The band was performing in the living room with the pristine voice of Marideth Sisco was very memorable.This is a movie I watched because of its Oscar buzz. This clearly is not for everybody. For those who take the time to watch it, you have to have the proper attitude and expectations. This is serious stuff and there is no definitely joking around. It is worth a watch, if only to witness the spectacular debut of Jennifer Lawrence, who seems to be on her way to earning an Oscar nomination for Best Actress.",Winter's Bone
67,jfgibson73,Star Making Performance,6,3 June 2011,"Winter's Bone is the story of a 17 year old girl who is taking care of her mother, raising her younger sister and brother, and doing so while living off the land. She is told that unless she can find her father, she is going to lose her house because he signed the deed over to his bail bond. We then follow her across the rural community as she investigates, trying to track down her father and maneuver through hostile backwoods locals.The setting was my favorite part of the movie. I remember winter looking a lot like this growing up in Michigan. It was easy to get confused because there were a lot of details that were only hinted at. We have to piece a lot together for ourselves as viewers. The people speak very plainly and play mountain songs, but it never feels too remote. The lead actress did a great job--if she doesn't become a star, she is at least getting a lot more work based on this performance. I wouldn't recommend this to many people, and I'm not sure I would ever watch it again, but I did enjoy it overall.",Winter's Bone
68,EUyeshima,"Lawrence Soars in a Haunting, Mirthless Regional Morality Tale",8,13 February 2011,"Having made a strong impression two years ago as Charlize Theron's younger guilt-ridden self in Guillermo Arriaga's ""The Burning Plain"", Jennifer Lawrence brings such a primal, haunting stillness to her performance that she singlehandedly transcends the dispirited tone of director/co-writer Debra Granik's small-scale regional 2010 film. At first, the movie, co-written by Granik and Anne Rosellini, appears to concern itself with the spartan existence of a dirt-poor family in the Missouri Ozarks, but it turns into a far more personal story of one girl's intractable dedication to her family and how she faces life-threatening challenges in keeping her family home together. This is much more a tale of survival than spiritual uplift because 17-year-old Ree Dolly has to care for her two younger siblings while contending with a near-catatonic mother and a meth-making father who has apparently disappeared.Even though she harbors dreams of entering the military to secure the $40,000 promised in the recruiting ads, Ree has to deal with the harsh reality that her father has put up their house as collateral for his bail. If he doesn't show up for a trial in a week's time, dead or alive, they will lose everything. She is determined to find his whereabouts from his criminal relatives and associates despite the fact that she gets the same constant warning to mind her own business or face the consequences. In fact, her stubbornness is at such odds with tribal ties and local customs that she faces revelations she could not possibly be prepared to handle. While Ree remains undaunted in her search for the truth, she also discovers how she cannot break entirely free of her surroundings.Just as she did with an unknown Vera Farmiga as a coke-addicted mother in 2004's ""Down to the Bone"", Granik extracts a sharply realistic, emotionally precise performance out of Lawrence. For example, when she listens to the soldier tell her to stay home to care for her family, she registers her character's resignation in a most economically searing manner. In smaller roles, John Hawkes etches a menacing presence as Teardrop, Ree's meth addict uncle who brutally warns her that her father may be dead, as does Dale Dickey as a plain-spoken woman who turns out to have more in common with Lady Macbeth. Michael McDonough's stark cinematography captures the bleakness of the rough, depressing terrain. The 2011 DVD/Blu-Ray includes a robust commentary track from Granik and McDonough, an informative 45-minute making-of feature, an alternate opening scene, and four deleted scenes.",Winter's Bone
69,Jonny_Numb,Winter's Boner,6,6 April 2011,"I use the latter part of my summary to refer to a blunder, not the favored slang of adolescent boys comparing themselves in the high-school john. After allowing the flood of 'Best of 2010' lists naming ""Winter's Bone"" within their rankings to subside, I finally sat down and watched the film to make my own determination. While the specter of hype stood in the back of my mind, I tried to assess as little predetermined expectation as possible. The result? A film with a generally unsympathetic heroine, some sporadically gripping moments (thanks in large part to the setting and cinematography), and a persistent ambiguity that frustrates rather than fascinates (the Coen Brothers pulled a similar stunt with ""No Country for Old Men,"" but their surface simplicity portended greater metaphors and meaning culled straight from Cormac McCarthy's source novel). While many have lauded ""Bone""'s unconventional Noir and pulp aspects (set in the Ozarks, the film is populated by tattooed hicks, corrupt policemen, and charred houses where crank labs once stood), the lack of any sort of narrative payoff turns the proceedings into a wild goose chase trying to convince viewers that it's the Real Deal.",Winter's Bone
70,raulfaust,part of me won't agree,4,18 December 2013,"Well, I start this review starting how much I disliked this film. Ree is an obnoxious girl that needs to find her father in order to not lose the house she lives in with her family. Although it could look simple, people her father are involved show to be some dangerous, making her road not that easy. I expected that some part of the movie we'd have some emotional scene, something provoking, something great, but we actually don't. Considering that Ree is pretty much unlikeable, it becomes hard to care about what will happen to her; she is just inexpressive towards other people, and with the lack of good scenes, spectator surely gets tired. Given that, I admit I couldn't make it to the end, but I watched enough of 90 minutes to express my disguise for this story. Photography is the only thing to appreciate in this poor flick. Maybe a better lead character could make some difference.",Winter's Bone
71,lewiskendell,There'd better be some Oscar nominations coming for this little gem.,8,14 November 2010,"SPOILER: ""But I can't forever carry them kids and my mom, not without that house.""Winter's Bone is a stark, almost documentary-like movie about a poor teenage girl named Ree in the Ozarks who supports her near-catatonic mother and two younger siblings during her meth-cooking father's many brushes with the law. When he disappears before a court date and the family's home is at risk if he doesn't show up, Ree (Jennifer Lawrence) investigates amongst the locals to find out where he might be. But, some people don't like the questions she's asking, and her life may be at risk, along with her family home. The plain, unobtrusive way that the camera observes events really helped draw me into the movie, to the point where I honestly forgot that I was watching a movie, at all. This effect was heightened by some excellent performances; especially from Jennifer Lawrence and John Hawkes (Teardrop). Lawrence had a star-making (and award worthy) performance, in my opinion. Ree is probably my favorite movie character of the year (well, perhaps next to Hit Girl), and Lawrence plays her with a realism and stubborn toughness that makes you believe that this seventeen year-old girl wouldn't wilt under the kind of circumstances that would overwhelm most adults. Her love for her family seems completely genuine, and there's never a word or a glance where she seems like she's ""acting"".  It's all very natural, and I was beyond impressed.The plot was quite tense and engrossing, as Ree pursues the mystery of where her father is with a dogged intensity, despite the fact that it leads her into some very dangerous (and violent) situations. The sparse, beautiful winter settings are a perfect backdrop for the story. It's been a while since I've seen a movie that does as good a job as this one in communicating a sense of place.Winter's Bone may not be for everyone, though. There are no shoot-outs or florid romantic scenes. The moments of happiness are small, fleeting, and poignant; like a gift of generosity from a neighbor who knows you're in need, or the quiet assurances of an older sister to her younger siblings. In Winter's Bone, our world is never in danger...but one family's certainly is. I liked the movie the first time around, enjoyed it even more the second, and heartily recommend it if you're interested.",Winter's Bone
72,begob,Tug him up,7,24 June 2015,"A daughter at the arse-end of capitalism must find her missing father to save the family.Real interesting film. Low key, but the pace is good with some lovely touches. Lots of great faces, especially the grim women, but the kids too and of course the lead actress. One great shot was of a baby tinkling on a bell as the bonds-man delivered his threats.You can read a lot into this about the viciousness of the neoliberal way, but the story is the main thing and I think it falls away in the end. There's great potential in the macabre ""tug him up"" scene, but the director pulls the punches. And the end is sentimental - playing it through to the brutal inevitability might be too much for the American dream.The sound effects are minimal, but when the music kicks in it's gorgeous - especially the early scene with the band in the house.Overall, interesting but just fails to satisfy.",Winter's Bone
73,bob-rutzel-1,Strong and Real,10,10 November 2010,"Ree (Lawrence) needs to find her father, who put up his house as collateral promising that he would show up for a court date otherwise she will lose the house and custody of her brother and sister.When I first saw the title I thought there isn't much to gnaw on with a Winter's Bone, and Ree doesn't have much choice but to find her father and there isn't much to go on. The normally friendly Ozark people have a secret they don't want exposed even if family are involved and they make it clear to Ree they won't help.There was a good mix of suspense and tension in here. I never knew what to expect from some of Ree's family members or friends. I truly expected them to help her, but...... The way this movie was produced and directed was like we were eavesdropping into the lives of these Ozark people. Nothing was overdone. No one stood out in an outrageous way. It was like..well, like really eavesdropping into something real. The cast were real pros. Ree lends credence to this as she fights an uphill battle to salvage her home and family. Her strong silent persistence is what drives this story. If you look into her eyes you can see she has no idea what to do next and that her house and siblings will be lost to her. Of course, Ree says as much at one point, but the eyes had it way before she said it. That is why Jennifer Lawrence is perfect in this role. Also, we feel more for her as her make-up artist made sure she looked better than all others in the cast. Hey, she is pretty and that's the way we want it. I was amazed by the singing of Merideth Sisco. Reminded me of another Susan Boyle. Very good. And, although minor characters, Ree's brother Sonny (Stone) and sister Ashlee (Thompson) were the perfect siblings full of love, with hope and trust in Ree, their performances went a long way to believability and caring in here. They were us hoping and trusting in Ree. Who says we can't be in movies?Lately, there seems to be a lot of movies and TV shows with the word bone(s) in the title. But, in here the Winter Bone is the key to making everything right for Ree and family. It's not a bone one should gnaw on. Can you guess?Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Yes, some F-bombs, not much",Winter's Bone
74,bandw,A look into a culture unfamiliar to most,8,16 January 2011,"This is the story of seventeen year old Ree who is living in the Ozarks of southern Missouri and trying to care for her two young siblings. It is not clear what Ree's mother suffers from, but severe depression would account for her behavior. Ree's father has been arrested for manufacturing meth and has posted bond by way of offering his farm as collateral. Most of the movie details Ree's odyssey in trying to find her father before the farm is repossessed, then she finds out he has skipped his court date and her search becomes desperate.Ree is living below the poverty line and, as portrayed, without the farm she will be homeless. She was getting no help from her supposed relatives in her search. In one scene she is taken into a barn and beaten and this makes the point rather dramatically. At first it was mysterious to me why Ree was being treated so terribly, but that is ultimately clarified when we find out about what her father had done.The hill country of the Ozarks can be quite beautiful, and that is contrasted with the austerity of Ree's family situation, since what is presented is rusted cars, mounds of used tires, ram-shackled homes, and dilapidated barns. It is a refreshing change of pace to set a story in the Missouri Ozarks, but the presentation is on the bleak side.This is an interesting study of a clannish rural society where the social network is more efficient than Facebook, the drug culture is as prevalent as in any large city, and getting by from day-to-day is a constant struggle. In the face of this, Ree's perseverance and love for her immediate family are heartening.I thought the actors were all quite good, including the kids. Many of the actors are locals. A sense of fear and anxiety hangs over the proceedings, and the actors convey this with skill. The movie kept my attention.The director's commentary on the DVD is of the type, ""It was hot the day we shot this,"" or, ""The room was so small that it was hard to get a camera in there,"" and so forth. I find such commentaries self indulgent; they offer no additional insights into the characters or the story, or even what the director's intents were vis-a-vis the story.I wound up reading the book and it clarified some things for me, like why the women relented at the end and led Ree to her father--they were taking heat for the beating they had given her. I think the scenes in the movie that deviated from the book were a detraction, like the scene with the musical group or Ree's pursuit of Thump in the stock auction site.",Winter's Bone

She meets however a very hostile reception from them all since they are all involved in the drug traffic and want her out of their business. This results in several severe psychological and even physical confrontations that hurt her a lot.

77,intelearts,My 386th Review: Impossibly brilliant - and important cinema,10,18 March 2011,"Winter's Bone is more than simply a memorable or evocative film. It is truly, for this reviewer, the best film of the year - and one of the best of the past ten years. It is simply beautiful cinema at its best - from the silences to the uncompromising willingness to invade and live its world, to faultless, and nearly unnoticeable direction, and to the performances, I can't remember any recent film that got to my soul the way this did - stark, strong, unforgiving and unforgettable, and yet so simple.The plot of a young girl looking for her father is mythical, but the piece is more than plot or character, though both are some of the strongest in recent memory. The approach of the film as a whole is so ordinary as to be extraordinary - one feels the cold, the wind, the gray.For this reviewer it redefines as Silence of the Lambs did, and as the Deer Hunter before it, what American cinema at its absolute best can be about - there is in all three a true attempt to say everything is not as it could be - and Winter's Bone is not a slice of contemporary social commentary - it''s a slice of something far deeper. It achieves the sort of honesty that the best of cinema can and is relenting in that honest approach and clearly a better film for it - a wonderful, mesmerizing and powerful experience in its simplicity.",Winter's Bone

The premises is really simple but what makes it complicated and intriguing was the Flawless performance of Jennifer Lawrence and incredible dept of director how he unfolds the story plus introduction of all characters who have something to do with Jennifer's father's life was really interesting. I think its really fascinating to see a movie which seems like plain drama from promos and its premises but actually is a heart hitting hardcore revelation, no one wants to See sometimes. Jennifer Lawrence is defiantly going to get an Oscar Nod, so far she is the only Best Actress contender around (I yet have to see Carey mulligan and Keira Knightley in Never Let me Go) her portrayal is flawless and makes the movie realistic and believable to its core.

81,oneguyrambling,"Definitely not the most entertaining film of 2010, but perhaps the best.",8,8 June 2011,"Even countries that are referred to as ""Developed"" and ""First World"" have areas where times always seem tough.In Winter's Bone this place is the state of Missouri in America. The action takes us to various homes and it would be fair to say that even the ""less needy"" aren't exactly living in the lap of luxury. The homes are cluttered and messy, the structures makeshift and flawed, and the diet consists of whatever can be scrubbed up at short notice – one scene featuring a squirrel hunt and the subsequent preparation of same left me squirming a little.One of the more down and out families in the area are the Dolly clan. With the father absent and the mother uninvolved, the responsibility of looking after Ma and siblings aged 12 and 6 falls solely on the shoulders of eldest Ree (Jennifer Lawrence), only 17 herself.This all sounds hard enough already, Ree cannot find work, has no money and no car, and the only pot of gold at the end of the rainbow appears to be joining the army and getting an up front lump sum, but that would entail leaving her brother and sister to fend for themselves. Not an option.But bad can always become worse, as Ree is informed when she learns her bond jumping Dad has put the family home up for assurity that he will show for his hearing – a hearing that looms in only days. Ree is told to expect that a no-show means they will lose the house within weeks.Ree might be only 17 and thrust into maturity when most 17 years old girls are singing Hannah Montana songs into their toothbrushes, but she is made of different stuff.Ree proclaims that she will find her Dad and make sure he is at the trial.With Ma having a total mental shutdown for reasons not explained, various neighbours and friends being no help, and Uncle Teardrop basically telling Ree to leave it alone, she moves on to other friends and associates of her father to pick up the trail.Now it needs to be said that Mr Dolly was a man who made methamphetamines to make a buck, that was what he was arrested for. (It turns out that this is apparently an oft-chosen occupation in Missouri as the drugs can be made cheaply with various easily sourced materials.) Looking for a known drug producer of course leads Ree to other known drug producers, people who are understandably protective of their own interests and not too eager to divulge details and fine print to a teenage girl, some with forceful warnings – an early one being ""I said shut up once with my mouth."" Read into that for yourself to get an idea of how the second message might be delivered.But the dogged and determined Ree pursues her missing father, driven by desperation – and the fact that there seems no other possible alternative.She comes across various equally beaten down looking, scruffy and dangerous people, most of who she is apparently related to in some way.Everyone she speaks to says the same two things, informing Ree that they don't know her Father's whereabouts and that she should assume he is dead, give it up and go home.After an exhaustive day's search on foot across an unforgiving territory dealing with inhospitable people – Ree tells the local police that she is positive that her Father is dead and that he can't possibly attend the hearing. The response: provide either your father or proof of his death or you lose the house in about a week.++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ There aren't too many events in Winter's Bone that could be described as twists or surprises as the story unfolds gradually and deliberately.The film would likely have been still solid with other actors as Ree, but Jennifer Lawrence is amazing in a pretty dark and thankless role. Her face is at once a picture of both resignation and determination. There are scenes where she vainly tries to show her 12 and 6 year old siblings just how to fend for themselves while knowing full well that they are not of an age or maturity to handle such tasks. (It must be said that John Hawkes as Teardrop is excellent too.) It is this inevitability that drives her into areas and across the paths of those that police and grown tough guys wouldn't dare disturb, Ree sees no other alternative and rather than simply fold and allow her and her family to give up all hope she puts herself in grave danger knowing full well that any false step or poorly chosen word will see the end of her and family alike.Winter's Bone is a gritty, bleak drama in the same vein as Undertow and Shotgun stories. I liked both of those films and thought them both excellent, but it is the unenviable situation that Ree faces and the actions she takes to protect her family – all fueled by the performance of Jennifer Lawrence – that make Winter's Bone a better film than the other two.Final Rating – 8.5 / 10.

Some of them engage in behavior which would make the upper-crust of mainstream America cringe, but they don't snitch on each other because this would be considered disloyal to their community. This self-contained bubble is the setting of ""Winter's Bone"".Ree Dolly (Jennifer Lawrence in her first acclaimed performance prior to the ""Hunger Games"") is a 17-year-old forced by circumstance to be the care-giver of her siblings, 12-year-old Sonny and 6-year-old of Ashlee. Ree Dolly has to be parent, head-of-household and bread-winner for her family. Their mother is sick in the head, unable to deal with family problems, and their father Jessup is long-gone. He's been accused of being a methamphetamine (""crystal meth"") ""cooker"", and he put up the family's small log cabin as bond collateral after he was arrested, and he has a pending court date. The trouble is, no one knows where he is, and the family could lose the house if he doesn't appear in court.On top of her other duties as the current head-of-household of her family, Ree has to find the whereabouts of her father. She then goes around her ""neighbors"" who know her family, some of them part of meth production and dealing, asking what happened to her father. These members of this community, if community it can be called, are all tight-lipped about her father, all claiming they either don't know what happened to him or they know and yet have no intention of letting her or anyone else know the fate of her father.The only adult member of her extended family who is functioning reasonably well is her uncle Teardrop, her father's brother. We get the sense that he also may have cooked meth. He makes up a story about what happened to him with some physical evidence, but she doesn't buy it. Early in the film, Ree Dolly tried to speak with the ""godfather"" of the locals, Thump Milton (Ronnie Hall), who probably oversees much of the meth production and dealing, but she's turned away. Then she realizes she may have crossed some kind of unknown line when she returns to the Milton residence only to be taken into their barn by force.This is quite an interesting yet not exactly entertaining film. Jennifer Lawrence shows early on why she became an A-list actress with an Academy-Award nominated performance. The story is entirely from her point of view, and her acting is as compelling as the natural landscape. Aside from the grim but compelling storyline, one aspect should be celebrated: this film has some of the most amazing shots of the Ozarks region I've ever seen in a narrative film, probably the best since ""Deliverance"" which takes place in the neighboring Appalachians. The broken-down cars and unkempt houses are certainly not sites for sore eyes, however, the landscapes of trees and foothills, especially during the twilight hours when a soft mist coats the scenery are breath-taking. Maybe the point of the story, which is not exactly touchy-feely, is that these people live in a beautiful part of America and yet live very dark and shabby lives. If their lives could improve and be closer to the beauty which surrounds them, maybe their lives could be more beautiful too.",Winter's Bone
86,marcin_kukuczka,Tough Human Drama,7,2 December 2012,"""I can't think of another film in recent memory that doesn't sexualize women for one moment in the whole film"" (John Hawkes).A 17 year old protagonist would rather make us expect a 'stereotypical' coming-of-age drama with more pretentious moments being evoked than hardship and inner struggles being imposed (a sort of tricky 'catch me if you can' approach). More to say, such a clichéd drama would indicate lots of euphemisms of hard reality making human emotions less authentic and more 'conventional.' However, Debra Granik with Anne Rosellini (DOWN TO THE BONE with Vera Farmiga) achieved something in WINTER'S BONE that cannot meet any 'conventional, predictable expectations' condensed to teenagers identifying with the heroes/heroines and parents being at odds with all that stuff. Granik's movie is a tough drama on the verge of hypnotic naturalism where you are surely not 'deluded' but realize people have real feelings. No wonder this quite specific production won great acclaim among both the open minded audiences and the pretentious critics.The lead role powerfully crafted by 19 year-old Jennifer Lawrence deserves full credit. Actually, she makes for the movie in considerable part because her character is vividly captivating: a young girl, Ree Dolly, left alone deep within the Ozark Mountains of Missouri, in a hotbed, begins a desperate search for her father. Her presence among ghostly removed characters is not the necessity but her decision derived from her maturity (almost heroic). She stays where she grew up though her father did not occur to be responsible enough to be caring for safety and stability. Being actually the only breadwinner of the family (two siblings and a mentally disabled mother), Ree experiences a tough lesson of hardship, indifference and cruelty. Her family in in basic need for existence and a place of living...it remains all up to her if they are thrown out or not. But to find her father, it seems she will have to enter a hotbed. Will she occur determined enough? Her neighborhood and surroundings seem to hate her because Ree is surely not one of them as she would surely subvert their established order. But let me now dare try a more in depth analysis of Ms Lawrence's performance.Jennifer Lawrence actually shocks us from the very beginning bringing out something new from the character like hers, not locking ourselves within her inner world entirely but revealing certain aspects in realistic locations of situations. Roger Ebert in his review on the movie said quintessential words about her performance: ""the movie heroes who affect me most are not extroverted (...) but they are ordinary people who are faced with a need and rise to the occasion. Ree Dolly is such a hero."" Hunting for her father in the most unpredictable situations and still counting on the people around (although they disappoint her and some of them hurt her) embody a character that easily leads to tremendously thought provoking viewing experience. The most powerful scene, perhaps, apart from the finale when she concludes her desires within the very existence, is her talk with a sergeant. Bruised, she avoids the temptation of leading herself towards selfish ways... In encountering other characters, excluding her friend, she represents the genuine, intact, humane struggle within the inner self while those people represent the decadent, corrupted, almost post-humane physical laziness and total spiritual immobility.The landscape and the camera-work mysteriously correspond to those dramatic undertones and memorably affect viewers' perceptions. Unlike the America we see elsewhere... Sukhdev Sandhu rightly observes that ""this 'inland empire' is a psychological place as much as it is a physical place"" (2010). Apart from the landscape filled with intense melancholy, the lifestyle of the people she meets on her way, the people who are her (almost) kins of blood ties but strangers in spirit (the Guardian reviewer Peter Bradshaw interestingly refers to this aspect as 'intramural wrangling of one gigantic dysfunctional family') is something absorbing. Most people resort to violence not to spill the beans about the secrets combined with their illegal activities. As the leader of 'their ways' stands Little Arthur (Kevin Breznahan) - ""a brooding figure of malevolent power"" (Peter Bradshaw).Yet, there is an intriguing supporting character, both like and unlike others - Ree's uncle Teardrop played by John Hawkes. He is a highly neurotic character, furious and eccentric. Surely, Teardrop is a secret himself. Roger Ebert meaningfully describes him as ""aggressive with his hatefulness instead of passive in amorality."" Is he a likable character, after all? John Hawkes said in an interview that ""she (Debra Granik) wanted Teardrop to be someone who wasn't just a cliché kind of criminal guy. I think she wanted some depth in the character and some different levels."" As a result, we get something truly desirable from the psychological point of view. We get a range of different features within him and do not label him as either a 'villain' or a 'goodie' The character develops in the long run. Such furious characters are, after all, more easily identified with than cold, indifferent puppets. The thrilling but ridiculous sequences of the moonlit lake excursion and a chainsaw that serves as Ree Dolly's tool to dig up the secret burial (on the verge of laughable product of modern horrors) is not something to deserve praise. It actually reduces the film's value being an artificially imposed noir genre element. Reminds me a little bit of some shots from Charles Laughton's THE NIGHT OF THE HUNTER. But anyway...WINTER'S BONE is surely a production that hits the right note for modern aims of cinema. If films are to survive as genuine means of addressing real people, it ought to flee from artificial glamor of robot effects and rather offer naturalism of that kind. Moody, realistic, shocking, memorable, creative, far from pompous are some adjectives that can best describe this movie. A human being and her behavior in the most unpredictable, tough situations. Human drama!",Winter's Bone
87,MrGKB,Possibly the best film I've seen this year...,9,5 September 2011,"...and certainly more than worthy of its Oscar nominations and multiple awards elsewhere, ""Winter's Bone"" is propelled by confident, nuanced direction by Debra ""Down to the Bone"" Granik, a tight, almost noir-ish screenplay by Ms. Granik and collaborator/producer, Anne ""ditto"" Rosellini (adapted from the novel by Daniel Woodrell), and a gorgeous breakout performance by Jennifer ""X-Men: First Class"" Lawrence, along with equally outstanding support from the likes of John ""Deadwood"" Hawkes (who copped an Oscar nomination along with Lawrence), Dale ""My Name is Earl"" Dickey, Sheryl ""Twin Peaks"" Lee, and Garret ""The Road"" Dillahunt. Even the numerous ""amateur"" actors involved are of a piece, including the two kids.I won't belabor the plot, which others have synopsized on these pages, but in a nutshell, ""Winter's Bone"" is the story of a young girl struggling as surrogate mother to younger siblings in order to keep family together by getting at the truth of her meth-dealing father's disappearance. At times almost lackadaisical in its pace, and then heart-wrenching in its sometimes simmering, sometimes violent confrontations, it's a tale of personal courage and perseverance writ small. The photography by Granik collaborator, Michael ""Quid Pro Quo"" McDonough, limns the Ozark setting for all it's worth while capturing every telling subtlety of the actors, while Dickon ""Cold Souls"" Hinchliffe's score supports the emotional tone of the film to a tee.That this film was put together for a mere $2mil should absolutely shame productions that have accomplished so much less with so much more. ""Winter's Bone"" is film-making with heart and soul and guts and artistry, something that can only rarely be ascribed to typical Hollywood fare. I look forward to further work by Mss. Granik and Rosellini, along with Ms. Lawrence (I already enjoy the heck out of Mr. Hawkes, one of the finest character actors working today), and am also motivated to track down the source novel, which I suspect is a fine read.""Winter's Bone"" is a near pitch-perfect film. Were I to pick fault with it at all, I'd note that the kids are perhaps a bit too adorable (and clean), and the same might be said of some of the adults (their teeth are too wholesome for crank freaks and the down-home poor). But these would be mere nitpicks, and are in no way meant to detract from what's there on the screen. It's not a happy movie, although it does finish on an upbeat, but it's so quietly powerful that you can't help but be drawn into it. Highly recommended.5.1.12 edit: I finally tracked the source novel down; it is, as I suspected, an excellent read. The film does it great justice, and the only alteration in the film was making Ree's youngest sibling a little girl. Highly recommended as well.",Winter's Bone
88,vitaleralphlouis,"A Sanity-Check after suffering through ""Inviction""",9,22 August 2010,"Winter's Bone is an absorbing, suspenseful movie that's unlike anything you've ever seen before, or anything like anything you'll see again. The suspense is natural - never contrived - and the acting, cinematography, and music is perfection.Contrary to other writers, ""Winter's Bone"" is absolutely not - in any way at all - like ""Deliverance"" and I can't see how anybody who watched this movie with their eyes open would compare the two films.I won't recount the story at all, but would like to comment on the ""poverty"" factor. The family centered in the story is desperate for money because of the father's prolonged absence, not because poverty is normal to them. The conditions of these alleged Ozark hillbillies are pure Poverty American Style. They dress well (mostly in denim, as in my neighborhood and yours), they have houses, motor vehicles, musical instruments, trampolines, water beds, et cetera. The real poverty lies with the addiction to crystal meth. In that, the poverty is the same in New York's Upper East Side or in the Ozarks. Addiction is a fast slide to misery and early death.Southern people need to know there is nothing in this movie that puts them down or portrays them in a negative light, compared to others.A special note about music: A delight to hear ""Father, Alone"" ""Fair and Tender Ladies"" and many other great songs; as a natural part of life.",Winter's Bone
89,JvH48,"Perfect casting, depressing ways of living on the border of the law",8,27 October 2010,"The story is situated in a settler-like environment, with people living in DIY homes in depressing circumstances, all of them struggling to survive on the border of the law and on a near-zero standard of living. The quest to find a father who has bonded the house the family lives in, is what carries the story from beginning to end. His 17-year old daughter is the main character who knocks on a lot of doors, without finding much cooperation (to say the least). She is sent away many times, and even molested when her knocks are deemed too persistent.I must applaud the casting and the performances of the various roles in this film. Though having no knowledge of environments like these, being far from my experience, the film shows a strong appearance of being authentic and believable throughout. Apart from her quest, the elder daughter teaches her younger family members what they need to know to survive in this world, like shooting animals in the wood, skinning these and preparing food from the materials at hand. Their invalid mother who lives in the same house, seems far off this world and is no help at all.The relationships with neighbors and relatives are remote, and few of them are eager to offer some help in the quest. Survival of the fittest is the name of the game, and in this respect they are all competitors. Nevertheless, some surprising turns in the story come from the fact that even natural enemies sometimes have mutual interests. It may relieve part of the depressing aspects of this film, and leaves some hope for the future of mankind.I cannot place myself in the footsteps of any of the story characters, but it did not keep me from getting entangled in the flow of events. I am sure that the casting and the performance of the players has contributed a lot to my positive experience.",Winter's Bone
90,Benjamin-M-Weilert,An unflinching look at the effects of rural poverty.,8,14 March 2020,"It feels like so few films deal with the actual consequences of poverty. It's probably why Winter's Bone (2010) seems like a raw and unflinching examination of what happens when a family is on the edge of homelessness. In fact, while I'm sure there are some inaccuracies, I almost saw this film as a documentary of life in rural Missouri. The handheld camera style was intimate and present as it followed Jennifer Lawrence in one of her breakout roles, investigating where her father disappeared to in order to save her struggling family.I didn't understand why so much of the community around Lawrence's character didn't come to help and support her in a time of need. Sure, her father did some pretty terrible things, but why punish his family because of it? Perhaps this is just an aspect of the dog-eat-dog world of rural poverty that seems so illogical to me. In the end, they eventually came around, but not without plenty of trouble for the teenage girl just trying to find her deadbeat dad. The amount of courage and fortitude that this young woman had to keep her family afloat speaks volumes about her character.Because there was this realism in the way Winter's Bone was filmed, the violence felt much more visceral than in some gory action or horror flick. Even the scene at the lake seemed excessive, even if nothing was shown on camera. What made it more impactful was that none of the violence was necessarily gratuitous (with perhaps the lake scene being an outlier). It was all there for a reason, even if that reason was that people are terrible to each other. Still, this gripping film deserves a watch, if for no other reason than Jennifer Lawrence's superb performance.An unflinching look at the effects of rural poverty, I give Winter's Bone 4.0 stars out of 5.",Winter's Bone
91,ajs-10,An excellent performance from Jennifer Lawrence is the highlight of the excellent movie!,8,26 August 2011,"I have been looking forward to seeing this film for about a year now. So many good things have been said about it and I wanted to see for myself what all the fuss was about. Of course it didn't play at my local cinema, and it only had a very limited showing at the nearest multiplex at a time that wasn't convenient for me (of course). And so a year later it finally airs on TV and, at last, I get to see this much anticipated film. I don't think the wait helped, it meant that, little by little, small details about the plot came to my ear and this, ultimately, affected my enjoyment of it. But more of that later, here's a brief summary first.Ree Dolly lives in the Ozark Mountains with her younger brother, Sonny, her younger sister, Ashlee and her sick mother. Her father, Jessop, has been gone for some time, and so it's up to the 17 year old Ree to hold the family together. One day the Sheriff turns up and tells Ree that her father has been arrested, but has posted bail. As part of the bond he has put up their house and their land. She has about a week to find him before he's due to appear in court. Ree sets off to talk to the close-knit community but gets short shrift at every turn. Even Jessop's brother, Teardrop, refuses to help her, but Ree is determined and continues looking. Nobody is prepared to step forward and Ree ends up pushing to too far, so far in fact that she puts her own live in danger. But she has an unexpected ally Of course, I would not be thanked for continuing at this point, so I'll leave it here. The Spoiler Police have already been making inquiries in the area and I don't want them to find me.The picture deliberately has a very stark look to it and this adds to the bleakness of both the surroundings and the situation Ree finds herself in. I also like the music chosen for the film, some traditional Ozark songs fit the mood perfectly. The film is notable for a tremendous performance from Jennifer Lawrence as Ree, I thought she was outstanding. Also worthy of note was John Hawkes as Teardrop; I thought he put in a good turn too. Lauren Sweetser was good as Ree's friend Gail and the children, Isaiah Stone as Sonny and Ashlee Thompson as Ashlee were also very good. Finally, honourable mentions go to both Dale Dickey as Merab and Garret Dillahunt as Sheriff Baskin.The plot has quite a slow pace and it is very much a character driven piece, so it may not be to everyone's taste. I enjoyed it, although it did lose me a little towards the middle; having said that it's well worth sticking with. There are a couple of scenes that some people may find a bit disturbing, but, I'm told, these things really go on. It's quite a serious film, addressing some very dark issues, but one I found ultimately did deliver. The performance from Jennifer Lawrence is what holds it together and I must admit to being enthralled by it Definitely recommended.My Score: 8.4/10.IMDb Score: 7.3/10 (based on 32,855 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes Score: 94/100 (based on 158 reviews counted at the time of going to press).",Winter's Bone
92,itamarscomix,Painful and haunting,8,14 January 2012,"A very good film by all accounts. Winter's Bone doesn't have much in novelty value - the story is very simple and it's been played out before, nor does the film benefit much form simplicity. What it does benefit from is from an incredible sense of realism, a chilling atmosphere aided by fantastic acting - Jennifer Lawrence is terrific, but more impressive are the 'villain' characters, who are very realistic and thus extremely scary.Whether or not Winter's Bone deserves the unprecedented Oscar nomination more than hundreds of other indie films released every year that are equally good or better, is a question of opinion of course. Whether it did the film any good is hard to say, because while every critic in the world praised it as one, it received some pretty severe hype backlash from the viewers (myself included) who were expecting more. It might be a positive precedent for independent films in the Oscars though, as well as an opening for a promising career for director Debra Granik.",Winter's Bone

I mean, I thought it was a good film, but nearly as great as other critics made it out to seem. Instead of being a great movie, it's a good movie with great parts.Oscar nominee Jennifer Lawrence (well deserved) is Ree, a teen who sets off to find her fugitive father because if she doesn't, they are going to stop paying the bills on their very small home in the Ozarks.Lawrence does well, very well. So does the actor who plays her uncle( I forgot his name). I think Winter's bone is a good movie. It's interesting, and well acted, but to me, its not quite up there with the years best.I mean, compared to something like Inception or Black Swan, it doesn't quite belong on that list. I think the actors nominated deserve their nominations, but as for anything else, I would've chosen such as the underrated dramedy Solitary man, or Splice, or even Harry Potter and the deathly hallows to go up there.

This is a serious movie that will not tolerate half-hearted performances or celebrity actors just for the sake of having a high profile star attached to draw a crowd. Jennifer Lawrence really is incredible in her role as the main protagonist. She deserves all the accolades she received for this role.The story is deep and is well thought out. It feels authentic which allows you to be invested with the characters journey. This is a difficult ask for many other films but Winter's Bone does this successfully.If you are yet to watch this movie then I cannot recommend it enough.

I would say it was his best part.The movie comes to you. He catches you and will not let you go. It's one of those movies that you believe it all.The picture you have is great.

99,Eumenides_0,Great Performances In Intelligent Thriller About Family,9,25 February 2011,"From the Ozarks comes the story of Ree Dolly (Jennifer Lawrence), a tough seventeen-year-old girl looking for her missing father amidst an impoverished community, in a grey cloud-covered landscape littered with debris and garbage and populated with meth heads. The people standing in her way? Her drug-dealing family.Ree takes care of two siblings and a mother with mental problems. She cooks, she washes, she chops wood, she shoots squirrels for food. Life is hard but at least she has a house. But Jessup, her father, is due in court and he signed away his house and property to get out on bail and if he doesn't show up Ree and her family lose everything. When one of the most talked about movies of the year is about a frivolous ballerina going desperate because she can't dance perfectly, here's a movie that dares to tell a tale of true despair.Ree starts investigating, asking her relatives if they've seen or know where Jessup is, but she only receives indifference, warnings and intimidation. Ree, who knows her family is mixed up in drugs, is getting involved in matters that women in her community shouldn't talk about. Furthermore Jessup's secret whereabouts hides a deeper secret that could harm her relatives. Here family matters nothing when staying out of jail is at stake.Winter's Bone, efficiently directed by Debra Granik and co-written with Anne Rossellini, is an engrossing, suspenseful thriller which rewards viewers looking for an intelligent screenplay and great acting.Let's begin with the acting, whose laurels must be divided between Lawrence and John Hawkes, who plays the frightening and ambiguous uncle Teardrop. Lawrence not only captures the emotional core of a young woman who had to learn to survive alone at an early age, she also trained for the physical aspect of her performance. For this role she learned to chop wood and skin squirrels. The latter is graphically shown in the movie. This self-reliance shows in her stubbornness, determination and inability to heed warnings for her own good. The moment she sets out to find her father she doesn't give up. Although physically unimposing, Lawrence transmits independence and confidence. She gets beaten down, but she always gets back up with renewed resolve.Hawkes, whose only fault is that he should have had more screen time, is just as good in a subtler role. A meth head, he looks like a human scarecrow, thin and frail. And yet he transmits fear to everyone around him. Teardrop is a fascinating character, more so than Ree. When Ree goes to him, he tells her to quit searching and says he won't go around asking questions. She insists only for him to nearly choke her. You never know where he stands or what he'll do. Ree, complex as she may be, remains the same, but Teardrop experiences a slow change as he's drawn into her investigation.The characters speak sparingly. The bleakness around them pared down their speech to the bare essentials. The rest is communicated through body language and facial expressions. Although the screenplay is good in the dialogue that fleshes out their personalities, it is excellent for what remains unsaid, for what is transmitted through subtext. Teardrop's last scene with Ree, for instance, is a final farewell between the two, although it's never spelled out. Ree's siblings are present and they can't understand it. But the viewer who has been paying attention will guess Teardrop's fate.In the movie attention is given to the role of women, family ties and the power of rumours. Let's consider the scene when Ree talks with a sheriff. At this point her dad is missing and she and her family have little to feed on. Her neighbours are aware that she's hungry, but she's too proud to ask for help. ""Never ask for what ought to be offered,"" she tells her brother. Then the law arrives. Ree keeps mum. The neighbours get nervous. The sheriff leaves. Later a neighbour comes in with a box of food. There are no good intentions in this movie, though: this visit is just an opportunity to suss out what the sheriff wanted and to remind Ree to keep her mouth shut. She's rewarded for her good behaviour.Ree knows her family is full of criminals but doesn't condemn them – it's the world she lives in. Other options are few. Her friend, Gail (Laureen Sweetser), married and with a baby, is Ree's opposite – dependent on her husband, forced to ask him permission to do everything. Ree can also join the army, tough as she is, but her family needs her. And that's it for options.Ree's loose family is not like other cinematic crime families. These are not the Corleone. In this year's Animal Kingdom a criminal is murdered by the police and his brothers immediately retaliate. Here there's no rush or senseless bravado. Jessup is missing within a closed community. There are no mysteries; everyone knows, they just chose to ignore it. Ree breaks a social norm by sticking her nose in these affairs. She gets people talking, spreading rumours. In a community where people talk only when necessary, people don't like stories running around.Winter's Bone is a rare thriller. Family relationships prevail over pointless action. When Granik shows violence it serves to reveal the characters' personalities. Granik's camera is sober and unflinching in its portrayal of human ferocity and cruelty. For most of the movie, however, Granik's style is invisible. She doesn't show off. She has a precision similar to Clint Eastwood's. Her presence is mostly felt in the atmosphere of tension and dread that accompanies Ree in her journey. The rest is just brilliant actors working in tandem with one of the best screenplays of the year. The result is an excellent movie which, with a meagre budget of $2 million, puts to shame most of the big Hollywood productions competing against it for the Oscars.",Winter's Bone
100,doctorsmoothlove,Winter's Tail,4,14 August 2010,"Twice times have I entered the cinema as of late to see films that have attempted to recreate a believable situation out of ordinary characters. Neither of them is ""good"" in the encompassing ideal of that word. I was at least able to tolerate Winter's Bone. It will be the subject of this piece, as I disliked the other one too much to discuss it now.The film follows a 17-year old girl who lives in the Ozarks, which is an area of the United States that appears to have not aged since the early twentieth century. People live in decaying homes and drive worn-out vehicles. They hunt for food and still abide by primitive gender roles. This frustrates the efforts of the protagonist, Ree Dolly, who has to provide for her two younger siblings and ill mother. Her father has vanished. Ree is notified by a state agent that her father has been arrested and placed the family home as collateral for his bail. Ree must find him or lose her home.One is mistaken for thinking this film is a thriller or action-mystery. Instead, Ree doesn't really ""look"" for her father. Sure, she asks her neighbors for his whereabouts, but she cannot simply leave her family. Kudos for realism at the expense of forcing a film to go in a direction its story isn't able to support. And if not being able to look for him wasn't enough, she is beaten for investigating further. Apparently, the locals produce methamphetamine to supplement their incomes. Her father was involved and was killed for some reason. They threw his body in a river and eventually assist Ree (after she is beaten) in cutting his arms off with a chainsaw to prove to that he has actually died.The movie was filmed on location and employed many local actors. It is an attempt to give the impression that this story is more powerful than it really is. The film succeeds in creating a dark, hopeless atmosphere, like the Coen Brothers do in their gritty films. Unlike them, however, we are unlikely to think that what we are experiencing is a cinematic film. It's like watching a documentary of poverty in a place, and had I known that before I saw it, I would have enjoyed it. I was instead placed into a depressing film for 100 minutes that is too sure of its own seriousness to care whether I was having a good time.Not Recommended.",Winter's Bone

The film is also very strong from a dramatic point of view: Ree's determination to stand up against the most powerful individuals in her community in order to save her family, takes your breath away. But the most impressive feature of this film is the way it captures the harsh life in the Ozark mountains. The chained dogs, the pick-up-trucks, the rugged faces, the wooden cabins; it all contributes to an atmosphere of impending doom. I think it's hardly possible to go and see Winter's Bone without being very impressed afterward.",Winter's Bone
102,christophe92300,Dull,4,7 February 2013,"In the same vein as Frozen River, Winter's Bone tackles the theme of the rural America struggling with problems such as poverty or drugs.The sincerity of the approach is laudable but the script clearly lacks substance, which translates into a stretched, and ultimately rather boring plot even when the movie only lasts a little more than an 1h30. This sense of slowness and heaviness is emphasized by flat and dull scenes that flow together in a total linearity. The dialogues are wheezy and though what is at stake seems important on paper, it is little touching due to, amongst others, cold characters like the climate of Missouri.As for the actors, they are average for the most part, and Jennifer Lawrence's performance is not even close to the raving critics she got.",Winter's Bone

To my amazement, Winter's Bone brought almost a documentary with similar contents. This prompted me to do some desktop research which, in turn, revealed a world of methamphetamine labs in idyllic landscapes of rural parts of central US. What i attributed to the exaggeration of one musician's storytelling turned out to be a harsh reality for a lot of people.Winter's Bone catapulted Jennifer Lawrence to world fame.

There is definitely a lot to love here - Lawrence gives a phenomenal performance, and Granik is so effective in conveying atmosphere and culture in each scene. She reminds me of Lynne Ramsay, another great director, in their minimal dialogue and intent, close-up focus on specific character actions which convey something about the character and often a larger theme. The cinematography is excellent, and the script is very good, conveying with its blank spaces and clipped dialogue the extreme poverty Ree lives in. Throughout the movie, we get a clear, unwavering sense of what her life is like and feel the atmosphere of the film. Despite these technical achievements, I walked away from Winter's Bone a bit dissatisfied, thinking ""is that it?"" The plot was super straightforward and I felt like we knew what had happened by the midpoint of the movie or earlier. Nothing really developed or changed throughout the movie - the closest to a climax there was was on the boat, which was intense but didn't feel definitive, nor did the bond payment feel like a victory. Each scene was well done, but without an effective arc to the story, I was left feeling immersed in a consistently good slice of life movie that didn't really go anywhere. This isn't to say I didn't enjoy it - well-done scenes are always fun to watch, but the lack of a real payoff at the end or a change in the emotional weight of the movie kept me from being truly satisfied.",Winter's Bone

The scenery and characters are authentic – but this only takes it so far.

Also if the movie dares not to have exploding cars and alley kills or cartoon animals trying to make hip statements then it is consigned to the bottomless last ring of hell art house category which is sure to be it's death-knell and you can guess where Winter's Bones was placed.Enough of these wannabe film critics; the movie was as good as the professional critics said it was. I was surprised that America had the nerve to make a movie that dared to lift the carpet to see the muck that was lying there, covered but obvious to any person not blinded by the mythology of a ""rich"" America, an America that does not have junker cars and house trash and clothes with holes and houses that look like third world shacks. To the writer that said he had lived or is now living at the film's location and that the film has nothing to do with the reality, I can only comment that I know poor rural people and everything in that film struck a chord with me; I have seen that and worse, the American underbelly. What surprised me was that the film was made in the first place. Europeans, South Americans and Australians have the nerve to look at their societies, warts and all but Americans don't have the courage and they just sweep the bad stuff under the carpet.It is an excellent film that deserves to be seen by all movie goers because it shows an aspect of American society that is rarely, if ever, seen.",Winter's Bone
108,alicecbr,Portia Faces Life,4,29 June 2010,"As a Southerner, I take offense to the indicated imbecility of these people. Too many gaps that probably Yankees won't see, since the very subject matter feeds into the prejudice that we're all products of incest and stupid. But here's the funny stuff: I heard the author interviewed on NPR and he's from there, going into the army at 17 but then returning to record these people's cadences. When the recruiter, with a straight face, told the girl ""It will take 4 to 82 weeks for you to get this $40,000"", I thought I would erupt in laughter. And with a son in Kosovo, I can tell you, nobody's getting $40,000 to join. As the recruiting contract you sign states, ""Nothing that has been promised to you verbally or on any other piece of paper applies......only this contract your are signing now."" I'm paraphrasing of course. But too many of our cannon fodder children are believing the lies of the recruiters. Of course, in this case, he was shown as being straight. Maybe some are, as judged by their suicide rate, higher than the rest of the Army.What else was funnY? OK, there's cocaine and crank easily available to give these poor hillbillies some surcease from the horror and hopelessness of their everyday life. But ALSO, there is plenty of 'legal' prescription drugs that are continually being offered to the girl when she gets beaten up and for the catatonic mom. I'm sure these offerings wouldn't have been given such high viewability if the director wasn't making a point: illegal/legal, what's the diff?Thank goodness, one cliché wasn't carried through: nobody could play that banjo even though they held it and tried. If that little girl had taken off on Cannonball Express, the movie would have been completely phony, instead of somewhat. I suppose showing the girl on the trampoline was just another way of showing how dumb the parents/caretakers were for letting those kids up there with (toy) horses?The character actors were pretty good, at least not OVERACTING. The beating wasn't believable, and we didn't actually get to see someone high on meth. With all the cooking going on, this was indeed a surprise.The best acting was by Teardrop, the girl's uncle. I'll be looking for other movies he's in. And I hope that Ozark writer keeps putting those novels out because I think he's got a great novel in him, if he gets off the stereotypes and puts in some realism. There is just ONE thing that was completely real, unfortunately: for those desperate, ignorant people going into the Armed Forces and being shipped off to die in another country for Big Oil seems a desirable way out of their poverty.I also very much applaud the setting of the movie in those two Missouri counties, for the sake of jobs. But would love to see on the DVD, interviews with the people who actually live back there in those woods. And, though this might be difficult, an interview with meth cookers would be GRRRRREAT!! maybe after they get out of jail.",Winter's Bone
109,chuck-reilly,"""Winter's Bone"" chills you with its authenticity",9,13 July 2010,"Deep-seated suspicions and clan hostilities run deep in Debra Granik's backwoods Ozark country tale ""Winter's Bone."" Taken from the novel by Daniel Woodrell, the story involves the odyssey of seventeen-year-old Ree Dolly (a great Jennifer Lawrence) who is desperate to find her wayward Meth-addicted father. He's due in court in less than a week and he's already jumped his bail after putting his ramshackle house up as bond. If he doesn't turn up, dead or alive, the family will be thrown out into the fields. To make matters worse, Ree's mother is nearly catatonic and the teenager has to tend to her two younger siblings or else they'll starve. Adding to her dilemma is the fact that her father recently attained notoriety among his clan members as a snitch to the local police. They'd just as soon prefer to see him dead as to give out any information regarding his whereabouts. It doesn't take Ree long to find out that she's up against a proverbial stone wall and that her own life could be in danger just for asking a simple question. Her father's younger brother called Teardrop (John Hawkes) eventually decides to aid her search, but he seems more bent on revenge than anything else. And he obviously knows a lot more about Ree's father's fate than he's letting on. ""Winter's Bone"" examines an area of economic plight and downright poverty that hasn't been seen in an American film in years. The picturesque Ozark Mountain scenery is abandoned for a bird's eye view of blown-out Methamphetamine labs, seedy bars, and dilapidated homes. Ree's sole purpose is to provide for her family, even if that means taking a vicious beating for asking the wrong questions at the wrong time. Her quest to find her dear old dad takes quite a few tragic detours; but what doesn't kill this young heroine makes her that much stronger. The fine cast includes Garret Dillahunt as the local sheriff who's more interested in Uncle Teardrop's violent activities than cracking down on illegal Meth labs. Their face-off duel near the end of the film is one of the highlights and a pivotal scene. Dale Dickey, looking like an Ozark version of Madame DeFarge, is the menacing Merab. Her grim-reaper face is enough to scare away any stray animal or traveling salesperson. Lauren Sweetser (Gail) provides some comforting moments for Ree, but they're too few to make much of a difference in her tragic search for the truth. Like everyone else in this neck of the woods, Gail has her own problems to contend with. Anne Rosellini co-wrote the adapted screenplay with director Granik and they're sure to win at least a few nominations when the awards season rolls around. ""Winter's Bone"" is one of the best movies of the year and certainly the most original one by a country mile.",Winter's Bone
110,peefyn,Bright light in bleak surroundings,7,22 May 2015,"This is not the story about breaking out of your surroundings, but about handling them and breaking out of the negative culture that that led to them. The plot itself is almost like a crime mystery, but it doesn't really try to be. Lawrence's character is not trying to solve a crime, she's trying to protect her siblings. This movie could've easily gone too far in the crime-direction, but is all the better for not falling for the temptation. Instead it is an exploration of the community, family and culture that made Lawrence's character who she is, and probably also motivates he to do what she does. While it is, no doubt, a negative culture, the movie also touches on the positive sides of it, and humanizes at least parts of it.",Winter's Bone
111,rooee,Another world,7,13 December 2011,"Plaudits flocked to Jennifer Lawrence's starmaking turn in Debra Granik's brutal Ozark-based drama, although when one actually watches her understated performance it's barely noticeable that she's acting at all. Lawrence plays Ree, bringing up her two younger siblings and her shell-of-a-mother in a chill, thankless world, where a cop (Garrett Dillahunt) will deliver threats to the doorstep but back off when the families start feuding. And up here, almost everyone is family.Ree's search for her father is the plot's MacGuffin: the real story is her fight for survival, and the loyalty and humanity tested along the way. ""Never ask for what oughta be offered,"" she tells her brother, Sonny (Isaiah Stone), early on. Such is her dignity; such is her courage. Upon second viewing I noticed the story contains an interesting ecological undercurrent. This is a film about a parent's legacy: handing a debt to a child who is worldly, stoic, but disempowered. Disempowered because she's too poor, too young – and ultimately too unwilling to continue the Dionysian excesses of her forefathers. This is a rare youth movie where the elders are the irresponsible ones, and the new generation is seeking modesty and balance, and a return to the nucleus of the family unit.Winter's Bone may not help shake off the hick horror stereotype laid down by Deliverance, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, and a million inferior successors. And some of the supporting performances are jarring alongside stunning work from John Hawkes and Lawrence (although watch out for a delightful, scene-stealing cameo from Sheryl Lee). But Winter's Bone is superior filmmaking thanks to its chilling atmosphere and minimalist script. A thrilling yet thoughtful glimpse into a world of mystery and menace.",Winter's Bone

Now, I'm not saying this movie is great, and I'm not saying the movie is terrible. It's just a good movie with an interesting storyline. On mixed thoughts, some parts of the movie almost made me fall asleep, but just got a little boring. Also, John Hawkes' performance was okay, and there was nothing special about the character, except for his perfect thrill brought to the character. But on positive sides, Jennifer Laurence is one tough chick in that movie, and she provided a strong performance as a girl trying to save her home, by finding the bones of her father. The script felt true, the characters were true, and sometimes the movie just felt like a ""true flick"". Nothing exciting and caring about the film, but the film does live a full purpose sometimes, which made the movie good.

116,dvc5159,"A fine, fine film; an instant classic which is not to be missed.",7,13 December 2010,"Rarely do I have the privilege to see a film that is so raw, so real, that it takes over your senses and becomes much more than just a great movie - it becomes an experience or an event. ""Winter's Bone"" is the little movie of 2010 that does just that - it takes over your senses because what is happening on the screen is unabashedly and uncommonly real and not-Hollywood like that you become immersed in this rarely- explored world of the Ozarks.Using a novel by Daniel Woodrell, director Debra Granik and co- screenwriter Anna Rosellini crafts a stark tale about a teenage Ozark girl who is forced to find her missing father before she and her two siblings get thrown out into the wild, due to dad putting up the house as a bond for his bail. The script is beautifully written, with very natural dialog throughout, you'll feel like you're there watching them. Every line has a meaning and is not without purpose, the main characters fleshed out in detail without excessive dialog overshadowing the character itself. The story is logical and extremely believable, and makes for a tense experience during the film. There are no clichéd Hollywood subplots and the story couldn't be more direct than a bullet to the heart. This is neo-noir at its finest.I can't say more about the actors, because they are all excellent in their own unique way. Especially and most notably Jennifer Lawrence as the protagonist Ree Dolly. Now Ree's father is missing and mother gone sick, and she has to take care of her two siblings all by herself. To make matter worse she has been taking some flak because of her family name's notoriety due to her father's mistakes, but she remains steadfast and strong, unmoved like a rock. She learns how to be responsible and independent all by herself, and she is a tough character whose spirit shall never be broken, however hopeless and desolate her situation is (perhaps that is what built her character in the first place in absence of her parents). If Ree knows what to do, she does it. If she doesn't, she'll ask someone for help. She's being honest and not just smart. Keep in mind that this is an Ozark girl we're seeing on the screen, but there has very rarely been a hero(ine) that is so daring, brave and real, that the audience is firmly placed on her side as soon as trouble starts brewing. Ree has to face both the Ozark wilderness and the shady underground, both of which can cause serious trouble for her (and she does get into it). All Ree wants is to make sure her brother and sister have a roof to sleep under every night. To me, that selflessness and the love of her family that drives her makes her one of the most memorable and greatest female film heroine of recent times.Which comes back to Jennifer Lawrence. She is absolutely terrific and perfect as Ree, a real knockout of a performance. She perfectly displays a balance of emotions and expresses her feelings with her face and not just explaining everything straight out of her mouth like so many hero(in)es. This is a true blue breakout performance for her and I honestly think she deserves many Best Lead Actress awards for her performance, and not just Best Breakout star. I've seen many movies and Lawrence's performance beats many previous Oscar winners' performances hands-down. Kudos also to other supporting actors, especially John Hawkes as Ree's uncle Teardrop, who delivers a guilt-ridden, burnt-out depiction of a nearly lost soul.The Ozark landscape in the movie is beautiful to watch, but it emits a haunting, bleak presence. Something dark and mysterious but at the same time so simple and real. It is astounding the way Granik films these scenes to deliver the raw power and authenticity these images can deliver. It's like looking at a painting that comes to life. The interior of the buildings (and around them) are quite messy at times but it shows just how bleak the situation these people have to face every day. Not a pretty thought for us ""normal"" people, but then again what is normal when all Ree wants is to keep her family safe and nothing more? Kudos to the production designer and cinematographer for creating and/or choosing a unique setting that not all moviegoers can experience everyday. The atmospheric, ambient music pulls you in even further into this strange yet quietly dangerous world.2010 has been a dull year for mainstream movies, but among the little known ones this could very well be the best one. I really hope the Academy doesn't overlook this like so many unfortunate movies before. It's a bit too soon for me to say but this may not only the film of the year, but also a true American masterpiece of a landscape that is nearly neglected by the public. A must see.Overall rating: 94/100",Winter's Bone
117,gary-444,Chilling Brilliance,8,9 October 2010,"A slow burning tale of a young woman's fight to save her family's home from the Bondsmen. Set amongst the mountain people of the Ozark mountains in Missouri, USA, Jennifer Lawrence stars as Ree Dolly, the seventeen year old leader of the family by default, tending a young brother and sister, and a mentally ill mother as homelessness looms.The remote location is reminiscent of ""Deliverance"" and ""Southern Comfort"", but the story is shorn of the visceral action which characterised them. We witness a young woman assuming responsibility when all around her abandon theirs. Her mother is a pathetic mute figure, her siblings wholly dependent ,her grandfather is hostile, her grandmother savagely beats her, and indifference or self interested hostility abounds. Only her uncle, grudgingly, ends up helping her in her search to find her father, who is immersed in drug culture,and avert the impending loss of their home if he fails to show for a Court appearance.At the heart of this story is amorality, right and wrong are uneasy bedfellows. Ree's father has let her, and the family down, and has betrayed his friends. The Bondsman, who could easily be stereotyped as the Bad Guy, comes good. Her grandmother obstructs her, leads a shocking female gang assault, but also finally offers closure to her quest. The Police are ambivalent peripheral figures, showcase in a tense roadside car stop stand off towards the end. The women are cowed wives, complicit in violence, but offer self-less assistance when the chips are down.The pace is overwhelmingly laconic, atmospheric and menacingly hillbilly making the climax of the film when Ree discovers her fathers fate all the more gruesome and shocking. Inevitably the final act falls a little flat thereafter. This is not for adrenaline junkies, and lovers of snappy dialogue or fast editing. Instead this is a film which allows the characters to breathe, to be nuanced and not to be defined by action, but rather by their actions. Bravely, the magnificent scenery backdrop is not allowed to dominate, instead images of tumbledown shacks, car wrecks and drug dens dominate.Easily one of the best pictures of the year, and a triumph for Director Debra Granik whose previous debut feature, ""Down to the Bone"" explored some similar themes of female resilience and deprived drug culture. The unexpectedly upbeat ending is delightfully uncontrived and neatly wraps up a fine offering.",Winter's Bone
118,bobbobwhite,"Shades of Deliverance, deja vu",8,21 June 2010,"This film tells the sad story of inbred, poverty-stricken, Missouri Ozark hillbillies trying to scratch out a living on poor soil and even worse personal resources, so it was no wonder meth production was embraced as a life-changing profit center that had the illegal potential to change their lives for the better. Their poor lives before meth had a certain dignity in the hard struggle for survival in an uncaring world that had passed them by or never allowed them to catch up, either or both, but cheap and dangerous drug production leading to fast but risky money took these unfortunates down a road that surely few would have chosen if they had a chance beforehand to see any of the personal and social harm it created in a society already at great risk of decent survival. What great harm it did was shown and acted brilliantly, as it pushed these already at-risk people lower down the chain of life than before and surely even lower than the wild animals they had to kill for food.A young girl of 17, seeming older than her years, beaten up and beaten down, wary of those around her but needing their help, and with 2 young siblings and a helpless mother to care for, she learned that her drug-making, drugged-out father disappeared and missed a court date for a drug arrest, and the most important task of her life then became finding her father before they lost their meager home to bondsmen, as that sorry home place was all they had in the world but it was home and she intended with all her heart and soul to do whatever it took to keep it and her family together. The acting throughout was appropriately serious to deadly, with hardly even a smile to be seen, and left us thankful as seldom before for whatever our own lives give us compared to those in the story.Such a grim and foreboding task the daughter had, with imminent harm threatening around every corner she turned and behind every door on which she knocked, even those of relatives. Determination can get you far, but only so far unless you get a few breaks, and that long quest for a decent break was what kept viewer's eyes glued to the screen until it all played out in the end as could be expected in that dire situation. Bleak, stark, harsh, mean, cruel...all those tough adjectives were present in full force throughout her search, but present also was her eternal fire of human spirit and family duty that would never quit. When actual survival is at stake, this story showed well that some of us truly can find the right stuff to survive when no better choices are possible.",Winter's Bone

120,Meven_Stoffat,Winter's Bored,3,28 March 2011,"OK, starting off, you see my star rating for this movie? That rating means I thought this movie has a few good points and, *gasp!*, a good deal of bad points. And I'm not a cinema elitist who disregards every blockbuster ever made and thinks every indier-than-thou flick is by default great. I rate films out of honesty, and this is what I honestly think of Winter's Bone.First off I can't deny this film is gorgeously shot. There's some great and nifty camera work in the movie and the scenery is just pure eye candy. I loved the opening shots and ominous, dark tone... and then the characters started talking. Seriously, the dialogue is so overblown and tacky. I was laughing at pretty much 80% of the lines spoken in the film. How this was up for Best Screenplay is against me.What very little plot there is relies on the protagonist being ten times as stupid as the characters in most movies today. It's about a girl at risk of losing her home searching for her father. What feels like an hour of the film is devoted to silent footage of the protagonist walking through the woods. If you cut half of the ""walking through the woods"" out, the movie would be an hour long. And again, there was a lot of buildup but NO ENDING... it just ends.The actors do a pretty good job given the script, but this film is a massive bore.

A 17 year-old girl,Dolly Rae,who's father is a ""cooker"" (producer of meth,or crank as they call it)is on the run from the police for a non appearance at his court trial for drug manufacture. The sheriff is threatening Dolly,her two siblings & catatonic mother with being thrown off their land if the father doesn't turn up soon. It's up to Dolly to find her father & make things right. This is a very well written,directed & acted drama about how times change (and not for the better),and is bleak & somewhat depressing to watch,but easy to appreciate. Jennifer Lawrence heads a cast of mostly unknowns,but does include John Hawkes (known mostly for his work in television dramas),as her Uncle,Teardrop (the closest thing she has to family,other than her own close knit,but fractured family),and Sheryl Lee (who will always be known for her role in Twin Peaks,as well as it's prequel,Twin Peaks:Fire Walk With Me,as Laura Palmer,although she did appear at the end of David Lynch's Wild At Heart,as the good witch),as April.

122,Eternality,Winter's Bone is more of an exercise in mood setting rather than being story-centric.,7,16 February 2011,"Unlike Frozen River (2008) two years ago, Winter's Bone is an independent film that has benefited from the expansion of the number of nominees for Best Picture, earning a shot at competing with large studio efforts backed by powerful producers and A-list directors such as Inception (2010), True Grit (2010), and The Social Network (2010). Despite being nominated for the top Oscar prize, and three other nods including Best Actress, I feel that Winter's Bone is overrated, and as much I would like to support independent works, this one does not work satisfactorily for me.Starring Jennifer Lawrence, who plays a seventeen year old girl, Ree, living with a mentally challenged mother, and two much younger siblings whom she has to care for. She has a father who deals with drugs, and has gone missing for more than a week. The sheriff warns Ree that if her dad does not appear in court to stand trial in a few days, their home would be taken away. Such is the predicament faced by Ree that one would feel sorry for her having to not only single-handedly shoulder the weight of responsibility of caring for her (wrecked) family, but also to find out the truth of her father's disappearance.Director Debra Granik, who is also a co-writer of this film, creates a setting that is so depressing that the viewer would be forgiven if he or she thought it was a post-apocalyptic film like The Road (2010). Shot on location in Missouri, the mise-en-scene of Winter's Bone captures the desolate wilderness populated by scrap heaps of metal, unwanted appliances, and old, shabby homes with rusty fences. Stray dogs could also be seen roaming freely trying to avoid the chills that plague the area. To make matters worse, most of Ree's neighbors are also like animals – hostile and self-protective.Winter's Bone is more of an exercise in mood setting rather than being story-centric. The narrative is intentionally meandering, and even though we see Ree's extraordinary drive to seek the truth, the truth itself does not seem to be the film's most important objective. Instead I interpret the film as centering on the uneasy relationship between Ree and his father's brother, Teardrop (John Hawkes), who is initially unwelcoming towards her, but later vows to help and protect her. The lack of scenes that push the narrative forward could be frustrating for impatient viewers, and those who are expecting a taut suspense-thriller may feel disappointed as well.GRADE: C+ (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",Winter's Bone
123,v-56289,what a drama,3,24 October 2020,I think some people may enjoy the long boring scenes and appreciate it as art.. Unfortunately this is nothing for me... Also the storyline is rather ridiculous to me... Especially the scene where they cut the hand of the dead body using the chainsaw.. OMG,Winter's Bone

The main character is played by a quite attractive girl as well, which adds to the enjoyment of the film. Overall, highly recommended but don't expect it a life altering masterpiece.The plot is very simple: it is about a girl who needs to prove that her dad is unable to pay his debs so that she can remain in her home with her two younger brother and sister.I found interesting the depiction of poverty in the United States. As a Brazilian I didn't know that such extreme poverty also existed in the United States.",Winter's Bone
125,Ryan_MYeah,"Expertly scripted, and directed. Jennifer Lawrence and John Hawkes are spectacular.",9,5 November 2010,"Today I finally got to see Winter's Bone, a rather small, but highly respected festival film based on the book by Daniel Woodrell. And first off, there's a reason the film won the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival, it's because the film is astounding.The film features newcomer Jennifer Lawrence in the role of young Ree, a 17 year old girl raising her young brother, and sister, and caring for her sick mother. A town sheriff comes to their house and informs her that her missing, drug dealing father has a court date, and that if he doesn't show, the house will be taken as bail bond. Seeking help from several people (though most of them just want to keep her father's disappearance a secret), she hacks through the dangerous Ozark terrain to locate her father.I want to applaud director Debra Granik, whose directs a subtly crafted piece of work, a dark character study of perseverance, and secrecy, and manages a consistently dark tone. At times, her and her co-writer Anne Rosellini's script can threaten to feel repetitious, but they have other plans in mind for this movie. It does feel slow occasionally, but it's also tastefully handled, and the character development feels absolutely right.Most of the cast of the movie don't play particularly huge parts, but every last cast member is extraordinary, and none of them feel underused, or overused. Obviously, most of the focus is on young Lawrence, in a nuanced, but rather intense performance. She performs the role with solid conviction, and gets lost in it, making it feel completely authentic. Not to be outdone is John Hawkes, who plays Ree's uncle, who starts out rather tight-lipped, but over the course of the movie becomes more helpful to her cause. Hawkes commands the screen every time he appears, and rivals Lawrence as the best performance of the film.See it for Lawrence. See it for Hawkes. See it for the script. In fact, see it for everything.Winter's Bone gets ***1/2 out of ****",Winter's Bone
126,PipAndSqueak,You bring what you will,7,25 September 2010,"This is a very sensitive treatment of life in the underbelly of the illegal drugs world. The viewer is cast in the naive and ignorant position shared by the principal character - beautifully acted by Jennifer Lawrence. You may well know more than she does - in which case you'll catch on to the story line well before the average. Otherwise, this film takes a long time to get going. If you haven't 'got it' in the first half you'll probably have gone to sleep by the time the real action starts. You'll be asking 'what was that all about' for a different reason to the ones who've seen the whole all the way through. So subtle is the message that it'll pass you by. Just remember that you're seeing this story from the perspective of a 17 year old girl. Now it makes sense!",Winter's Bone
127,Bob Pr.,A compelling odyssey through the Ozarks,9,24 July 2010,"A film about life in the backwoods of the Missouri Ozark mountains, filmed on location and with local residents supplying many of the bit parts; principal characters Ree Dolly (Jennifer Lawrence), her uncle, Teardrop (John Hawkes), and Merab (Dale Dickey), etc., are filled by experienced actors. Its tone is called ""country noir.""In this Ozark area cooking meth has replaced moonshining as the popular way to make an illegal living. Ree's father, Jessup, was charged with this and then has fled? -- disappeared. Ree is 16 years old and caring for her 12 year old brother and 6 year old sister as well as her catatonic mother. She depends mostly on the charity of neighbors for food, or from the squirrels she shoots, dresses, and cooks. A sheriff shows up and gives her notice that her father faces a court appearance in 10? days for cooking meth. To make his bond, her father had signed over the deed to their land and home as surety. If he doesn't show in time, Ree and her family will lose their only security.Ree says, ""I'll find him,"" and the rest of the film deals with her determined quest -- meeting and overcoming most obstacles to find her father and save the family home.She makes an odyssey among both near and distant relatives seeking her father. It's a very gripping journey and gives a view of that particular type of rural life and culture which, perhaps slightly broadly drawn, is fairly realistic in its picture of that wintry land and its people.Some reviewers are already projecting ""Winter's Bone"" as best picture of the year and/or Jennifer Lawrence as Academy Award winner as best actress; her performance is that brilliant and gripping. The photography is great, the suspense thrilling. I was propelled through it almost as if riding a roller coaster.It was only after the movie was over and reflecting about it that I wondered why Missouri's social services network was never mentioned, made no appearance**--and how in the world could Ree become such a strong, determined character given her father, mother, and circumstances? But just as I don't question Ulysses' escaping the cave of the one-eyed giant in The Odyssey, these omissions don't bother me. It's a great story, wonderful film. (But view the trailers if you have doubts about liking it.)**(The message board for ""WB"" -- http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1399683/board -- answered my first question: these people do not trust government and shun contact with any help that might come with having to answer questions.)",Winter's Bone
128,tnrcooper,A slice of life from the Ozarks,10,21 March 2011,"This movie gives us a look at the lives of meth sellers and poor folks in the Ozarks. We see the overarching influence of poverty in peoples' lives, both meth dealers who even in spite of their prominence locally, still live in decrepit, relatively poor surroundings.The central figure in the movie, a tough 17-year-old named Ree (Jennifer Lawrence in a star-making performance) is responsible for her catatonic mother, 12-year-old brother Sonny (Isaiah Stone) and six-year-old sister Ashlee (Ashlee Thompson) since her father is away from the house most of the time, usually owing to meth. However he has recently missed a court date and if he does not show up, he will lose his house. Therefore it is incumbent on Ree to find him or the family will be put out of their house. In trying to track him down, Ree has to deal with some unpleasant characters, most especially local meth kingpin Thump (Ron Hall) and Merab (Dale Dickey), a woman with connections to Thump. She also has to deal with her father's brother Teardrop (a fantastic John Hawkes) who keeps things close to his chest and may fall into the violence and drug habits which plague some in the area.The performance from Lawrence is fantastic. She conveys a very determined woman who is not cowed by some terrifying and legally ominous circumstances and who cares about her family enough not to shrink from the responsibility of taking care of her depressed mother and the younger siblings who rely on her. Lawrence will be a big star although I would bet most of the roles offered to her will not cast a shadow on this role. This is a meaty, juicy role and she sucks all the juice out of it, conveying thoughtfulness, toughness, and the ability to teach her siblings what they need to know in an unsympathetic world.The plot is quite well elucidated and we understand the role of all the characters we meet. The writing is spare and minimalist from a novel by Daniel Woodnell. The screenplay is co-written by director Debra Granik and Anne Rosellini who convey a bleak, hostile environment in the Ozarks of Missouri. The acting was almost totally done by locals from the area where the movie was filmed. This movie truly deserved many more Oscars than it received at the Oscars.",Winter's Bone
129,MovieGuy109,Intense little drama-thriller,9,29 October 2011,"Winter's Bone is a powerful drama from Debra Granik, who explores the drug world much like she did in Down to the bone. This time she places the setting in a moody dirt-poor town in the Ozarks. The atmosphere is incredible and makes this a powerful experience. Lawrence is amazing in her breakthrough performance and Hawkes is extraordinary as her drug-addict uncle. Granik uses the setting to amplify the tension and does a superb job of it. Simple shots have a complex effect on us and that is the genius in the picture. It also provides insights into the types of people that live in the places the movie depicts. The supporting cast is full of authentic faces in which we can easily see belong in the movie.",Winter's Bone
130,Bruce722,Pathetic movie.,2,17 June 2013,"What an overrated piece of trash Winter's Bone is... or should I say trailer trash? Outside of Jennifer Lawrence's outstanding acting job the rest of the movie is a big pile of crap. It's 90+ minutes of the dullest possible movie watching experience you can get combined with a mediocre plot and filled with characters that have no backbone and can't be related to. Honestly, if people like that really still exist, I could care less because they're all garbage. This movie is the perfect example of critics not knowing anything about film and only giving it high acclaim because it's different and not well known. Unless you want to see the reason Lawrence was cast to play Katniss, another tough young women who is forced to take care of her sibling(s) with next to nothing because her mother is worthless and her dad is gone, don't bother wasting your time.",Winter's Bone

The father turned out to be murdered in a community effort to prevent him from talking to the police about the neighborhood's little drug operation. The claustrophobic atmosphere in the film is accompanied by dry local dialog which won't exactly make you spin in your seat. By the time the film is over, you have gained nothing in terms of entertainment or a better understanding of what the hell it is that makes these people tick. The film just kind of drags on for 100 minutes and then ends.

The story sounded just OK, but being listed as a Drama/Mystery/Thriller, and a rating of 7.3 from 57k users on this site, I thought I would give it a shot. Surprise... it was only a drama, those other categories don't apply.Jennifer Lawrence plays a rural mountain girl who goes in search of her Meth cook father, and at the same time she is trying to keep her family together. Both of these issues are intertwined.Alright. The story sounded like some other movies i have seen, so it's not a ""stunning"" original concept. Jennifer Lawrence, and all the cast for that matter, did a good job with their characters, so no problem there. The ""Winter Bone"" I have to pick is that the movie is just boring. It is a straight up bore-fest. There is no mystery, no tension that makes it a thriller by any means. I really have to be in a bored mood to watch something like this, and I was, and it still bored me.This is one of those movies that a Director makes when they want to win an award. They make a boring movie with a boring plot. Just look at the movie ""Precious."" BORING. They want you to get done watching it and say something like, ""wow, this movie really portrays poor mountain people's lives realistically and it was so honest.""If you really want to make a movie that makes people say things like that, please, just go and start making documentary films, because me and I am sure a lot of you out there don't really want to pay money to watch a movie that portrays something ""realistically"" if it is going to make you constantly look at your watch in hopes that it will get over in time to see some reruns on TV. It's a trick that they use to try and force you to say its good. Judging by its rating on this site, they seemed to fool almost 57K people already. People please, just be honest and tell everyone you are bored so some of us can learn from your mistakes.Not the worst movie I have seen so far, but for doing a good job boring me to sleep, I give it 5 stars.",Winter's Bone
133,Michael Fargo,Farther along....,10,28 June 2010,"""Tempted and tried, we're oft made to wonder Why it should be thus all the day long""This wonderful movie makes me rejoice at what small films can accomplish. Last year's standout, ""The Hurt Locker,"" actually pales in comparison to what director/screenwriter Debra Granik puts together here. While the plot is reminiscent of the Coen Bros. ""Fargo"" and ""No Country for Old Men,"" the tone of ""Winter's Bone"" is dead serious. There's a superb soundtrack that softens the harshness, and music is used as solace just as it is in the culture of rural Appalachia. The cast is perfection. And while none of these folks would be welcome for dinner at my house, they are so convincing in their greed and fear that actress Jennifer Lawrence's minutely drawn heroine stands out vividly with her embodiment of hope and justice. What Lawrence does as Ree Dolly is a minor miracle. Standing before some very scary people (many of whom are blood relatives) makes you wish you could be like her. And the many who foil her attempts to keep her family together and save the family home recognize the goodness she represents and also wish they could have stayed on the path she's still blazing. But their souls have been sold and their actions against her frequently drew gasps from the audience.Midway, I wondered, ""How on earth can this end in a satisfying, believable way?"" And the denouement is so vivid and unexpected that the film is assured of being remembered at Oscar time.",Winter's Bone
134,torstensonjohn,Well Worth The Watch,7,14 July 2018,"A film that resonates with the audience comes across very few times that sticks with you. This is a movie that is driven by it's character's and the plotline. A poverty stricken young girl who is stuck with a ill mother and raising her young siblings. It is a mystery and drama based film with Jennifer Lawrence at the helm as it's lead playing Rhee the oldest of three kids.Set in the Ozark Mountains of Missouri Rhee is forced to try and keep her family home when her drug making father disappears. As the story develops we see the raw emotion from these characters. A truly telling story of how poverty stricken the families are in these areas, it's about survival and family at it's core. Winter's Bone won several awards, including the Grand Jury Prize: Dramatic Film at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival. It also received four 2011 Academy Award nominations: Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Actress for Lawrence and Best Supporting Actor for John Hawkes who played Teardrop.A rich film full of entertaining value and the audience is delivered a satisfying story. Jennifer Lawrence in her 1rst true major role that showcases her talent. A solid 7 out of 10",Winter's Bone
135,Ric-7,Invisible masterpiece,10,30 January 2011,"The film's set-up is just as unappetizing as it's title. Winter's Bone does not sound like a feel-good film. And it isn't. It is set in the contemporary poverty-stricken rural South. Not the Blanche DuBois kind of poverty, but the real, way of life poverty such that the local high school offers a setting absolutely pristine and comfortable in comparison to what the characters routinely face every day at home.A 17-year-old young woman (hard to call her a girl in light of what she faces) takes care of her frail mother and her two under-12 siblings. She must locate her drug-dealing father or risk losing her home. Her search takes her through her family tree and that of in-laws, and each new relative, also inferentially involved in the family secrets, is scarier than the ones before. No caricatures, just real, understated menace.If you have not seen this film, I would be doing you a major disservice in attempting to accurately describe the plot. Just follow it along as it develops. Aside from the major plot, there are so many fascinating contrasts. Such as the fact that our heroine faces risk of serious harm from the female relatives as much (if not more) than from the male relatives.And in the scene which furnishes the explanation: OMG, this is too good! It's the female relatives who furnish a solution. A grisly, horrifying solution.Throughout the film, the heroine faces her challenges because everyone fears she will reveal what she has discovered. The reason for the ultimate solution is anything but that.I can't imagine a more authentic setting and more realistic art direction for the film. I have relatives in the rural areas of Louisiana and Arkansas, trampolines in the yard, abandoned satellite dishes, junk cars, yet relatively clean interiors of their double-wides and houses. The art direction was flawless, the lack of award nomination is inexplicable.All of the actors were remarkable. I'd have sworn that they were located either at the actual location, or found in local Arkansas theatre companies. Wrong. Jennifer Lawrence is evidently not a novice, and gives an unforgettable performance. As Uncle Teardrop, John Hawkes is equally amazing: a Minnesota native. Yikes! Not a false note from either of them.The kind of realism in this film reminds me strongly of The Panic In Needle Park (1971). It's not pleasant because it is too real. I can't recommend this film to anyone looking for a pleasant diversion. I confess I avoided it for months due to this same consideration.In June 2010, when the film was released, Roger Ebert gave it 4/4 stars. And I see that over the past six months, among Ebert's fans on his site, it is rated by them 4/4 stars. And I completely and totally agree. See if you can find another film Ebert gives 4/4 to, that the other viewers do the same.When the Oscar nominations were announced, and this film was mentioned many times, I felt that maybe I had unjustly avoided a worthy film due to preconceived notions. So I rented it this weekend and watched it a couple hours ago.Best Picture, imho. How did I miss this last summer? This is such a wonderful film. And no one knows about it. It is an invisible masterpiece.",Winter's Bone
136,axlrhodes,Acting and mood great. Everything else average.,6,11 April 2011,"The first thing im going to do with this review is focus on the positives. Jennifer Lawrence and the whole cast for that matter, are excellent, delivering very real performances fitting perfectly into the surrounding landscapes. In addition, the mood of the film is captured beautifully and the feeling of raw hard work that goes in to 'living off the land', is expressed well. Here's the downsides, there is little to get your teeth in to from a plot point of view and the gravity of Ree's desperate situation, barring one scene is not really felt by the viewer. I felt bad for her at times, but on the whole we see that there are people within her small community who are helping her out with food and supplies, and although she has a lot on her plate, its hardly enough to hang an entire movie on. There is an ongoing sense that the film never really gets started, that things just amble along in the same gear. Some might see these things as a positive but i felt slightly bored and was glad when the film ended.",Winter's Bone
137,rhinocerosfive-1,"Hard, hard, hard",9,31 July 2010,"This picture has a number of qualities that set it apart from most entertainments I've experienced recently. The writing is subtle and simple and quietly deep; the production design, musical choices and direction are effective because they are so extraordinarily straightforward, supporting that tight little script. The acting, much of it by non-actors, is persuasive and accurate. I'm not saying it's always easy to watch. There's grimness here, and pain, and a stark, textured shorthand that almost denies viewers the time to weep. But primarily, endearingly, ""Winter's Bone"" is notable for what it is not.It's not a feel-good picture, even though its lead is a 17-year-old girl looking for her dad. It's not a brutal thriller, despite featuring teenagers wandering woods populated by armed, drug-addled rednecks. And it's not an ode to the simple life, though it presents likable ragamuffins in the bosom of Heartland countryside. So what is it? Great independent filmmaking, the kind Miramax almost gave a bad name, the kind that tells a story absent of primary-color commentary, unlikely happy endings, unnecessary violence, false emotion, and the rest of the junk that keeps thoughtful moviegoers out of the multiplex in the summer. I don't know when I've seen a less sentimental movie: the tragedies and horrors of the rural criminal life pervade the story, yet they are not the story, and they do not derail the story. ""Winter's Bone"" asks me to feel sorry for no one, to be outraged on no one's behalf, to write a letter to no congressman. I am witness, not participant. I'm not implicated or accused, and so I am not insulted. Before this one, I can't remember a film about hillbillies that wasn't at least a little condescending, not since ""Harlan County USA"", and that was a documentary. Shockingly, this movie treats the uneducated as engaged citizens in command of their faculties with every chance to live a fulfilled life. Nobody in this story has more than a high school diploma, and our protagonist has less than that, yet there are no stupids here, no clowns. Most of the characters are frighteningly competent and capable. Some of them are wise.And rare and precious is the movie about teenage girls that treats them as neither object nor subject of sexual action. How beautiful to avoid the whole oversaturated palette of pubescent angst! How thankful I am to Debra Granik for presenting a few days in the journey of a heroine who walks through fire, loses all, gains all, and feels no need to turn from the path to kiss a boy.",Winter's Bone

Deliverance Revisited...,3,24 July 2010,"James Dickey ,move over, Debra Granik has replaced any notion that ""Deliverance"" is dead...Just when you think it is safe to visit Branson, or the suburbs for that matter, it isn't safe... Based on a novel by Daniel Woodrell, ""Winter's Bone"" tells the story ofseventeen year old Ree Dolly(Jennifer Lawrence), oldest daughter living at home of the Dolly family, undergo severe hardships, with her Father missing, and the Bail Bondsman wanting to foreclose on their home. No Daddy means bad times for Ree,he is out on Bond for making drugs, so she goes looking through the Ozark Mountains in search of answers, only to find a hushed up partisan community, who wants to put the past behind.Now, I don't want to say that this film is bleak, harsh, downtrodden, and filled with despair, but that would be the most accurate description.Living in the Ozark Mountains ain't like Jed and Granny, but with almost everyone having crystal-meth stills to supplement their incomes, it is a wonder anyone survives, they usually become victims of their own product line.Mother Dolly's mind is in Looney Toon Land, so Ree has to take care of the place, plus her two younger siblings.This film is tagged as an ""Upper"" that will leave you feeling good, well , unless someone else pays for the tickets and gives you an hour and a half of your life back, I just don't think that is true.Whatever happens to her Dad is really irrelevant , how the backwoods people behave and act is. Unless time has stopped , which probably didn't happen, then I think we can probably dismiss ""Winter's Bone"" as Obamas wet dream.The friend I went to the movie with her Parents are from the Ozarks, and I can guarantee you that she didn't try to eat me or sell me drugs.I think we can move on from this film and wish Debra Granik and Daniel Woodrell a nice life at the funny farm.

139,colinrgeorge,"Unexpectedly Honest, Authentic to a Fault",7,7 July 2010,"Debra Granik, director of the 2010 Sundance Grand Jury Prize winner, ""Winter's Bone,"" exhibits a rare confidence in her vision that nearly supersedes criticism. Her film is a portrait, and her brush-strokes are so self-assured that I suspect she could provide two diametrically opposed interpretations and pass a polygraph test with flying colors each time.In a way, that's what nags me about it. My stubborn inclination, despite the potent, pea-soup atmosphere of dilapidated shacks and leering, shadowy characters, is to dismiss it all as 'almost great.' The story is kick-started by a strong, simple premise—That 17 year old Ree (Jennifer Lawrence) must track down her father who, having put the family house up for a bail bond, must be retuned by his court date—Which quickly escalates into an engrossing high- stakes mystery when she starts asking questions of the wrong (or is it right?) people.And yet the experience receded promptly in my mind. Why is it that I should consider Granik's film anything less than one of the year's best, immediately worth recommending? I suppose my expectations are partially at fault for the traces of disappointment laced with my enjoyment of the film. I had been hearing scattered but decisive praise for ""Winter's Bone"" over the last few weeks, and I went to the theater having only seen the trailer. Usually, the less I know about a film, the more chance it has to genuinely surprise me, but in this case it felt like the story built to an early peak it couldn't outclimb—Or rather, didn't try to. The early twists seem to precipitate later ones that never come.Nevertheless, Granik's authenticity in mimicking (and in many cases, simply capturing) the feel of the rural, dirt-poor Missouri communities is so complete that it's hard not to fall into the moment. The pacing is perfect, and it's a compliment that my greatest complaint is its straightforwardness. ""Winter's Bone"" washes over its viewers like a cool fog; it can be slow, but our heart rates seems to slow with it. In more tense scenes, Granik's direct line to our pulse is only more apparent.Of course, it doesn't hurt that her characters, in addition to being vessels for a mood, also have the propensity to be very funny. It's more than that though; somehow they don't feel like characters at all. It's not that they're particularly deep or fantastically realized—They just seem real, even at the expense, in several cases, of being great fictional personages. They joke, they allude, they threaten, they share; they exist as an extension of the environment rather than pawns of the plot.And perhaps the same can be said for the story. Maybe I was expecting something more conventionally thrilling, when what I was offered was a convincing, if very down-to-earth, mystery. The way it unravels is involving—It just never reaches that 'Coen brothers' level of (very showy) brilliance, and Granik isn't trying to be clever. She's a painter, not a writer.I still can't bring myself to call ""Winter's Bone"" a great film, but paradoxically, I do think the film-making is great. Granik is an unflinching director, the best kind. However, as a matter of personal preference, her style stands in stark contrast to that of my favorite auteurs: Paul Thomas Anderson, Kubrick, Tarantino, Lynch, the Coens. Granik seems more intent on publishing authenticity than cramming it through some self-stylized filter, and the result is a film of uncommon honesty. I guess that caught me off guard.Next time, though, I'll be willing to take her at her word. No lie-detector test necessary.",Winter's Bone

Man that was one eerie town and citizens to boot! This film came to my attention only after newcomer Jennifer Lawrence was nominated for both a Golden Globe and an Oscar for her performance in this, as to which after seeing this movie i see is well deserved. Also nominated for this film is actor John Hawkes (Teardrop in this film) who also deserves a win should he get it however being amongst some heavy competition the outcome should be interesting. Jennifer Lawrence portrays a 17 year old sister of two who is also taking care of her mother who presently suffers from melancholy after her husband disappears. Ree( Lawrence) after getting news from the local sheriff that if her father doesn't show up for his court date in a week her house will be taken away from her and her family as her father put it up on a bond. this causes Ree to look for her father, a well known methamphetimine maker, and question some folks around town on the possible whereabouts of her dad. This causes the local town leader named Thump who is also the head of the town's little dirty secret of methamphetimine production to get angry at all the newly unwanted attention Ree's questioning is bringing, especially from the town's law. Thump's crew, some actually related to Ree are not what you call the most friendliest looking of people as we find this out as we join along with Ree as she goes from household to household in a urgent plea to save her house and her family.

It is one of those movies that kind of drags on for 100 minutes, but nothing really happens and you are not excited about what is going to happen next or what is the ending going to be like.Yes, Jennifer Lawrence had a semi-good performance here, but her acting skills was highly limited, since the rest of the cast just seemed ''cheap''. And the movie itself just did not have any exciting moments, where she could exceed. Yes, the idea here was to show a sad life of American backwoods, where everybody is broke and doesn't have anything, but it just did not feel like it. Ree's family was going through some tough times, but the viewer does not really get attached to the story here and it is impossible to feel intrigued about how the story is going to unfold.It had a lot of background characters that were completely irrelevant, having some ''dry'' conversations with Ree, hence making the movie drag on and not providing any good scenes. The story in itself just is not good and the storytelling of this movie is definitely bad. Although, i didn't really like the plot and the movie was boring as hell, there is one thing i absolutely loved about this movie - the setup. I was enjoying the scenes and the background more than the dull conversations of uninteresting characters. It does a great job of showing a dire state of American backwoods. For some reason i really loved the places and run down houses the movie was shot in, that was about the only enjoyable thing to look out for in the movie, if it was not for that, the rating would have been 2/10.",Winter's Bone
142,tr91,Atmospheric but stumbles over the line,7,6 August 2014,"Winter's Bone is a good film. The plot is quite simple but still manages to be very gripping to watch. The atmosphere is tense and edgy and I really was intrigued all the way through the film.Winter's Bone is about a teenage Ozark Mountain girl, Ree, who is in search of her father. She is caring for her younger siblings as well as her mother who is sick. There is some trouble with her missing father and unless she finds him she is at risk of losing her home. We see Ree go to extreme lengths to protect her family and try and get to the bottom of things.The atmosphere is very tense and the film is shot beautifully. Jennifer Lawrence gives another fantastic performance (well worthy of that Oscar nomination). My main problem is that the ending seemed a bit abrupt. From the description I read about the film I thought there would be a lot more to the story about her father. All in all a good film though.7/10",Winter's Bone

144,Siamois,The lesser of two evils...,9,18 November 2010,"I had a very bad feeling about this movie, half expecting a pointless and artsy flick with no semblance of a plot. Boy, was I wrong. In a nutshell, the movie follows Ree Dolly, a teenage girl stuck in a dirt poor area in Missouri, trying to get by with her younger brother and sister and their depressed, lethargic mother. Their father is an absent figure, known to be involved in the production of meth, like many locals looking for cash in this barren, economically dead area. The environment, the people surrounding her... everything is bleak, harsh and brilliantly depicted by director Debra Granik but that's only the start of this film. One day, she learns her father has jumped bail. Problem is, the house was put on guarantee. Ree and her family will lose what little they have as the house will be seized in a week.But Ree is convinced her father may well be dead. She embarks on a quest to find out what happened to him and where he is. And in the process, must face and question people no teenage girl should have any business with, ever. Granik's direction is absolutely brilliant. Gritty, hearty, uncompromising. Some scenes are more chilling and tensed than any horror movie you could imagine. This movie is not for the faint of heart. Even the whole point of her quest is painfully tragic and without much hope. Which is the lesser of two evils? If Ree finds out and proves her dad is dead, her family is now fatherless and she must continue to be the main provider at the age of 17. If Ree's dad is still alive, it means he jumped bail and is now a fugitive, and Ree and her family are now homeless. The acting is fantastic. Jennifer Lawrence was a revelation here and has guaranteed herself a career with role. It wold take a string of duds for her to stop having work. The character Bree was a challenging role and it would have been easy to overdo things. The other spectacular performance with much less screen presence is by John Hawkes, who plays Bree's uncle. Teardrop is pretty much as legendary as any character could get in that sort of low-key drama. Hawkes steals every scene he is in and conveys a scary, menacing attitude while leaving a lot of depth and humanity show through. I've seen John Hawkes in tons of movies and I never, ever expected that kind of performance from him. I hope it gets him noticed. Many other performances are great but it would be too long to list.Winter's Bone is for me, without a doubt, one of the best movies of 2010. The plot is terrific and original, flirting with several genres without ever employing clichés for the sake of it. It is memorable and fresh. All the characters are fascinating, the situations interesting and director Granik's depiction of the Ozarks environment plunges you in this world. Best viewed when you're in the mood for a quite dark movie.",Winter's Bone
145,seaview1,A Girl's Indomitable Spirit in WINTER'S BONE,8,25 February 2011,"Winter's Bone, adapted by independent director Debra Granik and Anne Rosellini from the novel by Daniel Woodrell, is a small, low budget film with a courageous lead character. This is one of those small films that features strong performances particularly by newcomer Jennifer Lawrence.In a rural part of the country, a teenage girl, Ree (Jennifer Lawrence), raises her family which includes her younger brother and little sister. While most girls her age are attending high school, she has to assume the role of sister and parent. Life is grueling and tough for Ree who cares for her siblings even as her mother is depressed and dysfunctional and her father, who has had scrapes with the law, is missing from a bond hearing. Unfortunately the family's house has been put up as collateral for his bail and is in danger to be taken by the bail bondsman. Ree has to rely on the kindness and donations of food and supplies from neighbors, and when her home is about to be repossessed, her whole family is in danger of having their fragile world destroyed. Threatened with her family's survival and determined not to lose her home, she sets out to find her father by questioning friends and family. It seems that there is a little family blood everywhere, and people might know more than they let on. Her uncle, Teardrop (John Hawkes), is a menacing, uncooperative person. She follows leads that are dead ends and wild goose chases. She is at the end of her rope and desperate. What can she do? Is her father dead or on the run? Her search leads to some really bad people who are local crime lords, and her punishment at the hands of those she thought were friends is graphic and ruthless. Her situation is nearly an impossible one for anyone much less a teenager. Then help from an unlikely source begins to shed light on the fate of her father as her family's future hangs in the balance.Family is all important to Ree. She is put in what seems to be a hopeless situation with no options. Undeterred, she will not let her family be broken up. She has to not only act and think like an adult, but to grow up fast and also teach her brother and sister about the basics of life including hunting and cooking. She cherishes her siblings and despite her dad's criminal background and what it has done to the family, she clings to his clothing and belongings especially his guitar which also serves as a symbolic bond with her uncle. You ask yourself just what would you do in this situation? How would you survive? You respond to her plight by watching how she reacts to her circumstances.The lack of a budget does not hinder the film due to its subject matter and focusing on the individual characters. This is a very linear narrative with no parallel action. Some of the dialogue which reflects the local dialects is at times hard to understand. The unknown faces lend a very authentic feel as if these people really live this life. The rural countryside is filmed as a very foreboding presence and is itself a powerful character. The film employs frequent hand-held camera-work that lends an immediacy and documentary feel which work in the film's favor. Even the film's colors are a darker hue which adds to the somber tone.Lawrence really impresses in one of her first starring roles on film. The story rests on her shoulders, and she is more than up to the task. John Hawkes is believable as her uncle, and what's fascinating is his character's development and his dramatic changes over the course of the story.It is a kind of downer of a film as the odds are stacked against Ree, and while Winter's Bone is not for everyone with its solemn, serious themes, for those willing to immerse themselves in an intimate, realistic tale of loyalty and survival and a young girl who bravely carries on, it is an inspiration.",Winter's Bone
146,WubsTheFadger,Winter's Bone,4,2 January 2018,"Short and Sweet Review by WubsTheFadgerThe acting all around is quite good. The exception is that of Jennifer Lawrence's character. I have never seen Jennifer as a good actress, she has a very boring, mellow, and dry acting style that gets old after a while. Some of her lines sounded like she was reading off of a page. Her character has no depth and she did not have any redeeming factors or qualities at all. The story is deathly slow. Most of the movie is very boring. The premise is good but the execution is bad. The story is not bad but it could have been handled a little bit better.The Ozark scenery is the only redeeming factor in this film. The cinematography is beautiful at times. Pros: Great cinematography, some good acting, interesting storyCons: Jennifer Lawrence's performance, a large amount of boring moments during the film, bad pacing, poor execution in regard to the storyOverall:

147,n-kefala,The 17 year-old Ree Dolly takes care of her poor family as her father is gone and her mother suffers from depression,8,6 February 2011,"Heavy drama, based on Jennifer's Lawrence impressive performance, who has as a background a melancholic and cold environment. Debra's Granik, slow and languid direction, works flawlessly, as achieve her intent to portray the psychological movements of the characters in every glance and gesture.The social environment of the heroine occurs problematic and primitive, sample of a different America, who might surprise the audience with the insolence of. However, the independent cinema made once again the miracle, with a tough and the same time innocent film, like life itself. By dramatic realism reminiscent of that of Kathryn's Bigelow (Hurt Locker) and Courtney's Hunt (Frozen river), Debra Granik showed from very early that this is not a mysterious film that will unfold some intrigue. Jennifer Lawrence is scarred from a bad fate, but sees it as a reality rather than a tragic situation. It embraces the innocence of her little sister and brother while she learns them shooting. The tragic and great lies elsewhere: that she is mature in seventeen. She born in this cruel society. She don't criticized the irregularities and she does not like to be involved in these.This film could be described as innovative yet awkward, derivative film of Coen's filmography and old-fashioned American noir.",Winter's Bone
148,grnhair2001,Is this supposed to be set today?,3,25 October 2012,"I assume this is set today, as meth cooking on this scale is only a generation old...but strangely, many details seem plucked from the 1930's. People in the Ozarks, or West Virginia, or wherever coastal filmmakers like to think is so utterly inferior to their favorite urban bistro, have, among other things:1) televisions 2) the internet (at a public library and school if not at home) 3) telephones (punch numbers. ""Hey, have you seen my dad?"" movie over without Main Character ever needing to put on shoes) 4) food stamps and other assistance programs for poor children, so nobody has to shoot squirrels to live. (Not since 1932 or so) 5) furnaces...and I could go on.I have relatives who speak somewhat like this, love hunting, go to bars that look like the bar in the movie...but also have PhD's in physics and engineering, or Master degrees in social work or nursing or library science. I just know folks sat around at Sundance in their 1000 dollar jackets and frowned in concern and talked about the weariness of this life and the poor backwards people there and blah blah blah, having no idea what people in the rural midwest really are like or how those folks are living. It's as condescending and insulting as white people in the 50's making TV shows about happy-go-lucky imaginary black people who never spared a thought for Jim Crow laws.The slow pace didn't bother me. The quotidian cinematography didn't (though it was a waste--could have been a very artistic movie, but it sure wasn't). The acting was fine. I rather liked the story of a girl forced into an adult role too early. But sheesh, the setting was as realistic as Narnia's, halving the rating for me.",Winter's Bone
149,caseynicholson,A Hugely Overrated Bore,4,10 January 2015,"I finally got around to watching this movie this week after having wanted to see it since it was nominated for Best Picture a few years ago. I had heard good things about this movie, that it was a well done suspense thriller, and when it was nominated for the Oscar I imagined that it might be something akin to ""The Silence of the Lambs"".It was not. Instead, this movie is a painfully overrated bore fest which features a poorly developed script that can only be described as a mix between reality television and an 80's teen movie. The plot is thrown at you without any real buildup, and then the movie proceeds as an hour long scavenger hunt that is without any real creative cinematic value. The film culminates in an absurd, grotesque scene that serves only as gratuitous gore which completely denigrates the viewer's IQ (why couldn't they just throw them on the porch???). The entire movie is one giant flop to anyone who isn't viewing it purely from the interest and mindset of a meth addict. The one redeeming facet of the film is Jennifer Lawrence, who turns out a good performance in spite of a terrible script. Still, not even Katniss can save this movie from being a tremendous letdown. You might enjoy this film if you enjoy made-for-TV movies on Lifetime. If not, pass it up. There are better uses of an hour and forty minutes.",Winter's Bone

Ree has her back against the wall but it never shows. No matter what she pushes back and never backs down. It's a plain documentary-like film that draws you in, it feels real because the performances are excellent, natural even. Ree is easy to relate to and to understand, she's though and unyielding. I don't want to say stubborn because anyone in her shoes can't be stubborn, they're just doing what needs to be done.

151,jaredpahl,"Exhibit A on Why You Can't Trust Critics. Winter's Bone is a Boring, Empty Scam.",2,22 February 2019,"Every year, a micro-budget indie darling captures the hearts of critics everywhere. In 2010, that film was Debra Granik's Winter's Bone. I've been burned by these tiny darlings before, but the critical reception to this film was so overwhelmingly positive, I had to give it a shot. And two hours later, when the credits rolled, I felt like I had been robbed. I gave away a precious chunk of my life to this movie and got less than nothing for my investment. Winter's Bone cheated me out of a story, out of interest, out of anything that might be considered worthwhile.The movie stars Jennifer Lawrence as Ree, a 17-year-old Missouri girl who acts as the guardian of her two younger siblings after her father left and her mother became catatonic. The setup to the mystery at the center of Winter's Bone is this: Ree's drug dealer father has jumped bail and if he is not captured, the family house will be taken. Ree takes it upon herself to find her dad and ensure they keep the house. The mystery builds as the standoffish neighbors begin to get a little too hostile to Ree's inquiries. The promise of a revelatory payoff to her father's whereabouts is what carries you through the dingy locations and bland conversations that dominate Winter's Bone. If the payoff worked, I might be writing a much different review. But the answer to this mystery, after being teased, teased, and teased, is revealed to be an utterly pointless, insultingly underwhelming offhand plot point. I found it shocking how completely devoid of surprise this film's climax is. I won't spoil it directly, but the reveal of what happened to Ree's father has all the excitement of reading off a police report. To even call the end of the film a climax is disingenuous. This movie doesn't try to resolve anything. With such an inconsequential endgame, I don't understand how Daniel Woodrel, the author of the Winter's Bone novel, could have possibly thought this story was even worth telling. It gave me nothing to think about, nothing to mull over, nothing to take in. To be promised so much and given zero in the way of entertainment or insight is the ultimate middle finger to the audience. I left feeling duped, like I had been led on an elaborate scam designed to rob me of two hours of life.It's not the destination though, it's the journey. Unfortunately, the journey of Winter's Bone is just as empty as its finale. The film was praised mainly for two things: it's realistic depiction of the backwoods drug scene of the Ozarks, and for Jennifer Lawrence's performance. Let's start with those rundown, trailer trash locations that everyone seemed to love. Are they really that interesting? Maybe to critics who have never been outside their cosmopolitan bubbles, the locations represent some kind of exotic voyeuristic thrill. To someone familiar with farms and trailer parks, they're eyesores. Add to that all the phony Hollywood ""I'm unna save the farm, pa"" accents, and this is not a place I want to spend any time. I do not understand the appeal of this movie's look. To praise this film for its cinematography, of all things, is absurd. Anyone with a camera can go down to any backwoods town, film any neighborhood, at any time, and the result would be just as interesting. To call this lazy camera work great is disparaging to the cinematographers who do actual work with lighting, angles, and movement.As for Lawrence, an actress whose put-on gruffness I really can't stand, she is not that bad. This is the role that catapulted her career, and I'm thankful her strong protector character never feels too showy. She might get close a couple times to overdoing the steely-eyed determination, but she keeps cool, and the character is better for it. Ree might be the closest thing the film has to something of value. She's a well-written, well-acted character. But she is not nearly enough to offset the anger I felt toward this film.I'm open to the possibility that there is some underlying message in Winter's Bone, some hidden genius tucked away under all the Southern Gothic sparseness. If it's there, I'm willing to admit I missed it completely. But honestly, I don't think there is anything of worth in this film. I think it is simply a ""slice-of-life"" thriller that is embarrassed at the very idea of thrills, and inexplicably leads the audience on a slow, boring walk to a dead end. I feel like pressing charges against these filmmakers, and the critics who sold me on this cinematic pyramid scheme.19/100",Winter's Bone

Of course Ms. Lawrence booked THE HUNGER GAMES after carrying this well done but amazingly dispiriting film on her determined shoulders.It is easy to see all the usual ""Oscar Bait"" elements which ""professional"" critics like to rave are ""daring"" examinations of the underbelly of any society assembled here (serious expressions as women defend their men-folk and daughters try to track down absconding fathers, YOUNGER children seemingly blissfully unaware of impending disaster, poor folk raising their spirits in family folksong sings, moments of gritty ""reality"" - like the skinning of a squirrel for dinner - faux sexual tension, drug use and the rest; the film is about the children of a meth ""cooker"" who may or may not be dead and his oldest daughter trying to save the family farm by either bringing him back for trial or proving that he is dead after he posted it for bail), but anyone searching for actual revelations about human interaction or intelligence (not that UNintelligent people shouldn't have their stories told as well) is likely to come away sorely disappointed.We almost care about Ms. Lawrence's character because the actress is developing into a mistress of understatement. The film might have worked if we were allowed to care about anyone else - but given this cast of characters, that is a taller order than this film can fill.DO see it for Ms. Lawrence, but don't expect the new GRAPES OF WRATH that the film is trying so hard to be. It simply isn't there; one can only really wholeheartedly recommend it to fans of Martin McDonagh-like Irish bloody mayhem (for a scene in the swamp).

She now finds herself having to search for her elusive drug-dealing fugitive of a father for official reasons to prevent the loss of their home: a task that requires her to dangerously rock the boat, as the people with the information seem to want nothing to do with her.Outlined to the ears of different people, the plot line of this film may be perceived as anything from basic to fascinating, but in cinema judgements of a storyline's promise is ultimately meaningless as in the end a film's overall content will be turned into either gold or trash by the team attached to the project. Unfortunately in Winter's Bone the incompetent director Debra Granik together with her miserably mundane cast headed by Jennifer Lawrence (a wooden heroine), John Hawkes (a drab evil uncle) and Valerie Richards (a loathsome Texan stereotype) have neglected to put any life, heart of poignancy into the material. The end result is a bland, flat smattering of ghastly people doing ghastly things in ghastly surroundings, all of which stop it from ever connecting with its audience.However, because its content is ghastly and not simply boring, it is likely that this would-be flop is going to be critically lauded and publicly respected, with its defiant haters being labelled as sad little wimps who cannot accept reality. The fact is that pure, unpolished reality doesn't always fulfil the needs of a good feature film; when left untouched it often makes for a movie that lacks creativity, originality, intrigue or merit which is the case here.

Unless he turns up, dead or alive, the bond he placed on the house to get out of jail (he's a meth cooker) will default and Ree will lose the house, along with the ability to care for her catatonic mother and two little siblings. Her search is almost entirely among her kin, or what I would call her tribe, as hard-bitten a crew of mountain men and women you're going to find. The ending, set on a lake, is wonderfully Gothic and grisly.My problem with the movie is what I would call the fetishization of hillbilly culture. The camera dwells a little too lovingly on every sign of hick destitution that can be imagined. I didn't see any snake handlers or toothless women smoking corncob pipes, but here's my checklist of what's in the movie: banjos, rusted refrigerators on front porches, dogs, derelict vehicles in yards, junk everywhere outdoors, dogs, clothes hanging on clotheslines, broken- down sheds, roads with no center stripe, dogs, squirrel huntin' and squirrel guttin', firewood splittin', outdoor livestock butcherin', everyone is armed, dogs, all men are bearded, someone sits on a tire, mountain music jam in someone's living room, serious wrinkles (women included), dogs, lumberjack clothing, deer stew, greasy baseball hats, a burned-out abandoned house and, of course, methamphetamine. Also, do people who are not in John Wayne movies really say ""scatter gun"" instead of shot gun?This culture is hardly unique to the Missouri Ozarks. I've seen it in lots of places in the mid- Atlantic, including the coal regions of Pennsylvania and in western Maryland and West Virginia. But wherever you find it, you will also see folks who mow their lawns and keep flowerbeds, who have well-kept vehicles in the driveway and whose yards are free of junk. In other words, poor people who live with dignity. This belongs in the mix and Winter's Bone doesn't show it, no doubt for ""artistic"" reasons.Also, a scene at the end in which cash is handed to Ree seemed hokey and out of place. Can't well enough just be left alone??Kudos for a compelling story, lively dialogue and vivid performances.

Her accent, the way she handles the shooting of a rifle all look authentic. And luckily she is creates a very sympathetic character with Ree who is the sole supporter of her family - her Mum is mentally ill and her younger brother and sister don't yet know how to look after themselves.Ree finds out that her father is meant to show up for a court hearing and if he doesn't, her family's house will be taken away as he has settled a Bond with the house. So she goes out to find him to ensure he does go and discovers more to the locals here than what meets the eye. Despite warnings to her about not asking questions on these issues, she is nevertheless determined to ensure her family's safety and survival.What is really great about the film as I've mentioned before is Jennifer Lawrence. She is perfect in this role and brings a real authenticity to the role. It's also her character that we are interested in and how she cares for her family as well. I loved the scenes where she is showing her siblings how to shoot a rifle but also makes it perfectly clear to them never ever to point it one another.I did find some of the dialogue a bit difficult to understand sometimes, and those heavy accents sometimes make it a bit hard so if you have subtitles to choose from, I recommend it (though this is only with some parts). I'm very glad to have seen this film as it not only brings a great look into this culture of the community which some people live in but it brings a simple story of courage and determination, family and struggle into a very finely made film that deserved its Oscar nominations, and possibly should have deserved a best actress award for Lawrence.",Winter's Bone

And for only two million.""There's nothing wrong, I suppose,with creating a film for Sundance, except film festival screeners and panels are not a typical audience. (Granik has the Sundance formula down pat.) Most patrons of the local multi judge their experience by how the content engages and entertains them. Judging from a worldwide gross of $6.6M, not many have taken this dreary, boring trip.This film arrives DOA. Basically a murder mystery, the film trudges through the white-trash, junk infested Ozarks in search of Daddy. Forget clandestine Meth labs and 'where's Poppa?', the most potent secret, incest, receives barely a mention. The oblique references make the story dishonest. While every other Ozark stereotype parades, there is a conceit the incest was buried deeper than dear ol' Dad - his watery, offending hands unceremoniously chainsawed as savior of victim-daughter, et al.Films as this are as clichéd as the films they're meant to program against. While their worth as art (and usually welcome counterpoint to Hollywood fodder) is critical, they must also live up to the Indie promise: uncompromising, alternative, thought-provoking, engaging tales. ""Winter's Bone"" is only partially successful.Quiet to the point of mumble, ""Winter's Bone"" flits on the surface of a fascinating subculture. The too-good-to-be-true heroine was written, directed and acted with no internal life. She's an automaton - blank eyed, flat affect - veering here and there to surmount problems finally solved by a financial deus ex machina.The supporting characters are equally bland, and no one stands out.Comparisons of ""Winter's Bone"" as this years ""Frozen River"" are unfair to that far superior story. If you're in the mood for a real post-feminist heroine, instead watch ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.""Watch ""Winter's Bone"" if you must. It'll disappear from your thoughts quickly. I applaud the effort, but decry the flmmaker's lack of conviction.",Winter's Bone
162,sgcim,Jennifer Lawrence Can't Act,3,19 November 2014,"This might have been a good movie if they hadn't chosen Jennifer Lawrence for the lead role. She had the same stupid expression on her face for the entire movie. She had the phoniest sounding Southern accent I've ever heard, and even forgot to use it many times during the film! She didn't look the part at all. She displayed very little emotion throughout the entire film. There used to be talented actresses like Sissy Spacek, and Elizabeth Hartman, and Shelley Duvall who could play roles like this. Couldn't they have found anyone other than this good looking robot to play a good role like that? I suppose they wanted to appeal to younger kids and make a lot of money, but they destroyed what could have been a good movie with such an out of place lead character. It's a shame because everything else was fine.",Winter's Bone
163,robertmaybeth,Poignant and gripping tale beginning to end - a movie that does very much with relatively little,9,23 May 2018,"This movie starts making you question things from the very beginning... As Ree, Jennifer Lawrence gives a great, genuine and very gutsy performance as a young girl that's been cornered by events not her doing. It's very easy to identify with Ree, as none of the bad things that happen to her and her family are their fault, but are all caused by her dead father. Dear old dad was apparently a big-time meth cook and has disappeared, presumed dead - but Ree has no way to prove it but desperately needs to, or else the family house will be foreclosed on and her family (a demented and psychologically unstable mom and two young siblings) will all be thrown out on the street. This movie is all about Ree's fight to find the answers she desperately needs (proof that Dad's actually dead), and how it brings her into conflict with the local Redneck meth underworld. Filmed in Branson, Missouri, the backdrop very much brings home the abject grinding poverty and desperation of the area, and the movie oozes authenticity in every scene. Moreover, what gives this movie real guts is the undercurrent that Ree is fighting not for herself but for her under-privileged family too. Ree generates real sympathy as she faces everything head-on, on her own, and never backs down an inch. This might be Jennifer Lawrence's best performance in any movie so far.",Winter's Bone

166,joncheskin,It's all about the courage,9,7 January 2015,"Winter's Bone is the critically acclaimed story of a 17-year old girl (Ree Dolly--Jennifer Lawrence) in the Ozark mountains who is thrust into the role of family provider when her father becomes a meth cooker and her mom loses her mind. This is tough enough, but when her dad uses the family property to post bond, the new threat is that he won't show up for his court date and the family, including Ree's two younger siblings, might find themselves homeless. Ree sets out on a quest to find her dad and convince him to go to court, and the resulting story is old-fashioned film noir taken to the meth belt.Most people like this movie because of the wonderful acting by Jennifer Lawrence and the excellent evocation of its unusual setting. I cannot argue against these assessments--Lawrence is really gifted and the film is wonderfully constructed, making you feel as though you have entered a strange land where you are NOT on familiar ground. I immediately wonder what folks in the Ozarks actually think of the film, since I do not know the area well myself.For all that, however, I think the film is powerful primarily because of the relationship between the actress, Jennifer Lawrence, and her character, Ree Dolly. Ree is a very sympathetic character--a lion of a human being in a kid's body, believable because humans, if pushed to an extreme, will sometimes do extraordinary things. Enter Lawrence, who seems to have something of this quality--a dose of spirit from somewhere beyond that is possessed by not one in 10,000 people. You begin to believe that, if it was Lawrence herself that was in the situation, she would react in the same way her character reacts--she is a steely-eyed actress out to blow us all away.The result is mesmerizing, because Lawrence the actress and Ree the character go from one petrifying situation to the next, and Lawrence projects the lion over and over again in a way that really tugs at our hearts. For all of the film's artistic achievements, it is the human level that is most gratifying.",Winter's Bone

169,gilligan-11,Bleak and atmospheric,7,26 March 2011,"There's no gentle way to say this—""Winter's Bone"" is a bleak, bleak movie. Which is not to say that it isn't a good movie. In fact, it is impressive in many ways. Jennifer Lawrence, in her Oscar-nominated lead role, gives an amazing performance as 17 year-old Ree, the oldest daughter of an on-the-lam fugitive and a catatonic, inert mother. Ree must take care of her two younger siblings as she searches her Ozark mountain community in search of her father, who's due to appear in court. If he doesn't, the court will take over their house and evict the family. With the help of some friends and a morally ambiguous uncle (played by John Hawkes, in a role that also earned him an Oscar nomination), Ree tries to track down her father and preserve what little sense of family she has left. Her search yields disturbing and dangerous results, and Ree is forced to face choices and consequences appropriate for someone twice her age. This is a tale of lost innocence and survival. Not a ""feel good"" movie by any means, but certainly worth seeing.",Winter's Bone

The story demonstrated more than just a normal life of a poor family, it showed us that without giving up, there was always hope for Ree. Winter's Bone is touching and thrilling at the same time, but its main element was the performance of Jennifer Lawrence.

I figured this was done to really get into this young girls problem but the only thing that's prevalent is how these kids she's doing all of this for will probably grow up and be like everyone else in this horrible town. On top of that the accent is so hard to understand, it's not so much that they speak English as it is they chew the language and spit it on the floor. I might have enjoyed it more if more of the towns folk landed up dead. But they don't. Just a slow boring ride on a broken roller-coaster towards a really obvious ending.

175,PopCulturedwithMovieMike,Meet Jennifer Lawrence,9,29 January 2014,"Winter's Bone is a bleak and gloomy glimpse at a part of America that is rarely seen. The cinematography really stands out. The Missouri countryside is captured beautifully and the conditions in which the characters live really feels authentic. There are also some very strong acting performances by relative unknowns, mainly Jennifer Lawrence, who is sure to nab an Oscar nod. Lawrence really gives a powerful performance as Ree Dolly, a 17 year old looking for her father in order to save the family house from being taken away. You can feel the pressure and stress that she is burdened with. She must take care of a sick mother and her two siblings. Ree does all this with little or no money. When her father puts the house and land up for bail and then skips out, you can feel the determination and desperation Ree has in every scene as she sets out on her journey to find him. Winter's Bone is a slow, deliberate film. The pacing might turn a lot of people off, but that's not where the film falters for me. Where it misses for me is the story and the plotting. Just when the story seems like it's going to take an interesting turn, it stops short. In the end, the final payoff is not enough. It's possible that my expectations where too high, and that's why it didn't live up to the hype for me. Winter's Bone is still definitely worth a rental. It's an interesting character study of teenage girl forced to become an adult and provide for her family. In many ways Winter's Bone feels like it takes place in another country. It's hard to believe so many people live so close to the poverty line in our own country.",Winter's Bone

178,mistabobdobolina,"Brilliantly-acted, psychologically authentic, socially perceptive, and engrossing",9,14 December 2012,"So, by now, Winter's Bone has been through the usual waves of reaction to any promising low-budget indie film. First the positive responses from critics at Cannes; then the wave of faux-contrarians who automatically dislike a thing because it is liked by critics at Cannes; well-heeled upper middle class bounders denouncing it for supposedly being ""poverty porn"" (really just denouncing the audacity of showing poor people of any kind on a movie screen, which apparently is just gauche); people denouncing it for not matching their memory of growing up (because apparently the Ozarks are unchanging, eternal and completely uniform); and various other forms of bullsh*tting and nit-pickery.On balance, though, it seems to have survived the inevitable avalanche of nonsense and emerged from it with recognition as an extraordinary, and immensely courageous, piece of filmmaking. Which, indeed, it is.The backdrop of Rhee Dolly's story is a rural America ravaged by the global economy, in which cooking meth or ""crank"" has become the entire economic engine of entire towns. This is a kind of story -- and Rhee Dolly's immediate environs the kind of neighbourhood -- familiar from across the globe in the past forty years, replicated in place after place with faces of every hue and in settings from urban ghetto to the back-est of backwoods. There's a reality, an immediacy, and (if one hasn't led too sheltered a life) an authenticity to the characters we meet in Winter's Bone: anyone familiar with impoverished and ravaged places has met and known many people not unlike this.But that's not to say they don't have their particular culture that sets them unmistakably in their own time and place: sternly patriarchal, a weird mixture of formally hospitable and deeply paranoid (even around insiders and family), populated by largely shiftless men and tough, wary women who forge their own fatalistic, thread-bare mutual-aid networks. The omerta-style code that flourishes anywhere that people are driven to the illegal economy for their livelihood is visible here, almost suffocating, presided over by local boss Thump Milton... and it profoundly shapes people's reactions to Rhee, who's distrusted by association with a father whom (we later learn) had broken it. The power of that code is vividly portrayed in Rhee herself, who adheres fiercely to it despite rejecting (for herself) other aspects of her father's lifestyle, and whose reaction on learning that her further was murdered for his weakness is not vengeful rage at his killers, but shame on behalf of her father. This is a psychologically realistic and admirably unflinching depiction of how insidiously omerta/no-snitches codes can work in real life.The performances are spare and intense, the cast and costumes look authentic to rural America (not prettified and gentrified as would be the normal Hollywood reflex) and there's a clear sense of a lot going on outside the frame. Winter's Bone isn't obsessed with the grotesquerie of addiction, which is hinted at but not seen much in the foreground. It isn't obsessed with other familiar southern Gothic grotesqueries either, though Rhee's fiery rejection of a cousin's proposal to take her brother in (owing to their impending eviction by the bondsman) certainly seems like she's reacting to a proposition from a child-molester (heavily hinted also in her later, bitter acknowledgment that these same cousins don't want to take her sister in because ""she don't shine for them""). It is in main the story of Rhee's perseverance -- both through strength of character and desperation -- in the cracks of the meth business and in the face of a visibly broken community and society; not a treacly story about the ""triumph of the human spirit,"" but a hardscrabble story about real survival and all the secrets, hypocrisies and untold violences that can come with it.There are some truly incredible standout performances here: especially Jennifer Lawrence as Rhee -- and really the whole cast of women from the crank-cooking hamlet she's trapped in -- and from John Hawkes (whom you may remember as the mild-mannered Sol Starr in Deadwood) who is extraordinarily transformed into the manically intense loose cannon Teardrop. And for visceral emotional horror, I've seen few scenes that could compete with Rhee's discovery of her father's final resting place and the soul-wrenching salvation it offers.It's a slower and less polished style of film than your average Hollywood output, but it's gripping, authentic, unflinching and well worth a watch. And a few re-watches too.",Winter's Bone

Artistically, it was a very good film, but it was hard to watch. First, it was just hard to see the squalid living conditions and the constant repression and abuse of women. Second, it was sad to see the children who had barely enough to eat and were in constant fear of losing everything.
I know there are people who actually live this way, and it's heartbreaking to watch.
As far as the actual movie, it was deep, meaningful, and well acted. I only gave it 5 stars because it was way too slow for me and it seemed like the entire movie was a long, hard, abusive search for her dad. I would rather watch something more upbeat with more of a storyline. The scenes seemed to consist of driving old beat up trucks to bars with abusive men, scraping together meals from squirrels and handouts from neighbors, and going from one ramshackle house to another where the women are scared of their husbands.

181,rddj05,"Well-crafted, Yet Not Particularly Engaging",4,12 February 2011,"Winter's Bone is a well-crafted film, written and directed by Debra Granik who appears to have quite a bit of talent. It is well-shot, its characters are clear, and overall, it's a very honest docu-drama. And yet...it doesn't quite work.My first reaction after seeing the trailer was that there was no need to see the film as the trailer told the whole story. And yet, I was reeled in by the buzz of the film and the Academy Award nominations for it's lead actress and the film itself. Supposedly, it was ""a shocking mystery that would keep you on the edge of your seat."" A few friends told me that I must see it. I figured I'd give it a shot. However, the shock and the mystery never seemed to materialize.An immediate reaction might be to see Winter's Bone in the same vein as the recent ""Frozen River"". However, where the two films diverge markedly is that Frozen River had a clear plot, an engaging lead character, and a riveting performance by it's lead actress, Melissa Leo. I couldn't find any of these elements in Winter's Bone. There was very little in the film that reeled me in.The plot is fairly simple. The story revolves around Ree; a tough, reticent, 17-year old girl, who lives with her dirt-poor family in a ramshackle house in a ""white trash"" town in rural Missouri. She is struggling to take care of both her catatonic mother and her two younger siblings.Within the first 10 minutes, we find out that her father, whom the family is estranged from, is a good-for-nothing local meth-user/dealer. He has skipped his bail after putting the family's house up as his bond. Ree now has one week to find him in order for him to appear at his trial. Normally, this is where the plot would kick into gear. And yet, it's more of a slow amble from here on out. About 20 minutes into her search, we are given more information about her father, (which isn't much of a surprise), and then everything seems to slow down from there. By the 1-hour mark, most of the mystery is solved, and all I could think is, ""what are they going to do with the last 40 minutes of the film?"" The answer was ""not much."" I certainly did't feel that the one ""shocking"" scene that happens in those last 40 minutes was enough to carry the last part of the film.The acting is good, yet not superb, and it is clear that Miss Granik used a lot of non-actors in the film. Non-actors in a piece like this can be wonderfully useful when the director is trying to add a certain verisimilitude. But you must be careful to make sure they can handle being in front of the camera, so as not to sacrifice the very honesty you are hoping to achieve with them. (For excellent use of non-actors in this year's nominated lot, see Russell's ""The Fighter"").The best performance is from a miscast John Hawkes, who does a wonderful job, yet with his diminutive size, is a bit difficult to believe as the rough and tumble character he plays, putting the fear of god into every 6 foot 3 inch, 200-pounder in town.This film won Sundance, and though it has also become a very surprising Oscar nominee, it's not hard to see a pattern emerge with the films that have been successful at Sundance over the last decade. They tend to be low-budget, gritty docudramas, about poor people living in near-squalid conditions, with minimal plot, and people who are ""just like some people I know."" Now, I'm certainly no fan of what has been coming out of the studios as of late, and yet I thought the other 9 Best Picture nominees in this year's Oscars, were all extremely well done.But if you're looking to get some attention at Sundance, I'd say it might be a good idea to start making a low-budget film about a Rwandan refugee who struggles to to bring his family to America by selling trinkets on the sidewalks of New York, while living above a ratty bodega somewhere in the Bronx. I guarantee you, you'll get a long, hard look from the selection committee, and subsequently from the audiences when it comes awards time.I think there are many good films that come out of Sundance and other film festivals around the nation, but after sitting through almost a decade of them, I can tell you that many are not strong (try sitting through Wendy & Lucy or Old Joy if you don't believe me. Two more examples of well-made, painfully unengaging films about....I'm still not sure, but hits at Sundance). I think the reason why some of these films like Winter's Bone are a bit more touted than they ought to be, is that after festival audiences are forced to see one sub-par film after another, they tend to overrate the rare film that is halfway decent. And Winter's Bone certainly is half-way decent. It is a well-made film...just not very engaging.",Winter's Bone
182,markdroulston,Fairly standard indie fare.,6,15 June 2011,"There were only two Best Picture Oscar nominees from last year that I didn't manage to see in theatres, so today I decided to catch up on one of them, Winter's Bone (The other one being The Kids Are All Right). Winter's Bone was something of a sensation on the festival circuit last year following it's debut at Sundance last year, scooping a bunch of awards and making a star of the previously unknown Jennifer Lawrence (soon to be seen in X-Men: First Class and the adaptation of the Hunger Games novels). It's a solid, moody film which is unfortunately hampered by a somewhat dull and unfocused story, a problem I see in a lot of independent drama.The setting of a small American community seemingly under the control of methamphetamine dealers makes for some beautiful and haunting imagery which matches the bleak tone well, and a feeling of cold seeps through every desaturated frame of the film. Ree (Lawrence) is a teenager struggling to raise her young brother and sister and care for her mentally ill mother, while also searching for her absentee father to ensure he makes a court appearance so the family won't be turned out of their house. She's something of a wonder-kid, selflessly juggling all of these difficulties, and it just seems a little far-fetched. In the hunt for her father, Ree visits various acquaintances to gather clues, adding a nice element of mystery to the story, but again the realism of the film's construction and performances doesn't extend to the story as Ree runs afoul of the higher-ups of the town's drug hierarchy. There is no satisfying explanation offered for why so many people react to Ree with such hostility, but the implication is that asking questions leads to trouble. However, Ree's claim that she is a ""bred and buttered"" member of the community surely extends to a knowledge of its pervasive drug influence, and the idea that a young girl would be treated so badly by so many stretches the limits of believability a little too far, and reeks of emotional pandering.While this type of overly melodramatic plot is sadly quite common in American independent productions, the quality of the acting does go a long way to redeeming Winter's Bone. The film works as a character study with Lawrence shining in every single scene, and the massively underrated John Hawkes (Me and You and Everyone We Know, Deadwood) is typically excellent as Ree's uncle Teardrop. Working with a fairly small part, Hawkes injects such humanity into the character, and he's by far the best part of the film. Lawrence is well on the way to becoming a huge star, but hopefully the success of Winter's Bone will also allow us to see more of Hawkes in future, as he's truly a class act who needs to be in more films.",Winter's Bone
183,flickernatic,Winter's Bone? Massive Bore!,2,15 October 2010,"I find it difficult to say anything positive about this movie. The plot. This is the story of a young woman who is left to fend for her two kid siblings after her druggie father is arrested and her mom can't cope. Dad has skipped bail and unless he shows up pretty damn soon, the kids get it (i.e. their house will be forfeited to the State). Will our heroine find her wayward father in time and so save the kids from a fate worse than being stuck in the Ozarks in winter without a cabin roof?Trouble is that the central characters inspire little or no empathy from the audience. The details of the plot remain obscure throughout and it's hard to care about what happens to the girl, her uncle, father, siblings, neighbours or anyone else. It is also difficult to take seriously a grizzly male character given the name 'Teardrop'. Even as symbolism this is heavy-handed; he's miserable or sad enough without rubbing it in. The movie generally fails to lift us out of our sense that we are watching a (rather bad) movie.The acting. Apparently a number of local amateurs were used, presumably for 'authenticity'. What this authentically shows, however, is that they are very poor actors. The dialogue is frequently mumbled to the point of inaudibility and there is repeated use of the 'long meaningful stare' which generally turns out to be pretty meaningless. Importantly, there is no development of the characters: they remain stuck and this robs the story of any sense of dynamism.By the time the movie reaches, very slowly (my wife fell asleep in the first half-hour), a bizarrely unconvincing climax, it's hard to still care. Besides, there are gaping holes in the story. And when, in the final scene, one of the cute kids reaches for the banjo and starts to strum, I felt distinctly queasy. (Earlier we see them being instructed in the use of firearms by big sis, pandering no doubt to the US's obsession with guns).What is 'Winter's Bone'? By the time you leave the cinema you probably won't know - and you certainly won't care.",Winter's Bone
184,istara,"Bleak, compelling picture of rural poverty in the US",8,11 June 2010,"Winter's Bone played at the 2010 Sydney Film Festival. Its setting - the landscape, the weather, the buildings - is universally bleak and wretched. There isn't even a harsh wintry beauty to be found. There is nothing but struggle, poverty, cold and decay.It's disturbing to realise that people in a western, developed country actually live like this: well below the poverty line, freezing in their homes, in sheer survival mode, hunting squirrels just to eat, reliant on neighbourly charity, facing the prospect of eviction with no apparent welfare system to support them.The casting is a real strength in Winter's Bone. Many of the lead actors look similar: the women with their long straggly hair and grim-set mouths, and the men with their lean, hungry faces masked by grizzled beards. People look convincingly inter-related, as they are supposed to be in the plot.The scene set at the auction is fascinating: to hear the strange, singing drone of the auctioneer. The traditional Ozark folk music is also used very well. You leave this film with the impression of a really distinct and little-known culture (outside America at least).The plot has the feel of a quest as the Ree Dolly - a shining performance by Jennifer Lawrence - goes from person to person trying to find her no-good father. He has put the family home up as a bond and skipped bail, and his wife and children face complete destitution unless Ree can find him. Her own survival skills are amazing: how many seventeen-year-olds in most western societies could be this tough and resourceful, able to care for and teach two younger siblings and a mentally-broken mother in a hostile, dangerous and desolate environment? Winter's Bone is a very intense and unsettling experience. The scene in the boat at night, on the freezing lake, will linger for a long time.",Winter's Bone
185,evileyereviews,A World Without Smiles,8,16 November 2010,"This unflinching flick of a world without smiles is perfectly set in the Ozark backwoods. The tone is an uncomfortable realism of moonshine hillbillies turned methamphetamine culinarians and the rampant destruction of the already tenuous infrastructure of this deeply disaffected culture. Our lead role, sublimely played by a resolute Jennifer Lawrence, reveals a willful and sadly precocious teen in a struggle that can hardly be reconciled by city-folk. As she tiptoes her way through the minefields of her kin's shenanigans, the essence of this alien world is illuminated sans the typical Deliverance stereotypes, a sort of third world habitat meaner than a chained-up pit bull. The direction was impressive, creating a world with adroit skill, a backdrop just as unimaginably entertaining than the story itself. The score was just as impressive, revealing that this might just be the real thing, a world whose typical mental fabrications usually involve inbred cannibals whose eyes are set on feasting upon each and every lost suburbanite come their way. Instead this is a flick centering upon the dark atmosphere of an America that would rather be forgotten than appreciated or succored.Genruk of Evil Eye Reviews",Winter's Bone
186,mephotography2001,Where the Family Tree Don't Fork,7,3 February 2014,"I found it interesting, gripping, suspenseful to a point, yet slow and boring through a good part of it (a better score would've helped), and overall the film had a heavy depressing feel which makes sense, considering the subject matter. The trailer made it look much more of a thriller than it ended up being, which was probably my biggest disappointment. The acting was superb which is most likely what earned it many awards, as the actors made a lot out of a simple ""a young woman trying to track down her bond-jumping father to save the family homestead"" story. There was a significant subplot about southern family ties that I personally couldn't grasp, but it was believable within the context of the film. It does not follow any standard structure, leading to a rousing climax and a satisfying payoff, but that fits the story quite well, though we are definitely left wanting more, like losing a book with 10 pages left to read. 7/10",Winter's Bone

Cinematography is well done as well, with stark shots of the rural geography which really sets a dark and dreary mood. The town's drug culture and power dynamics are set up well with the story, giving us a strong sense of how easy it is for the townsfolk to get in trouble with the rural underworld.Unfortunately, the pace of the film is at a crawl and the payoff is rather dull and expected. To me it's like the Social Network, where I'll remember the strong performances, but in the end, I would have rather not have spent the time watching the film if I knew it would be like this.",Winter's Bone
188,dennis_chiu1,Powerful Performances in a 2-Dimensional Story,7,21 February 2011,"""Winter's Bone"" by writer/director Debra Granik is a thrilling and disgusting depiction of backwoods, redneck, methlab hell. In ""Winter's Bone"", hell is a frozen Ozarks. Art makes the observer feel, and during ""Winter's Bone"" I felt disgusted, angry, and fearful, but never bored. Power in the form of main character Ree, played by Jennifer Lawrence, carries us through this miserable tale of a 17-year old girl, who must locate her criminal father or what's left of him, before bail bondsman seize the family home, where she cares for her younger brother and sister.Ree's journey takes her to one creepy, mean, cocaine snorting, criminal associate of her father after another (many of whom are to some degree blood relatives), where each question she asks might trigger her cold blooded murder. Ms. Granik does depict some social rules in this human cesspool -- blood does prove thicker than water and a bare minimum of human decency exists in the end.This is a powerful film, but is flawed. That Ree is so heroic in the face of so much adversity illustrates the two dimensional nature with which Ms. Granik handles most of the characters and subject matter. Ms. Granik only provides very brief scenes depicting depth to the culture of the Ozarks through homespun bluegrass/folk music. This film's milieu reminded me of a 2004 film titled ""Chrystal"" that I saw at the 2004 Sundance Film Festival by actor, writer, director Ray McKinnon. Mr. McKinnon chose to give the viewer more understanding of the people through greater use of bluegrass/folk music and multi-dimensional characters such as Joe, played by Billy Bob Thornton, and Pa Da, portrayed by Harry Dean Stanton. The only character in ""Winter's Bone"" that showed the same three-dimensions was Teardrop, played brilliantly by John Hawkes, Ree's uncle, who provides the real gray moral center of the film, as opposed to the white-and-black nature of Ree's moral journey.In the end, I enjoyed parts of ""Winter's Bone"" and disliked parts, so I must give it a mixed review. See it out of curiosity if you're a film buff, since it is a 2011 Best Picture Oscar nominee, but I can't recommend it for those that want a good time.",Winter's Bone
189,eucalyptus9,Scarier than a horror movie,9,19 May 2011,"This is a brilliant film, one that's stayed with me for days after viewing it. It's a remarkable depiction of another way of life.Not long ago, I spent some weeks touring Tasmania, an Australian island State surrounded by the Tasman Sea and Southern Ocean. Tasmania is wild and rugged, and incredibly naturally beautiful, but has a brutal history and a strange, eerie, atmosphere. I drove through towns in the middle of nowhere with landscape, buildings and people not far removed from those in this film. I sometimes wound up in cabins, lonely roads, bush tracks, or just the wrong place by mistake, which could be plain unsettling.I've seen similar places in North Carolina and Virginia. So I felt as though I had an immediate affinity with the locations and atmosphere of this film. The story turned out to be pretty good too, allowed to unfold slowly and subtly. The same with the characters, who revealed themselves slowly, but with a hint of greater depths and subtleties still hidden. The acting is universally superb, far superior to most of what I've seen of late (with the exception of Naomi Watts in Fair Game. Or the cast of The King's Speech). John Hawkes is terrific as Teardrop. He's not a naturally imposing character, but still conveys a sense of menace and toughness.But it's Jennifer Lawrence's film. Talk about inhabiting a role - every look, every movement, every gesture, convinces you that this IS Ree Dolly. In fact, right from the start, I pretty much forgot I was looking at actors. These people, with their dialog, their look, their stillness, seem as real as it gets, and that can be pretty scary. With Lawrence's superlative portrayal leading the way, this was a riveting movie to watch.The contribution of the cinematography, film coloring and choice of locations shouldn't be overlooked either, in lending the air of realism that the film contained. One of the best I've seen of late - definitely a 9.",Winter's Bone

192,hudsonwa,The unflinching telling of a Ozark Mountain girl's desperate quest to keep her family intact.,8,13 March 2010,"""It ain't much, but it's all we have."" Winner of two independent juries' prizes at this year's Berlinale, Winter's Bone is the unflinching telling of a Ozark Mountain girl's desperate quest to keep her family intact by finding a father who vanished after posting their home as bond.Ree Dolly (Jennifer Lawrence), the sole support of her younger brother and sister and mentally ill mother, is a classic film heroine who when up against impossible odds won't take no for an answer. Dead or alive, she must find her meth-cooking father, defying a near-cultic criminal syndicate that manufactures, supplies, and supports crank culture in the Ozarks.Based on a novel by David Woodrell and set on location in Christian and Taney counties in southwest Missouri, Winter's Bone uses experienced actors in the lead roles and local actors and residents for most of the secondary parts. Dale Dickey is electric in the role of Merab, wife and gatekeeper to the local crime lord. John Hawkes shows unexpected tenderness and loyalty as Ree's fearsome, addicted uncle. And Jennifer Lawrence inhabits the lead role with hardscrabble grit and enduring vulnerability as she tries to see her brother and sister through their own childhoods.After several scouting trips to the area, and with help from local guides to one of the North America's more exotic and dangerous locations, cinematographer Michael McDonough and production crew manage to skirt hillbilly cliché in settings of meth labs, run-down farms, and honky tonks.In one expert nighttime composition, Ree waits in her uncle's truck while he engages the opposition with some calculated violence, an American flag darkly reflected in windshield. In the Q&A, the largely German audience was particularly interested in a scene at a livestock auction. The rhythmic chant of the auctioneer was unknown to most, and there was some discussion of whether the man was singing or speaking, and what he was doing.",Winter's Bone
193,showtrmp,Well-Acted Bilge.,2,26 May 2011,"This is the most overrated movie I have seen since Clint Eastwood's ""Mystic River"". These movies think that by not resolving their plots and not providing any (intentional) entertainment value they are somehow being more gritty and honest than the usual glossy Hollywood blockbuster.Like ""Mystic River"", ""Winter's Bone"" is art-directed in shades of gray, brown, and black (the sun never shines) and almost everyone we meet is surly and close-mouthed in exactly the same way, taking forever to deliver their flat lines (a technique critics usually mistake for ""depth"".) There are good actors here, but the camera is so close and lingers so long that we see every bit of ""acting."" (""Look how trashy and illiterate I can be!"") The minimal story (girl with two younger siblings is abandoned by her no-good daddy and must find him in a certain amount of time or she will lose her house) is as old as silent movies. Frequently the movie runs out of plot and spends time on such stereotypical diversions as a squirrel hunt and a laughable pseudo-bluegrass ""singalong."" At the end, a character announces that he ""knows"" what has happened to the father and goes off to deal with it--and the movie ends! There is nothing ""groundbreaking"" or ""interesting"" about this--it's a cheat! I understand the acting nominations, but when I read critics describing this thing as ""the best movie of 2010"" I want to scream.",Winter's Bone

If it were hanging in a museum I might walk over and admire it, but I would not dream of taking it home with me because it would clash with everything. The only difference is a film is much more of an investment in time. With a painting I would at most spend a minute or two on it and walk away. With ""Winter's Bone"" I didn't like what I was seeing and it kept getting colder and colder. Like gawking into a big black canvas with twigs and a broken wooden doll glued to it, looking into the pit of despair for 100 minutes I almost felt like throwing myself in. It was a marvel that such a story with so little plot could keep turning the page the way that it did from one horrid place to the next. I thought that we would find the elusive father somewhere and then there would be something to the story— a branch to carry us to the third chapter of the film, but like all the characters in the film I lost hope there too. I would say lend me a hand or two, yet if you have seen the film you know there nothing attached.The chilling affect of ""Winter's Bone"" really needs to be experienced to be believed. Words don't do the overcast skies, rotten huddle homes, junked automobiles, dead wood trees and squirrel entrails justice. And just when you find yourself eyeball deep with everything that is gloomy, the bottom drops out and you sink deeper in cigarette ash and narcotics. Once engulfed the red theater ""EXIT"" signs beacons, becoming as tempting as following the film to its conclusion, either way is a path to freedom.",Winter's Bone

Jennifer Lawrence gives an Oscar Worthy performance as Rolly Dee. I was surprised how excellent she was, because I was sceptical of her in the ""The Bill Engvall"" show. But she turned me to a believer and boy, she can REALLY act. Her performance actually surpasses some of Meryl Streep's performances. Hopefully the Academy will recognize her and give an Oscar nomination or maybe even a win! The film is well directed by Debra Granik and is easily her best work yet. She definitely has potential to become the ""new"" Kathryn Bigelow. Anyways the film is really bleak and powerful, but it still has a tone of hopeful in it.

The women are subordinate to the men, but everyone is held accountable by someone. The women have a strict hierarchy but ultimately stick together and support each other. It's a complicated weave of loyalty and balance, that could easily be misrepresented in a movie as satire. In Winter's Bone it's handled expertly and instead becomes an incredible backdrop for an otherwise simple premise.Also, I was shocked to see that these characters were actually professional actors and not just backwoods folk they gathered to play some of the parts.

The story is simple, but the script develops each character well and yet never loses focus. The remaining cast is just as brilliant as Jennifer.What amazes me the most about this film is how well it avoids over exposure, allowing the scene and the actors to tell the tale without following the common trend of trying to serve the lowest common denominator, and sensationalize the drama.The cinematography is truly remarkable and uses well the rural backgrounds to create a sense of desolation and entrapment that this young girl experiences.

Imagine an iPhone that can send out all the e-mails or texts you want, play all the games you can think of, use all the apps you need, make all the notes you want, and use every feature it has, but has no cell reception. That is basically what this film is. It has well above average acting, pretty good directing and a satisfactory script. I had seen Jennifer Lawrence in her other roles before I saw her in this and as much as she was meant to have been an undiscovered actress at the time, I've seen her in Silver Linings Playbook and Hunger Games but still, she does a very believable job as Ree, and along with the supporting cast, and the artsy directing.All that said, this movie is very much like the faulty iPhone in that it has all the great elements for a film, except the cell reception: A PLOT! This movie has a 100 minute runtime and I can guarantee you if they cut out all the random nature scenes and scenes of lengthy, meaningless actions (walking, washing hands, staring, eating, driving) then the film would barely break an hour.

210,trentreid-1,Superb Neo-Noir With Troubling Implications,7,18 October 2010,"Rural neo-noir with a gender reversal but no real homme fatale, and some potentially problematic depiction of male legal and military authority. Institutions are not depicted in a classic noir style of course, but their opposite female network of informal ""soft"" power is portrayed as incredibly brutal of necessity/in result. This is troubling, in the sense that it could be interpreted as supportive of a victim-blaming or culture of poverty model for understanding the local dynamics on screen. The ending suggests a fragile shell of more traditional culture surviving in the old and very young, but this remainder is barely hinted at.As neo-noir it is excellent with superb direction and performances all around, but the implications of some other artistic choices were troubling. I'm curious as to what they reflect more - period genre style or a particular regional view. It is personal, which makes it moving, and the strong female lead and director build on that. But I think it reflects that experience in a depiction of informal social networks, (female power behind the throne) as cruel and backwards while institutional male authority is rigid but rational.I'd be curious to know how much of that is from the novel vs. screenplay or any improv. There's a mix of neo-noir elements with the rural coming-of-age ordeal - the latter tying into a literature and film subgenre that has been wrapped up in stereotypes, victim-blaming and a model of rural development that goes far back.But the feminist elements complicate interpretation, as female power is behind the informal power structure that is set up opposite the male-dominated military/legal authorities. Of course, the females inflict a rite of passage which is portrayed as highly ruthless and almost animalistic - which again ties into stereotypes of rural poverty as the self-inflicted product of backwards culture.The alternative to this dichotomy between informal female/formal male powers is, I think, the really interesting character of Teardrop. Of course, he stands up to both of them - but it's also partly a byproduct of him being a borderline psycho, drug-addicted 'Nam vet. It reflects many of America's social problems that make it a highly significant film. But I think it also does so in some troubling ways, characterizing these issues in ways that twist - but ultimately rely upon stereotypes and simplistic ways of blaming poverty's victims for their own lot. Survival is possible, but only through submission to primitive forms of justice - with a small hope for progress in the next generation.",Winter's Bone

Watch her stock rise in the film industry. The storyline is believable, being that there are hill-folks who make their living manufacturing meth in that part of the country.

Winter's Bone is about a teenager named Ree living in the poverty-stricken Ozark Mountains. She must care for her siblings and her apparently depressed mother. One day, the police show up at her house. They inform her that her meth-cooking father put up the house for his bail bond before vanishing. If her father does not reappear before a week, the family will lose their house. Ree then begins searching for her father deep in the mountains, asking her uncle and neighbors for help. The movie continues at a slow pace, but the plot and characters are really fascinating enough to keep you hooked for its entirety. Considering the somber tone of the story, that is really saying something. Jennifer Lawrence gives an Oscar-worthy performance as Ree. She makes you believe all the emotions and hardships she goes through while completing her journey. The remarkable script, brilliant direction, and crisp cinematography help make Winter's Bone one of 2010's most deserving awards contenders.",Winter's Bone
213,piverba,Hodge-podge of nonsense – avoid,1,24 December 2010,"This film came highly recommended by an acquaintance, so I felt obligated to see it. It turned out a sort of a dramatized detective story with obtuse chain of events. Father of a troubled family of two very young kids, one seventeen year old teen named Ree and wife who's completely lost it, disappears while have bonded his family farm. In case of his non-appearance in court the farm will be forfeited and the family will become homeless. Another possibility to save the farm is to prove that the lost fugitive father is dead.Ree is set out to do just that. First she hopes her father is still alive then after it becomes unlikely, she hopes to find his remains (his bones in the title of the film). Eventually she succeeds through perseverance and ability to 'keep her mouth shut'. The initial sympathy for a clean young girl with only one prospect in life – joining the army, is slowly waning, while the story unfolds. The girl is proud of her roots, her family. She cares for her siblings. She is self sufficient, can cook, have skills with rifle, serious – perfect canon fodder for Iraq or Afghanistan. I found the usage of the youngest sister extremely manipulative. The family lives like animals, hungry and dirty; yet traces of previous abandon (perhaps due to the drug money) is still visible. The father was involved with drugs usage, production and distribution - and I thought that was a curse of large urban centers. Seems like all father's relatives, living near-by are also involved with the drugs. The relatives eventually end the father despite of their blood connection – father allegedly squeal on them.The symbolic order controlling narrative shows Ozarks farmers, as a whole, a kind of drug pins, mostly due to blood association. They are indignant, yet show traces of honor, friendly and hospitable, yet capable of murder. If this is a device to create ambiguity, then it is a success. If I would be living in the Ozarks, I would wish to do something bad to the film director for this unflattering generalization. After watching this film I felt annoyance with country music, which I love, but somehow this film made me hate it. I had an unpleasant feeling of being dirty and the urgent need to take a shower.",Winter's Bone

216,lunchboxwanderer,"Very, very good film. Almost excellent.",9,23 June 2013,"'Winter's Bone' is a nuanced and excellently constructed film.The characters are portrayed brilliantly by the this fine cast of actors. The roles are played so well that the word ""believable"" would be a gross understatement.The lead, Jennifer Lawrence, has an extremely bright future. I see why she got the lead in The Hunger Games' and 'Silver Linings Playbook.' This young lady has at least one Academy Award in the near term.John Hawkes nailed his role. However, his acting is so consistent it's almost become under appreciated. He needs some bigger roles, he can carry a film.The directing was almost perfect. There were a couple of lulls, but in a way, they added to the suspense.What I really appreciate about the directing though is the actors were allowed to act.The scenes, through effective dialogue (no unnecessary banter), facial expressions and background were left to speak for themselves.The film had a quality that rewarded the viewer if the requisite attention to detail was paid.That said, for me it became exponentially more rewarding.I could go on and on, but if you haven't seen this film, do so.It's high quality, an oasis in the Hollywood desert.9/10",Winter's Bone

218,myc4971,This is why you make movies!,9,16 December 2010,"For those who dismissed this movie as downright boring, I'd like you to consider the reason why artists create pieces... why writers write stories --- because they feel that there is a story to be told and they have a unique point of view.This movie is an excellent demonstration of just that. It tells a story that needed to be told --- an important one, at that. Sure we watch movies to be entertained but I'd like to think if you're going to waste 2 hours of life, it might as well be spent discovering a world that's entirely different from the one that you're living in.This is not a sad movie. In fact, it's a movie about hope... about finding simple joys in life and how sometimes the things that we regard as a right is actually a luxury for some. No the movie did not went all preachy --- it just simply followed the journey of an ordinary girl who needs to find his father to keep their house. Sure, the situation, the living conditions and the environment that the movie's set is bleak, dirty and dire. But looking past that, you can see that Ree (Lawrence) was actually happy --- as long as she can look after her family... as long as they can survive. To some that's pitiful but not to Ree.I like how the movie kept it simple and just stayed on the story without complicating the plot or forcing it to be sentimental and melodramatic. The result: it successfully essayed the central characters and sharper focus on the main story. It's quite amazing how Lawrence was able to carry the movie considering she's relatively a newbie.One of the best films of 2010. I'll recommend anyone who has an open mind to watch it.",Winter's Bone
219,barrwell,"hey if the last film you saw was a sequel, you might not like 'Winter's bone'",9,12 August 2013,"I don't agree with the people who get on here and try to tell others not to watch a movie. Most of today's films are just a rehash of some other financially successful similar film, or worst of all -sequels. So many garbage films how can you trust someone who watches a lot of today's movies? I watch few newer films and when I do it is something like 'Winters bone', an original, stark and realistic film shot on location in the Missouri Ozarks.Ree Dolly (Jennifer Lawrence) is a 17 year old who is raising her two younger siblings in the absence of her father, and the debilitating mental illness of her mother. The Ozark mountains in recent decades has experienced an epidemic of meth ""cooking"" and Winters bone takes us inside an extended family that has become deeply immersed in drugs. Ree's father has been running meth-labs and is in deep trouble with the law and has apparently hit the road...at least that is one possibility, and the sheriff now is telling Ree that if he doesn't show up for a court date Ree and her family will lose their home, which dad had used as collateral to a bondsman.This is the setup for Rees journey to find her father and keep her family together. Her uncle Teardrop (John Hawkes, perfectly cast) warns her to stay away from the family and their business, but Ree is determined and sets out, mostly on foot, deeper into the hidden crevices of this area that time has left behind. She is fearless and defiant, and Lawrence brilliantly captures the aura of a young woman who has grown up being taught the things that children just are not taught in today's America -not just the hard work like chopping wood, but shooting and hunting and gutting a squirrel, and some touching scenes show her teaching some of these things to her much younger brother and sister. At first I thought she may look a little too clean for the part, her skin too clear, but she quickly grew on me in what is a fully convincing performance.Winter's bone is much more than the story, this is deeply rooted in the location depicted, and people who love location photography and the lay of the land, a part of America that hasn't changed much in 100 years, will appreciate the visual aspects of this film. I was reminded a little of 'Deliverance' or the little known Walter Hill film 'Southern comfort' when watching Winter's bone. To have seen and enjoyed either of those two films is to understand what to expect from this kind of environment. I love unique settings like this, a nice piece of Americana full of local flavor and I think the filmmakers understood this well as several of the actors were Ozark mountain locals and they add to the ardent realism of the film.What also shines through is the hope, the hope and strength of this incredible 17 year old woman who faces challenges that contemporary women, for all their talk of ""having it all"" (career, family. etc), could never handle. That's all she knows -how to survive, against all kinds of odds...it's her bread and butter...and to those who would say ""don't waste your time on this movie"", I would say...don't waste your time trying to be a film critic.",Winter's Bone
220,crooked_spoons,A long meandering tale that goes absolutely nowhere.,6,26 September 2011,"I, like many others, saw Winter's Bone amidst a whirlwind of deafening Oscar buzz. Every where you turned critics were falling all over themselves to praise this movie. Open up a news paper or turn on the TV and your favorite reviewer was practically wetting themselves in either anticipation or admiration of this movie. Favorite critical catchwords like 'haunting', 'heartbreaking' and 'gripping' were being thrown around like confetti at the Rose Parade. Like a sucker, I bought it.Winter's Bone is nothing more than a formulaic indie tale that plods along at a snail's pace with a pretty but humble lead actress, one of many in a burgeoning genre of literature and film affectionately called 'Country Noir'. Like so many indie's, it relied too heavily on slow pacing, authentic regional dialect and ""characters"". We were thrown into the middle of a story and expected to watch and care with rapt attention, overwhelmed by the gritty realism and the plight of the people involved.I'd be lying if I said it didn't feel authentic as hell. The director certainly did her job choosing a good cast and the writers thankfully didn't opt to throw it every Appalachian stereotype in the book.Meanwhile, as the movie was busy doing such a great job of engrossing the audience with settings and authentic feeling characters, it was failing on film's most basic level — possessing a compelling plot. This was one of those movies that keep you on the edge of your seat, not because it's all that interesting, but because you're half about to walk out and half glued to your chair, waiting for a point to present itself. Never have I ever left a theatre more stunned and disappointed. There was very little suspense and zero character development.I will not say that Miss Lawrence isn't a qualified actress, or that her Oscar nod was undeserved for the masses seem to think she's a rare gem. I will agree that she is a good actress but I refuse to call her performance phenomenal nor her acting skills tremendous or well cultivated, mainly because her role as Ree didn't exactly call for the performance of a lifetime. She's a pretty blonde in a long line of pretty blonde actresses who played a 'tough cookie' and dressed herself down a little.Simply put, I didn't like it and despite the cliché, it's one of those movies where I am deign to say it was, yes, overrated.",Winter's Bone
221,riva-910-797068,Stark and chilling,8,28 December 2010,"It is hard to believe that some people still lead such frontier like existences. Even though this movie is set in Missouri, you would think it was in the hills of the Appalachian. Ree Dolly (Jennifer Lawrence) is the matriarch of her family at the tender age of 17. She takes care of her mentally ill mother, her younger sister and brother as best she can as her drug making/dealing father has left the family to tend for themselves.Ree is informed by a bounty hunter that the house they live in has been put up as bond for her father who has a pending court date. If he is not found and presented in court they will lose their home. So, Ree takes it upon herself to find her wayward father. What follows is are encounters that I could only describe as scary. Scary because these people she is seeking out for information are her own relatives. This movie is a perfect example of, with family members like these who needs enemies. Jennifer Lawrence's performance commands your attention. She portrays a believable strength and resilience of a mature actor. You feel her frustration and lack of opportunity in the way she delivers a line or when in her silence. There are scenes where you feel for the desperation of this child's circumstances or fear for her life. The audience almost grieved for her when the army recruiter told her to stick it out at home because she was needed and not to enlist. Or felt the pain when she is revealed to the audience after a ""conversation"" with a group of distant female relatives. If this is how they deal with their ""family"", anybody else doesn't stand a chance.The code of secrecy in this community is one that WILL be adhered to by all its inhabitants. When that code is broken; there are dire consequences. Through all of the poverty and crime Ree pushes on to find her father in order to secure her family.This movie reminds me when I am traveling across this great nation of ours; stick to the main roads.

223,AverxgeJoe,A real movie,8,8 December 2014,"You don't need a big budget to make a great movie. Winter's Bone proves that. It's a movie about real characters and real life in backwoods USA. It's a gripping story about a young woman Ree Dolly and her struggle. Her father has pawned their house and lands for bail from jail. He's gone missing and now Ree has to find him. If she doesn't find him till the court day and his father doesn't show up they lose their house. Ree gradually finds out more about his father disappearance. We don't get know too much too fast and it's good cause it's keeps the viewer guessing.The movie has a sense of realness to it. The atmosphere is bleak and almost hopeless throughout the whole movie and this is also seen in the cinematography. Colors are cold and gray for the majority of the movie. The score sits well with the atmosphere. It's beautiful and almost haunting at times. The movie is tense and keeps you watching it closely.The acting is top notch. Jennifer Lawrence is amazing in her role. She captivates Ree's character so well. Not only via dialogue but her expressions are really good. Ree is a young woman who's had to grow up very quickly in order to take care of her family, without her father. She is tough and Lawrence makes sure the audience knows that. In a supporting role we see John Hawkes as Ree's uncle. Who seems like a hard and even scary person, but he has a great story arc. There is not a bad thing that can be said about his performance. In general the characters feel very genuine and real. Movie's script is very good one of the best of the year and the dialogue between the characters is nice to listen.I saw this movie back when it came out on DVD, but I didn't write reviews then. I just saw this for the second time and since I recently started writing (or at least I'm trying to write) some reviews, I thought might as well do a review on this one.",Winter's Bone
224,GrowMagicBeans,"Dark, morose, thrilling and suspenseful",9,22 September 2010,"The plot in itself is relatively simple: a girl named Ree Dolly (Jennifer Lawrence), who is looking after her younger brother, sister and disturbed mother, must find her estranged father. The father had put the house and land up for bond to secure his bail. If he does not show for court, then the young seventeen year old and her family will be thrown out of the house with nowhere to go. She is already struggling to make ends meet, but without a roof over her head, she, and her family, will be left completely destitute.There are no major plot twists, but rather a storyline that continues to build and develop in a steady and revealing manner. It is like we have all the pieces to the puzzle from an early stage, but only as we begin to fit them together, does the true picture reveal itself.Ree Dolly must confront her extended family and neighbours, in order to ascertain the whereabouts of her father. Like a clap of thunder ready to explode, these scenes herald great tension. Within an intimidating environment, nobody seems to want to talk, and Ree, through her nagging questions, is met only with contempt. At first it appears that the women in this male dominated society have no voice. Ree is questioned by one woman, ""have you got no man to talk for you?"" Ree's best friend cannot even get a lend of a pickup truck for a couple of hours from her husband as she explains to Ree that things change when you're married. There is even an air of violence when Ree's own uncle, Teardrop (John Hawkes) grabs Ree by the throat in a threatening manner.Things are not always as they appear on the surface however. Cracks begin to appear and the blanket of denial slowly begins to lift. There is a strange dynamic in the life of these mountain folk, and we, as the audience, are totally absorbed into the subtle undercurrents at play in this world. ...the best friend eventually manages to weasel the truck out from under her man of course; and we learn that Teardrop's motivations may have be spurred on through a desire to protect the young girl rather then maliciously trying to hide the truth from her; even the estranged father manages to make somewhat of a recovery in character as the revelations of his disappearance become apparent. The men may make a lot of threats and gesticulation, but in truth the female characters turn out to be among the most vicious. Dale Dickey is utterly terrifying as the hard-boiled, ruthless and resourceful, Merab. This character juxtaposes the nervous wreck of Ree's mother, thus posing the question, what extremes are the woman in this hellish world doomed to? We can only hope that Ree can find a mid-ground as she traverses mind games and minefields.Although the theme my strike some as being incredibly dark and morose, the picture manages to be relatively uplifting in so far as, as we come to sympathise with Ree, we watch her grow in resolve and character. The resolution of her immediate crises may not be a long lived reprieve from her enduring squaller, but at least we see her further enabled to cope, come what may. Well worth a watch.

The actor nominated in supporting role, John Hawkes deserves an award rather than her. Besides I've seen a good movie I can tell, well done.

Adapting the story from Daniel Woodrell's novel, co-writer/director Debra Granik takes full advantage of the harsh Missouri landscape in order to examine the cruel mindset of some of the meanest people you'll ever encounter. Granik manipulates the narrative and natural images with a poetic energy that Jennifer Lawrence fulfills with astonishing braveness and integrity.

Everyone was brilliant. Jeniffer Lawrence's Blow me away. the Depth that she Brings is unimaginable. She is DARK, but at the same time loving,she is angry but she doesn't want to show it and the sense of responsibility that she has is admirable.One thing that really bothered me was that Jeniffer Lawrence Did Not win the Oscar which she was nominated for. I think the only reason that she was beaten by Natalie Portman was that Jeniffer wasn't as famous as Natalie Portman. Just as simple as that ! Because if you want to compare the performance, Jeniffer NAILED it !! John Hawks Plays a character that I personally think fits him beautifully. and it earned him an Oscar nomination which i agree with.One Other interesting Element in this movie, is that you actually FEEL the Coldness. I know it sounds crazy but you do feel it. The Sound of walking on snow...the light direction..the sound editing and makeup, Everything makes you feel the cold and i think that is something really really hard to pull off.At the end if you want to watch a movie that will keep your Mind busy for days, this would surely be a great choice.9/10 Overall.",Winter's Bone

Filmmaker Debra Granik has done a remarkable job in communicating an ultimately hopeful vision of a dirt-poor family in the Ozarks threatened by the epidemic of methamphetamine drug abuse. She has elicited extraordinary work from the acting ensemble she's put on screen. Jennifer Lawrence and John Hawkes give standout performances as seventeen year-old Ree and her uncle, Teardrop. But the entire cast is tuned to the same pitch and the result is a movie that not only holds a dark mirror up to the hardscrabble lives portrayed but one that also makes the viewer care deeply about those lives. I've sometimes heard singers and musicians speak about hitting a note ""smack in the middle."" This movie does the same thing in cinematic terms. This isn't a movie for viewers who are looking for a ""feel-good"" experience; it's a movie for adults who recognize that life -- any life -- is worth fighting for and who realize that that fight must be fought for on the terms that life offers.

Sounds good, isn't it? Well, let me tell you in advance: It isn't that good. If there's something clear about this film, it's that this is probably the best Jennifer Lawrence performance to date. The way she makes the viewer believe in how Ree feels, to see the realness in it, is astounding. Really, if you still doubt about her acting skills this is a way to prove you wrong.And that's all the good about this movie, because the plot is just bad. Is frustrating how plain is in the first two thirds of the film, how it starts getting more intense in the third... and how anticlimactic is in the end.

231,Evan_Wheatley,"Hillbillies, drugs and Katniss Everdeen",9,11 April 2017,"Nominated for two Academy Awards and winner of the Grand Jury Prize: Dramatic at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival, Debra Granik's ""Winter's Bone"" ranks among the top films to come out of Sundance in recent years.Adapted from Daniel Woodrell's novel of the same name, the film follows 17-year-old Ree Dolly, played by Jennifer Lawrence, and her struggle to provide for her mentally ill mother and younger siblings in the fallout of her father's disappearance. Her father is out on bail following his arrest for manufacturing ""crank"" (methamphetamine), and is soon scheduled to appear in court. Ree is told that if he does not show up for his court date, her family will lose their home. Determined to ensure a hopeful future for her siblings, Ree sets out to find her father in a family- and drug-centered culture of southern Missouri.The film opens with a wide shot of the landscape. Rolling hills of green and grey overlook a valley of mobile homes and rusted vehicles, with a lone, naked tree resting in the foreground. An a cappella rendition of ""The Missouri Waltz"" is sung as Ashlee and Sonny Dolly play outside on their trampoline. Ree hangs laundry out to dry and repairs Ashlee's baby doll before calling her siblings to come inside. The sequence ends with the words, ""Winter's Bone"" superimposed on a silhouette of barren trees.Filmed entirely on location in Missouri's Christian and Taney Counties, the opening minute and a half of ""Winter's Bone"" captures the ruggedness of its setting. While not everyone who views the film will be familiar with Missouri's Ozark region, most southern viewers will recognize the rural and impoverished neighborhoods depicted and the hillbilly archetype of the film's characters. This is largely due to Granik's desire for an authentic setting.She and her crew ventured six times to southern Missouri during pre-production, taking notes and seeking out local guides for assistance. Three families in Forsyth, Missouri allowed Granik and her crew to use their homes as sets for the film, and very little was altered to the families' property during production.The people of Christian and Taney Counties were as vital to the film's authenticity as the location itself. Local residents such as William White, Ashlee Thompson and Isaiah Stone contributed their accents and knowledge of the culture to their roles of Blond Milton, Ashlee Dolly and Sonny Dolly respectively. Other Missouri natives added improvised dialogue for their characters, one being Ron ""Stray Dog"" Hall, who plays Thump Milton in the film.Granik also discovered and enlisted the talent of American folk singer and Missouri native, Marideth Sisco for the soundtrack of ""Winter's Bone."" A scene from the film's second act features Sisco and a group of musicians casually playing ""High on a Mountain"" as Ree arrives at April's house in search of her father. Four of Sisco's recordings are used in the film: ""The Missouri Waltz,"" ""High on a Mountain,"" ""Come All Ye Fair and Tender Ladies"" and ""Farther Along."" Her raw; yet soothing vocal style plays an important role in bringing the rural Ozark culture to life on screen.The meth capital of the United States serves as the cultural backdrop for the narrative of ""Winter's Bone."" As depicted in the film, family ties and regional loyalties govern the more remote areas of southern Missouri. While Granik shows the impact that meth manufacturing has on a local community, she avoids depicting drug use in a negative or positive light in the film.""He cooks crank,"" Ree says to her cousin Megan.""They all do now. You don't need to say it out loud,"" Megan replies.The film's dialogue and character interactions reveal that the community's drug problem is acknowledged simply as the way things are. Ree's Uncle Teardrop casually snorts crystal meth in front of her twice in the film; the second time with a cigarette in his other hand. Her cousin Little Arthur asks Ree if she ""want's a line"" or if she would like to ""blow some smoke"" when she asks him about her father's whereabouts. When she refuses, he bangs his hands down on his coffee table and tells her that he has nothing else to offer. Even Ree herself, despite avoiding the use of crank, still understands that it is at the core of her family's identity and the society in which she was raised.""I'm a Dolly, bread and butter,"" Ree says in the film.Granik seems to enjoy telling stories that use drug addiction as a key component. Her first feature film, ""Down to the Bone,"" like ""Winter's Bone,"" neutrally depicts drug use while showing the impact it has on a young woman's life. Both protagonists hit rock bottom in each film, but, like Katniss Everdeen in ""The Hunger Games"" franchise, persevere to overcome their respective struggles.In fact, Gary Ross, director of ""The Hunger Games,"" was interested in Lawrence for the role of Katniss because of her breakout performance in ""Winter's Bone."" Fans of the young adult dystopian films will undoubtedly fall in love with Ree, as her characterization strongly resembles that of the girl on fire.The brilliance of ""Winter's Bone"" is found in its simplicity. Woodrell's novel told Granik and her team where to go and they went, crafting an authentic mise-en-scène for the film along the way. Within this setting, Granik tells the relatable story of a young woman who loves her family; who goes the distance to save her home. With another feature film in the works with ""bone"" in the title, we certainly haven't seen the last of Debra Granik. Her meticulous direction coupled with Lawrence's performance is where ""Winter's Bone"" shines.",Winter's Bone

233,Miakmynov,An engrossing slice of backwoods American life,7,20 June 2010,"Just back from seeing this at the Edinburgh Film Festival, and at the Q&A afterwards, the director, Debra Granik (refreshingly eloquent and well beyond the usual wanting to thank the world and his wife for being here at EIFF) described her film's subject matter as 'hard scrabble'. Although she wasn't referring to a Russian Roulette version of the popular literacy board game (now there's an idea for a film...), it was an evocative description of the tough slice of backwater American life served up here. The basic storyline – a teenagers plight to save her dependent family from imminent homelessness because of the actions of an errant and now-absent father – felt both authentic and compelling, as did the way the local community closed in around her, meting out both violence and support in equal measure.Using grey and oppressive colour tones, the entire film is shot in a bleak wooded landscape, where the grizzle-bearded men all look like they've just left the set of 'Southern Comfort', and the straggle-haired, world-weary lined faces of the women add to the unspoken sense of the harsh reality of life here. I doubt they see many tourists in this neck of the woods, and at the same time, the film steers well clear of the 'and if they did, they'd probably eat them' stereotype. I liked the sparse and effective use of bluegrass-folky-type music, which cut through, and gave some relief to, an otherwise fairly unremitting sense of hopelessness.Although the subject matter is an uncompromising reality-check to much of the superficial Hollywood drivel that fills our multiplexes, this is not a hard watch. At its' heart, it's a good story, well-told, with excellent central performances (particularly John Hawkes and Jennifer Lawrence) and an open-hearted sense of the local community here, in spite of their bread-line existence. 7/10.",Winter's Bone

235,leereddy,Life should not be this hard for a seventeen year old girl.,8,17 September 2012,"Winters Bone is an American independent film adapted from Daniel Woodrell's 2006 novel of the same. The film is set in the unforgiving mountain range of the Ozarks in central America.In the opening scene we are introduced to the films central character, Ree Dolly, as well as her two young siblings. Their sparse, poverty stricken existence is apparent from their humble, ramshackle dwellings that are to be pivotal to the films story.Along with her brother and sister, Ree is the custodian for her mentally ill mother who we learn very little about other than she has abdicated the upkeep and care of the family to her 17 year old daughter.Life for the Dolly family is arduous in a way few of us can relate to. How many 17 year old girls for example find themselves having to teach their siblings the necessary skills required to survive that include hunting squirrels, along the subsequent skinning and gutting of said woodland creature.And as if life isn't already difficult enough, we soon learn that the absentee father figure is a meth dealer who has skipped bail after having put the family residents up as collateral. Ree is suddenly face with the egregious news that unless her father can be located and forced to appear for his bail hearing, the family will effectively find themselves homeless. What ensues is Ree's quest to track her father down in a community ravaged by both poverty and drug abuse. He ordeal is made all the more onerous by the fact that most of the people she is forced to confront are dangerous, tight lipped junkies with whom she has some convoluted relation to. As she ambulates her way around town she is met with much encumbrance, usually with the caveat that any further enquiries will be met with violence.The films lead, Ree, is portrayed by Jennifer Lawrence who puts forth one of the most incredible performances from a young actress I have ever seen. Her effortless turn is both sublime and heartbreaking. John Hakes, who plays her terrifying uncle - Teardrop Dolly, also puts in an amazing effort as the brother of the missing father. Within this role we see a fascinating story arc evolve.Little more can really be said of this picture other than it is a must see for all serious film lovers. The acting is superb and the directorial skills of Debra Granik are exceptional. The way the cinematography somehow takes this bleak and dejected setting and make it look stunning, in a melancholy fashion, is further testament their skills as film makers.The film has some shocking and fairly disturbing moments, to say the least, yet afterwards I felt uplifted by both the story and the outstanding piece of work I'd just seen.",Winter's Bone
236,woutervandersluis,Why liberal movie makers make films about Trump lovers?,8,29 April 2018,"A wonderful movie to watch; the nature and the people in the movie are fascinating. But what was it all about? A view on people who live at the edge of society, living a dismal life of cruelty, crime, drugs, anti-law and suppression of women? Sure that is it but I sense more in this movie like in many other American movies about borderline people in the countryside. It seems the movie makers of these films are looking for something genuine American under all tha raw behavior: independence of modern urban life which tries to overpower them. The state and all what is represent. In this movie 'Winters Bone' the independence of the person, his or her house and property is prominent all the time and the means to defend them by guns. And there is despite the drugs which sooth the rawness and pain of this life an admiration for this independence as something untouchable and at the hearth of being American.
That is strange cause it are these people who admire Trump in his outspoken right wing and racist policies. Would these film makers in their hearth also admire Trump and not the soft liberal attitudes of the millennials in the city? Those are mostly portrayed in the movies as failures, estranged people in their urban life. The hillbillies are in the end not failures but proud people.",Winter's Bone
237,dalefried,Brilliant Genre Bender and Thematic Cauldron,10,25 September 2010,"Watching this film the first time you will see one of the most accessible, compelling, and almost entirely straight narrative films this year. As a film snob, I tend to like them more visually challenging and time bending. Nonetheless, I was entirely blown away in my first viewing and simply could not get this movie out of my mind for the rest of the film festival I was attending.In quiet repose, the vapor trails coalesce around two things when you try to explain Winter's Bone to others. From the view of genre it goes everywhere: mystery, noir in gray tones, gangster, thriller, almost horror and a brilliant, stark family drama. Then there are the themes that rage quietly behind the scenes: hopelessness in poverty, good transcending almost demonic evil, an unbridled feminist treatise, nobility free poverty, drug culture ripping social fabric asunder, and family is your trump card for everything.This really grasps you like a whirling dervish in a cauldron, so powerful it takes your thoughts so many places so quickly.The source of all this is a startling story and screen rendering by one who may become a great young female director. The performances, likely coaxed by this great director, stun you silent.Plus it contains possibly the greatest role model for the young ever put on film, performed in true star making brilliance if seen beyond the art houses where characters like me reside.In the end, after five viewings, it stands as my favorite film seen since American Beauty, therefore placing it in my favorite ten all-time. Please see this before it shocks you when its name appears on year end awards lists.",Winter's Bone
238,blackfirepro,"""Never ask for something that ought to be offered"" - Ree Dolly",9,10 October 2010,"This is perhaps the grimmest, darkest, and most sombre tale of the passed few years. It is deeply stirring and thought-provoking, dishing out for its audience an immensely sad slice of life. Probably the main theme of this film is hopelessness and how we deal with it. Its characters are hopeless and hopelessly lost in this surreal world of poverty, drugs, and brutality. The audience is hopeless that its characters could possibly live happily ever after. Even the dark, almost colorless cinematography carries an air of hopelessness with it. It is a truly bleak and grizzly fable that plays before our eyes like nothing we've ever seen. I have seen many a motion picture, but none I've seen is at all like this one. It is a truly original movie, even thought it was based on a book. Neither the story, nor the characters, nor the oddly unsettling vibes radiating from the screen have ever really been presented before. Because it is like nothing I've ever seen, I had no idea in which direction the film would go next. I kept expecting specific things to happen, but they never did. And certain things that did happen caught me completely off guard. Finally I realized that this film wasn't built on plot points. It was built on a whole. They picture can't be examined scene by scene like most can because the scene flow together seamlessly like real life. There is no telling where one event begins and the next ends. This could be the most relentlessly realistic film I've seen in a while. Instead of following a formula like even the greatest movies do, Winter's Bone takes its own path in telling the audience what it needs to know, and it takes its time getting there.The premise is basically this: Jessup Dolly is a meth cooker who signs off his entire property as a bond for his bail after he is arrested. Once he is released on bail, he runs and pretty soon the law comes knocking on the Dolly family's door telling them that they will loose their house unless Jessup can be found. Jessup's daughter, Ree, looks around at her brother and sister and her emotionally distant mother and wonders what to do without a house. Then, without batting an eye, she firmly tells the county sheriff that she will find him herself. So begins her journey into a dangerous world inhabited mostly by other meth cooking relatives who are often both scary and sympathetic at the same moment. No one wants to help Ree maybe because they're just mean and hostile hillbillies, or maybe because they are afraid of what they may discover if they do help her. The thing I love most about the story is that there are no heroes and no villains. There are just people. People who for some reason known but to God, have been sentenced to live out their life in total ignorance and despair. Every character has numerous flaws, and every character has some qualities. Our ""heroine"", Ree, is hardly perfect. She is often mean and cruel and terribly cold when it comes to her emotions. She is often unlikable, but for some reason we identify with her. The rest of the people in this desolate backwoods universe are equally as cruel and determined as she. The one and only relative who is willing to even remotely help Ree is her uncle Teardrop (John Hawkes). Although he can be just as evil and scary as the rest of the family, there is a streak of nobility in him that stops him form alienating Ree the way the rest of these dark souls do. So together, Ree and Teardrop do their best to find Jessup, but what waits down the road may be even more horrific and painful than being thrown off their property.The film is a subtle, quiet, and utterly satisfying film with numerous unidentifiable themes. Perhaps the highlight of the production is Jennifer Lawrence's performance as the aforementioned Ree. In a role where most actresses would have gone wrong (either by over acting or becoming too emotional in their performance), Lawrence plays this poor girl to perfection. I can't really find a flaw here. She is not over-emotional in any way, nor is she too detached so as to become aloof to the audience. She travels through this bleak and dark film in a way that many other actresses would envy. In short, perfection. I would be surprised if there isn't an Oscar nomination for her. Of course the film is also beautifully shot. The cinematography by Michael McDonough is absolutely breath taking. It is dark and gray, and often times we can't hardly see anything. Some of the shots are so bleak and grim, evoking strong emotional responses form the audience. Every frame is so meaningful, and the spare use of colors only defines the meaning even more. The visual style is poignant and beautiful, giving the film a mood like no other.I have to say, I loved this movie. It is probably the best of the year so far and I doubt it will be topped. The film is so well-executed in every way. Its performances are subtle and moving, the story though grim and violent at times is utterly thought provoking. This is one of those rare gems of a movie that comes along every now and then to really wow an audience. If you are a smart person, do yourself a favor and go see this. You will not be sorry. Winter's Bone is a stunning, beautiful, and grizzly depiction of the dark side of America. It is perhaps the darkest movie out this year. Nonetheless, it is truly a great movie in every sense. Nothing is wrong with it. If I could name a flaw, don't you think I would? Fabulous.www.colewebbharter.com",Winter's Bone
239,jerrybrsc2,What did I just watch?,8,15 April 2012,"I just recently saw Winter's Bone, so I already knew about the hype and and Oscar buzz surrounding it from 2010, so I had some pretty high expectations for the film to live up to, and HOLY CRAP. This movie is fantastic. From the acting, to the direction, to the storytelling, all are fantastic and have this visceral feel to every scene. If you don't know the story of Winter's Bone, which would be a little strange since you're reading a review on it, it centers around Jennifer Lawrence's character, Ree Dolly, and it's fallen to her to try and support and defend her family while her drug-dealing father has skipped out on her family, leaving the world that Ree has built for her family to come crashing down. First of all, let's talk about what really worked for me. First of all, Jennifer ""Freakin'"" Lawrence. Her performance is absolutely captivating and purely entrancing. She infuses her character with such strength and a vulnerability that's rare to come by in films today. In addition to Jennifer Lawrence, John Hawks gives a wrenching and heart-felt performance that's undeniably one of the best I've seen in years, and the local actors enlisted to fill out the universe in which Winter's Bone takes place are all perfect for their roles too. The direction by Debra Granik is superb. She has such respect for the source material and is clearly interested in telling the story, and doing it well. The story is, of course, based on a novel and the translation is excellent. As for what I didn't like, there isn't much of anything, there are a couple parts where it slowed down and where the pacing was just a little off, but honestly, I just attribute this as a necessary part of the story. There wasn't any one part where I thought to myself, ""Oh, that part needed to be cut out"". So overall, Winter's Bone was an exceptional film filled to the brim with incredible performances and excellent story telling. 8/10 Stars. I really hope you like this review and hope you take it into consideration if you consider seeing the film or not. Thanks.",Winter's Bone
240,paddy-56,Save yourself the time.,1,14 November 2010,"I'm a movie junkie and, like most movie junkies, have a few guilty pleasures on my shelf. One thing that I do demand of a movie is a story. What I can't abide are terrible little films that get ""good buzz"". One recent example was the Blair Witch Project. Lots of buzz, but it basically revolved around bad camera angles and close ups of some chick's snot.Nothing, absolutely nothing, can redeem Winter's Bone. I honestly can't think of a movie worse than this one. The acting is wooden, characters meaningless, hollow and the epitome of one dimensional. Do yourself a favour and save your time for something good, worthwhile, or at the very least, with a story. I cannot understand the, ""Oscar Buzz"", around this film.

241,smiley_pat77,it's built to be driven by both plot and character but only achieves one of the two.,8,17 July 2010,"The character of Ree is something to behold. To see the world she lives in will astound you enough, let alone how she manages to live in it. She is mighty and fierce but yet so human. She does not back down even though she often can't handle the fight. She is naive perhaps, but if she wasn't then she wouldn't be a believable 17-year-old.Her future has very little promise. She is left with a mentally invalid mother and two younger siblings to raise. Her initial desire to join the army establishes a vague notion that she has aspirations for her life, but more importantly it solidifies the commitment she is willing to make to help her family. By the end of the ordeal that is the plot of ""Winter's Bone"", her path becomes more uncertain than ever. She says to her brother and sister, ""I would be lost without the weight of you two on my back."" That phrase resonates with you and couldn't be anymore accurate (or unsubtle). She is someone who knows nearly nothing else in life but surviving and helping her siblings survive. Yet she is determined to do those things right and well in a community where so much is wrong.This character is truly a tribute to those youth whose lives are in some way restricted by their habitat or any circumstances beyond their control. The backbone and discipline they have is both astounding and heartbreaking. Jennifer Lawrence knows the age of her character and plays her accordingly with the appropriate amount of wariness but yet youthful optimism. She gives us hope for the character's future based on her determination but yet leaves us with uncertainty towards the stability of that hope in the years to come.The plot to ""Winter's Bone"", while substantial enough and full of intensity at moments, really doesn't do much for the film with its disappointing lack of compelling mystery that you would expect given the premise. It winds up playing a supporting role with its partially unmotivated pacing that seems to do little but continue to further the story in an adequately efficient, even if not preferable, manner. The ending will intrigue you but the journey there just isn't as memorable.What you will take away from the film is a look at the world Bree is confined to and her ability to stay afloat in it. Unfortunately, this is a story that is built to be driven by both plot and character but only achieves one of the two.",Winter's Bone

Sometimes a nomination doesn't equal enjoyable.The movie was so depressing in it's depiction of it's character's lives, that I thanked my lucky stars for the life I have. The abject poverty these characters live in is horrendous. Though the movie does it's job to accurately portray these people's lives, and the performances for the most part are outstanding, you do walk away feeling drained and suicidal.The movie is excruciatingly slow moving and I looked at the time at least a hundred times waiting for it to be over. It failed to totally capture my attention despite the fine performances and it left me wondering why on earth it was nominated for a Best Picture Oscar. You never even get to know who killed the lead character's father or why the town's folk are concealing the fact that he's dead from her.Perhaps, as I said earlier, this type of drama just isn't my thing.

250,eneyeseekaywhy,Uncompromising bleakness,8,19 September 2010,"Uncompomising is a word thats bandied around too freely these days. It seems to be applied to any film with darker than normal subject matter, especially if they happen to be 'indie' films. But uncompromising is exactly what Debra Granik's work here is. The self-assured director doesn't shy away from the grotesque or macabre aspects of life for these mountain folk. It's uncomfortable viewing at times, and so it should be, we're not watching The Waltons.Winter's Bone is shot beautifully on location in the remote Ozark Mountains near the Missouri/Arkansas border. The cinematography makes use of the natural light available as much as possible and the resulting muted, flat tones capture the bleak, broken spirit of the area. The music is straight-forward, simplistic and compliments the narrative without calling for our attention or distracting us from the story. Nick Cave's soundtrack to The Road achieved much the same results. It is the fantastic performances however, that really glue all these elements together to form something brilliant. Walter Salles used the local Peruvians to great effect when he cast them as extras in The Motorcycle Diaries. The same technique is used here by Debra Granik with numerous cast members being natives of the Ozark Mountains. Jennifer Lawrence and John Hawkes both give stellar performances here in the lead roles, Lawrence in particular is captivating and thoroughly believable as the vulnerable heroine, Ree.At 17 years old, Ree Dolly is the sole bread-winner and carer for her family. Her two siblings, twelve year old Sonny and six year old Ashlee, as well as their mentally ill Mother, all live together in little more than a shack. They survive in abject poverty by shooting and eating squirrels. Their home and the few possessions they have come under threat when the local Sheriff knocks on their door. It seems Ree's Father, a wanted criminal, has used their home and all their assets as collateral for his bail and promptly disappeared. She has one week to find him or everything they own will be taken. She sets out to confront her Fathers friends and acquaintances in an effort to find his whereabouts. These people all form a 'Hillbilly Mafia' of sorts, a world where people make a living cooking up Crystal Meth and dealing Oxycontin. Putting her own life in danger, she pushes on for the sake of her family. Eventually the truth, or part of it, is revealed.Having won two jury prizes at both Berlinale and Sundance Film Festivals, rumours are already circulating about this films Oscar chances. John Hawkes as Teardrop and newcomer Jennifer Lawrence as Ree Dolly certainly deserve academy recognition for their strong performances. Also worthy of note is the sparse cinematography of Michael McDonagh. Needless to say, if you're a film fan you owe it to yourself to go see something so bleak, harrowing and desolate that ultimately leaves you feeling hopeful. A rare treat.",Winter's Bone
251,ciera-larose,"""Winter's Bone"" is about a young woman called Ree Dolly and her quest to find her father, save her property from ""the law"" and keep her family together.",8,22 April 2013,"""Winter's Bone"" is about a young woman called Ree. Ree Dolly is seventeen and looks after her mother (who's in some sort of a depressed stupor), her twelve year old brother Sonny and her six year old sister Ashlee. We begin the movie watching Ree perform her duties and we (or at least I) start falling in love with her character right away. She really seemed like a good person just trying to do right by her family. Suddenly, ""the law"" shows up and informs her that her criminal of a father, Jessop Dolly, signed their house and their land over for bail; and if he doesn't show up for his hearing they'll be forced to take possession of the house; essentially leaving them all homeless. So she embarks on a dangerous mission to find her father, risking her life several times just to save her house and keep her family together.The story and plot is good; it's captured well thanks to some great cinematography, after a while you really become engulfed by the nature of the film. Both literally and figuratively speaking.The main characters are portrayed rather impressively by those cast. Jennifer Lawrence captured the essence of Ree Dolly impeccably. She delivered an Oscar worthy performance for sure, in my opinion. She plays her character very naturally and the love that she demonstrates for her family seems very real and quite genuine. She manages to play a tough and stubborn character without it being immature. It was a mature role to take on at that age and I think she handled it well. John Hawkes who plays her uncle Teardrop also did an incredible job portraying his character. He was really quite cold and frightening. Much like Ree's character, he was very stubborn and tough as well. But he also began to display his softer side throughout the film and I found myself rooting for him, just as much as I did for Ree. I really enjoyed his evolution from a cold and distant man to a loyal and helpful relative who really seemed to develop a strong attachment to Ree and even to Sony and Ashlee near the end of the movie. The cast as a whole was great, including all the supporting roles. I have no complaints about any of the cast or how they portrayed their characters.In summation, ""Winter's Bone"" is a good movie to watch. It's a good story about love for one's family and determination. It's portrayed and captured well and all involved did a wonderful job. It's a good movie to watch and I recommend it.",Winter's Bone

Ultimately, the film is simply condescending and silly, it's characters have no real depth. The acting is wooden and the dialog sounds like redneck speech that was translated into Croation then written down in Japanese and then re-translated back into fractured hillbilly-speak by a screenwriter from New Jersey with poetic aspirations.

This is indie-ethnographic film-making where a slight, if not banal, situation is presented against a new (for most viewers) background and culture and then declaimed, by too many reviewers, as artistically successful. Like Once Were Warriors, a family abuse story with no interesting merit save for its Maori characters, Winter's Bone is underdeveloped in its plot and offers no real theme except the tragedy of a woman realizing she's trapped in a dreary world. The film is a valuable exercise in the delineation between plot and story. The story here of a woman searching for her father only to realize she must act as one is interesting. But the episodic nature of walking here and there, and then there again, is tiring for the hero and us. There's a real failure here in changing the plot's pacing and structure from the novelistic to the filmic. As for the theme of the woman realizing she must stay and act as both father and mother her siblings – the filmmakers treat this as a kind of epiphany, which it is, but also as a positive outcome. That is far less certain. For all her gumption and courage our girl is condemned to this backwoods culture and folk.",Winter's Bone

It seems many reviewers said that it was clichéd in that it tried too hard to be an indie movie.For me the lack of clichés made me like this movie. I truly get sick of movies where I can predict what is going to happen because of scenes that set up other scenes coming later. For example, in one scene the main character teaches her younger siblings to fire a rifle. I was thinking, ""Great. Now one of the kids is going have to save the day by shooting attacking meth-dealers."" But no. They just want to shoot some squirrels to eat. In other scenes, you think the main character is being set up to be murdered, but no again. The ""bad guys"" really are just giving her a ride in a truck or canoe. No southern-fried incest. No rapes. No shootouts. No car chases. No concocted motivation for revenge. And all the while this young girl is flirting with disaster which to me is more scary because it's implied and not overt.And the acting is superb. Yeah the girl never smiles because she has pretty much nothing to smile about. She can barely keep her siblings fed. And Hawke as the uncle is downright scary. The relationship with her sister and her friend, and really all the female relationships in this movie are really well done.This is a real slice of life movie with no other motivation than to tell the story of a girl trying to get out of a jam. No fairy tale. No preaching. Just a really good movie.",Winter's Bone

259,janebrownrigg,Compelling look at life in the Ozark Mountains,9,19 July 2010,"Featuring an assured performance by Jennifer Lawrence as 17 year-old Ree Dolly. Winter's Bone is a compelling look at the poverty and difficulties that face those Americans living in the Ozark Mountains in Missouri. Ree has dropped out of school to care for her ill mother and two younger siblings. Her dad, Jessup, is absent. Things go from bad to worse when the Sheriff informs Ree that if her father fails to show for a court hearing in a week's time her family home will be forfeit, as Jessup signed it over as part of his bail. Ree undertakes to find him, a task that is formidable and dangerous. Hers is a community where most share some degree of blood ties, however that doesn't make it close or in any way welcoming. The location and characters invite fleeting comparison with Deliverance. Ree's stoic perseverance is masterfully understated. She is steadfast in her love and support for her family as she pragmatically tries to prepare her young siblings for survival. Occasional generosity and assistance from sections of the community highlight the harsh code of Ozark life. Ultimately, reprieve arrives in the most unlikely and grisly fashion.",Winter's Bone

My favorite is: ""is it safe for you to return home?""I haven't read the novel, but I did finally view the movie tonight and I must say that for the most part, the story theme, while intriguing, was off-base, and the cultural/societal portrayal was quite far-fetched. People really aren't that dramatic. There isn't some sort of unwritten code of conduct. The bloodline-based devotion is way overstated. The instant transmission of knowledge is absurd. It just ain't like that, folks.Sure, there were some accurate portrayals. Poverty, roughnecking, and continuously bad decision making all exist there...just as it all exists in nearly every community throughout the USA. But that only accounts for a small percentage of the Ozarkian community.The derogatory-redneck, white trash, emotion-guided individuals represented in the movie are not as prevalent as the movie attempts to reveal. There are many who don the image with fashion choices and sound like stupid hicks, but are in fact intelligent. Many are great at running businesses, some hold advanced degrees, most are friendly rather than hostile or suspicious, and not everyone is driving around in outdated vehicles.The 5 stars I awarded are for the great acting.

262,Movie_Reviewer_from_LA,A must see,8,2 June 2011,"Debra Granik's WINTER'S BONE is one of the better films of last year. It's an intimate portrait of rural Missouri, revolving around seventeen-year-old Ree, whose meth-manufacturing father has left her to care for two younger siblings and a sick mother. Ree's father Jessup has gone missing, but he put his property up for bond. Meaning, if Ree doesn't find her father within a week--either that, or proof that he is dead--she looses the house and the land. Unfortunately, her father's extended family seems inclined to let sleeping dogs lie, to the extent that Ree finds herself in genuine danger. Her only accomplice, if you can call him that, is her uncle Teardrop, who may be as dangerous as everyone else around her. As Ree, Jennifer Lawrence carries this film on her more-than-capable shoulders; she is the rock of the film, anchoring it down so tightly that even the other stellar performances-- especially John Hawkes as Teardrop--pale by comparison. A lot of the cast aren't even professional actors, which lends the film an extra air of authenticity (that, and the fact that it was shot on location). WINTER'S BONE is, without a doubt, a small production; and while that can sometimes ruin a movie, here it helps. The script is good though not wholly memorable; the real grit here lies in the actors' performances, without which this film would've been a mediocre idea and best forgotten. As is, it's nominated for 4 Academy Awards, and goes down as one of the best films of 2010 (a year in which quite a few good movies were made).",Winter's Bone
263,webapalooza,"Tedious, depressing, and ultimately pointless",3,7 September 2011,"After hearing rave reviews about this film, not to mention the Oscar hype, my wife and I sat down to watch it recently and came away scratching our heads. We literally looked at each other when the end credits started to roll as if to ask one another, ""Did we miss something?"" Maybe we did miss something, as much of the dialog is mumbled and hard to discern. The bleakness of the Ozarks seems to be captured well, although I have never been there so I can't say for sure.A few things stuck out though: how do people who are so tragically poor still have enough money to buy a trampoline? Can anybody say ""misplaced priorities""? And as my wife pointed out, just because you're poor doesn't mean you have to be a slob. These people are not only poor, they're wallowing in filth and trash. Have some respect for yourself and take a little pride in your home, however modest it might be. Sheesh.Some of the performances are good, although I don't consider Jennifer Lawrence's performance to be Oscar-worthy. It's fairly subdued and one-note. The actor playing Teardop was much better, frankly.Overall, it's a slow-moving, depressing film that doesn't really offer much satisfaction. It sets up the so-called ""mystery"" of what happened to Ree's father, as if there is any doubt in the audience's mind. I was hoping for some big revelation at some point, but the film just plods along and is a major let-down overall. Oh, and did we really need to see the characters skinning a squirrel? I don't think so.",Winter's Bone
264,LadyHol93,Bitterly Disappointing.,7,17 April 2011,"I wanted to like this, i really did. I heard nothing but good reviews from all including my mother. So when it was showing while i was on a business trip in Sweden I took the opportunity to watch......well, I was very disappointed. Yes the acting was great and it gave a real insight into the rural white trash way of life but I found it exceedingly slow. Perhaps my expectations were too high? I don't know, but it didn't do it for me.I would still recommend the film just to see others opinions but I found myself bored quite often throughout which is such a shame because it received such great reviews.Quite an odd ending with little significance but I think it was well directed and acted for what it was. 4/10 and that's me being generous.",Winter's Bone
265,rburton66,Phony and folksy.,5,18 June 2010,"As phony as it is folksy, Winter's Bone's lack of authenticity isn't its biggest flaw. It thrusts us into a convoluted, overcomplicated plot, which only gets sillier as the ensemble swells. The work all falls on the stone-faced Jennifer Lawrence, a pudgy, limited actress, who often fades into the background during her dozens of close-ups. Those endless close-ups are used to compensate for underwritten characters. I guess if we can see these actors' tears as clearly as we do their pores, we'll care more deeply for them.There's only one great scene in the movie, as Lawrence can't articulate a good reason why she wants to join up to an army recruiter. Otherwise, Winter's Bone exemplifies why there are so few great films about rural America. Granik can't be content with the low-key drama of a youngster forced to care for her younger siblings. Even the threat of losing their home isn't enough. (Places in the Heart or Sounder this is not.) There are so many throwaway scenes, like a trip to the cattle auction where Lawrence tries to talk to somebody for some reason. Most of it doesn't really matter, as Granik's obviously building toward an ending formulaic, reassuring, and false.Also, to nitpick, it's set in Christian County, Missouri, but nobody in that part of the Ozarks spouts such rapid-fire colloquialisms (""I'll take you to see your Daddy's bones""). The accents are also wildly inconsistent.",Winter's Bone
266,CassandraSparkles,Spirit Award Nominations: Winter's Bone,10,19 December 2010,"Winter's Bone, which was originally a novel by Daniel Woodrell, made into a movie by director Debra Granik, is an original, powerful story of a 17-year old young girl who tries in the face of unbelievable odds to keep her family together. The movie takes place in the Ozarks in Missouri, but the life there feels so alien to this viewer that it might as well be set on Mars.It has overtones of ancient tribal behavior with its own code of law and ethics. The fabulous actress who is the prime mover at the center of the movie is played by Jennifer Lawrence. She is Dee Dolly, searching for her drug dealing, oft-jailed father whose disappeared, then revealed to have put up their home for collateral, jeopardizing the family's shelter. Dee cares for her catatonic mother and two young siblings. They have no money and despite her pride, she accepts grudging help from neighboring farmers. Dee is the glue of the story which focuses on her journey of overcoming unfathomable obstacles. No one, even her close friends, will help her. Her life becomes as alien as the terrain. Not only do they refuse aid, her pursuit puts her life in jeopardy. She learns to function even when there is no one she can trust.The town has lost all industry. The only way to make money is to manufacture methamphetamine. Dee moves forcefully through the mine field in order to keep her family together, safe and sheltered.I feel compelled to repeat it: 17-year-old Jennifer Lawrence is a revelation, determined and unafraid. You fear for her but she is fearless.Debra Granik's direction, with its ability to reflect the barrenness of the landscape and to coax powerful performances from her actors, is praiseworthy. One of the few women directors (at least that I'm aware of) with a good distribution deal.",Winter's Bone

I'd argue not as insanely good as most people say, but a fairly solid film.I won't go on about plot but the acting was good from basically everyone in the film. John Hawkes especially shone out for me.The film is shot really well on the RED camera. It looks pretty amazing.The soundtrack is pretty haunting stuff and fits the film perfectly.The storyline is meant to be pretty much the same as the book. So it's a straight conversion. Done well.Listening to the Q&A with director after the film showed me just how much research had gone into the film. Soo much preparation really paid of for them as the film feels really authentic.There was a lot going on in the film, not plot wise but themes and hidden messages. The film is very anti-drugs, and thats one of the main messages throughout. Its showing how drugs can tear apart families and communities. There are other things going on I'll let viewers figure out for themselves.

269,ssharon-17215,"Depressing, bleak, no plot",2,9 September 2018,"Very poor storytelling, little plot, no mystery or suspense, horrible characters, extremely bleak & depressing. Main character, Ree, is devoting all her energy to taking care of two younger siblings and saving their home. However, they are surrounded by relatives who are violent, in the drug business, and/or are using drugs. She doesn't seem to realize that if she doesn't get the kids out of there soon, they will most likely end up like all the relatives shown in this film. Yet, instead of selling the forest and moving her family, all she wants to do is stay put. By the end of the film, during which various relatives act out of character (hostile uncle becomes kind; super violent matriarch gives Ree what she desperately needs), Ree is no better off than at the start of the film. She is still stuck there with her awful extended family and no prospects. The only mystery is the identity of the financial donor; the end of the movie is not really an end. Ree is given a bag of cash but we don't know what her plans or hopes are. She is already living in a kind of prison with no hope that things will get better for her or the kids. I really do not see the allure of this film. Does the film maker believe that poverty forces people to become involved in drugs and violence? In my country (not USA), I have met people who grew up very poor, some will no plumbing or electricity, but they did not turn to drugs. They grew up with an extended family that helped each other; they did not grow up sad and hopeless.",Winter's Bone

Lots of harshness in their everyday lives. However, these mountain people only know this way of life and though it is a hard life they hold onto it fiercely. So in that sense the film maker did an excellent job.On the other hand, I also got the sense that the target audience of this film will be people who will mistakenly feel sorry that these people have to live this way.It was as if the film was presented honestly to the viewers and simultaneously, the viewers were at some sort of sociological zoo where in this cage were the unfortunate people that have to live that way.I could be wrong, but that is the sense I got while watching the movie.",Winter's Bone
272,mdyer-11,"Boring, look-and-feel of a mediocre documentary",4,7 July 2010,"My wife and I went to see this movie and we found it so disappointing, so mind-numbingly boring, that I just had to warn everyone to avoid this movie. We nearly walked out but, unfortunately, kept hoping that the movie might improve. We had our misgivings before we went. We worried that it would be a movie mainly about the daily sufferings of a poor, 17 year old girl in a rural Ozark-type area (which it was). We went solely because it had gotten good reviews from a number of movie critics (listening to them was a BIG mistake) and also because it had a good rating on IMDb.com (but with only 600+ votes, those votes were probably mostly cast by the director, producers, actors and their own families). So why is this movie sub-mediocre? Here's why: 1) Except for the two main characters (the young woman and her uncle, Teardrop) the acting by all other characters is terribly wooden. It's like watching a spear-holder movie in which everyone stands around (and instead of holding spears while in togas and saying wooden lines like ""Oh, queen, you must send in your soldiers now"", we get people standing around in dungarees, looking stern and repeatedly saying ""Don't make me have to warn you again, child.""). 2) Even though the main character is 17, she has no boyfriend, no love interest, no friends her own age. As a result, 3) there is no character development. 4) There is very little plot. One possibility was that the movie might have been a good mystery story, in which the heroine tracks down clues to her father's whereabouts, but that's not the case here either. Instead, there is scene after scene in which she goes from house to house, each time asking relatives where her father might be and each time being rebuffed. 5) The dialog is nearly nonexistent and highly repetitive and most scenes (e.g. of the kids playing) seem to go on forever.I will not give away the one really strong scene in the movie, but it makes little logical sense because the material that the main character obtains could have easily been supplied to her by her relatives without her having to have gone through the suffering she is made to go through.The movie was obviously produced on-the-cheap (use of unknowns and the location being just a few rural, outdoor areas and one tavern), which is OK, but it has the look and feel of a mediocre documentary or of above-average student film. What makes a film memorable involves interesting dialog, interesting characters and development, intriguing plot, good supporting roles, multiple memorable scenes and proper pacing. This movies lacks all of these elements.So now you can't say that you weren't warned!",Winter's Bone
273,majesticmeteor,"Ya got no call... blah, blah, blah.... get off my land...",1,27 January 2011,"Synopsis: Pretty girl without makeup tromps around in the Ozark woods in search of her drug dealin' daddy. She looks sort of cute in her Carhartt jacket, faded jeans, and moccasin style boots. (Spoiler Alert: There are no lady bare feet featured in this film. All together on 3... 1...2...3...FAIL...BOOOOOOOOO!This film fails miserably in that it fails to feature the lead character, ""Ree,"" in any explicit erotic scenes with her 12 year old brother, and not only that, she doesn't use her feminine wiles to extract information from many a redneck that that might know what happened to her daddy.The whole deal is that her homestead was put up for bond by her daddy, but he failed to show at his court date. Probably he turned State's Evidence and a law official narked on him. But nobody's a talking. But Ms Ree must at least turn up her daddy's dead body to satisfy the bondsman's obligation to the court.But nobody's a talking', and nobody keep on a not talking' etc. etc. etc.There's an unrealistic scene where Ree and her uncle ""Teardrop"" are tracked down by a county deputy, and with this laughable encounter the idiot deputy has obviously made himself as the nark employed by the meth cartel. For in real life the deputy would've opened fire with an automatic assault rifle and put the ""situation"" to sleep.But there's honor in the Ozark woods, and later the wussie deputy says he don't believe in shootin' underage people (Ree is age 17). Again, that's totally not on par with how the meth cartel and nark cops work. Laughable in the extreme.Ree ends up in a fix because of ""a bein' where ya got no call to be, a askin' 'bout what none yer business,"" and gets her butt kicked by the wife and girlfriends ""Melvin"" the kingpin of the meth cartel. But in real life Ree would've been dismembered by the backwoods women, let's get serious!But no, Ree is released to her uncle Teardrop on conditions of ""You answer for her now, ya hear."" Translation: If Ree keeps digging around about the whereabouts of her daddy, then both she and Teardrop will get assassinated. Again. FAIL! The meth cartel leave no trails. This film tries to insert some sort of Honor Code in the Ozark woods meth trade where none has ever existed, and never will.Everything winds down when Ree comes in possession of both her dad's severed hands. She doesn't call the FBI, but instead hands them over to the narc deputy. FAIL! In real life the deputy would've disposed of the severed hands, thus not satisfying the court and bondsman's need to verify by DNA the death of Ree's daddy. And then the deputy would've been in on a kickback on the sale of Ree's homestead by the bondsman.But no, once again incredible Ozark backwoods honor comes in to play. The deputy doesn't even try to score some tail off Ree. How lame is that?There is no small part of a Star that is little enough for this film's rating.

I think this is because some of them weren't actors and yet gave truth to the part. Also, the details such as the frayed clothes, home-made haircuts, crowded interiors, and so on.The frontier feel is from teaching the kids how to shoot, skin, and cook animals and other meals. Also, it is from the perseverance and harsh landscape and difficulty surviving.I just went with it, and could not help liking it very much, in spite of the despair.

I have't read the book but I have read several other Woodrell novels and they are all excellent, unfortunately the same cannot be said about the realisation of his work onto film. The plot is potentially interesting but is resolved by a series of unlikely about-turns by characters who act completely out of character.For example one minute the uncle is a coke-snorting,wife- beating drug dealer and the next minute he is giving little chickies to kiddies!!! And minutes after beating Ree up the women get all concerned about her welfare!!! Also would a draft sergeant not just be desperate to get his quota of canon fodder for the month? Totally farcical, ludicrous and unbelievable. Ree just walks about asking questions and the answers just fall into her lap! As for the great acting from Jennifer Lawrence, well all I saw her doing was wandering around looking morose. Sh1t! I can do that!!! As for insight into the lives of these people all we got was the standard chopping wood, playing banjos, mistrusting strangers, and shooting/gutting squirrels that we have seen countless times before.

She makes sure they're fed, that they do their homework, teaches them how to shoot/hunt... but she's never seen playing with them, fooling around, or having any kind of fun. This is probably due to Ree having to grow up so fast and assume her parents' responsibilities. Her sense of humor and joy have been buried under the stress of ensuring her family's day-to-day survival. She's either lost the ability to enjoy life or she simply doesn't have the time or energy to anymore.The story unfolds in a pretty bleak part of the world, and the sets/backgrounds flesh out that bleakness beautifully. The run-down, barely maintained state of the houses and other structures in the area, as well as the trash and junk that is everywhere, visually reinforces how just-above-rock-bottom the characters' financial states are. There are several shots of the children basically being bored: without any real toys to play with, they spend their time either lying around or playing with whatever they can find. One of the neighbors that Ree visits to ask about her father has a very new-looking front door, as well as an automatic garage door attached to their rickety barn, showing that they are doing a little better than the rest of the neighborhood.It's not really important to the story, but I would have liked more background on Ree's mother. What was their relationship like before she lost her mind? What was she like as a mother? She seems to have some of her senses, because Ree still tries to talk to her and asks her to do things like look through a photo album.",Winter's Bone

The main cast are a talented group who do very well in their roles. However, the story is not very compelling and the telling of it takes 90 minutes for what could have been done in 15. The first 30-40 minutes are basically a girl walking from house to house to find her dad and people being worse to her each time. There are 2 good scenes that present danger and entertainment. Beyond that it was a waste of my time. I simply waited to see what everyone was talking about. This movie is awful, the acting is good. Good actors don't replace awful directing. After seeing the film I looked it up and realized the director made another independent film I had heard about that was supposed to be compelling. I saw one scene and knew it was boring.

Two awards at Sundance! Two thumbs up! ""A noirish thriller!"" - looks awesome. Based on that I was expecting something along the lines of Frozen River or Mean Creek (two excellent indies).I have nothing but respect for film makers in general. The odds are stacked against them in so many ways, so writing a bad review of a low budget movie feels a little like criticizing David for not knocking out Goliath sooner.BUT.The cinematography, script, pacing, acting all meshed together in one long dull, clichéd mess. This is the kind of movie that gives indies a bad name. It's why your local art house cinema remains empty and its why people think indies are pretentious and boring. This is the end result of too much film school and not enough living; AFI and USC tutors all tell you to bring more emotion into the frame and students interpret this as meaning you have to have the most sour-faced, dismal characters, all lonely and doing drugs to create that emotion. Instead of bring excitement and tension to the frame with framing, juxtaposition, sound and quality performances that say ""original character"". The only scene that conveyed this was early on, with a great line ""that's the last time I use my mouth to tell you"".I'm not saying you should go see Transformers instead, I'm saying that there are many more original compelling low budget films out there that deserve the kind of reception that this dull-fest has received.",Winter's Bone
286,hillbillyloren,I LIVED it. Reality of life in the hills,8,23 September 2010,"Great Movie!! I was raised in the Missouri Ozarks area where the film was set and filmed. This is the part of the US that loves Sara Palin, Rush Limbaugh (who is from Missouri) and voted for GW Bush twice. I have to say that the film was amazingly ""true to life"" in every detail. I would also like to say that you don't have to be desperately hungry to hunt and eat squirrels either. It is considered very good food in the hills. I have eaten it many times and it is delicious when cooked correctly.I have been dismayed reading many of these reviews calling it a ""fake"" and/or ""phony"" and contrived film. I do understand that the character of Ree Dolly certainly has many wonderful and admirable qualities that seem to have developed in a vacuum. Ree Dolly needs to be that sort of character for the rest of the film to work and not simply be a documentary of the endless poverty endured in the Ozarks for generation after generation. I grew up EXACTLY in that part of Missouri and Ree's character aside,,, it is EXACTLY correct in the look, the language and the behaviors there. I have a video of the beauty and poverty there at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avq3-lBgyzs or a longer version at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTKWqKTGwTgI would also like to address the Meth Epidemic that has raced across huge sections of the rural Midwest America. I was raised in the Ozarks from 1963 until 2009 and I watched the moonshiners lose out as Sunday Blue Laws and Dry County Laws were voted down or abandoned. Then marijuana became THE big cash crop that survived and thrived for many years until ""Daddy"" Bush's anti-marihuana laws poured in tons of money to local law enforcement and new laws confiscating lands forced the richer growers indoors. It was finally in the mid 1990s when you began to see meth force out ALL the remaining marihuana farmers and moonshiners. Counties began to get in meth dealing Sheriffs and the old games were OVER. In my Ozark County (Morgan) during the late 1990s a deputy sheriff's home mysteriously exploded and then was investigated by the FBI. I watched as the marijuana become hard to find and evil Meth take over.The people of the Ozarks have always been clannish, hostile to outsiders and proudfully ignorant and primitive in their opinions of society and politics. Those traits are nothing new or something that manifested due to Meth. But the introduction of Meth has struck down many good men and women who might have made the culture a tiny bit more tolerant or hopeful.But along with the continuing devastation of multi generational poverty and vastly inferior schools there is also a great beauty in the land and the people of the region. Many an unbelievably gifted musician lived and died in those hills never having recognition from anyone outside of the hills.I strongly urge everyone to watch this movie because it is VERY truthful and realistic of how parts of the US survive. It also shows a part of America that is VERY often overlooked because many are (rightfully) ashamed that this sort of 3rd world poverty exits in the US. I personally feel that the Federal US government needs to inject a LOT more funding and oversight of the rural school districts in order to overcome the generations of prideful ignorance that governs the mindset of many born into that rural America culture.",Winter's Bone

I kept turning the volume up but that didn't help either. It was like a mixture of gibberish and mumbling.This movie tries so hard to let everyone know that it's an indie and unfortunately flops in the process.I assure you there is no great drama, no suspense, no horror, and god forbid anyone cracks a smile. It's just a couple hours of the viewer trying to figure out where the heck it's going....and what's the deal with the mom? Is she a mute?

Being a couple of generations removed from that exposure, not completely inaccurate of description of rural Anglo people; clannish, independent, territorial and living by certain codes of conduct. The chainsaw scene was excessively grotesque and rather unnecessary for that genre of the movie. Like for a brief moment the movie lost itself by digressing to a grade B horror movie. It quickly recovered though and compelled a strong ending. A positive aspect of this movie is that everybody acted within the parameters of this rural ""code."" This is a refreshing and different aspect of this movie, where as in most Hollywood movies at least one person is an outlier, operating outside of the social norms without consequences. Warning though. This movie is like ""The Godfather"" where as it gives a romantic glorification to a destructive criminal element in our society.

Jennifer Lawrence turns in a wonderful performance as the teenage girl forced to raise her younger siblings and care for her mentally unstable mother, all the while searching for her career criminal father in some very dangerous, very unwelcoming backwoods hovels and dealing with an array of increasingly unsavory characters. The only lead performance by an actress that has impressed me more this past year was Natalie Portman in ""Black Swan,"" and an Oscar nomination for Lawrence seems inevitable. The film definitely takes its time to unfold, but there is a sense of menace and dread from the very beginning that builds relentlessly, like a coiled spring being drawn tighter and tighter. The film also has a wonderfully unpolished, un-Hollywood type of vibe to it; it feels edgy, real, and dangerous. Be prepared to get creeped-out by this terrific little drama.",Winter's Bone

There are many other compelling true stories of white trash crack dealers that could be made into a movie than this laughable 100 minute long waste-of-time-camera-roll-and-talent trash.

292,ameyabokil,The Little Movie That Could,7,13 February 2011,"Winter's Bone brings somber mood to the Oscar night. The Sundance Film Festival is believed to be the launch pad for independent movies to the Oscars. It is there where Winter's Bone won the Grand Jury Prize, ""setting off with soft explosion"" .This has given it enough thrust to make the cut for the nomination list (and most Top 10 movie lists),but not farther.In the grim mountainous lands of Ozarks, USA lives Ree Dolly, taking up the overwhelming responsibility of two kids and a socially withdrawn mother. The landscape is brutish, the children's games point to a lifeless picture where Ree is shown taking pains for their survival through poverty. Ree is in fact 17 years old and the kids, her siblings.Now Ree has her father to trace else she will lose her house and thrown to the streets with the two kids. As she finds only serious dissuasion on that road, she considers parting from her siblings and prepares the kids for the hard life.And if Ree does not find her father (drug dealer, deserter, absconder and the guy who put his family in peril), she discovers him in a new light. The end hits with forceful intent, unfortunately it does not hit hard enough we find it for the reason that drama is lacking in the rest of the movie.Character and performances definitely form the driving forces of the movie. Jennifer Lawrence in such a strong character of a teenager forced to grow up, proves immense potential. John Hawkes is excellent as the uncle Teardrop who stands behind Ree, filling the void left by her father.The Academy has been know for giving a push to little movies, the two Screenplay categories have been a happy hunting ground for these with Little Miss Sunshine and Juno winning original screenplay in their years. Precious won it the next year for adapted screenplay. It is in this category Winter's Bone is put. Small chance as The Social Network may walk away with the award. But it is the other Sundance hit, The Kids Are All Right that has a better shot at Best Original Screenplay trophy. Winter's Bone will probably go the way of the win nothings like The Wrestler. Hopefully it will do well at the Independent Spirit Awards like the 2008 Aronofsky classic.The movie is like its protagonist.

But I hate to tell you, the Ozarks, for the most part, are much more modernized than this. There were little parts that were authentically white-trash Ozark and parts that were just what others THINK it's like. Nice touches: drinking from jelly jars. The kids sleeping on recliners and couches or water beds (LMAO). The couches covered by sheets and blankets to have a cleaner surface to sit. No matter how poor a family is, they would still have a TV on. The trampoline was a cute and authentic addition. Fried potatoes and fried squirrels. Looks like Ree's wearing a men's t-shirt with a deer on it. This could definitely be seen. Ree also wears a Scrunchee in one scene. All of the clothes in the movie were accurate to a T. Poor, mismatched, but not over-the-top poor. When Ree brings in her dad's hands, she brings them in a convenience store sack. Totally real.The Bluegrass jam session in the mistress' house--totally fiction. Bluegrass is totally an artsy, cultured thing. Something you only see when you go to a festival. Not one of the actors looked like a meth-head except for one of Merab's sisters. Not one of the women in the movie is wearing makeup. Even in the country, the women wear makeup, albeit badly applied makeup. Ree's inconsistently bad grammar--on one occasion she says that her siblings wouldn't be able to fend for ""themselves."" She would most likely have said ""theirselves"" or ""theirself."" Some of the colloquialisms would never be heard in the Ozarks. They're kind of corny and sound like what people THINK we sound like. One guy calls Ree ""child."" Most of the accents are not at all what a Missourian would sound like, most notably Ree's accent.",Winter's Bone
294,mdh310,Fine lead performances and formidable atmosphere let down by patchy script and amateur bit players,7,8 July 2010,"This one didn't quite gel for me. Heavily in its favor are the grim but beautifully rendered setting (it was shot almost entirely on location), a breakout performance by Lawrence, with solid support from the other leads, and a great premise. Early on the tension is palpable, helped greatly by the understated, almost documentary-style camera-work, as young Ree embarks on her quest.This promising start is gradually squandered though by a meandering, sometimes repetitive script, and amateur actors plucked from the local area. They repeatedly break the spell - when they are supposed to be menacing they look like they are barely suppressing an attack of the giggles. Later on, as the pace starts to build, events start to become faintly ridiculous, building to a truly gratuitous finale.I wanted to enjoy it more because much here is very good - Granik and Lawrence are surely destined for great things - but as a story it fell a little flat for me.",Winter's Bone

She is now left with the challenge of trying to find and convince her father to turn himself in, so that the family doesn't lose their house, the only thing they have left.The story is a slow burner with increasing intensity. Ree (Jennifer Lawrence) embarks upon a journey which is unforgiving and is just as much a mystery to her as it is to the viewer. With every new character Ree meets to ask where her father is, she is pointed in a different direction. The cinematography is simple and beautiful. The way the places of the Ozarks Ree travels to is shown really puts you in her shoes.

When it finished, i said: ""That's it?"", nominated for best picture really? The premise of the movie sounded interesting, and i gotta admit that the performance of Lawrence is the only good thing in this movie.

There were no meth labs back then but it was a very small town of a few hundred people, an economically desperate life in the middle of nowhere with few other resources. I felt it, I remember it. I was just a teenager. And I was lucky to only have to live in that locale for a few short years of my youth. I felt like crying before this movie was even a quarter through - knowing how little chance there was for the heroine that Lawrence portrays to find a way out of the crisis she's thrust into.This movie sucked me in. I was transported back to those few years in my young life when, given a few minor changes in details, Ree's desperate circumstances could easily have been the state of affairs for me. Small town cops trying to do their job regardless of the innocents they hurt in the process, with the usual instincts to CYA thrown in, all this within a backdrop of a small cartel of corrupt, insular and yet powerful 'longtime locals'.I hope I haven't given too much away. This movie made me cry, for more reasons than the obvious themes of loss and love in seemingly impossible circumstances. That this kind of deprivation, corruption, isolation and anonymity doubtless continues to exist - in spades- in an era when us city-dwellers feel secure and safe in urban existences is undeniable.Finally, it's one of the reasons I support and will always support the legalization of drugs from marijuana to cocaine, heroin, meth and beyond.

There is no fear or disappointment in her eyes, not even the progressive realization of the possibility of never seeing her father again seems to shake her too much, as if the fact did not surprise her.
Even the always messy clothes and hair are perfectly in line with the context.

I've already seen 200+ movies this year and the hype of this movie is sickening.

316,pigasus.press,Poverty breeds monsters,3,20 January 2011,"Sight & Sound (February 2011 issue) has a piece on Coens' remake of True Grit. The article's titled 'No country for young girls' and that phrase neatly sums up the gritty hard-worn coming-of-age story in Winter's Bone.It's a slice of realistic Americana, one that's pitched about midway between the wholesome family TV entertainment of The Waltons or Little House On The Prairie, and the despicably unfriendly, with no-redeeming-features amorality, character-fest of The Devil's Rejects. Which is to say that, its overall tone is halfway to nowhere in particular, and manages to take up 100 minutes of your viewing time without offering much drama beyond terse Missouri inhospitality and outright Ozark hostility (due to criminal activities of drugs not moonshine), and stubborn teenage rebellion (yet with a 'noble' cause - that of saving a rundown family homestead from profiteers).There's a formidable-looking redneck bloke, some kind of community patriarch type, who's named 'Thump'. At that point... the bleak solemnity and dreary mood was just so OTT that oh, how I larfed! But, to be honest, I found this 'people picture' film was mostly rather dull.",Winter's Bone

The ramifications of what we witness are far more important. I live in Arkansas and have relatives that are rural. Heck, I was. I can only say that we used to have get togethers, no more.This movie tells a truth. You may have to ""really"" watch it more than once to fully understand the story it is trying to tell.

This was, however, a great film about an Americana that Hollywood either ignores, or treats as a comedy or horror.If you are unfamiliar with the current ""hillbilly"" subculture, or the shade-tree, ditch-bank, abandoned house meth lab industry, some of this show may escape you. It will still be a profound statement about many things, like the absolute inability of some good people who make good choices, show great talents, and tremendous fortitude, to neither become a social success nor reach anything like self-actualization.I may be biased since this movie hits so close to home, but it remains my favorite of the Best Picture Oscar nominees. It may be that Jennifer Lawrence was simply a natural for this character, hailing from Kentucky, but she did such a wonderful job that I am hoping to see great things from her in future movies.",Winter's Bone

So many little details like this.It's also because I liked the plot. It doesn't give us a twist ending or any unexpected outcomes. Why it has to be? Isn't there enough movies like that?

It is intense enough to rip you out of your comfort zone and skin you alive with a cold blade of a bowie knife. The gruesome extremes of the life on the outskirts of Missouri forests, where the rule of the rifle is the ultimate law, make the movie an unforgettable, sobering and humbling experience.Observing the atrocities of this animalistic life, you can't help but start revaluating the very basics of your own. The movie plunges you head-down into icy-cold water, washing off the dust and seeming gravity of superficial problems like a broken iPod, missed interview or a fight with a friend. It once again reinforces the idea that not all of us were lucky to be raised by loving and caring parents; that food on the table is a privilege we have to be grateful for; that life without a constant fear of being shot, raped or separated from the family is still a lottery ticket that not all of us will draw.The movie is permeated by a pervasive odor of decay and hopelessness.

323,adriannguyen,Winter's Bone is a death wish,9,19 June 2011,"Winter's Bone set place in the Ozarks where 17 year old Ree Dolly (Jennifer Lawrence) lives with her two younger siblings and her catatonic mother. Because of her mother's mental state, Ree has to take responsibility of her family and teach them survival skills. She then got a notification from the Sheriff notifying her that her father had not appeared in court for his drug-related crimes and had put their house up at stake if he doesn't show up. This caused Ree to look for him to save their family and through her journey, she encounters her uncle Teardrop (John Hawkes) and countless other people who spells conspiracy towards Ree and her father.Now I have never heard of the Ozarks before or what it's like but in this film, it's shown with characters portrayed as rednecks whom they are close to each other yet dangerous. Through the nature of the film, it's a crime thriller and a quiet, minimalist one because of the fact that it's based around family. It's well directed by Debra Granik and the gritty visuals including the cinematography and photography of the Ozarks are well-executedJennifer Lawrence brings a powerful performance as Ree who is determined to find her father regardless of the consequences and who cares about her family through rough living conditions. She should be thoroughly recognized. John Hawkes plays Teardrop as a fierce force of goodwill and hard luck and his performance is on the same level as Lawrence. It's one of the Best Picture nominees so small it could've been recognized for its greatness of determination and feminism.

326,kamoore63,"An Unflinching, Unsentimental Gem",8,20 January 2011,"Winter's Bone is one of those small films that I heard good things about when released, but disappeared from theaters before I could see it. I just watched it at home (albeit on a wide- screen in HD, capturing somewhat of the movie experience) and was very impressed. Hence this rather late review: few people saw the movie (less than $7 million at the box office), but it deserves a wider audience. It's a small film that addresses big issues without preachiness or sentimentality. In other words, it ignores the normal Hollywood conventions.Jennifer Lawrence portrays Ree Dolly, a 17-year-old girl trying to look after her family: two younger siblings, and a mother who's lost her mind after years of worry about her husband, Jessup, who cooks meth and is involved in the local criminal underworld. As the movie begins, the sheriff shows up hoping to find Jessup, who's due in court and has disappeared. It turns out that when Jessup signed his latest bail bond, he signed away title to the house and property where his family is living – meaning that if he doesn't show up in court, they could find themselves without a place to live. The remainder of the movie follows Ree's quest to find out what happened to her father so she can hold onto what little the family has.This could easily be a depressing film. It starts with a long shot of the family's ramshackle property: broken down autos and toys scattered around a cabin that seems ready to collapse. these scenes appear again and again in the film, capturing the poverty and hopelessness of these lives. Lending a strong air of authenticity, the film was shot on location in the Ozarks. The visual palate is the muted greens and browns of an Ozarks' autumn. The environment seems perpetually ready to slide into a permanent winter, as good a metaphor as any for the lives depicted: these people aren't struggling along in dead-end job, but have left that world behind and exist in a kind of rebel economy. There's no suggestion of improvement here, no possibility that any character will escape his or her fate.In spite of that (and without any Hollywood gimmickry), it is a fairly upbeat film. No matter how damaged they are, the people do look out for one another, albeit in an often gruff or offhanded way. They are resilient, resourceful and fiercely independent. And in Jennifer Lawrence's portrayal, Ree is absolutely indomitable, determined to do everything she can to look after her siblings and her mother, even if it threatens her own life. I suspect Lawrence will receive an Oscar nomination (although I doubt she'll win over Natalie Portman in Black Swan). There's no false bravery or histrionics here. Just an understated and highly believable performance, affecting without being affected.Ree is the emotional and physical core of this film, but she's also a symbol for all the strong women in this movie who keep life going as the men disappear – into jail or addiction. All the women in this film, no matter their ages, wear their difficult lives in the worry lines carved into their faces like the stark tree limbs against the wintery sky that backdrop the opening title.Beautifully filmed and lovingly executed, Winter's Bone is that rare movie that captures the lives of the marginalized people without patronizing them or turning them into cartoon figures.",Winter's Bone
327,Hissobel,"""Deliverance"" on Drugs",6,26 January 2011,"A beautiful, but dark, film. Perhaps it was my mood, but this film seemed unusually joyless. Not that I require joy in every film, but this one, unlike more unrealistic fare, directly fed my own terror of poverty, violence, greed, ignorance, and lovelessness in my human relationships.To the extent that the circumstances depicted were realistic, folks who live this way have my profound compassion. I worry a little that the story might contribute to negative stereotyping of the Ozark people. A scan of the other reviews on this site indicates that many viewers feel as I do, that the lifestyle described provokes compassion rather than condemnation.At the same time, the film shows how joyless human relationships can become in any culture or class setting. I can easily see Shakespeare telling this same story about a European Renaissance monarch's family.

If you want insight into poverty, suffering, beating, drugs, alcohol and crime then you will like this movie. For me? I'll pass.

341,alexsantosedgar,"A superb film, to be watched with hands wrapped around a warm beverage, and a blanket over your shoulders.",8,2 October 2016,"I sat down to watch this film not really sure what to expect. I am personally a big fan of Jennifer Lawrence and I understood from critics that Winters Bone put her on the map, in Hollywood and I wanted to see where her career took off. As the films opening scene came into focus, my eyes were greeted with a bleak, grey view of a mountainside. Very little grass, the skeletons of caravans that once were and rubbish scattered everywhere, filled my vision. Soft American country music accompany the mid shots establishing the setting of the movie, and immediately I understood that I was looking at a poor family that lived outside of normal civilisation who fended for themselves. Within minutes, Ree (Jennifer Lawrence) walked outside to hang the washing up and help, who I assumed where her siblings, fix some toys. I was instantaneously encaptured by this small glimpse at the other side of the world, the other side of society, that the brochures don't include, and I was shocked overall at how badly some people have it. It made me feel like a horrible person just watching them suffering and not offering help or means of help. This film was raw and despite the telling title, I couldn't get over the almost dystopian society I was watching, where everyone knows everyone, blood relations meant a lot, to a lot of people, and even the police of the town knew there were some that were above the law. I felt personally responsible for the safety of Ree and her family, not thinking that a 17 year old girl could carry such a weight on her shoulders, but so helpless to aid her as the film progressed. There are also several moments throughout the duration of the film that I found quite harrowing to witness, not thinking that anyone should have to be put through. The surroundings and the people seemed to work together to create, this almost black hole of despair and bone chilling cold that engulfed everything that moved throughout, and I felt everything that Ree felt, wincing as characters grabbed her throat, and threw hot liquid in her face. Although the age of Jennifer Lawrence's character was 17, she was forced to be an adult in her actions and priorities, but when something bad happened to her I felt that she was still a child, and that she was lost and needed guidance from an adult.Lawrence played Ree, to such a degree that I if I didn't know that she was an actress, I wouldn't personally have been able to determine her from someone who actually lived in Missouri in a similar predicament. The cinematography was very effective at creating a desolate landscape, where you couldn't really imagine anyone living there, and seeing what the characters were wearing, and the surroundings they were in, made me feel cold despite my jumper and tracksuit bottoms. I switched from where I was sitting on my sofa, and moved in front of the fireplace with a blanket drawn tightly around my body, up to my neck, believing that with these tools I could fight the overpowering chill that the movie's setting was giving me. Overall this film made me feel emotions raw, and in a way that I haven't felt from a film in a long time. I was enticed by Jennifer Lawrence's superb acting, and I felt that I was experiencing the same journey that she was. I hated the characters she hated, I loved the characters she loved, I felt that I could empathise with her character better than any other female character I have before in a movie. Everything, everywhere reminded me of hopelessness and there was a slight life draining effect that I felt taking me, near the end. From the dead leaves, crunching beneath her feet, to the grinding sound of boots on loose stones underfoot, all the noises including the squawking of birds instead of singing, added to the grey feeling and colour of Winters Bone.",Winter's Bone
