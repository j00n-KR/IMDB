0,MartinHafer,"Like Buddhism, this film is best seen with a clear mind and no particular expectations",8,24 October 2006,"This is a lovingly made and filmed movie. It's so artistically made and beautiful to look at that this alone is reason to see the film. However, the plot is something many Western viewers probably won't be too thrilled with unless they have a very, very open mind and are willing to see a film with an unusual structure and many odd allegorical elements--sort of like Buddhism, actually. The film consists of many wonderful and amusing moments, but also has many intense and even horrifying moments, so be prepared for an ""emotional roller coaster"".The film is about several seasons that are spread out over many years. The film begins with a little boy who is the apprentice to a monk who lives on a shrine built in the middle of a lake (Spring). It then moves to the boy's early adulthood (Summer), then after the boy has left and committed a horrible crime (Fall), followed by the boy's return to the shrine many years later after his master has committed suicide (Winter) and is then followed by a woman bringing a new apprentice to the shrine (Spring once again). The film is very well made and interesting, but ultimately it may leave you a bit confused and even irritated that, in many ways, the film is as much about redemption and rebirth as it is about death and nothingness. The film is definitely one that will strongly appeal to some and turn others off due to its sad and confusing tone. An odd and strangely beautiful film chock full of religious imagery and oddness. It's definitely worth a look, given that the viewer appreciates international films and is open to non-traditional story-telling.FYI--The DVD said it was rated R for 'strong sexuality', and while there is indeed some nudity, it isn't all that intense (you see a guy's butt while he is making love--nothing else is shown). In fact, possibly more disturbing to kids and teens (and some adults) are some of the very adult themes--such as ritual suicide by fire and murder. While I wouldn't show this to kids, this MIGHT be appropriate for older teens--use your judgment and see it first before showing it to them.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
1,Leofwine_draca,Wonderful exploration of Buddhist learnings,9,2 March 2015,"SPRING, SUMMER, AUTUMN, WINTER...AND SPRING is a triumph art-house movie from South Korea, looking at that country's minority religion, Buddhism. Despite the simplistic nature of the narrative and the ultra-slow pacing, this is a beautifully shot and thoroughly engrossing movie that had me absolutely captivated at all times.As suggested by the title, the film is split into five parts, each of them exploring a different stage in the life of a youngster apprenticed to a Buddhist who lives in a remote floating temple on a lake. The photography is frequently stunning, bringing the glory of nature and the seasons to life in a way few achieve, and yet the human story is just as compelling.Be warned: this isn't some twee, genteel movie that avoids reality. It's a story that depicts the often ugly sides of human existence, with themes of animal cruelty, lust, and death dealt with quite explicitly. Yet this is what makes it great: it's a film that fully captures the human condition without shying away from the harsh stuff. Needless to say the acting is wonderful, particularly from Young-soo Oh as the elderly monk, as is the film itself.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
2,SnoopyStyle,Compelling and poetic,8,5 November 2014,"In a Korean temple floating on top of a lake, a Buddhist monk teaches a young apprentice through the years. The movie is in five sections. The first one has the apprentice as a boy. In the second one, he's a young man who lusts for a sick girl brought in by her mother for help. Each season brings a new chapter.This is a very compelling story. It's simple, heart-wrenching and also life-affirming. The dialog is sparse and it completely fits the movie. It is poetry. Everybody who likes movies that is a little different should give this a try. This is one of those foreign art film that is completely watchable.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
3,classicsoncall,"""Lust awakens the desire to possess. And that awakens the intent to murder.""",8,9 December 2017,"The seasons are allegorical, the movie follows the life of a young boy on the way to manhood under the watchful eye of his Master. I found the wisdom of the Master to be guardedly accurate, EXCEPT when he made the observation to Young Adult Monk that's in my summary above. The Master's statement has the effect of making his observation inevitable for the Young Adult Monk as he sets out into the 'world of men'.Obviously, this didn't have to be. But a young man who cannot control his passions, even over the infidelity of a wife, is still accountable for his actions if they result in murder. The crime the Young Adult Monk committed is troubling within the context of the story because it seems to me he should have learned something from his Master over the years to make his life more productive. He expressed remorse as a Boy Monk when he tortured the animals with a stone. The Master taught him a valuable lesson about carrying the weight of a stone in his heart for the damage he had done to one of God's creatures.Fortunately, the Young Adult Monk was made to repay society for his crime. It would have been inappropriate for him not to face justice. But when he returns as The Adult Monk, he returns with the same heart of stone he left with, and pursues self tribulation to cleanse his heart of it's guilt. The disgraced mother who brings her out of wedlock child to The Adult Monk symbolizes the way he himself may have arrived at the floating monastery to be placed under the care of the original Master. So describes the arc of the seasons in a person's existence, though in this case, one of pain and sorrow instead of joy and fulfillment. In another more uplifting film, this would have been called the Circle of Life.To my mind, the picture would have been more fitting to convey a positive attitude with a positive outcome, but of course, life isn't often scripted that way. Considering that, the film offers an excellent cinematic experience, with the change of the seasons displayed in a vibrant array of textures and colors. This was my second viewing of the movie, and I found that it had gained greater resonance for me than the first time I watched it a number of years ago.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
4,gavin6942,Beautiful and Simple,8,27 June 2015,"On an isolated lake, an old monk lives on a small floating temple. The wise master has also a young boy with him who learns to become a monk. And we watch as seasons and years pass by.Although I do not know very much about Korean culture and religion, I think this film is brilliant. Others have said it is not only cinema, but art. That sums it up nicely. Like the peaceful trance of meditation, this film tends to unfold slowly, but not in a way that is boring. More like a flower blossoming. We watch as time goes by, and bask in that.The colors are wonderful, especially the night scenes where the fog slowly drifts along the water. So I must single out the cinematography of Dong-hyeon Baek, whose work I am otherwise unfamiliar with.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
5,rmax304823,Through An Eastern Window.,8,2 April 2013,"I doubt that fans of Hollywood action movies are going to find this exactly enthralling. The dialog is sparse, and what there is of it is in Korean with subtitles; there's no gunplay and very little violence; there's simulated coitus but no nudity; things seem to stand for other things but we can't be sure what; and there are elements of spirituality and mysticism in it.Ostensibly, it's a film about a Buddhist master who raises a young boy at an isolated shrine that is occasionally visited by people in need of a religious cure, something like Lourdes but without the least bit of glitz. The old master is kind and he enjoys the boy's presence but he's harsh when he needs to be. When the little boy torments some small wild animals -- a fish, a frog, a snake -- the elder has the boy torment himself in the same way. This early incident, which I found rather touching, sets a pattern for the rest of the story, in which the boy grows up and runs away after a sick young girl finds a cure for herself, murders her, and finally returns to take the master's place. That's the explicable part of the story. There are many incidents and some characters that I can't explain, not being particularly cosmic myself.The photography is exquisite. Every shot is rather like a carefully composed watercolor. The acting on everyone's part is fine, even if most of it is physical instead of verbal. Of special interest is Yeo-jin Ha (it's spelled variously in English). She's of special interest because, well, for one thing her clan name isn't Park or Kim. For another, as the sick young woman who visits the shrine for a cure and winds up having the now post-adolescent monk put the blocks to her, she has the fragile beauty of a tiny porcelain doll. When the young monk teases her, then while draping a quilt over her sleeping body, he inserts his hand under the quilt and tries to feel her up, it's hard not to understand why. (He gets a slap across the face for his sins.)I'll mention another incident that comes out of the blue -- or the pale green or the lavender. The young monk who ran way now returns, mature and angry, having killed his wife for being with another man. The elder monk has him use the murder weapon, a knife, to carve out an astonishingly long number of character on the wooden pier. Two detectives come to arrest the murderer, but the old monk asks them to let the criminal finish carving out the characters, which will take him until the next morning. The cops agree. Near morning, when the killer finally collapses from exhaustion, the two cops, out of curiosity, begin to help the old monk fill in the carvings with paints of varying colors -- and the detectives really are bewitched by the task. Can anyone imagine such a tangent in an American movie? I don't believe in mysticism, angels, jinn, karma, kismet, Madam Blavatsky, or anything much beyond a drab mechanical universe, but I recommend this film highly. I suspect, like the two detectives, like me, you'll be swept up unthinkingly into the enterprise.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
6,Quinoa1984,"a Buddhist meditation on life and death, and what surrounds us",9,24 August 2005,"I remember when I saw this film on screen last year, I was struck by the rhythm director Kim Ki-Duk used in the film. It's deliberate, too deliberate for most I'd suppose. But like a reading good piece of philosophy, the filmmaker allows the viewer to get as much as they may find in the work. The story is more of a fable than a really conventional narrative- a baby is delivered to the steps of a Buddhist house on a lake, where the boy is raised by a master. He grows up, and falls temptation to the desires of the world. He decides to leave, only to return and find himself again. In the end, as winter comes, things come full circle. Each of the 'seasons' of the film are handled delicately, with the kind of simplicity that may appeal even more to children (the segment of the first 'spring' with the child transcends religion and goes into the basic stance of nature). The scenes of finding lust in 'summer' is not terribly graphic, but it puts the point on what is right and wrong in the customs and traditions of the religion. Then in 'Autumn', there are harsher lessons to be learned, and this also contains the best acting from the old master and the young, angry pupil. And 'Winter' becomes the most meditative of them all, with next to no dialog. Indeed that may be the turn off to most viewers- to say that the film isn't supported by dialog is an under-statement. And its not necessarily documentary realism. What I sensed from the film, and what stuck with me for a few days afterward, was the spiritual attitude behind the style, the confidence that the rhythm had a connection with the subject matter. It's one of the most soulful films to come out of the Eastern world in some time. It's less a traditional drama than a unique experience, for better or worse, really more for the better.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
7,sunwarrior13,An Eastern Film Masterpiece,10,21 October 2012,"Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring is a South Korean film about a Buddhist monastery that floats on a lake in a pristine forest. The story is about the life of a Buddhist monk as he passes through the seasons of his life, from childhood to old age.The movie features Su Oh- yeong, Kim Young-min, Seo Jae-kyung, and Kim Jong-ho; and it was directed by Kim Ki-duk.The action takes place over the course of several years, and is divided into five sections denoted by the seasons of the title. Spring - Child Monk takes life of animals out of innocence A child monk ties a stone to a back of fish. Same plight awaits a frog and a snake. The child monk roams the brook in search of the fish and the frog as his punishment allotted by the old monk. Summer - Boy Monk in love learns obsession The monk is now 17 years old. To the lonely hermitage, a girl comes to convalesce. Before long, warm feelings towards the girl sprouts in the boy's heart. Their ripple in the water turns into an act of love. Fall - Young Monk in agony of malice The boy returns to the hermitage in the mountains as a young man in his thirties after committing a murder. The old monk whips him finding the young man attempting suicide in front of the statue of Buddha.Old monk order him to etch the Pranja- parpamitasutra, meanwhile he finds peace in his heart. Winter - Mature Monk in days of enlightenment The monk, now in his full maturity retraces his steps to the abandoned hermitage in the mountains. A woman wearing a veil visits the hermitage with a baby. She leaves her baby behind and runs away. And then spring - Another child monk : cycle of four seasons The old monk living with another child monk is having a peaceful time in the hermitage...the circle of life keeps on.While each section tells a story of its own, the overall plot follows the education of the younger monk, a small boy in the beginning, as he learns lessons over the course of his life from his aging counterpart. Troubled outsiders also visit the monastery seeking guidance, including an ill young woman and a man who murdered his wife.This is one Eastern film that shows a world view that is very different than the Western view of the universe.Working miracles with only a single set and a handful of characters, Korean director Kim Ki-Duk creates a wise little gem of a movie. As the title suggests, the action takes place in five distinct episodes, but sometimes many years separate the seasons. It's as enchanting as a Buddhist fable, but it's not precious as consistently surprises you with a sex scene or an explosion of black comedy and he also vividly acts in the Winter segment, when the lake around the monastery eerily freezes. With its heart-stopping setting, gorgeous images and a lovely little story,the picture's extraordinary beauty is inescapable.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
8,jotix100,The five seasons,8,15 April 2004,"This is a hypnotic film to watch. The beauty of it lays in the simplicity in which it has been told. Director Ki-duk Kim's images feel like paintings by great masters. This story about Karma and Buddist beliefs could have used a bit of trimming to make it more appealing, since at times it is too static. This is a film to stay away for those interested in fast action or special effects. No one is going to find them here.  What the viewer will get is a feeling of well being and inner peace. The director seems to be teaching us a lesson in how anyone can achieve  nirvana through self examination, meditation and doing good no matter to whom. Also, how cruelty, be it against a harmless animal, or a human being, will haunt those who transgress throughout life.The acting blends in with the serene beauty of the temple in the middle of the lake, as we watch one season following another, as seen by the amazing cinematography by Dong-hyeon Baek.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
9,grantss,"Minimalist yet poetic, beautiful and engaging",7,3 November 2017,"A Buddhist monk lives in a temple in the middle of a lake. He is training a child to be a monk. We see the transitions the younger monk goes through as he ages, his discoveries, trials and tribulations, temptations, sins, punishments and atonements.Minimalist yet poetic, beautiful and engaging. Very basic setting - pretty much everything happens in the temple and around the lake. Plot is reasonably simple and there's hardly any dialogue. Yet it works.While simple, the plot is profound and engaging. There is a structure to scenes and the narrative that is quite poetic. Dialogue is not essential here as the actions speak for themselves. The setting is stunningly beautiful, filled with vibrant colour and wonderfully filmed. The cinematography is superb.On the downside, the structures that make the film so poetic also make it quite predictable. The title also gives away the ending. So while profound, not too powerful, as, from a point, you can see where the movie is going. The final few scenes are actually redundant.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
10,ferguson-6,"Row, Row, Row your boat",7,29 March 2004,"Greetings again from the darkness.  Korean director Ki-Duk Kim also wrote the screenplay and in the post-movie Q&A explained that this is a movie about life.  Really it is the proverbial circle of life.  The seasonal changes are the perfect backdrop for his vision of the changes in our lives. By far the most interesting portion of the film is during the teen years when the ill female visits.  More life is experienced in this 20 minutes of filmmaking than in 2 hours of most.  The symbolism of the boat is most appealing, although the buddhist spiritual scenes threw me off course at times.  Did enjoy the director's comments on the stones (burdens) we all carry in our life and how at the end, we usually reflect on those times. Definitely worth seeing as a metaphor of the circle of life.  Some of the scenery is beautiful and peaceful.  By the way, that is the director as the master at the end of the film.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
11,christopher-underwood,a most significant film,8,2 October 2005,"Leisurely but assured, pastoral mood piece from the director of The Isle. He himself plays the Buddhist monk at the end and must therefore be taken as a most significant film for this consistent producer of beautiful, yet hard edged movies. Once again there are scenes of animal cruelty that will inevitability be removed from UK releases, thereby removing the full meaning. Nobody except the police have names in accordance with Buddhist ideals and though the film is packed with significances beyond those such as I their resonance is clear to behold. Moving and involving look at life which is at once simple and complex. To avoid lust is to avoid the likelihood of killing, for what you may want and attain then surely another will soon also want. Oh dear, this may actually be true","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
12,Vincentiu,Movie like piece of memory,10,24 December 2006,"A real master-piece. Tale about the life, love and forgiveness. About a form of passing way of every moment. About master and disciple, waiting and imagination. The perfection like a long strange way in own conscience. Time and feelings, scenes and words of smoke. It is a movie without oriental marks. A film about nothing, with many mirrors and precious stones, clear, beautiful, lyric and warm. But this is the skin of a gorgeous moment. The young man is only a desire. The old teacher is the shadow of an age. The love is the smell of an amber day with signs and looks and time like a mystical snake. In this film, the death and the God are the characters. In every moment the escape is the fundamental desire. On every face of actors the light is the mask of soul. Is it a poem this movie? A pictures? A description of nature of soul? Maybe. But the form of perception is more important for everyone. They are movies - director's work. Bad or gorgeous, they are a gift and the public is only the costumer. ""Spring, summer, autumn, winter.."" is a special puzzle. The public is master and creator of him. His sensitivity is the maker of each scene. This film is good because the ""costumer"" is his ""father"". The message of a movie is only piece of memory, part of conscience. And ""Spring..."" is the best example.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
13,=G=,Zensational,7,8 October 2004,"""Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"" is a very East Asian art flick which moves like molasses with mesmerizing beauty as it spins its simple allegorical tale of the seasons of nature and life. The film centers on an elder Buddhist master and his young charge as the boy grows into manhood with considerably less grace than the passing of the old man to the next life. Mostly visual with minimal dialogue, this flick tells its tale with stunning cinematography, keeps subtitle reading to a minimum, and allows the disengaged and those who don't want to languish in many tedious moments to fast forward at x2 of x4 through most of the film reducing its100 minute run to 20-30 minutes. Recommended for buffs into Asian art flicks. (B)","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
14,dromasca,"not only cinema, but art",9,25 June 2005,"This film is a good example why cinema is called an art - this is not just another movie, but a real piece of art. The pleasure of seeing it belongs to the aesthetics, and it transcends beyond the action and beyond what only happens on screen, or what the characters say and do.It is both a simple and complex story - the story of a life, catching all seasons of development of man: innocence of childhood - so quickly lost unfortunately, mistakes of the young age, tragedies of maturity , and wisdom coming with the old age.The film is filmed at one location of a cut-breathing beauty. Beauty of nature is being maximized by the art of the camera. The soundtrack has little dialog, but the expressiveness of the actors makes the dialog useless. You feel the drama, you do not need to hear the words, and the music says more than words.There are a lot of symbols in this movie, and I probably lost most of them because they belong to the Budhist culture. There are however many other symbols that speak to the European spectator - the cycles of life, the rhythms of nature, the magic figure 4, like the number of seasons of the year, or like the number of parts in classic symphony, the unity of space as in Greek tragedy, and time - one life instead of one day, all give to this creation a wonderful symmetry and equilibrium.Worth seeing, this is a film that will make the delight of anybody who believes like I do that cinema is an art.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
15,paulclaassen,Could it possibly have been any slower paced...?,2,12 August 2020,"As the title indicates, the film is about the circle of life. While there's no denying 'Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter...and Spring' is beautifully filmed, it is one of the most boring films I've ever seen...I honestly can't understand why this is such a highly rated movie. Nothing significant happened here...apart from a young man with a conservative upbringing lusting for a girl now that he's mature. Sounds harsh? Well, that's what its all about. Yes, sure, everything is not to be taken literally and you have to read between the lines. There's a few underlying lessons here, but by golly, was it a tedious journey to discover the actual meaning of this film!This was insanely boring. To make matters worse, the film is also seriously short on dialogue. This might have worked as a short. Some scenes are unnecessarily long just to make up time. It's just not worth sitting through this for almost two hours with so little happening just to find the hidden message. A message I fully understand, mind you, but to tell it...so...slowly... is just not worth it. Yawn. Skip. (At least the cinematography was really beautiful).","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
16,Thanos_Alfie,Perfect photography...,6,31 October 2013,"""Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"" is a movie that shows us one place in which we have a house on a lake and this movie also shows us the four seasons of a year and the years that pass. In this house stays an old monk with a young boy and he is trying to teach him some things not only for life but for the human relationships.I liked very much the interpretation of Yeong-su Oh as the old monk and the interpretation of Jae-kyeong Seo who plays the little boy monk. As i said in the title of this review the photography of it's really beautiful because as seasons pass we can see the difference between them and of course the beauty of each one.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
17,howard.schumann,Labored and self-conscious,6,16 May 2004,"""While the film deals with Buddhist themes and elements, I made this film without having studied anything about it at all."" - Kim Ki-dukFilms that leave me feeling spiritually uplifted are often subtle and understated in their evocation of the transcendence of the human spirit. On the other hand, those that ""try"" to impress us about how spiritual they are often fail to achieve their desired goal. Such is the case for Spring, Summer, Fall, Winterand Spring, a South Korean film by Kim Ki-duk that works hard at conveying a spiritual experience but comes across as labored and self-conscious. While the shots are beautifully composed, the film offers little more than pre-packaged enlightenment, reiterating the accepted clichés about the long and painful process, the uphill battle full of struggle and effort, and so forth.Set in monastery on Jason Pond, an artificial lake in North Kyungsang Province in Korea surrounded by a forest of ancient trees, each season represents a chapter of life and the achievement of a hard-earned lesson. An old monk (Oh Young-Soo) teaches his young charge (Kim Jong-ho) about the value of all sentient beings. After the boy playfully ties a rock to a frog, a snake, and a fish, the old master shows him what it feels like by tying a huge rock to the boy's back while he is sleeping. In the morning, he is told to find the animals and free them or he will have to carry a rock in his heart the rest of his life. Unable to do so, the boy grows up with a burdensome guilt.By the following season, the young monk has become a 17-year old adolescent and is mesmerized when a beautiful teenage girl dressed in blue jeans shows up in his floating paradise, She has been brought by her mother because she is ""sick"" and wants the monks to ""cure"" her. After some time spent in prayer, the old monk tells the mother, ""When she finds peace in her soul, her body will return to health."" The soul cure is found pretty quickly when the young monk undoes his robe, letting us know that all women need to do to achieve health is to find a man. The old man confuses love with lust and utters such strange teaching as ""lust awakens the desire to possess, and that awakens the intent to murder"". When the girl is sent away following her cure, the boy also leaves the monastery and the film takes a non-Buddhist turn toward obsession and revenge until the cycle comes full circle.
Spring, Summer, Fall, Winterand Spring cultivates a mood of serenity but, from the opening moment to the final credits, it struck me as inauthentic. Buddhism is a disciplined system of mental and spiritual development designed to develop compassion and loving-kindness for all beings. Its practices include daily meditation that calms and clears the mind and allows us to gain a clearer sense of who we really are. This does not guarantee that we will never make mistakes but it is not credible to me that a boy raised from birth in the Buddhist tradition would be capable not only of cruelty to animals but to other human beings as well. At the end of the film I felt neither moved, uplifted, or even involved. If enlightenment means to lighten up, the best medicine for this sort of hokum is to laugh gently. After all, this too will pass. There is a cycle to everything -- even bad movies about spirituality.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
18,Vartiainen,"Slow and philosophical, something you'll remember",8,20 April 2017,"Kim Ki-duk continues to solidify his position as one of my all-time favourite directors. Every film I've seen from him has been a unique experience, yet all of them share similarities that make them instantly recognizable as a Kim Ki-duk film.This particular film is one of his best critical successes and in some ways a new direction for him. Most of his films are at least somewhat urban in nature and deal with themes such as sexuality, detachment and the effects of loneliness. And while those themes are also explored in this film as well, it feels different. The story goes that there's a lake up in the mountains, on which floats a small Buddhist temple. A lonely monk takes care of the temple, accompanied by a small boy. The film follows the events of the temple throughout the years, watching the boy grow as the seasons change. Each season is given a clear separate story, a separate mood, a separate set of symbols and omens.In some ways the film can only be understood if you know enough about Buddhism and its particular symbols and teachings. Then again, I certainly didn't, and I still enjoyed the film immensely. I also enjoyed learning about the symbols and meanings afterwards as I was reading about the film.And quite frankly that's about as much as I'm willing to say about the film. Because to say more would ruin the experience. Know that it's not a very fast-paced film. It's not about great characters or complicated dialogues. Rather it's about mood, about ideas, about silence. Very much worth a watch and a great place to start if you're unfamiliar with Kim Ki-duk.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
19,Turfseer,Original story with troubling questions that remain unanswered,6,25 December 2009,"'Spring, Summer, Fall, Winterand Spring', an offbeat film from Korea can best be described as a fable. It focuses on a Buddhist monk who lives in a 'monastery' (actually a small house in the middle of a lake) cut off from civilization. The film has five sequences, each set in successive seasons of the year. However, the action does not occur one season after another—there are gaps in years between each season.In the first 'Spring' sequence, the monk (who appears to be in his 60s) is mentoring an apprentice, a young boy who appears to be around 10 years of age. The boy takes delight in attaching a stone to various creatures he finds in the lake: a fish, a frog and a snake. The monk is appalled by the boy's cruelty and decides to teach him a lesson by attaching a rock with some rope around his back while he sleeps. He orders the boy to find the creatures, untie the stones from them and then he will remove the rock. Foreshadowing violence to come, the monk warns the boy that if any of the creatures dies, this will weigh heavily upon his heart for the rest of his life. Sure enough, when the boy returns, the fish is dead and it appears that the snake might be dead too; he is able to find the frog and remove the string and stone from that creature.In the next 'Summer' sequence, a mother leaves a young woman with the Monk as she is suffering from some sort of physical malady which is not made clear. The monk indicates that her physical problems will go away once she deals with the afflictions of her soul. The boy, now a young man of about twenty, takes a sexual interest in the young woman who initially rebuffs him. We never learn anything about this young girl's personality and for some reason she eventually gives in to the Young Adult Monk's advances and has sex with him on a number of occasions. When the old Monk finds out about this, he banishes the girl from the monastery but the Young Adult Monk has fallen in love with her and leaves the island to pursue her. Before he leaves, the Old Monk warns the Young Adult Monk that lust can only lead to murder.In the third 'Fall' sequence, the Old Monk has just returned with provisions he has obtained off the island. While unwrapping a newspaper which contains his lunch, he notices an article stating that his former pupil has murdered the girl that he had years before fallen in love with and was now wanted by the authorities. The former pupil now shows up at the island and makes it clear to the Old Monk that he killed his wife due to her infidelity and that he was still full of rage. In response, the Old Monk paints numerous cryptic characters on the deck of the house and orders his former pupil to carve out the letters one by one with a knife. He explains this will help him overcome his rage. Meanwhile, two detectives appear on the scene and take the Old Monk's former pupil away (presumably out of respect for the reputation of the Old Monk, they wait until daybreak to allow the former pupil to finish carving the letters before he's taken into custody). Later, the Old Monk commits suicide through self-immolation, while sitting inside a rowboat on the lake.Years pass when we arrive at the fourth ""Winter"" sequence. The former pupil is now much older and presumably has been released from prison. He returns to his old haunts on the island and once again takes up the disciplined practice of Buddhism which he rejected as a youth. A mysterious woman (her face covered with a shroud) walks across the iced-over lake and leaves an infant in the new monk's care. She mysteriously falls through a hole in the ice and drowns. In an apparent act of repentance for past sins, the new monk attach's a stone to his back and climbs up a mountain overlooking the island.Finally, there is a coda to the movie—a fifth sequence: spring again! Now life has come full circle. The pupil has now become the master and is teaching the young boy who earlier had been left in his care by the mysterious woman.Despite the film's originality, troubling questions remain. The young woman who has been brought to the Old Monk to be healed ends up becoming the sexual object of the Young Monk. Even though it's clear that the Old Monk knows that there are highly unethical things going on, he does nothing to prevent his charge from taking advantage of her. His response is to merely banish her from the island. He could have drawn boundaries from the beginning preventing his former pupil from acting the way he did. More troubling is the girl herself. What is it about the Young Monk that attracts him to her? For someone who's had no experience with women, most women would not be attracted to such a bumbling novice. We just don't know enough about the young woman to make us believe that she would take up so easily with the Young Monk.More troubling is the idea that the former pupil would end up a murderer. After all that good work the Old Monk does with the kid, apparently not enough of his good advice sinks in. Why exactly does the Young Monk become so jealous that he would resort to killing the woman he has fallen in love with? Most people do not become obsessed as the Young Monk does and the film's creator never explains why. Instead, there's a simple suggestion that everything here is predestined. Still, 'SSFW..and Spring again' features beautiful cinematography and gets high marks for being an original story which will keep your interest to the end.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
20,FilmCriticLalitRao,Circles of life :quite easy to watch in a film but absolutely difficult to follow in the real life.,10,19 July 2007,"I am a self confessed admirer of Kim Ki Duk.The mere mention of his name can provoke heated discussions.He is not so much liked by his own countrymen due to his choice of topics for this films.He is more liked outside Soth Korea where his admirers have easy access to his films both in terms of their availability and comprehension.The great thing about this film is that even though Kim Ki Duk is a part of Christian faith(he was born as a Christian),he has been successful in creating a meticulous spiritual tale of Buddhist world.This proves the amount of energy he spends in researching things about the subject matter of his films.I have seen Spring,Summer on many occasions and each viewing reinforces my belief in spirituality.It is good to see spiritual actions portrayed in a film on big screen but it is not only difficult but also impossible to follow them in real lives.The truth is that most of the people feel happy for a while and afterwards go about their daily chores.So if you wish to gain a brief spiritual experience watch this film.Nobody is going to question you about your spiritual existence after having seen this film.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
21,drqshadow-reviews,The Purest Ideals of Buddhism Given Form,8,10 April 2012,"A quiet, unhurried meditation on the lessons and warnings of Buddhism, given form by a basic narrative in which a lonesome monk ages, errs, matures and accepts his place in the world. Set on a floating temple in the center of an expressive, isolated Korean lake, the gorgeous scenery is as much a character as the very small cast. With the shifting of each season, the story turns the page on a new chapter, many of which skip decades at a time. While this allows the central character, who is never named, to grow vastly in spirit between appearances, it also makes the task of forgiving his larger sins more difficult for the audience. Which is, in a way, a lesson in itself. Delicately framed, it's a beautiful picture that's slow-moving and deliberate on the surface with a wealth of hidden meanings beneath.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"

23,Amyth47,A True Philosophical Gem - Aesthetically and Spiritually Compelling.,8,21 December 2018,"My Rating : 8/10""All conditioned things are impermanent - when one sees this with wisdom, one turns away from suffering.""On a floating monastery in a beautiful lake, a young Buddhist monk and his master live their austere, simple lives in Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring. This film traces the life of the young monk as he grows into adulthood and old age, with each stage of his life represented by a season of the year.This film perfectly exemplifies Buddhist teaching and ideals in both its narrative structure and its message. By framing its story within the changing seasons of the year and of life, it reminds us of the impermanent yet recurring nature of each stage of existence. The great Gautama Buddha sought to help people understand why they suffer and how they can end their suffering. Siddhartha Gautama taught that by maintaining the proper perspective and welcoming each change in one's life, we may avoid the sorrow that comes from clinging to either the joys or sorrows of any given season, and thereby achieve balance.A simple but very effective piece of film-making. Highly Recommended.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
24,Seraphion,"A film that presents the lessons of life, as much as testing our patience",6,20 September 2014,"The story opens up so slowly and softly that even when the base conflict of karma arrives, it won't be something highly noticeable for most viewers, especially casual viewers. The film really focuses on the Buddhist perspective on life; presenting the way they see life itself and how they suggest people deal with life. The movie tends to feel very long due to the serious lack of dialog or even human interaction in that matter. The Winter part doesn't even have a word uttered at all. But the lessons are strong within this movie, including karma and love. The movie, being terribly long in the sense of its lonesome aura and mood, tests our own mettle and patience in watching it. But I really don't agree with the overall conclusion of the movie that the cycle repeats itself, that man cannot be absolved from their inherent sin. The acting is a decent overall considering there's quite no need for much dialog in this movie.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
25,Galina_movie_fan,Cycle of Life,10,24 January 2006,"Easily one of the best films of that year, or previous year, or any year, ""Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter...and Spring"" is a tale of ""cycle of life."" The idea is not original but the result is amazing. It is perfection of simplicity, the story told by images more than by words. There are very few words but how much has been said. There are only two main characters but we are completely drawn to their life-long journey for the meaning and balance. Looking for inner peace, they encounter innocence, lust, passion, guilt, and redemption. It is a simply crafted story yet deep and subtle. It does what all movies try to do but only few have achieved - takes us out of our world, puts in another and keeps us there for days, weeks, and months.10/10","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
26,bkrauser-81-311064,A Cyclical Examination of Life,9,11 August 2016,"Very little in the world of Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter...and Spring is physically attached to one another, yet everything feels connected; physically, spiritually, narratively. The doors insinuating rooms inside the tiny monastery where we lay our scene stand alone, unattached to walls. The small row boat, providing the only connection between the outside world and the monastery is almost never festooned to its moorings. For that matter, neither is the temple itself which gently glides across the lake like it were a pontoon. Nothing is attached, yet everything is connected, tranquil and cyclical.The story is told in simple, largely visual terms; an elderly Monk (Yeong-su Oh), is rearing a small child (Jae-kyeong Seo) with him as his master in an isolated monastery surrounded on all sides by a man made lake. As the seasons pass the boy grows into a young man (Young-min Kim), then a troubled adult (Ki-duk Kim), with each chapter of his life reflecting in the seasons as they pass. We witness as the capriciousness of spring changes the boy into a flirtatious teenager by summer; made all the more apparent by the arrival of a young girl (Yeo-jin Ha) who comes to the temple in search of restoration. His desire for the girl turns to lust, desire then anger, followed by a long absence in fall before winter becomes a pilgrimage of contrition. All the while, the elderly Monk looks on like a spirit as his protégé succumbs to what is natural.What little is spoken throughout, everything people do speak in Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter...and Spring is given an incontrovertible weight. Yet there's never a lecture or conflict made verbal disquisition. Much of the conflict, characterization and morality is expounded through visual metaphor complimented by the fantastic natural splendor that surrounds our protagonists. What results is a film with the conciseness of a fable without trenchant proselytizing. The elderly Monk mirrors that sentiment, using a gentle hand to guide his young apprentice towards the lessons he needs to learn. The world then bends to the magnanimous will of the story, using animals as larger symbols of the young man's journey.What results is a story lush with beauty and serenity awash in the full spectrum of human experience. With a very small cast, director Ki- duk Kim unravels the central tenants of Buddhism and gingerly brays them into contemporary society. It results in colors and emotional shades hereto unseen by anything ever committed to celluloid apart from perhaps the final works of Ingmar Bergman. The comparison is completed with the ponderous rhythms of changing seasons and the slowly changing perspectives of the Monks.Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter...and Spring makes the short list for most beautiful film in human history, capitalizing on the natural beauty that surrounds the water bound temple. Furthermore it is an innately human parable about the cyclical nature of man and the hidden beauty therein. Contemplative yet truly mesmerizing, Spring, Summer, Fall Winter...and Spring is a revelatory triumph. Those looking for the naturalistic beauty of a Terrence Malick film bending to the meditative majesty of eastern philosophies should pick up Ki-duk Kim's contemporary classic right away.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
27,bandw,"Beautiful cinematography, unsatisfying story",5,13 January 2007,"This story of the life cycle of a Buddhist monk and an apprentice living in near isolation on a floating pagoda in the middle of a lake is beautifully filmed. The images and music create a distinct mood - the scenes of the apprentice doing T'ai Chi (?) on the snow and ice are poetic. But I had some real problems with the story.First, some technical concerns. Many scenes seemed contrived or not believable. For example, when the old monk ties the stone on the sleeping child, can it be believed that the kid would not wake? Or that he would not notice his new burden sometime during the night? The interior of the pagoda was exceedingly sparse, but no end of things kept coming out of it: ropes, stones, ice chisels, clothes, paints, and so forth. The doorway in the middle of the empty room irritated me every time someone felt obligated to walk through it when walking around it would have been much easier. How did these people earn their living? In thinking about the scene where the apprentice is hanging from the ceiling in a sling on the end of a rope with a candle burning under the support, I wondered just what the mechanics were of arranging that. The old monk seemed pretty weak, too weak to tie the apprentice up and hoist him several feet into the air. And what was supporting the rope from the ceiling? Was there a pulley up there? How was the rope affixed to its ceiling support? Where did that aluminum can come from that the police were shooting at? It was the only item ever to mar the pristine beauty of the lake, and at just the appropriate time. And the old monk was able to flick a stone and hit it on the first try? And he just happened to have a small pebble in his hand right then? Painting all those carved characters with a cat's tail would require a mighty patient cat. And where did all those colored paints come from? The hole that the apprentice chipped into the ice was nowhere big enough for the woman to fall through. And so on.Now that I have run through some of the petty concerns of a literalist, I can move on to what really bothered me about this story. The overall message appears to be that isolating yourself from society is the path to some higher state. Even if that were true, it seems like a selfish goal. Much more challenging and useful is to attain balance in the midst of the chaos that is living in the world. The old monk utters the words, ""Lust awakes the desire to possess. And that awakens the intent to murder,"" as if to express some deep insight. However, it is the rare person who has not experienced lust, but only a tiny percentage of those ever have an intent to kill. These words from the wise man seem patently false. But, in the context of this film the words have a more potentially worrisome significance. Perhaps the import of the words carried such weight for the apprentice that the intimation planted in the mind effected the deed. The lessons meted out by the master seemed exceedingly harsh. If tying a stone to a snake were to kill the snake and the snake were to die, then the kid would have to carry that burden with him for life? What a traumatic thing to say to an innocent kid. If as a kid I had had a super moralist following my every move, as this kid did, I would have gone nuts. I found the sadomasochistic beating to be disturbing and repellent. And what is the deal with the worshiping of icons? I though the sacred was in the mind and not in physical objects? If everybody were to absorb the teachings of the master, then our race would soon die out since sex seems to be avoided at all cost. I have found that an intense day of tedious activity indeed produces exhaustion, as did the apprentice, but it never seemed to be a path to the catharsis and peace that the apprentice experienced after his ordeal. And the master could beckon an empty boat to him or impede the rowing of two vigorous men by force of mind? Give me a break.There is too much Eastern philosophy and mysticism here for this Western viewer.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
28,sarastro7,Not that simple,7,3 April 2005,"I was not as impressed with this movie as most people here seem to be; I found it slightly dull and not very constructive in its message. Still, it is a beautiful piece of film-making, and it has enough developments to keep your attention despite the simplicity of the setting and the scarcity of characters and dialog.As a symbolic tale, I didn't think it was simple at all. It was about the attempt - the failed attempt - to attain peace and serenity. It showed that no matter how lofty your ideals and no matter how much you isolate yourself from the world, the human condition remains the same. Life on the remote lake ultimately mimicked all the chaos, anguish and meaningless pain and death of the outside world. The monk's faraway place of worship became a lie; an escape; a retreat from the madness that had infected the monk himself as much as everyone else in modern society. A place for atoning for past sins, rather than living some virtuous pious life. A form of therapy rather than a noble pursuit in its own right. A self-inflicted prison, almost.So the film-maker did not endorse any kind of romantic view of the monastic life style; he did not say it was an improvement over an ordinary life style. He said that Buddha may soothe, but he can't heal. While I'm not religious, I do believe that high ideals are capable of changing things for the better, so I'm not sure I can agree, on the symbol plane, with the film-maker's message.7 out of 10.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
29,sharky_55,...and Spring.,10,13 November 2015,"The title gives away the structure. It is Spring, and a floating temple is surrounding by an idyllic lake and mountains all around. A young boy giggles endlessly while abusing animals in the most unusually cruel way, and no doubt Kim Ki-duk has inflicted this in real life as it is on the screen, leading to that entire end sequence being cut in the US. Not that I agree with animals cruelty, but there is nothing to be gained and much to be lost by removing the entire ending of a film. Upon being discovered by his master, the boy has his own cruelty imposed on him, and the young actor's ability to laugh and gurgle so unmoved from his acts but also sob endlessly is marvellous. A stone is placed in his heart, and its burden remains for much of his young life. Summer opens as all the other seasons do, with the creaky beckoning of the doors of the archway which often frames the floating temple. Now it provide a docking point in the heat of summer, while at other times it is half submerged by the tide. It provides a purely symbolic function, much like the wall-less door in the temple itself, but signifies the devotion of the Buddhist lifestyle that is marred when the now teenage boy commits theft and flees. He is blossoming sexually, wrapped up by carnal desire, but is also conflicted enough to pray relentlessly and tearfully upon his defeat to temptation. The first instance of sex is framed by a extreme wide shot of the two against the rocky shore of the lake, and I am struck by how much this seems like animalistic behaviour in the wild, of filming a documentary where two creatures unexpectedly give into their biological functions. The master is not furious when he catches him, but warns that a strand of lust and desire will lead to greater wrongs. He carries two items as he flees, heartbroken; the rooster is a purely selfish act, while the statue is the weight of the teachings that cannot be separated. The last shot is of sunlight being pushed out of frame by storm clouds.Fall brings orange leaves and the boy back, now a young man and having committed murder because of his undying love. This is tragic because it shows the pitfalls of the religion and also the solitary lifestyle; he has been taught to repress such desires and has not adequately understood love, and so chases after a woman who, he has shared more sexual experiences than words with. The rock is at its most heaviest here. And yet the master is once again not furious, but wholly accepting. He beats him not for the murder he has committed, but for trying to escape its consequences through suicide. Kim di-Kuk masterfully imbues a peaceful silence as the man carves out his repentance (an admittedly cheesy moment when the master silences the gunshots with well thrown rock). Even the two policemen become swayed by this peace. As he is taken away for physical punishment, there is a achingly beautiful time lapse shot where the water and leaves tremble, and the temple slowly but surely floats across serenely. This signifies the end of the master's life, having done all he has done. There will be another master.Winter, and the lake is frozen in time. In an incident of karma, a veiled woman arrives, proceeds to abandon her son, and pays dearly with her life. The middle aged man, nearly complete in his repentance and understanding, merely accepts this as it is, just as his master did so long ago. We do not see her face, but does it matter? It could be any of us. The soundtrack is at its most dramatic here. A tense orchestration strikes up as he begins a training montage, moulding and sculpting his body according to the meditative teachings, acquiring peace of mind. He gracefully poses upon the slippery surface without the least bit of concern - he has mastered the surface, and the water that he once struggled with so much. To complete his journey, he once again inflicts the punishment of the animals. The traditional ode Jeongseon Arirang is particularly lifting as he beings the ascent to the mountain. Crosscut are a frog, fish and snake struggling and writhing, mirroring his pain. It has been merely an hour in runtime since those childhood actions, but it feels like a lifetime. Life returns us to Spring, and again we have a young boy torturing animals, and showing a lack of awareness of what is to come. But the final shot offers a different perspective, of the Buddhist statue overlooking the lake and its temple, framed and isolated by the power of nature. The cycle of life and birth and reincarnation has brought us back to this point, but the trials and tribulations of a man promises release from this never-ending cycle. The colours and words of the Heart Sutra are now faded, but its lessons remain.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
30,fwomp,Drink In The Seasons Of Life,8,15 July 2006,"A recent blockbuster film, MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA, blew my mind with its sumptuous cinematography, settings, and costumes. It was pure eye-candy, through and through. Looking at the cost of production, $85 million, one can easily see the care director Rob Marshall took with each and every shot. Now let's move on to SPRING, SUMMER, FALL, WINTER ...AND SPRING (SSFWAS), director Ki-duk Kim's sparkling success.Shot in one location on a high mountain lake in Korea, and using only a handful of actors/actresses, SSFWAS accomplishes the same wondrous scenery with only a fraction of the GEISHA budget.The story is that of a monk and a young boy in training to become a monk. They live in a monastery that floats, raft-like, on a pristine mountain lake. The monk teaches the boy life lessons: how to pray, caring for one's home, and treating nature's creatures with respect. We view their experiences through the title's seasons, sometimes leaping a few years ahead, watching the boy grow, mature, and learn how tough life can be. As the story progresses, the boy battles his demons, learns by hard example, then comes full-circle to become the very thing he so recklessly tossed away (his faith in God/Buddha and his trust in his old mentor, the monk).The script is a simple one, not delving into side-plots, but giving us a glimpse at how extraordinary life truly is. This isn't just the life of a boy and his master, though. This is everyone's life with all its trials, follies, and triumphs.But through all of this simplicity there's the camera work. It is (to use a cliché) breathtaking. The changes in season are stunning, and the lighting, angles and scope of the landscape are visually perfect.It's also interesting to note that the film is only 103 minutes long and has maybe 30 lines of dialogue. The scenery tells the story more often than anything the actors say, which is also impressive.Not surprising, the movie is slow but viewers probably won't notice because of the oohing and ahing most will do while sitting drinking in every lush scene.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
31,khanbaliq2,"This film, director Kim Ki-duk's best, reveals the spiritual yearning behind his dark vision.",8,4 May 2010,"Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter And Spring is as meditative and beautiful as its title would suggest. On an island monastery in the middle of a remote Korean lake, a monk's apprentice learns lessons at each stage in life, and eventually takes over from his master.The film is a beguiling distillation of Buddhist philosophy, rich with a glistening natural beauty and unfolding with Zen calm, despite vigorous bursts of sex and cruelty. The episodic structure represents life as a cycle of perpetual renewal, like the seasons.Kim Ki-duk said of the film: ""I intended to portray the joy, anger, sorrow and pleasure of our lives through four seasons and through the life of a monk who lives in a temple on Jusan Pond surrounded only by nature.""","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
32,rainking_es,Simply delightful,8,16 November 2006,"The movies of Ki-Duk Kim are accumulating, it's hard to follow the rhythm of a director that makes 3 or 4 films every year.

In short: the circle of life.""Spring, Summer"" is a calmed place in the day by day madness, it's like a ""mantra"", so it's quite understandable that those who want velocity and adrenaline will hate this movie and the whole Ki-Duk Kim works.

33,artzau,A Visual Delight,9,18 September 2004,"I'm constantly amazed by the appearance of some seemingly off-the-wall piece of art that when you view it evokes a stunning effect. The simplicity of this film, its low-key action and pace, its visual surrealistic beauty, all interact to create an emotional impression that is long-lasting and thought-provoking. Korea has been somewhat slower to enter the international cinematic world and here is a film with actors whose names stir little or no recognition. For myself, who has enjoyed the Korean films I've seen before, it was a delightful surprise. The film itself is a wonderful tapestry of Korean Buddhist culture, with quiet visual beauty, simple moral themes and human passions put into a simple, homespun perspective. The remarkable natural setting which reflects the wide spectrum of Korea's seasons, which range from hot, sticky humid-fraught summers to icy, cold snow-bound winters, become a metaphor of life with unadorned figures, completely human in form. The old monk becomes a witness to the interplay of human qualities, without judgment yet with a complete and quiet moral presence. The foibles of child cruelty is met with a simple retribution which imparts a lasting lesson. Judgment is always withheld and warnings are given simply. The effect of all of this rings long and lasting, much like the impression of a delicate Korean silk print: simple in design with plain brush strokes and stylized representations of nature-- yet, lasting in impression, often to the point of being unforgettable. I buy few videos and DVDs, preferring to see things I really enjoyed again and again. But, I've ordered this one.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
34,lawprof,The Fifth Season Is For Renewal,10,9 May 2004,"SOME SPOILERS UNAVOIDABLE[See IMDb main page for this film for cast and director.  They aren't known outside Korea.]In music and literature as well as in film, the cycle of seasons often is a profound leitmotif for the stages of human experience.  Rarely has that association been so beautifully and exquisitely portrayed than in the Korean film, ""Spring Summer Autumn Winter...and Spring.""  The ""fifth"" season reflects not only the Buddhist concept of eternal cycles but it also encompasses a compelling universality.While the seasons change in normal progression, years pass between each one, a technique that allows the unfolding of a rich story of growth, love, loss and redemption.Set in a gorgeous Korean landscape outside, wholly, the bustle of a modern industrialized society, all the scenes take place on either a floating temple in a calm lake or in its immediate vicinity.  A monk in the first spring is the only caretaker but also teacher of a little boy.  Childish acts of cruelty to animals delight the child until a tough lesson from the master molds his awakening conscience.With summer comes a young woman accompanied by her mother, both dressed in comfortable, stylish western garb.  The daughter is ill, coughs betraying a non-specific malady.  Why she has been brought to the monk is never stated but the expectation is for a healing sojourn.Now a young man, the acolyte falls either in lust or in love with the woman. Their sexual congress is proclaimed by the master as an obviously necessary cure for the woman's illness but he warns the smitten youth that in the outside world love and violence are intermingled.  Hardly surprisingly, the man departs with the woman for life outside the rituals and teachings of Buddhism.And then comes autumn and the anguished young man is back.  He married the woman and it didn't work out.  In fact it worked out so badly that two detectives arrive to arrest him.  Now wizened but still wise, the master concocts an act of spiritual expiation to unburden the tortured fellow's soul.  Even the cops fall under the monk's spell.Winter brings the now matured and hardy former disciple back to the temple where he begins to repeat his now deceased master's simple life.  And as he once was brought to the old master, now a mysterious woman brings a baby boy to the temple, a child she can not keep.And spring again...the symbol of renewal but also repetition.This is a brilliant film that distills a great moral tradition into a tale that uses the passage of a little over a year to illustrate much of the human experience.  You don't have to be especially interested in Buddhism to savor the strengths, weaknesses and temptations moving across the screen.10/10","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
35,PIST-OFF,ouroboros and simplistic morality play,8,18 February 2006,"the concepts and idea of the film are nothing new and neither is the central idea. using seasons as metaphors for the stages of life is probably as old as religion itself. despite the prevalence of this old metaphor it still resonates quite nicely. this film might make a good companion piece to the Hesse novel Siddhartha (that is, if there isn't already a movie of that). The scenery takes a front stage in this film which is quite meditative simply to look at. An island hut floating in the middle of a lake and protected on all sides by mountains. And i don't believe that the feeling of cold has ever been so evoked so wonderfully on film. The characters (who have no names) move about in this scenery less like individuals and more like chess pieces going through moments and movements even they fail to grasp the significance of. My only complaint was the handling of the build up to carnal exploration which feels a bit forced, and lacks any of the singular obsessiveness which drives such emotions.8 out of 10","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"

37,smakawhat,An Amazing awakening journey!!,10,15 May 2004,"Kim Ki-duk's latest film simply tells the life of 2 monks who inhabit a temple that exists in a setting that seems one could only dream.  The setting is a small pond that is nestled between several mountains and within this pond a simple temple floats in the center, through the ever changing seasons.  It is within the changing seasons that we follow a young mentored monk from boyhood, to manhood.The first story involves the young monk smart-alecking around and tying rocks to animals for fun.  The next morning he awakens to find a giant stone tied to him by his master.  Considerably immobile and begging his master that he has learned his lesson, his master does not remove the stone until he orders the young monk to go release all the animals first.  If any of them are dead he proclaims, you will carry that stone in your heart forever.There are many spiritual teachings that are throughout the film, and the story continues with the young monk's education.  Other seasons show him as an inexperienced teenager, and then as an adult later.  For sake of spoilers I will not say what happens, only to suggest that the first story hints that the young disciple is headed towards a life of possible tragedy.  However, what happens isn't so much of importance, but the setting it happens in. Kim Ki duk hasn't created so much as a film or a story, but a journey of exquisite beauty that happens around the viewer.  You are literally forced to do nothing and await this films exquisite beauty, and the film isn't so much entertainment as it is a meditation for the soul.From within the lessons and beautifully shot seasons that occur, you are surrounded and literally ""enveloped"", in the temples beauty.  Every single shot in this film, from the cinematic grand pictures of the temple by itself, to simple shots of just someone climbing up a hill, is perfect. EVERY SINGLE ONE!!  More importantly the poetic pace of this film forces you to look and relax and await the beauty that surrounds the temple.  The most spectacular shots involve the camera remaining motionless, and the landscape changing and more importantly MOVING around the participants.  This effect is simply indescribable and powerful in terms of putting the viewer not just in a great film, but as an observing participant in the story.  It's as if we can sit back and watch the lives of these people from some holy juncture.I can honestly say in my several years of strongly watching and reviewing films that I have never seen a film that was so powerful, and effective on the viewer, but was so incredibly simple and extremely subtle to get that effect.   It is a great deal of masterwork that Kim Ki-duk did to pull off such strength while just letting the story and the surroundings tell things by itself.I have seen it on the big screen twice and upon second viewing its power was even stronger and more unforgettable.  It is certainly a film that deserves some award merit come February, and one that I will never forget.Rating 9.5 out of 10","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"

And Spring is an artistic film by a South Korean director/writer, Kim Ki-Duk. His films haven't been that successful in his home country, but they are internationally very popular. His films have got a lot of nominations and prizes from many European festivals. After seeing a few of Kim Ki-Duk's films on TV, I decided to rent Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... And Spring, because of its huge appreciation. Quickly I found where all the appreciation had came. Later on I had the chance to see this on the big screen, in a film theater. I've mostly written this review according to my first time experience, but the second viewing opened some new stuff up too. This is a breathtakingly beautiful tale of moral growth.An old monk lives with his young student in a floating temple on an isolated lake. He observes the young boy's games with animals. The boy learns. The boy grows into a youngster. A young girl comes to the temple to heal. The boy falls in love and goes after the girl to the city. He comes back as a murderer, gets in jail. After many years he comes back as an older man, gets a student and teaches him.That is briefly the storyline of this film. It's a growth story divided in five parts. The first part, spring, shows the boy's childhood. The way he treats animals and the way how the monk gives him a lesson of life. He never could forget the traumatic experience, the horrors he did to the animals. The second part, summer, is about his youth. In that era he meets the girl who comes to the temple to heal. They start having sex and try not to let the master find out. When the girl gets healed and leaves, the boy goes after her. In the third part, fall, he comes back as a murderer of his wife. In the temple he manages to achieve inner peace. The fourth part, winter shows us his return from jail to the temple. A masked woman comes there with a boy. In the last fifth part, spring (again) the boy, the woman brought becomes a student of the man. We see the circulation of life.And that is the main theme of the film, circulation of life. As in the beginning the boy played with animals, in the end the other does it too. It makes us wonder about the life of the first old monk. Did he go through the same as well? The burden the boy had to carry through his life is turned into a stone here. Guilt. The life he goes through includes some of the most touching scenes in the history of modern cinema.This film is an incredibly beautiful tribute to nature and life. I always thought that La Grande Illusion (1937) was the only film that managed to actually salute to life. Even that this is a completely different film, this managed to do the same. Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... And Spring will make the most die-hard sons of the western-world realize the true beauty of nature, life and the eastern wisdom. Through that this film is a must-see for all the people.As other films by the same director have proved that he has a great talent of visual narrative so did this. The film doesn't have much of a dialog, which was to me one of the best technical things in this film. I understand that many Europeans/Americans might have a problem with that. Because most of us aren't used to this kind of narrative, at least the people who only watch mainstream and commercial films. But those people won't probably even come across with a gem like this. This is a quiet, non-hectic growth story. In addition to its marginal dialog it has a lot of symbols and many of them might be totally unknown for the people of the western world. But that's not a bad thing it's the reason why this film can be watched so many times. It made me to go through some Buddhist symbols in the internet.Earlier I named the circulation of life as the main theme of the film. But it also deals up with themes like: guilt, regret, learning, growth, spiritualism, wisdom, lust and greed. The latter can be proved by the rooster. The rooster is a symbol of greed, a desire to have and own everything. ""Lust awakens the desire to possess."" As the old monk said.These are the main things I wanted to mention of Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... And Spring. It's a great film and to keep this as short as possible I left a few things away. By that I also wanted to let you observe on your own to achieve the highest possible enjoyment. This is maybe, dare I say the best film of the decade. Even that I haven't yet seen all the films of the decade, but at least this is one of the best. A very touching experience.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
39,Bob Pr.,"Gave it 10/10 first time, only 6/10 second time",6,30 June 2004,"My review after seeing it a second time follows this first one (WARNING: SECOND REVIEW HAS SPOILERS)This beautiful film is one to see more than once -- either in the theater (or in your mind's eye). I found the discussion group on this film (see IMDb's Message Board for this film title) VERY helpful in illuminating the symbolism which I partially grasped the first time I saw it and in decoding some Buddhist principles.The setting and the photography that captures it are strikingly beautiful and satisfying. The issues are so universally human that the Buddhist flavor provides an accent and not a barrier.The story recounts the growth of a child into his adulthood and his eventual reclaiming of his roots and meaning. While the film deals with other Buddhist principles and symbolic elements, a central part of it very much reminds me of lines from T.S. Eliot's ""Four Quartets"" which reads (loosely remembered) '...and the aim of all our wandering is to arrive again at the place from which we started ---- and know it for the first time...'As one sees one cycle end and another begin, it made me wonder about how the old monk first got there and what his life was like.Symbolic. Complex. Elegantly simple. Beautiful. Evocative. Haunting. Provocative. Gently touching the universal religious and the profound.10/10 =============(SPOILERS AHEAD) After 2nd time (03Mar2011):Buddhists are against hurting animals. SO why wouldn't a wise monk intervene when the young boy in his care was tying stones to the animals? --BEFORE they died? And be aware that teenagers have hormones that often steer them? The recurring gratuitous punitiveness and pain bothered me: the monk beating the young man's back, the demand to carve all night 100s of characters into the wooden deck, the self-immolation, the pulling the weight up the mountain, the nude torso in winter, etc.As if enduring pain for pain's sake helps anything but masochism or sadism?The film's photography did remain very beautiful to me on the 2nd view.6/10","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
40,tnrcooper,The circle of life,9,20 February 2014,"Kim Ki-Deok takes the long view of life in this film. He sees life from a more remote distance. It's beautiful and poetic. We see the mistakes of the father repeating themselves down the line and we see life as a blink of an eye. Really beautiful film about the course we take in life and how actions and decisions live on into the future. Nothing new under the sun. No one is totally good or totally bad and life goes on.In this film, a young boy living on a remote lake is raised by a monk with whom he lives a simple, ascetic life. I think Kim is showing by some of the responses of the boy that someone who grows up so remote from society might have difficulty adapting to living in society.It's a beautiful, reflective film. Not much happens, but on the other hand, more than enough happens to make a great film. Kim Ki-Deok is a thoughtful man and a brave, talented director. Some great performances, most especially from Yeong Su-oh as the monk, but also from Jae-kyeong Seo as the kid and from the director playing the oldest version of the kid. Reflective, thoughtful film.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
41,dcldan,Totally different,7,26 November 2006,"Two monks (master and apprentice) live in a isolated temple in the mountains. The young one its doing his way to learn about the paths of life. One the the arriving of a mother with her daughter to the temple will change their peaceful life. The young one will learn about love and jealousy and will learn by heart the prices of loving too obsessively. With a very different rhythm and a sense of quietness very unusual, the movie tells us a tao story inside the most spectacular mountains of Korea. Dialogues are forbidden (almost) because they are not needed, and it is task of the actors (good job) to make us understand what is happening. Though being very different (this may do not like to everybody), the photography is superb and the story, though very slow (as demanded in the atmosphere of the film) is very touching and heart-taking.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
42,Atavisten,On the cycles of life and Buddhism,9,9 April 2005,"This I feel is a very personal film for Kim Ki-Duk and that he himself plays the most important role supports that. The scenery and some details was also in the equally brilliant Seom (the lake with huts/temple for one, the other you'll see for yourself). Suchwiin bulmyeong (Adress Unknown) reflects his political views. This reflects his personal philosophy. He promotes the views of Buddhism, self awareness for instance, that the old monk instead of punishing the young monk rather lets him experience the same. And the thing with the carving of the Chinese characters. Also the worth of all living creatures and the cycles and the importance of denying passion and possession.Its not difficult to watch this movie as it won so many rewards and so much is written about it. It has deserved all that, and much more. Lets just hope that Kim Ki-Duk continues making movies personal and of no compromise as he has. I am a big fan of his.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
43,Artimidor,Doorways to yourself,9,16 April 2014,"Endless sky. Mountains. Trees. Pristine nature all around. A lake. A temple floating in its mid, a haven of tranquility. A Buddhist monk and his pupil call this place their home, living a humble, ascetic life of daily routines. Surrounding and permeating it all is the circle of life, repeating itself over and over again: spring, summer, fall, winter... and spring again. A year, a lifetime, what's the difference? These are the ingredients of Ki-duk Kim's invitation to lean back and watch, to contemplate and meditate, listen closely to the inner self. While the scenery is guaranteed to impress its viewers right away and throughout the picture, the story itself is basically an allegorical offering, a fable if you will, a touchstone for the individual to measure one's self. Kim's film is simple and straightforward, with no unnecessary embellishments that distract from its core, speaking to the heart and told primarily in images with only a handful of characters and next to no dialog - you won't miss anything. However, while the film is directed to the soul searcher in us it doesn't evoke a philosophically imbued melancholy you might find in European cinema for thinkers represented by the likes of Bergman or Tarkovsky. Rather it opens the doors for you to get immersed in an Eastern world view and it does so with bravura without being preachy or over the top.Ki-duk Kim has a rather diverse oeuvre to offer, but the zen-like quality one finds in ""Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"" is also present e.g. in his fascinating work ""3-Iron"", whose original Korean title ""Empty House"" is much closer to what the film actually tries to convey. In both films food for thought is embedded in a seemingly straightforward story that can resonate deeply, given the viewer's mindset to welcome the Buddhist spirit. It helps to think about the endless sky. Mountains. Trees. Pristine nature all around. And a lake with a single house on it.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
44,kurosawakira,The Monk's Life,8,23 April 2013,"A film as undisturbed as the lake portrayed, peacefully advancing; not much is spoken, but so much is said. I like ""Bin-jip"" (2004) even more, but I'm certain it wouldn't exist were it not for this, a film that in some ways enables Kim to travel as far as he does. There, and in the films that followed, he's narratively adventurous, and at first sight this seems to be quite ordinary even. There's the Buddhist undersong, however, that makes the narrative bend, and it's really implied in the title as well: it's cyclical, everything, woven quite beautifully in the fabric of the thing — a boy grows up and abandons his teacher, then coming back after his master's death. He now takes his place, soon finding a young boy entering his supervision. He has learnt from his mistakes (has he?), but now sees the young boy, of course played by the same boy actor who's with us in the beginning, do the exact same foolish things he did as a child. The director himself plays this final phase in the monk's life.The film has a special place in my film life, as it somewhat typifies a period of watching many, many films, and I don't hesitate one bit to extend the film's narrative to my own exploration of cinema: childish curiosity, hits and misses of early life, the tragic swerve, reconciliation, apparent clarity. Isn't this the beauty of watching films, to learn, to be hurt, to heal, and in a positive light not to learn too much, thus making us experience it all over again?","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
45,mohit_sinsniwal,WOW!,7,1 June 2019,"Perfect SimplicityMy review of this film should end with those two words. However, the 10 line minimum requirement that IMDb requires of all reviews belies the differences between my world and the world shown to me in Spring, Summer, Fall, Winterand Spring. I understand why IMDb does not want 1000's of (apparently) useless two-word reviews in their database. However, I would hope that they could make an exception for this film.Perfect: The film is as close to perfect as a film could get. No shot is presented to us, nor a line of dialog uttered that does not make us ponder and understand at the same time. The film is also beautiful. (Like the previous reviewer, I am a fan of Asian cinema and never tire of the stunning ability of Asian directors to capture beauty on film.) This film exceeds most other Asian films I have seen in the cinematography regard. However, its beauty is surprisingly deceptive. Like most great films, it surpasses the 'cinematography' level of beauty and delves into the beauty of existence through its story. For example, the Old Monk has a different pet during each 'season' of his life. This is not discussed by the characters nor shoved in our face by the director - as would have been done if Hollywood had done this film. It is merely background we experience and come to understand. Two days after viewing the film, I am still finding new reflections in my mind that encompass the cinematography, the literal story and the underlying context of the film.Simplicity: This film approaches a level of cinematic Haiku. While I don't recall the entire dialog with any specificity, I am sure you could print the script on one page of paper. The amazing part is that while you are watching the film, you don't notice this. Every shot moves the story along. The simplicity of life as shown by the story is reflected in the simplicity of the film. After the film ended, I had a strong urge to move away from civilization and live - or die - in peace with nature. I enjoy (and have come to be too dependent upon) modern inventions, so I will stay at home. However, this film will remain in my heart. It does exactly what good story-telling is supposed to do: Take us completely out of our world and put us in another. There is no wonder that this film was selected for so many film festivals.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
46,tapio_hietamaki,A man's journey of self-discovery and spiritual enlightenment,10,23 March 2017,"This is not a boring art movie. Do not skip this movie thinking it's going to go over your head, even though some of it probably will. This movie will make you think and feel, and it's not a difficult watch like some Tarkovsky film or There Will Be Blood or something like that. It's less than two hours long, it's easy to follow and it has some really profound messages.There is plenty of symbolism that requires knowledge of Buddhism to fully grasp, like the animals present in the movie, or the meaning of the ending sequence, but even without context you can appreciate the story and the characters.Kim Ki-duk's movies are great, some of them are really weird but this one just works even if you go into it totally clueless.So why is it that good? It's got it all - love, passion, crime, forgiveness, repentance. It's got a totally ripped kung fu master, a beautiful young lady totally naked, it's got a floating Buddhist temple in the middle of an idyllic valley, it's got a spell inscribed onto the floor by a cat's tail. It will leave you with questions, but it will also give you answers to questions you didn't know you even had.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"

A small boat, to link to the ground. There is the gate, perhaps some fences too, only the movie doesn't show the fences, as we pass from one world to another only through the gate.Probably inside the shrine the rooms have also walls, the movie doesn't show them either. What use would be? Use is there only for doors, to open and to close.Everything is slow there, the shrine is for meditation. An old monk, and along with him a dog, a cat, a roster, a snake, are they the spirits of the deceased monks? Once we accept the movie convention, we enter the zen space.And an apprentice, a kid who is raised by the old monk and is finding his road in life.Here, so far from the world, is the road of life, here the apprentice learns the great and simple lessons of life, and each age is like a season.Innocence, passion, sin, loose of hope, repentance, illumination ... innocence again - the endless road of life.The surrounding mountains are full of small statues of Buddha- each one was carried in its place by some monk, long time ago - each monk started as an apprentice and found its way to holiness through trial and error, through sin and repentanceIt's so beautiful !","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
49,colonel_green,Zen and the Art of Cinema,9,15 July 2004,"I'm not a Buddhist, and I have little specific knowledge of Buddhism, so I cannot speak to the accuracy of Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter...and Spring's presentation of Buddhist life.  To my Roman Catholic mind, this was a great film. I've seen three foreign language films in my life (this, The Passion of the Christ, The Barbarian Invasions), and subtitles have never posed a problem for me.  Even if they had, I could still have easily enjoyed this film, which I doubt has more than fifty lines of dialogue in its entire run; and in many cases, what is being said is obvious from body language and situations. The plot is fairly ordinary, even obvious, but this never poses a problem. None of the principle characters have names, but that is no problem either; they're archtypes, embodiments of the various emotional stages of life.  The audience has known characters like this before, by many different names. Only once did the plot go somewhere I wasn't expecting it too, but this film's placid tone is one of it's strengths. This is primarily a visual experience, with many shots composed like oil paintings, but there isn't a single special effect in the whole film.  As I am unfamiliar with Buddhist traditions, some of the imagery was beyond my comprehension; but by and large, the film possessed an awesome visual poetry.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"

52,gentendo,The Stones We Carry,10,22 October 2007,"It was apparent that the Korean culture held strict reverence towards Buddhism and the path to enlightenment. This was heavily suggested in the film through the use of doors. At the beginning of all five seasons expressed, there are two doors that open to a beautiful and isolated monastery out on the middle of a lake. Monasteries, by nature, are sanctuaries where ascetic monks retreat to seek enlightenment. The doors represented the barrier between the noise of the outside world (i.e. city life) and the peace of the inside world (i.e. nature). This sacredness is heightened inside of the monastery as well. Two doors are paralleled next to each; in the center lies a sculpture of the Buddha where worshipping takes place. There is a particular scene that the director suggests how the Buddha becomes desecratedhow what is considered holy is made unholy. When the older boy begins to have sexual relations with the girl, he crawls to her side of the room, not going through the doors, but around the doors. It's as if when the boy was contemplating going through the doors, he hesitated for a moment, realizing that his conscience would have been seared with guilt if he had gone through. This was a commentary that suggests that it is better to be a non-conformist than pretending to be holy.The sacredness of monks being viewed as spiritually enlightened teachers is also highly venerated amongst this culture. The old monk depicted in the film is very experienced and wiseone who teaches the path to enlightenment. In a way, the director portrayed the old monk as Godone whose all-seeing eye watches over everyone. This is demonstrated in one particular scene. From the beginning, the viewer knows that there is only one boat used to travel from the monastery to the forest. When the young boy uses the boat to venture out by himself into the forest to tie stones to the various animals of the field, the old monk is seen watching behind him from a distance. This idea of the monk violating time and space (acting like God) is only understood because of the boat. There would have been no way for him to get to the forest without having the boat to transfer him there. Since the boat was already taken by the young boy, it is apparent that the director is making a commentary on the culture's sacred view of monks.The sacredness of animals is also highly esteemed in the Korean culture. Animals in most Buddhist cultures help teach the way to enlightenmentthey are considered the Zen masters. Because they do not possess a mind that is capable of reason, they do not cause unnecessary suffering by attaching themselves to righteous or unrighteous desires like humans do. Most of the pains humans suffer are caused by their own ignorance and enslavement to doing what is wrong. Animals do not know any better. They are in a constant state of bliss and the mere observance of them brings an individual closer to enlightenment. In the film, ducks are shown peacefully gliding, frogs (when given the chance) are shown quietly swimming, and snakes (also when given the chance) are shown gently slithering. All of these traits are effectively contrasted with the inner turmoil and struggle seen within the people of the story. It's as if the director wants not only the characters, but also the viewers, to observe the nature of these animals to help them on their own path to nirvana.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
53,poc-1,Quite Disappointing,5,20 May 2008,"The recommendations and visuals would lead you to believe that this is a really thoughtful, unique movie. Indeed the first two chapters ""Spring"" and ""Summer"" were promising, leading up to a plot which manages to hold the attention. After this is starts to go downhill and the final third is just awful, with a few very silly scenes. Also lacking is any kind of subtlety. You expect a quite thoughtful meditation, but really you get a series of really simple dumbed-down messages like ""it is bad to hurt animals"" or there are consequences to evil acts. The director is not content with making a point once, or obliquely, he has to make the point three or four times each chapter. This points to a basic lack of editing directorial concision. For instance, the child monk in ""Spring"" is naughty, mean to three wild animals, a fish, a frog and a snake. The master chastises him an makes him rescue the animals. The whole series of scenes where the child finds each animal in turn and then has to rescue each animal afterwards are needless filler. One animal would have made the point far more clearly and forcefully. Given the quality of the visuals available and the basic concept of the story a much better movie could have been made.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
54,MetalAngel,One of the most important films in contemporary cinema!,9,7 October 2009,"One of the most important aspects of cinema is the way it represents culture and transmits a country's beliefs to the rest of the world. You find yourself watching foreign films and contemplating a variety of subjects which you would never even have thought of, and enveloping yourself in said country's culture, at first with some restraint and shock, at the end with deep empathy and profound understanding. Korea, for example, is a country I know very little about, and with the exception of Chan-Woong Park's masterpiece ""Old Boy"", I had never seen a Korean film which truly moved me and which brought me closer to understanding their different culture. Kim Ki-Duk's ""Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter...and Spring"" changed my way of thinking, and it became one of the most breath-taking and marvelous film experiences I've ever had.It's a surprisingly simple yet profoundly emotional film, that's about nothing and everything at the same time. It all takes place in a floating house that silently drifts atop a gorgeous river deep within a vast, forgotten forest. Nature here is unharmed and unfrequented by man, and everything is peaceful, stunningly beautiful and quietly sublime. In this floating house live an old, wise Buddhist monk (Young-Soo Oh) and his child apprentice (Young-Min Kim), living in utter harmony with nature and perfecting a profound relationship with their God through meditation and humble living. The film follows these two characters through different stages in their lives and through different seasons; we see the boy grow taller and become a man, and we see the monk grow older and nearer to death. The innocence and natural bliss is interrupted when a young girl (Yeo-Jin Ha) arrives to stay in the floating house to cure herself from sickness, and this awakes feelings the boy never even knew he was capable of feeling.The point of the film is precisely that- to expose the emotions and feelings of human beings in their natural state. Few things happen in the film, but every single scene pertains to a human emotion, and is depicted in such a sublime and poignant way that we identify with them all and cheer for the sheer wonderment we're being shown. Everything moves according to Buddhism too, and we're introduced to various Buddhist principles, simple yet memorable life lessons and a deeper sense of spirituality. There is little dialogue in the film (and I mean little), but that's all for the best; words are useless when you have such raw emotion going on screen. There is a fair use of imagery and metaphor too- the animals that inhabit the floating house, the direction the house floats towards, even the changing seasons...not only do they deepen the supernatural meaning of the events, but point towards a higher meaning of the universe and how human nature distorts and tries to remedy what could be utter perfection.The film lasts a little less than two hours, and even though there's few dialogue and seldom any events, the power, elegance and profundity of the images presented keep you transfixed to the screen, experimenting a variety of thoughts and ideas. Ki-Duk Kim combines breath-taking landscapes, metaphors, a trance-inducing score and masterful cinematography to convey interesting points of view in life and to perfectly exemplify the truth behind Buddhism.The film opens itself to a thorough analysis, and a viewer could spend hours writing paragraph after paragraph about the meaning of each scene. But I rather sit back and let the film wash over me, awakening an explosion of thoughts which would take me hours to write down but which instantly make sense in my mind. Little by little, you will begin to make sense out of many things (including Buddhist rituals you have no idea what they mean), and you will begin to feel as if you've drawn something important and transcendental from what you've seen, and that even though you can't put your finger on it, you are aware of its presence in your mind.Works of art just don't get any better than this. And with this kind of film, it's safe to say that Korea has made itself an everlasting place on the map as one of the countries who has produced one of the most important films the world has seen. I highly recommend it! Rating: 4 stars out of 4!!","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"

Set in Korea on a tiny floating monastery in a breathtaking, changing landscape of lake, woods and mountains.

During his teenage years he has a sexual encounter with a teenage girl and he leaves after the monk expresses his displeasure. The apprentice finds it difficult to integrate with the outside world and after he has killed his wife he returns to the monk who puts him through strict penances. Eventually the monk realises his time to die has arrived and he sets out across the lake in a boat built as a funeral pyre. A woman visits the monastery, wanting to leave her baby there, and upon her departure slips under the frozen surface of the lake.

Everything happens in due time. Neither before nor after. The life cycle is shown with detachment and objectivity. The destination which has come into existence on the first day of birthing is unfolding, and it will determine our lives until we begin to be aware of our actions.Actually, the film is similar to a Buddhist story.As the Old Zen Masters said: ""Do not despise the story.

We don't know what to do with life, and life unexplainable. We think that this is wrong and this is right, it's in nature to be happy and doesn't matter if it's a sin or not, but they made to the whole world a big lock that we don't know how to get it off, God created everything and we must feel everything.

58,soymilk,What you see is what you get - a simple but very effective piece of film-making,10,16 November 2004,"'Spring, Summer, Autumn - (or Fall, if you will)- Winterand Spring' is, as the title should imply, a fable very much in the 'cycle of life' cache, so simply crafted and yet so flowing with gentle complexity at the same time. It works wonders both as an episodic coming of age saga concerning one man's life-long quest for inner peace and balance, and a refreshing type of character study where actions and physical mannerisms are thrust more attention than words; the dialogue here is minimal, yet the two key characters still display a surprising amount of depth - every subtle tear and drop of sweat adds up - and I found myself completely drawn in by it. The background settings are as delightfully picturesque as background settings come, and the movie's pacing is both gradual and thoughtful, while still leaving room for some slight drizzles of drama, and a handful of haunting, even harrowing, moments which capture the rougher side of living, but nothing to detract from the overall calming sensation you're left with. The result is a seriously unique slice of life and inspiration, and hats off to Ki-duk Kim for it.Overall, things are left ambiguous enough for us viewers to draw our own merry conclusions, and so rich in all those little minor details which build up the bigger picture that you could spend hours assessing them right down to the very last shade of blue, and dissecting each and everything for all the symbolism and abstract concepts they might embody. It's one of those flicks that has different meanings to different people, I guess. Personally, I'd be happy enough taking it on its direct face value level - things are what they are, they're there because they're there, and what you're seeing is exactly what you get. Cast all possible symbolism aside and it's still a perfectly effective offering about the trials and triumphs of one man's life. And yes, this particular life's complicated enough without all those itty-bitty extra meanings.The Holy Man's ever-changing assortment of animal companions are probably the best example. We go through the various seasons always with a puppy, chicken, cat, snake or tortoise successively at our sides, and viewers are liable fill up an entire message board debating whether it's the positive or negative aspects of our protagonist they're meant to symbolize - the chicken being lust and brashness, and the puppy being youthful ignorance, the cat being idleness, etc.But really, their exact species, in most cases, is pretty incidental - their reason for being there doesn't need to be anything more complicated than simply to emphasize time and the changes it entails. A different animal with every new 'season' further marks the shift in time since our last visit to the temple. Note also that the snake arrives on the scene exactly as the older man departs (you don't really need to be familiar with Buddhist practices to follow this one, although it might be helpful to know that apparently that is actually an established self-cremating ritual which comes of knowing the exact moment of your death in advance, and not a suicide by any means), and you can take it as a hint that it may well be his reincarnated self (it's lovely BTW to finally find a flick where snakes are represented in a positive frame). In light of that, isn't it also kinda tempting to subscribe to the possibility that the remaining four could also be the reincarnated souls of the temple's former residents, whoever they might be? That notion satisfies me a lot more than that of the chicken just standing in for some hot burning passion, or whatever.Then there's the mysterious woman who arrives at the temple with a cloth covering her face. And that's all she really is - a mysterious woman who arrives at the temple with a cloth covering her face. Her exact identity isn't revealed, and nor does it have to be. And we don't really have any means of working it out either, so why worry about that? It is clear though that she's a desperate person in such dire straits that she's forced to conceal her real identity and depart ways with her son, and we can still feel for her on that.In short, this film is what you make of it, and it more or less goes without saying that it only becomes a complicated puzzle if you make it one.My own personal quest for inner peace still continues but, needless to say, this movie provided me with 103 beautiful minutes of escapism and bliss.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"

61,beastwarsfan,"Very good, but not perfect",7,21 April 2006,"""Spring, Summer, Fall, Winterand Spring Again"" (2003) is a deep spiritual drama, directed by the Korean Kim Ki-duk. The movie is divided into 5 chapters, the seasons from the title. The story takes place high in the mountains where a small isolated Buddhist temple is floating in a lake. There an old monk teaches a little boy harsh lessons about life. Years later, the grown boy falls in love with an ill girl, who came to the temple to seek cure. Her body is unharmed, but her spirit is troubled. She finds salvation in the boy's love. Here we have some erotic scenes, I guess they were meant to be pure and innocent looking, but there's nothing really remarkable about them. Later on the boy leaves his old life behind and escapes from the temple to be with the girl. He returns years later, haunted by his horrible deeds, done because of jealousy. Silence and long nearly motionless scenes are OK with me, the pictures tell their story. The open shots are beautiful and inspiring, but in such location it will be spectacular even if you shoot the birds' drops on the roof of the temple  it all just looks so peaceful and harmonic. I guess the western audience will be more fascinated than me, but I've seen more than one Asian movies and a lot of anime titles, so I am used to such motives. The first fragment, ""Spring"", about the boy's youth was the most interesting for me, simple but strong. I am not really into topics like romantic love, sexual desire, lust and jealousy, but I like the way the movie shows how love makes one to be blind and to betray his principles. I look at it as a different approach to the story about the fall of the good man to the Dark Side. The old monk's words were very close to Yoda's ""Attachment leads to jealousy. Shadow of greed that is. Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose."" The story is not necessarily trying to push you some religious Buddhist wisdom, it tells about the circle of life, the mistakes one can make blinded by feelings. It is a masterfully shot and emotionally charged movie, but there are a couple of things I don't like  at the end there were some moments that seemed illogical to me, some symbols that were not clear enough, and they left me confused after the end - the old man was trying to help his apprentice to overcome his anger and sorrow, but put an end to his own life. Out of his pyre a snake came out. What was that all about? And the in final episode, when there comes that woman with a baby  I don't think it is well told, it leaves the audience to wonder what is happening. Maybe it requires a second watch to get a clearer view, or maybe it has something to do with the Buddhist culture or Korean mythology. Or maybe someone is just trying to be enigmatic to look more profound and philosophic. All in all  it is a very good movie if not excellent, but according to me not that great that everyone is trying to present it. I find phrases like ""The most beautiful film I've ever seen"" and ""Left me speechless"" generally exaggerated. But it's definitely very worth watching.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
62,katydid4819,Simple Tale Executed with Style,9,21 December 2004,"This film is beautiful in all ways. Its setting is a lake somewhere in Korea, separated from the rest of the world. The main characters, which remain nameless through out the entire film, are a monk and his protégé, living on a houseboat in the middle of the lake. There is serenity to the film, which is rarely disturbed by dialogue. The majority of the story is told visually.The film tells the story of the protégé's life; the journey he takes from innocent boy to teacher himself. Each season comes with it's own fable. In spring, the boy ties a rock to a fish, frog and a snake. He giggles as he watches them struggle but when the monk ties a rock to the boy's back, he tastes his own medicine. In summer, the boy, now a teenager discovers attraction and lust for a young woman brought to the lake to be healed. He experiences the pain of losing her, which will carry into fall where, now a man, he must be redeemed for a sin brought on by his actions in the summer. With winter and age comes the test to walk in someone else's footsteps and by spring, life starts over again.This film brings the whole range of emotions to the table and subtly places each somewhere in this vast story. Only a little over and hour and a half, it feels like it truly could be a lifetime with its slow pace. However, its slowness is not a burden but serves more to enhance the slow quality of this type of lifestyle. In the Western world, we are a fast moving people. Even the two hours it takes to watch a movie often seem too much for some, who feel that they have too much to accomplish in a day as opposed to what we see in this film. Sometimes the simplist life will have the most to be proud of in the end.Not lacking in the technicals, we are given a vast array of wonderful film-making aspects to chew on. The score, like the lack of dialogue, is never over the top or intrusive. The music, composed by Ji-Woong Park, is the perfect compliment to the cinematography, by Dong-Hyeon Baek. Both are understated, and simple. Still, like the film they grace, they are deeper than the four seasons.Ki-duk Kim's screenplay is beautiful, although at times perhaps too simplistic, and contains a beautiful idea. It's the pacing that really brings the story to life. It is sure to remain one of my top screenplays of the year. It's not a story that sweats the small stuff. It's rare to see tales that accomplish this much without feeling over the top. Spring, Summer, Fall, Winterand Spring is a masterpiece. ****/*****","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
63,SixtusXLIV,"The best Film about human Life, after the Great German Silents",10,16 March 2012,"This is an absolute cinema masterpiece. It is almost silent. The actors could be anyone Buddhist. No words are needed to express any feelings, just image. And very beautiful, at that. Violence when it rarely occurs, is felt, not graphically shown. This film can have many layers of interpretation. Mine is that human beings always return to their mistakes, if discipline and education are not enforced thru the whole life. That is the failure of the Rousseau based Democratic system. The Western civilization will soon collapse. The Budist system has more chances of survival, just because it is close to Nature. The fact that it was made in Korea with German Production support, perhaps financial tell it all. The Sons of Jeovah, should watch this and stop killing their brothers.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
64,j30bell,A gentler addition to Kim's compendium of sexual obsession,7,7 January 2005,"SPOILER: Spring, Summer, Winter, Autumn and Spring is something of a self conscious art-house film. Possibly Kim Ki-duk is trying to work off his reputation for making movies replete with violent sexual imagery, but he's not fooling anyone. Spring contains  admittedly in a much more restrained form  most of the themes from his earlier works, The Isle and Bad Guy. Onto this, however, is pasted a hefty dose of Buddhist teaching. Or, from another perspective, an interesting juxtaposition of old and new.Beginning in the Spring of an undefined year close to the present, the film is set on (and I mean, on) an isolated lake. A child acolyte lives out a life of quiet contemplation, punctuated by occasional acts of petty animal cruelty. His master, a monk, observes his young charge with increasing disapproval and orders him to undo his evil or face the consequences in his own life. It soon becomes apparent that he means this in anything but the figurative sense.Moving through the seasons, Kim explores the ""cycle of life""; with his acolyte experiencing youthful love (or lust), anger, violence and finally acceptance, contrition and peace. The film ends with a new acolyte and a new cycle: implying an endless repetition with subtle variation.Spring is not exactly a subtle film, but it is beautifully done. Kim uses silence like few other filmmakers, matching Kurosawa or Bergman at their best. He punctuates these long slow movements with abrupt changes in tempo  such as the arrival of Yeo. The pace quickens and the mood changes. The courtship of the adolescent boy and girl are some of the gentlest scenes in cinema (though culminating in a suitably Kim-like, energetic coupling).With popular Buddhist and Confucian ideas now so firmly established in cinema (thanks in part to their bastardisation by George Lucas), the ideas in this film aren't exactly going to leave its audience in need of a large glass of perspective and soda (to quote Douglas Adams). Lust leads to possessive urges, which lead to violence; ones violent actions lead on to violence against oneself; peace (and redemption) is found not through approbation, but understanding oneself.I can't quite dispel the notion that The Isle, with its sly humour and darker plot is a better film, or that Spring is, if not completely then at least partially, up the bottom of its own artiness. That said, it is a very, very pretty film. Its story is intelligent, if not awe-inspiring, and it is a delightful change of pace from most modern cinema. Most of all, it is probably one of Kim's most accessible films, and I shall certainly be watching it again  if only to see Oh Yeong-su practising his calligraphic art with the tail of a live cat. 7/10.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"

66,cwx,"Mostly clear, always compelling to watch",7,8 May 2006,"A very beautiful film (especially in the first ""spring"" segment), clearly loaded with entrancing but elusive Buddhist imagery. As in his subsequent film, 3-Iron, Kim Ki-duk makes very effective use of silence (not always, but for the larger portion of the film), without leading to snores. Compared to the many films I view as ""good, but I didn't get it,"" I generally preferred the segments that I did get here. Even though it is about a very particular set of religious and cultural practices (and who knows if it's portrayed accurately), I found most of the film to be accessible, which was why it was a bit tiresome when the climax, such as it was, was a largely unexplained hike up a hill. Actually, I suppose it wasn't that hard to figure out, but it just seemed to lack an impetus, which you couldn't say for the rest of the film. Overall, however, a strong effort, a movie that has a point but is also very serene, in a good way.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"

That night the young boy also left the valley. Summer: After few years the young boy returns to the valley while old monk read the news paper ""Man 30 Killed his wife and escaped"". He said his wife left with another man. Another day the police officers came into the valley for arrest him. But the old monk punishes him as to crave the letter with that knife which he wrote. Then the old monk fires himself and died. Winter: the young boy grows as a man(Kim Du Kik) and he returns to the valley. After some time a lady came into that place with her baby. That night she fell in the hole in that ice lake while she decided to left the place. Spring: The baby grows in that place. The man became like old monk.

68,jhuni_x,A bad and over-rated movie by a horrible director.,1,27 April 2009,"This movie, ""Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter ... and Spring"" was created by Kim Ki-Duk, a reprehensible and indefensible south Korean director who is well-known for portraying disgusting acts of cruelty that have shocked many audiences causing them to faint, vomit, or leave. In Kim's movie The Isle, unspeakable acts of cruelty were created, in my opinion at this point he should have been persecuted by the law and he should have lost the right to create films. As such, I think this movie should never have been created.As for my rating I give it a 3/10. In my opinion the average film is 5/10 and there must be something good about a film to give it anything higher then a 5/10 and there must be something bad about it to give it less then 5/10. So first, I will address the praise that this movie has got. Well first of all this movie is certainly not entertaining, if anything it is depressing. The praise then, that this movie gets is generally that it effectively teaches Buddhist principles. If you really want to learn about Buddhism go to the library and read some of the things in which Buddha actually said, instead of listening to this sick and cruel director's interpretation of it. In my opinion there are much better movies out there that teach about Buddhism such as Samsara and Phorpa.Another thing is some reviewers have said that this film effectively teaches people to have respect for animals. Well first of all, this movie hardly sets a good example for animal liberators as they used animal cruelty to produce this film. Furthermore, this movie hardly focuses on animal cruelty. It is slow-paced and they throw in unnecessary scenes, including the scene where the old master kills himself.What good was that scene about him killing himself? Perhaps they are advocating animal rights - except for animals that are old? I fully understand the point of the scene - the old master wants to die on his own terms. Even then, the scene is completely unnecessary it is not entertaining at all and it does not tell any educational or moral lesson. If the movie wasn't slow paced and if it didn't have unnecessary scenes such as those, then perhaps it could serve as a decent educational tool.In this movie, the children do all sorts of cruel acts to the animals. I think this is profoundly unrealistic and fallacious. I do not think children have a natural tendency for cruelty, actually I think it is rather the opposite, children are generally very kind and innocent. Yes children like to experiment with things, humans are creative and intelligent animals after all. However, when it turns out that as a result of their experiment an animal dies or is hurt that child has a natural empathy and he/she will probably refrain from doing that action again. I do not believe in real life children will naturally do cruel things and laugh at them in the process, as is depicted in this movie. If anything, cruelty develops with adulthood, but even then that cruelty is unnatural. Yes animals such as humans have a natural tendency to compete for mates and food, that is not the same as the pointless cruelty which is in this movie, as such this movie is profoundly unrealistic.Furthermore, what good did the masters do in this movie if they couldn't even effectively teach their children apprentices to have a respect for life and not be cruel. In my opinion, if the masters teach their apprentices well enough, from a early on, then all the cruelty/murder that happened in this movie would never have had to have happened. I reject that it actually had to happen.Anyways, I will not only shoot down the praise that this movie got, I would like to also make the case that this movie is actually bad. First of all, one of the things this movie advocates is a sort of isolationism, that you should isolate yourself from the world, especially women and that is the path to some sort of ""higher/religious/spirtual truth."" Isolating yourself from the world is an inherently destructive practice, people need to cooperate with one another if they are to progress at all. In addition, the adult monk should not have to carry the burden his entire life as he did for something he did as a child, he should have instead spent his time doing something actually useful.Furthermore, a significant concern of mine is that in this film they created animal cruelty for a visual effect. This movie was made in 2003, they had so much technology at the time that they could have easily used CGI or some other cruelty-free technology. I would have been fine with watching the movie even if it was a cartoony looking, it still could have portrayed just as effectively, however, it doesn't even have to be cartoony, the CGI technology they had at 2003 was so advanced it would have looked realistic, you would have barely noticed the difference. That is my case for why this movie is actually bad.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
69,rsa5387,Simply Wonderful,9,6 March 2009,"A simple, yet poignant film about the relationship between a Monk and his protégé. It is a quiet film that is reserved in its pace and narrative, yet fiery in its understated emotional intensity and gorgeous, lingering cinematography.

For the patient viewer, however, this film may prove to be a heart-wrenching introspective experience on the simplicities of existence, and the feelings that complicate it. On top of its beautiful cinematography and score, the acting and skimp narrative are good compliments, lending the film much emotional depth.

You are much akin to a fly on the wall just lucky enough to be along for the ride, and what a ride....The film mainly features two characters; a boy, and his master. They live on a floating temple in an isolated lake, training in the ways of a monk. It follows their course through the seasons, learning life's lessons throughout. There is very little dialogue in the film, but magically, it is hardly needed. Every single shot of this film is strikingly beautiful and tells the story all by itself. I must express that the cinematography here is some of the best I have seen, it was absolutely exquisite! The changing seasons made this even more so, the film actually becomes more beautiful to look at as it develops.I can assure you that you have most likely never seen a film like this before.

71,info-2513,This is not only a Buddhist idea but one of the facts of life.,10,16 June 2004,"In ""Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter ... and Spring,"" Kim Ki-duk, a South Korean director whose past films were often fueled by violence, does a complete about-face. This film is a pastoral poem about the changing seasons and a meditation on the cycle of life. In a tranquil and timeless setting of a temple floating atop a man-made lake in a forest, surrounded by mountain spires that cut the monastery off from worldly concerns, an old monk teaches his young disciple the wisdom of Buddha over the many seasons of their lives.But don't let the movie's mysticism fool you: This South Korean/German production has created festival buzz here. Sony Pictures Classics snapped up the picture in the second week. As it is chosen to be South Korea's entry into the foreign-language film Oscar competition, ""Spring"" should become an art house hit in North America. Set against the background of this floating monastery, the picture's only set, the film follows the lives of a child monk and his master through four different seasons of their lives. Kim infuses these episodes with Buddhist principles, which teach kindness toward all forms of life and the goal of inner peace. Yet the world does intrude into the serene hermitage, bringing with it life's pleasures and sufferings. Under the watchful gaze of an old monk (Oh Young-su), a little boy (Seo Jae-kyung) learns what sorrows his own cruelty can cause. As a teen, the boy (Kim Young-min) experiences the power of love and of lust when a young woman (Ha Yeo-jin) enters his life. Turning his back on the hermitage, he joins the world of man only to return years later, in anger and terror, when his desperate need for possession has turned to murder. Before police can arrest him, his master sees that penitence has cleared his heart and soul of all hatred. In winter, the old monk makes his funeral pyre. Then his disciple, now a mature man (played by the director himself), returns to the sanctuary of his youth. He seeks peace and quiet so he might fulfill his destiny. When a woman brings a male baby to the temple, the monk undertakes a journey of atonement to place a holy statue on a frozen mountaintop. Now he is ready to raise and instruct a new monk. Much of the movie is steeped in Buddhist mysticism. Each of the five episodes features a different animal -- a dog, a rooster, a cat, a snake and finally a turtle. For each season, Kim Ki-duk observes the change of weather and the relationship of man with nature. The film emphasizes the power of meditation and, in the episode concerning the murderer who seeks enlightenment, the need to perform a sutra to cleanse the heart of all jealousy and anger. Kim Ki-duk keeps dialogue to a minimum and actions simple in what is virtually a two-character piece. Humor arrives organically, often resulting in hearty laughs. Backed by a terrific South Korean/German production crew, Kim Ki-duk is in total control of his material, its rhythms and its tone.Spring - Child Monk takes life of animals out of innocenceA child monk ties a stone to a back of fish. Same plight awaits a frog and a snake. The child monk roams the brook in search of the fish and the frog as his punishment allotted by the old monk. Summer - Boy Monk in love learns obsession The monk is now 17 years old. To the lonely hermitage, a girl comes to convalesce. Before long, warm feelings towards the girl sprouts in the boy's heart. Their ripple in the water turns into an act of love.Fall - Young Monk in agony of malice The boy returns to the hermitage in the mountains as a young man in his thirties after committing a murder. The old monk whips him finding the young man attempting suicide in front of the statue of Buddha. Old monk order him to etch the Pranja-parpamitasutra, meanwhile he finds peace in his heart.Winter - Mature Monk in days of enlightenment The monk, now in his full maturity retraces his steps to the abandoned hermitage in the mountains. A woman wearing a veil visits the hermitage with a baby. She leaves her baby behind and runs away. And then spring - Another child monk : cycle of four seasons The old monk living with another child monk is having a peaceful time in the hermitage...the circle of life keeps on. Kim Gi-deok(b) has been known for making films that are involving but often difficult to watch. In his eight previous works, which include ''Som (The Isle),' ''Nappun Namja (Bad Guy)' and most recently ''Haeanson (The Coast Guard),' Kim has taken on such controversial and agonizing topics as the life of a prostitute, the love-hate relationship of a woman and a pimp who kidnaps her, and a soldier slowly going insane. For his new film ''Bom Yorum Kaul Kyoul Kurigo Bom (Spring Summer Fall Winter... and Spring),' Kim says he tried to change the pace and outlook of his films and show a different side of himself. ''I feel like I've been living my life in a rush, so I wanted to slow down a little and make a movie like this,' Kim said after a press screening.The film traces the life of a Buddhist monk as he goes from being a young orphan to an adult monk. Kim uses the passing of the seasons to parallel the monk's development and his experiences of desire, jealousy and rage.With a small cast, all of ''Spring' takes place in and around a temple on Chusanji Lake located in Mt. Chuwang National Park, North Kyongsang Province. A 30-ton set built specifically for the film, the temple floats like a wayward raft on the lake, accessible only by a small boat.With the construction of the temple and the logistics of filming on water, Kim says there were a lot of people behind the film that made it possible. ''They made something that it seemed could not be done work,' he says.The floating temple was used to show ''the speed in which life can change, the way that one can wake up and find that East has become West and West has become East, that irony of life,' Kim said. ''Spring' also shows Kim making his debut as an actor. Kim portrays the older monk in the film's winter scenes, a role he originally conceived for the veteran actor Ahn Sung-ki or renowned scholar and philosopher Kim Yong-OK. Both were unavailable due to schedule conflicts.After deciding to take on the part himself, Kim made the already physically demanding role, which included meditating in freezing temperatures, even more so. In one scene Kim climbs up a steep mountain with a large stone tied to his waist while carrying a stone statue of a Buddha with both arms, something he admits he wouldn't have asked another actor to do.A devout Catholic _ Kim at one point in his life seriously considered priesthood _ the director says the film in part was driven by his relationship between his own religious values and the culture around him.''All Koreans have lived surrounded by Buddhism and Buddhist culture is the foundation, which we acknowledge and accept,' he says.And though the changing of the seasons in the film is to show the life of one monk, Kim says it reflects the cycle of life in general.''If we were able to remember life's lesson from spring we wouldn't repeat them,' Kim says, ''but like winter which rots away the leaves and freezes over everything, like the seasons' patterns, our patterns in life will make us forget and repeat our past mistakes. ''This is not only a Buddhist idea but one of the facts of life.'","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
72,Topher-26,Maybe amazing for those who've never seen an Asian film...,7,22 September 2006,"*spoilers herein*The problem is that this film could have been much better but I think the director just kept shooting himself in the foot. First of all, the title gives away the whole point of the film. As you're watching the ""Spring"" segment, you already know this is going to be another one of those life cycle stories... Why not choose another title then ? At the end of the ""Summer"" segment, the Master says that lustful acts can lead to murder *nudge nudge*, next thing you know, he finds an article about his disciple in the newspaper wrapping his fish... Why are these scenes necessary ? The disciple stabbing the floor with his knife full of blood was clear enough, and would have had a much more surprising effect on the viewer than having the whole murder thing spelled out for us beforehand. Finally, the disciple becomes the master and there is a new disciple, as if this had to be an unavoidable cycle... which it doesn't. So, the director says he wrote the whole story in 2 hours and made a point not to alter any of it, and I believe him as this story is cute but superficial as a Paulo Coelho novel. It certainly doesn't have the depth of most works by Mizoguchi, Kurosawa, Kobayashi, Ozu or even Koizumi and Kitano. Still, it's watchable, thanks to the acting, cinematography and nice settings, and can be a nice introduction for some shallow Westerners to Asian cinema.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
73,alasdair7,Very instructive,10,31 October 2008,"It's difficult not to get the feeling that there are deep moral lessons to be learned from this film.It involves a young child who is brought up under the guidance of a very learned man in an (apart from extreme cold in Winter) idyllic setting.The tranquility of the setting, which is so brilliantly filmed it could be watched for that alone, is an overwhelming characteristic.We are not moved away from the scenery and are left to imagine what caused the wreckage of the young man's life when he returns.It becomes clear that life away from the gentle discipline of his instructor only brings ruin however attractive and whatever form the lure away may be.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"

A child have to get know what is good and what is evil and this knowing or experience is carrying during all life. Lihtly and beautifully shown going through ones life - innocent childhood till wise old age. Again older man gives advices to younger one but going own way causes disaster. And after many years away the student return to his master mansion/sanctuary but masters life has been already over.(also old man knows when is his final time and chooses ritual death which shows his vast will and self-control)So he continues his own life in the name of wisdom and faith but still remembering his sins from earlier times expiates and continues never ending wheel of life by accepting another student - refused child.

75,joehemmings68,"Beautiful and intriguing, but inconsistent",8,5 September 2015,"The first thing to say about this film is that visually it's gorgeous. It's set entirely around a lake with a temple that floats on it. It's an incredible location that remains as we make large leaps through time. The film makers have made the absolute most of their location with excellent cinematography. I also really loved the music which varies from ambient to amazing singing.I loved the start of this film, the spring section, it was a very early peak for me. Here we see the student of the temple as a young boy. In terms of child acting this is about as good as you'll ever see. He's allowed to behave in a perfectly natural way, rather than acting, and that gets the absolute best from the section. His childish ways of interacting with the world feel very real, and are both funny and poignant as he learns valuable lessons. The film continues with this more amusing tone as the student moves into maturity. Some of the comedy works really well here, and some of it falls a bit flat. I felt this is where the characterisation of the student fell a bit. The film has a tendency to draw things out in such a way that they can be very effective, but they can also be slightly awkward. The film becomes far darker and more serious, but also wants to retain a darkly comedic element, for me it doesn't quite work tonally. Throughout the film are two constants. The symbolism, and the Master. So much symbolism in this film which certainly adds a level of intrigue as you form opinions as to what the recurring imagery could mean. The director has done a great job of putting these things front a centre without having them be a distraction. The Master is a brilliant character, wonderfully acted. Subtle and mysterious, very little of him is revealed which gives him a wonderful air of mystery. All in all, this is well worth a watch. Beautiful to look at and will leave you pondering once it's finished.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
76,jstu9,Slow but mesmerizing,8,5 September 2004,"The movie is very slow and very deliberate. It tells the tale of primarily two people (master and pupil) in a little hut on a small lake. And it is broken down into 5 chapters, each jumping about 10-15 years between chapters.It is just a simple story, master slowly teaching his pupil. Teaching one principle at a time as the master and student grow older.It took me a few minutes to get into the mood and pace of the movie, and actually start liking what I was seeing. But I think after seeing the simple story of the first ""Spring"" segment, it caught my attention and made me interested in what was to come.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"

A wonderful lesson for the West that lives by the old adage VANITAS VANITATUM ... I cannot put in words all gratitude to the makers of this film.They have an excellent taste in choosing the location (the lake and surrounding hills ,in their serene beauty,make a viewer speechless).The acting,laconic in expression, and yet powerful,is awesome.The film makes one ponder on life and its meaning,on the worldly fuss we are all immersed in,on our true calling in this life and our fulfillment. I would love to give the director,the cameraman,the actors and the rest of the film crew a deep bow of my humble appreciation.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
78,theordinaryreview,One of the most beautiful movies I have seen...of rare splendor.,9,10 July 2013,"I think I met Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring by accident while browsing IMDb. It was possibly a movie similar to something I saw, but it might just be random. Or maybe I was seeing through the top#250 and realized I never saw this one.An old monk lives in isolation in a house in the middle of a lake. With him lives a young boy who is training to be a monk. One day, the young boy attaches a rock with a string around a fish and laughs at the fish that is painfully trying to swim away. Oblivious to the fact the old monk is watching him, he applies the same treatment to a frog and then a snake. The old monk attaches a string and a rock while the boy sleeps. When the boy wakes up, he complains that he cannot walk because he is attached to a rock. The young monk then realizes it was wrong to do so to the animals and the old monk tells him to go free the animals. If any of them died, then the young monk will have a heart of stone for all his life.Years passes and the boy grows into a young adult when a young woman comes visit them to cure her bad health, the monk quickly falls for her. The woman first ignores him but they soon fall in love and sex comes naturally after. The old monk who ends up seeing them does not blame the young monk, but as the woman's health is much better, tells them that it was the right cure. Once the woman is healed, she prepares to leave-- a painful departure for the young monk, who one morning, abandons the lake and flees... But he is bound to return some day.First of all, I have to say that this was one of the most beautiful movies I have seen. Not only the scenery, but the house in the middle of a lake and in the middle of a valley is absolutely stunning, and the passing of the seasons--which are not only metaphorical of the life of a person and the emotional states of their mind--are also filmed in their respective corresponding season. This all adds up to create scenes of rare splendor.There is a real clever economy of dialogue. There aren't many to begin with, but the ones present are carefully picked and always speak volumes. The relationship between the old and the young monk (who is played by a different actor in each and every season) is complex but a pleasure to watch. I admittedly haven't deciphered all the symbolism, for example, I don't know if there is an explanation as to why each season finds them having a different pet with them, but I am certain there are explanations.I was most stunned with the winter scenery when the water turns to ice. The movie has a lot to say about the cycle of life, the cycles through life and the repetitive wheel of fate. It seems to have quite a fatalistic take on life as the mistakes of our childhood can carry through a whole life, or maybe this is simply a symbol.In a way, I wish that the two young people didn't have sex, it seemed too simple to have them go for it simply because they are the only two in a deserted place. I wanted the young monk to show remorse or guilt in regard of his faith but very little of it was used. This is only a detail and I think that quite realistically what happened in the movie is what would happen in most cases.The movie is a tour de force. The filming must have been a patient task over different seasons but also for the actors, especially the one playing the adult monk (who is in fact the director) and how he had to walk on a lake of ice, fall, etc. There are such beautiful scenes around the pond, whether it's the ice sculpture or the young boy who is smaller than the head of the Buddha. And the wooden doors with paintings that open for every season on a new scenery. The doors could be another theme as the doors in their house were quite interesting.I liked: The scenery. The economy of dialogues. The evolution of a person. Asceticism and faith. It's a film that can't leave you indifferent.I disliked: Is it pessimistic? Fatalistic? It is hard to decide. I found the segments of Spring and Winter superior to the rest.93/100 I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys Movies with a capital m, the ones that hold a message, a meaning.Read more reviews at: www.theordinaryreview.blogspot.com","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
79,marioonline,A true gem.,10,16 June 2004,"Let's face it: this movie is not for everyone, because it may challenge the patience of those viewers that are addicted to uncountable plot twists or to jaw-dropping exploding action scenes.Nothing like that can come from this movie, settled in the surroundings of a Buddhist temple in the very middle of a lake in a Korean valley.I didn't count them, but there are probably less than 200 lines in the dialogues. But this is what it's all about. Not (spoken) words, but the tough though serene Buddhist way of life.The existence of three men, two monks (one old, one young) and an apprentice, is narrated by focusing on the most important events in their lives, which happen in different seasons, as you may have guessed by the title.Even if it is rather rarefied, don't think that this movie is not intense. Some moments get the audience very, very emotional.Oh, by the way...if I think of it, there are actually some plot twists, blood, and gunshots. But this is not the point. The point is the mystery of life. Nobody can tell you about it, you only can try to grab it by yourself. This movie is a beautiful enchanting chance.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
80,kemicon,Beautiful and Serene,8,10 December 2007,"Incredibly lush and deliberately paced, this film is probably the most zen like experience you can have without devoting your life to the search for enlightenment. The film itself has very little dialog and could probably be watched without reading the subtitles (assuming you are not fluent in Korean). Positively overflowing with mysticism and symbolism those familiar with the finer points of Buddhism will have a lot to talk about by the time the film closes. Visually stunning and cleverly scripted the film has a lot to offer, yet the slow pacing may turn some people off. After having seen this film I am looking forward to the next project from this clearly talented director.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
81,gsprods,Brilliant Korean film,10,21 January 2005,"This was one of the best films of 2004. I was looking forward to seeing it after being so impressed with a previous film from the director, The Isle. Like that one, this film features breath-taking photography and is shot on a secluded island. As in The Isle, there are several scenes of animal brutality (the killing of live animals never would have made it past the U.S. censors) but it is done in a powerful, non-exploitative manner. This story of the life of a monk is told through the metaphorical changes in the seasons and it's lyrical elements showcase a circular existentialistic philosophy that can be interesting even to non-Buddhists. A strong, thought-provoking film.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
82,rupertbreheny,SYMBOLISM AND MEANING,10,28 April 2004,"At the risk of boring you all senseless here are some observations off the top of my head. THE HUT Representing the self. All the possessions and shelter needed is on the floating hut. When the young man can no longer live at peace and comfort in the hut then bad things transpire. He never commits lustful acts in the hut. When we seek happiness outside ourselves, we are never truly content.
THE DOORS The doors by the lakeside and in the hut are symbolic rather than prescriptive. The fact there are no walls means their use is not forced but elected. They represent morality and discipline. Morality is not defined by a higher power but by society and the self. By adopting the constraints the doors engender, self-discipline is attained. As soon as the young man transgresses these self-imposed boundaries, to sneak across to the young woman, then disaster follows. THE DEAD ANIMALS The Master allows the young boy to let the animals die. He does not become an all powerful father figure, cleaning up after him, but allows him to make mistakes and suffer the consequences. Buddhism does not have a higher power but rather promotes self-awareness. THE MILLSTONE AND BUDDHA Represent the twin stones of regret for killing the fish and the snake. What you do unto others, you do unto yourself. He has carried that karma around with him all his life until he transcends them both, carrying them to the top of the hill, near heaven. Here he cuts himself free and attains redemption through struggle. THE MASTER Is a great teacher, but does not lecture. Hardly a word is spoken, but lessons are learned. A good teacher points the way for a student to discover self-evident knowledge for themselves. THE MOTHER The veil, representing guilt and shame are ultimately the cause of her downfall. Hiding from the outside world can bring about ruin.
THE YOUNG BOY Both at the beginning and the end, represents us. A good life is attained not by the absence of bad thoughts, but rather by their mastery, so they have no hold over us. We choose our behaviour rather than it choose us. The new boy is not born without sin, but rather must walk his own path to divinity. The same actor playing the young boy show the eternal cycle of the human soul. THE SEASONS The endless cycle of birth, growth and death.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
83,eshaines,beautiful but....,5,10 April 2014,"i can't in clear conscience give this film the 10 stars its beauty warrants. recently i came across a number of interviews and articles online about Ki-Duk's films, and he tends to include animal cruelty as a visual tool. how can any kindhearted person rationalize something like this? apparently, the scene that included animal cruelty in this film was eventually cut from the final version, so none of us would even know unless we dug around a little online. what i find shocking is that Ki-duk justifies the violent cruelty, such as skinning a frog alive in one of his other films, by saying that the cast and crew eat the animals when they are finally dead. it is unfortunate that one so capable of conveying beauty, Kim Ki-Duk, can be so lacking in moral compass regarding treatment of beings without a discernible voice. It would not even occur to a woman auteur to resort to such methods of pain-induction and death, now would it?","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
84,joughin,Pretty shallow,6,24 February 2008,"6 out of 10: a 'middle way' between 10 for style and 2 for content. And maybe I should make that 5, because the triumph of style over content, surface over depth, is in a way a complete antithesis of what the film seems to think it's about.The director could make great pop videos (for very slow music) or fantastic TV ads (for the Korean Tourist Board). But Buddhism as pop video, or beautiful adverts for the Buddha's path to release from beautiful illusions, well...I found this basic contradiction so irritating that I couldn't watch the whole movie, but since the bit I did see was so crudely schematic, I doubt that I missed any profound message in what was doubtless a final closing of the circle.Nietzsche praised Greek culture as deeply superficial, and contrasted this with German culture as superficially deep. This film is to me as pretty and shallow as the lake on which it's set.'Film': a thin surface. Don't be taken in. You can drown in an elegant Korean dish.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
85,FairyManh_2007,Different Feelings in Different Time Period,10,30 June 2020,"The first time I know this movie when I was in sixth or seventh grade. If my memory serves me right, my mom introduced me this movie as a Buddha lecture because she wants me to understand the circle of karma in life. However, my mind was so simple at that time to understand all meanings as well as messages that the director wants to send to audiences. Then, when I was grown up and studied at university, I had a chance to watch this movie 3th or 4th times with the purpose of learning how to make tell a story and understand the usage of images to tell a story by Kim-ki- duk. Finally, when I'm currently 30 and watch this movie again. Honestly, this movie really touches me and brings me to other special feelings that make me think deeply about life, karma, and behaviors. This movie is deserved to be one of the best classical movies all the time just because its simple story is subtle and deep. Thank you Director Kim-ki-Duk","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
86,SiamakZ,"The circle of nature and human life, simple but deep.",10,13 September 2015,"A movie astonishing in its beautiful portrayal of the nature through all the four seasons. Thought-provoking in its message of the journey of the hero: from joy and pleasure to lust, desire and anger. And finally coming full circle with redemption and contemplation.The movie is indeed universal, as it shows the circle of life and the circle of the seasons. But there are many spiritual meanings to be found if you dig deeper and recognize the Buddhist signs. It's a timeless masterpiece and a must-see film for everyone above the age of 16. It's not held back by a complex plot or difficult dialogues. It's simple, yet full of wisdom.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
87,objesguy,Kim's Tale of Growth Soars,10,5 November 2005,"Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter and Spring is one of those unique films. A film that is beautiful watch and incredibly tough to digest. Without a doubt, this movie requires deep thought, but with careful examination, this movie is definitely one that strikes into the deepest of hearts and souls. The film's chronicle of a young monks journey from an innocent youth, to a troubled adolescence to a reborn adulthood is extremely deep, with all kinds of messages that emphasize the importance of spirituality and the dangers of lust and sexual obsession.The film technically speaking is beautiful to behold. Korean movies generally come out of the same mold. In other words, they are very colorful and the picture of their films are sharp and vibrant. This is especially true in the widely popular Memories of Murder (Or Salnui Cheouk) and Kim's follow-up film, 3-Iron (Or Bin-Jip). The environment of the forest is especially engaging to the eye and it adds to the isolated atmosphere of the film as well as the isolated personalities of the characters. Techinically speaking, Kim does a fabulous job with this film and the beautiful cinematography is one of the many reasons why Kim is slowly becoming one of the more recognized Asian filmmakers of his generation.However, cinematography can't do it alone. The theme of the film as well as the development of characters is extremely important in a film. Kim goes with a different approach in this film that most filmmakers aren't bold enough to do: he relies on silence and actions rather than dialog (much like his follow-up film, 3-Iron, in which his main male protagonist doesn't say one word). It sounds eccentric, but the characters do show their personalities well and the theme of the film is also carried out in a way that words could never do. While this further shows Kim's greatness, a great deal of credit goes to the actors as well. Their excellent performances with such a limited script is commendable and a premiere example of a new kind of art form that is developing in film during this century.Without a doubt, film purists and art-house film lovers will adore this film, but overall, anyone who has an open mind should feel at home with this film. Granted, like his other film, 3-Iron, this movie is not the kind of film that you can sit back with your friends and laugh away with a tub of popcorn. Instead it is a serious film that displays that film is art and a brand of literature, and like those two genres this movie should be studied and analyzed in order to get the most out of this film. Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter and Spring is a pensive film, but for those who put the time in analyzing this film will be rewarded with a message and work of art that is like no other. Kim's latest film, 3-Iron was a study of love and relationships. Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter and Spring is a study of the growth, fall and rebirth of life.Final Analysis: Excellent! Highly Recommended!","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
88,shannon-weiss,"Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter...and Spring: A Cinematic Painting",8,5 October 2008,"Spring, Summer, Fall, Winterand Spring is a story whose beauty is reflected in the visual elements of the film. Ki-duk Kim utilizes stylistic techniques characteristic of Korean cinema as both writer and director. The film features a small Buddhist monastery that rests in a lake beneath the snowy mountains of the region. The serene setting is gently interrupted by the arrival of a curious young boy who trains to become an old monk's successor. The narrative is divided into portions of the boy's life, delineated by the passing of each season. The story is revealed at a slow, winding pace as an archetypal life story unfolds on the screen. With little dialog to follow, one begins to interpret the visual symbolism within the film in order to extract deep meaning from the quintessentially Korean narrative. The use of long, unchanging takes allows the viewer to become absorbed in the tranquil environment that engulfs the unusual one-room monastery. As a result one finds the dramatic climaxes within the film that much more jarring; viewing the film becomes, therefore, a reflection on the events that shape, challenge, and reaffirm not only the main character's life but also one's own.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
89,deadbunny28,Over-hyped...but see this if you like stunning cinematography,5,30 September 2011,"This is a smack dead average movie...but you should see it. It has a lot right, but it also has a lot wrong. Now I would usually reserve my right to write reviews on IMDb, but I just couldn't stand the critics lying here. That's correct they are out right lying to the public on this one. Maybe it is, because it is a truly artistic film and they want to feel more intellectual by relishing it, or it is because it was just that time to over-hype a foreign film again to make them seem oh so worldly.Listen, I am one of the biggest advocators of art, especially great art, but great art does not always equivocate to a great film. Film isn't like a painting or a picture where art is simply what it is. Movies are like one part Art, one part Entertainment, one part Technical, and one part Love. This is a stunningly beautiful movie, and some of the best cinematography of it's year, but the script is simple and stagnant.The Critics would have you believe this movie is far more profound than it is. Things were said such as, ""Sometimes the most complex things are best when they are the simplest."" Although that is true in some cases, it does not apply here. Even when the seasons change you feel like you are just stuck in a town with whimsical weather. The acting is sub-par and you are constantly hit over the head with cookie-cutter mantras. I recommend seeing this mediocre movie however, not because of some intense artistic deeper meaning, but because it is still beautiful, visually stunning art.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
90,sonjapasa,An Unusual Gentle Lovely Story,10,9 July 2006,"I saw this movie when it came to our town some years ago, then when our local Borders Bookstore had a Buy 3 and get the 4th free, I bought 4 different Asian films - when selecting them and being a huge fan of Asian cinema, this was the one movie I wanted to add to my collection. I remember a friend (from Viet Nam) telling me she had just seen the most incredible movie with her American husband, who absolutely loved it though he never seen an Asian movie, she described it to me as ""calming"". When I saw it I felt I wanted to just drop out my modern day life and find a lake just like the one in the movie. I tried to convince my friends to see it but as often happens, the movie only played for 1 week and most of them missed it. When I bought it (not cheap $25.00) I sat with my boyfriend and watched it, we never spoke a word during the movie, it was a sign of how the simplicity of the story yet strong messages made us think as we went along with the story, it brought us closer together as human beings, closer to our inner source, closer to realizing the symbiotic relation of nature and our souls, in short it was a complete respite from the insane busy lives we personally lead. We talked for days about it, not the message so much but how we felt having seen it and since have decided it was a movie one can see again and again as the message we'll get from it, will and can be different each time. How lovely that the director was able to convey this to us half way around the other side of his world. Gentle and lovely is the best way to describe how it made me feel. Though I love many Asian films such as Hero, House of Daggers, Crouching Tiger, etc. which all have messages as well, this film was the absolute best for me.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"

92,kelshawd,"Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter...and Spring",7,17 September 2006,"This is a great movie in almost all ways, but it assumes you know something about Buddhist philosophy. Like The Passion of the Christ, having some objective background in the scriptures of the faith helps you to get more out of the movie. One interesting element in the casting is that after the old master dies, he comes back as the same little boy that the younger monk was in his youth. So there is an implied step beyond reincarnation here; perhaps both men are the same person living a concurrent existence. The story is based on a typical style of Buddhist parable; it illustrates a set of principles that are basic to Buddhist thought by following the monastic lives of two monks in a father-son type of relationship. The characters are bland and unassertive. The scenes of nature reflect the cosmology of Buddhism that life events flow in cycles of cause and effect that follow the patterns of natural law.

Both films grabbed the audience (me/us) with subtle oriental painterly imagery, restrained natural sound and both featured rites de passage on a lake. Dialogue special effects and flashy shots are not part of this genre. Hoorah! The previous commentators have said it all. All life is encompassed here. The summer sector includes sex and I must say the couple fornicating passionately on the rocks was the most watchable sex scene I can remember.

95,not_the_real_george,"60% deep, Hollywood ending !?",7,16 February 2012,"This movie tries to be a Zen story and leave you changed after viewing it, but for whatever reason it couldn't go all the way.First of all, I loved the season structure(meaning a life cycle) and the photography. The decision to have very little dialog is also inspired for this certain kind of picture. The Zen master is just perfect for the role, every time I saw him I had the feeling a real master is shown on screen. Everything he says or does is as it should be. Some may not understand his actions, based on ""accepting whatever comes"", but they were pretty authentic. As long as he was around, everything was good.But the winter season just made no sense to me. First of all, what is the purpose of all that Wushu practice ? It was just thrown in there, for the sake of the show. Those high kicks in the middle of the winter(learned from a book ?) without much clothes are, I believe, made just for their visual. If he was practicing as a child, or taught directly by the master, there was at least a connection. Then he went on climbing the mountain with a big stone tied to his back. This was pointless, it made sense when he was 10 since it was a punishment from his master... I know some of you are going to say he was actually dropping his past and so on, but I believe this is commercial rubbish. From what I've read : As you progress in Zen you do less, not more(so it would have made sense if he practiced more meditation). Even the soundtrack is more intense and tries to stand out in the ending scene, whereas in the rest of the film it is just subtly hiding in the background ! I do recommend you to watch it, the movie is good, but the last 20 minutes or so are just lower quality.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"

97,Sauvik,That what makes a Human - I am Touched.,10,28 June 2007,"This movie has touched me in more ways than one. The beauty of the movie is its simplicity. Although an insight of Buddhism will enrich the experience, but it is not necessary. What is portrayed in the movie is universal.The movie is essentially about a disciple of a monk and how he learns that life comes full circle just like the four seasons. Through the film we are taken on a subtle, beautiful journey - how the disciple grows, the success, faults and failures, and how he rises again to replace his master. The director did a splendid job. With minimalist dialogue, the movie moves forward on actions, expressions and visuals.The director did a wonderful job in handpicking the actors. Even he plays a part in the movie. Everyone did a great job as (I believe) it is really hard to carry a movie on pure actions, emotions and expressions. And needless to say - they did it flawlessly.The movie relies heavily on symbolism and one has to pay attention to minute details and think over and over to really appreciate the movie and the values it portrays.I am sure that after watching this movie, you will be a different human being.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
98,mdkersey,Beautiful thoughtful film,10,25 January 2009,"This is a beautiful film that captures the eye and mind. I wish only to add some possible additional interpretations of symbolism: When the young man left he took the Buddha statue, a further illustration that his love/lust had awakened a desire to possess. The old monk is untroubled and continues his meditation as before in front of the ""missing"" Buddha, because he knows that the stone statue is not necessary for his prayers to be effective.As the young man is taken away by the police the boat suddenly halts, bound to the temple by some mystical force. The old monk is surprised: it appears that his own attachment to the young man (or possibly vice-versa) is holding the boat back. In any case the monk must forcibly will the boat to go.To some degree I view the monk's re-enactment of his pupil's ""Shut"" ritual as penance for developing a strong attachment to his pupil. (I do not fully understand the funeral ritual, but other explanations have been offered).","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"

It takes the harsh view that acting on our passions is unwise and that human nature dooms us to repeat the same mistakes. Yet we should make peace with the process and accept / expect failure.What would I change in this movie? Nothing. It's just perfect as it is.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
100,matrixus-1,"Who we are, what we want and where we go to - a full circle.",10,16 October 2008,"I am not your typical Asian movie buff per se, in fact, I am more of a mainstream Hollywood fan who appreciates action, violence and the occasional drama from time to time Movies usually serve only one purpose for me, and that is entertainment.This movie is very peculiar, in a good way. The entire dialog could fit on a piece of paper, each character's dialog is of utmost importance, but redundant at the same time, because you would still understand the plot without any dialog at all. What makes this movie so special is that it offers a glimpse into the true human nature, not only portraying our continuous struggle to find ourselves but also our purpose to find meaning in life. The protagonist's life is reduced to four 'seasons' and each season corresponds with a stage in his life. (I shall try to keep it abstract to prevent spoilers.) Spring represents the planted seed, buried deep under the snow and the prospect of growth and maturity around the corner. Summer represents the full grown, stubborn and proud being, gathering precious experience, but still swaying with the wind. Fall represents his desire for reconciliation, foremost with himself but also with others he has met along the way. With Winter comes his longed for peace of mind, having mastered his struggles he buries them under the icy white and soon another being will rise and be challenged the following spring, closing the endless circle of life and the struggle to find purpose and guidance in our lives.Impact on the viewer: We are being questioned about our wasteful, shallow and often times violent ways. The movie holds up a mirror so we may see ourselves in our struggle to discover the core values of life, without slipping into being didactic. Simplicity is not the sole reason this movie is brilliant, it's the fact that underlying all of our complex, engaged lives run the same core values and struggles which shape everyone's life the same way. I vow to pay more attention to the Asian movie section from now on.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
101,bexultanakimkhan,Movie review by Bexultan Akimkhan,10,9 September 2018,"The first thing that comes to mind after watching this movie is cyclicality, if to be more precise, the spiral cyclicality. The cyclical nature of the seasons which comes after one another with strict order of nature. Interestingly, but I found from this spiral cyclicality some kind of analogy with a fate of human being, which you cannot escape throughout your existence on Earth. Perhaps, there is a Buddhist philosophy according to which an individual goes through a number of stages of his life, at certain momentum of his life a person can think that he/she have some free will, by following after its own imaginary free will that person makes mistakes in something and finally understands that mistake which he did, was important to find his place in life, his truth. However, as I noticed in the movie disciple of Master is trying to change his fate by leaving to the city, while the Master does not try to change anything in his life, by continuing to live with nature in harmony, from my point of view the Master is already found his truth. A disciple in his cycle goes through a series of stages and, perhaps, what he does, everything that he tries to change in it, is the essence of this spiral cycle, which as a result comes to the same outcome.
 I would argue that the main agenda in the film is the soulful load. In spring, little boy did not know that all the bad things you did sooner or later will become transparent and you have to take responsibility for it. This is shown in the scene where child kills fish, frog and snake by playing in nature, then teacher ties him a stone on his back, and says I will untie the stone from you whenever you will untie stone from fish, frog, and snake, if they are died the sin of your action will be on your heart. At this point of time, I think, as a child, he realized how your bad act turns against you, and how your action can hurt someone. He became aware all of it, took upon himself feeling of guilt and carried that stone rest of his life. In summer, director of the movie shows how raging wave of feelings in youth lead them to trouble. The situation depicted in the episode where young man falls in love with girls and enters multiple time into sexual intercourse with her, once upon their amoral behavior is detected by Master, then the girl was compelled to leave the valley. Yet, the young man realizes that he cannot live without girl, and decides to follow after her to the city, where they marry and after some time went by he kills her because of his jealousy. With this scene, I think director tried to deliver that carnal love is not harmony, as Master himself states that passion generates desire, the desire to possess leads to murder, and I totally agree with him. While, in fall, the disciple becomes load for himself after murdering spouse. Then he returns to deep valley where he is again given the opportunity to take the blame and try to atone for it. Master forces disciple to carve out characters from holly Sutra text in order to drive out anger from his heart. After the cutting and painting the hieroglyphs he voluntarily surrenders to the police who came to detain him. Thus, after serving his sentence in prison he finally gets rid of emotional confusions and spiritual contradictions. In winter, he releases from prison and returns to his deep valley. He rises up the mountain with a stone on his back and with a Buddha's statue on his hand and, in my opinion, it is at that moment that he manages to remove the stone from the heart that was lying on it since his childhood. In addition, once upon, veiled unknown woman brings a child and dies, suddenly falling into open ice hole in the lake. The monk takes the orphan into his care. The movie ends with the arrival of another spring to the deep valley and the monk as in his childhood continues to educate the kid. 
 Throughout the film, there is a sense of calamity and dimensionality. In some episodes of movie there is an emotional tension, which is very harmonious with nature. The personal conditions of people are connected to nature, it seems me sometimes that human beings are also rigorous and harsh as like winter, mature and wise as like spring, tranquil and friendly as like summer, and, cranky and irked as like fall. Laconic style of movie always kept me on thinking and realizing my past. The movie amused me with its eastern wisdom, its poetry, music and with magnificent landscape. 
 After watching this amazing movie, I came to the conclusion that the struggle of the protagonist with his passions leads him to understanding, to consensus, to unity with himself. We observe how the agony of the soul become stronger than the pain of the body. Physical punishment can ease mental pain, but not cure it. Only after accepting and realizing of your own actions you can return to a delicate peace of mind. But your memory will forever save it in deep burdens of your mind, and the stone on your soul will hang forever until you decide to atone it. I would like to end my words with my following statement, ""every your sin is forgivable, if you will decide to atone for it"".","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"

It already hits hard when you complete the first spring part of the film. It foreshadows the future outcome of the characters, past life of them and the entire film to be honest.Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter and... Spring (2002) is visually so satisfying that it kept me hooked throughout the entire film despite being an almost silent feature. The cinematography talks about the silence of solitude, love, innocence, corruption, intimacy, Karma, spirituality and redemption. It's really amazing to think how the director pulled off such a voluptuous and spiritual journey not only of the characters but also of the atmosphere, the location and the entire world which revolves around the story throughout the movie. This is one of the most beautiful philosophical cinema I've ever seen. Hats off to Kim Ki Duk, the maestro!When we seek happiness outside ourselves, we are never truly content. This philosophy is the main protagonist of this hypnotic masterpiece of Kim Ki Duk. The entire movie floats around our mind like the monasterial hut. The circle of life is everlasting, innocent and redemptive.

It was extremely well done and the more we critiqued it afterwards, it became more obvious that there was a lot of time spent on this film. The cinematography was amazing and exceptionally beautiful through out the film. The location lended itself to great shots of the landscape. I heard it stated and I would agree that in order to get the most out of the film it required some knowledge in Buddhist philosophy. Mainly to catch a lot of the symbolism used throughout the film; which I actually missed but was amazed at all that was used after discussion.

The two crazy shots where it pans forever, throughout the whole household were amazing. I liked how the coup was arbitrarily started by one mans own emotion, it seemed to discount the quality of the revolution. All the different rolls needed and played out in the movie were all very interesting. To the planners, and to the puppets that are just acting on orders. I also like how the coup isn't pulled off perfectly by anyone's standards from the small problems like the gun failing to the larger problems like the whole coup is an utter failure. The characters are strangely well developed and I was rather sympathetic with the general who they characterized as being crazy.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
109,dannatyo,"The suffering is in her mind. When she finds peace in her mind, her body will return to health",9,4 February 2018,"The film ""Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter...and Spring"", created by the Korean film director Kim Ki-duk, was highly appreciated among the critics and was awarded with many global prizes, and after watching this I can easily understand why. Atmospheric - that is the appealing word to describe this film. Everything, starting from the amazing landscapes, and ending with barely-heard beautiful music, make viewers to be completely immersed in this parable-like movie. With the minimum amount of words, the creators of the film clearly delivered the story, and have let every viewer to make his own conclusion. 
In my opinion, the idea of the film coincides with the Buddhist ideology, that life is full of suffering; it is a continuous battle with yourself, with your own cravings, attachments and unnecessary emotions. During the whole film, the main character is trying to conquer himself and to become like his master. Starting from the period when he, as a boy, attains pleasure from seeing the sufferings of animals and ending with the time when his lust turned him into a murderer. All this way through, his teacher is trying to help him, by attaching the stone to him and thus, showing how instant karma works, or by detaching him from the woman, the object of the disciple's passion. The teacher expects that he would be able to change the life of this boy by teaching him all that he knows. But the Wheel of Samsara is continuously turning because all creatures are sinful, and it is very hard to escape it, as well as it is hard to escape the fact that after spring where will be fall, and after fall there will be winter and on and on. 
Throughout the film, we can see different interesting Buddhist signs and references. The first thing that catches the attention is that nobody in this film has the name. It may be connected with the Buddhist idea of ""no-self"", that there is no permanent ""self"" in us. Another example, when the boy decides to leave, he takes with him the statue of Buddha and the rooster. By doing that he wants the revenge, he wants to hurt his teacher by taking away the things that his teacher loved and was attached to, the same as the teacher separated the disciple from his woman. But rooster in Buddhism symbolizes lust and attachment, so metaphorically speaking, the disciple takes this sin with him to his further life. Another episode, when the teacher burns himself after the monk goes to jail, the snakes come out. Snake in Buddhism symbolizes hatred emotion, so probably this was because the teacher was full of hatred and disappointment in his disciple and in himself, because he failed to pass the Dharma effectively. Or probably because even the disciple tried to get rid of the hatred through cutting the Sutra, it was still left in him. 
That is the fascinating feature of this movie - everybody can understand and interpret this story according to his understanding. But the main moral is clear - it is all in your mind, which always should be in peace and not deceived by physical attachments, lust, cravings, hatred, and only through abandoning this, it would be possible to change the frailty of life and stop the Wheel of Samsara. Or how it was said in the movie: ""The suffering is in her mind. When she finds peace in her mind, her body will return to health"". 
Overall, I think it is a great movie. It greatly demonstrates the basics of Buddhist ideology and some of the Eastern cultural features. I think it may seem for some viewers to be a little slow, or lack of actions and words, but again, that is the feature of Asian movies, of their culture and mentality. There is a good camera work, amazing nature shown, good storyline, and more importantly, it provides a great food for thought, even for those, who are not interested in Buddhism.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
110,alibekbolat,Movie Review,9,9 February 2020,"The film shows us ""Spring, summer, autumn, winter...and spring again"" of a student who has experienced all the main human feelings, both high and vicious. The pupil will have to pass through all the trials and temptations to rise to the level of his teacher, so that when the time comes, he can take his place.
Sorting of collected medicinal herbs illustrates the entire film - the ability to distinguish. It seems that two herbs look the same, but one kills, and the other gives life and it is difficult to get confused about what is what. The goal of mature teacher is to make it the wisest way to explain to the student what is good and what is bad.
The film perfectly shows the cyclicity of life - samsara, and it is perfectly shown in comparison with the seasons. Spring will come, then summer, and so on, and in the end, spring will come again. No one has power to stop this cycle of life, just as the teacher is not able to prevent the mistakes of his student - everything has place and time to be.
Spring. The student, as befits all children, wants to know the world around them. The student is like spring, he is still immature and through mistakes learns this world. And fortunately, he has a strict, but kind and wise teacher, who will always point out a mistake and show the right way, although he will have to show it to his favorite student through a well-deserved kick. And one small but meaningful scene occurs when a boy, because of his childish mischief, plays with a fish, a frog, and a snake, tying them to a rock at the end. Noticing this, the wise teacher did not scold him for his mistake but showed him the pain and inconvenience he caused to the animals by tying a large stone to the pupil himself. The most important statement of the teacher in part spring: ""if one of them dies, then you will wear a stone on your heart all your life"". So, it happened: two animals died and looking at the loud cry, the boy realized his mistake and carried the punishment inside himself. The teacher wanted to show his immature student that every life in this world is important, whether it is the life of a fish, a frog, or a snake.
Summer. Like the summer, the student grew up, gained strength, and became a young man. Now he's smarter and stronger, and he's not that little boy who does not understand the life around him. However, his life changes dramatically when he meets a girl of his own age, who due to illness, came to his teacher. The student is relatively grown up, but he is still constantly discovering new things - it is common for him to make mistakes, previously it was to tie a stone to animals, and now it is to succumb to the temptation of a female body. During the film, love is shown as a drug, as a medicine for boring ordinary everyday life around, you should be able to refuse, but first you need to try it. The student is blinded by love and passion for the girl, now there is no place for teachings in his thoughts. On the day of the arrival of the girl, the student points out that it is prohibited to sit on the stone statue, but over time, finding feelings, he sets her on a stone statue by himself.
Autumn. There comes a cold, life begins to fade and with this, the teacher sees the news that the man violently killed his wife. In this murderer, the teacher sees his pupil. The disciple comes to the place where he was expected, the place where he is destined to be. The teacher immediately accepts his student, without unnecessary words of aggression or condemnation, because the disciple came here for wisdom, for answers that should muffle all the pain inside. The words of the Buddha are relevant here: you will not be punished for your anger; you will be punished by your anger. Student becomes incredibly determined and aggressive. His anger reaches a peak, the pain inside is so strong that it seems further he cannot live an ordinary life. Consequently, he tries to commit suicide, but was stopped by his beloved teacher, one who was always nearby and always ready to give a help. By cutting out the Sutra, student begins a long and painstaking journey to the lost inner balance. He went off with the police with complete humility to serve his sentence. Whether admitting defeat in the fact that he raised up an unworthy student, or vice versa, deciding that he finished all his business in this world, the teacher commits a suicide ritual.
Winter. The student returns to his home after serving his sentence and looking at the calm and humility in his actions, it can be understood that he has got rid of his inner suffering, and now, he is completely ready to replace gone teacher. An unknown woman leaves the child to the master, such a boy, which once was the teacher himself for a long time ago, and now everyone already understands what's what. Soon the winter will end, and the entire path must be traversed again.
...and Spring. As expected, the little child became a student, just like his teacher before, he is childish like his teacher, tortures animals, just like his teacher. Life has come to its beginning, already other people, but with one essence of action.
Life in the early spring and summer seems intended only for the sake of their own pleasure, the realization that this approach to life inevitably entails great suffering for the soul, sometimes comes too late, only in the fall. Autumn, as a period of personal maturity, brings with it spiritual torments, a re-evaluation of the past and gives a chance to prepare for the next round - winter, a complete life from the point of view of spirituality. Only after passing the full cycle of spiritual transformation, life passes to renewal-spring.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
111,yeldarbitibayev,Masterpice,10,26 April 2020,"The movie ""Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter and Spring"" (2003), directed by Ki Duk Kim, is a true masterpiece, that covers philosophical ideas, like life cycle and attachment to things and people. The movie shows different life stages of young monk, who was raised by older one. In all scenes, they live in the temple, which is located in the middle of the lake, surrounded by mountains and fosters. In the first scene (Spring), boy tied a stone to the fish, frog and then to the snake. It is not clearly shown his motivation to do so, and I am not sure that he intentionally wanted to harm them. He was very young, and it is more likely that he did it because he found it interesting and amazing. However, our actions should not harm others' lives. The Buddhist monk saw his action and harshly punished his disciple by tying larger stone to his back. He wanted to give him lesson and said that he should release all animals from the stone, and if someone is dead, then ""you will carry the stone in your heart for the rest of your life"" (m. 16:08). Fish and snake were dead. The facial expression of disciple in these moments was priceless and very emotional. I had the opinion that he might have trauma for life. It was not clear for me, why the teacher did not help these animals; he saw everything and did nothing. I hope he might find other ways to teach him a lesson without harming animals and disciple's psychology.
In the second moment (Summer), the disciple meets a young girl and falls in love with her. He decides to go after her and renounces monasticism. His teacher said: ""Lust awakens the desire to possess. And that awakens the intent to murder."" (m. 47:38). He was right, at the end the disciple murdered her because of her desire to be with another man. This moment illustrates that nothing is forever, the love, desire, feelings, people are all temporary and leave all of us soon.
In the third moment (autumn), the disciple flees after murdering and returns to the isolated temple to his Buddhist teacher. The movie in this scenario raises another important question. The Buddhist monk said to his disciple: ""Sometimes we have to let go of things we like. What you like, others will also like!"" (57:34-57:41 m.). We can not affect to the feelings and desires of others. When we want something or someone, our emotions take hold of us, and we stop to think rationally. As a result, the desire will turn into obsession, and in this moment the obsession turned into killing the person, whom he loved. As Buddhist monk assumed, everything is temporary, and we can not control others' desires, and we sometimes can not even control our own desires and emotions. The best way in such cases is to let go of our desires and loved ones, especially when it is not mutual. I do not clearly understand the ending of the episode, when the Buddhist monk decided to commit suicide. I had some assumptions: he wanted to atone because of his poor education to his disciple or maybe he wanted to free his body and everything. Then, he was reincarnated to the snake. Reincarnation is one of the important concepts in Buddhism.
In the fourth episode (Winter), the disciple returns to the temple after the jail and again became the monk. He tied the stone and climbed to the top of the mountain with this stone. The possible reason is that he wanted to let go of the guilt, which started in the beginning of his life, when he tied the stones to animals. I think this guilt haunted him all his life up to this moment. In the beginning of this episode, woman left the child in the temple. Monk decided to raise a child as a monk.
The next episode, called Spring, is one of the most important episodes in the movie, because it shows the cyclical nature of life. Child repeats the actions of the disciple in the beginning of the movie, but instead of tying stones to the animals, child puts the stones in their mouths. It shows that everything in life repeats. The only thing that we can do is to help others not repeat our mistakes. I am very curious to know how the monk would decide to educate the new disciple. Will he choose the same method as his Buddhist teacher or another method?! We could help others live a decent life. In other cases, as its theme shows, everything will repeat in this life and spring will start again.
In this movie, I liked everything: the content, soundtracks, the acting, nature, animals. It was interesting to see some concepts and elements of Buddhism through the life of the disciple. That is why my rating for this movie is 10/10.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
112,the_rb-1,Jaw-dropping cinematography makes this film a masterpiece,10,17 July 2008,"For a film with so little dialog, it certainly speaks volumes. Some might complain about this aspect of the film, but ultimately, what the characters say is unimportant. It is through their choices and actions that you will come to understand the Buddhist philosophy that this film portrays.'Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter...and Spring' is chalked full of symbolism, which, due to the lack of dialog, encourages the viewers to contemplate on the movie's themes of beauty, love, life, death, and rebirth themselves. A thought-provoking film such as this is refreshing when so many other films force-feed us their views on the same subjects.I mention the theme of beauty first, because the cinematography is absolutely stunning. Out of all the movies I have ever seen, there is no comparison. Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter...and Spring shows by far the greatest display of beauty in nature, from the fragile and gentle aspects of fish swimming in a pond, to the sublime sweeping views of the surrounding lake and mountain sides.Overall, I consider this movie a masterpiece. I believe it comes closer than any other to capturing beauty in its purest form. I am very eager to see what other work Ki-Duk Kim has done if this is any indication of his talent as a director.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"

This is beautiful to watch in a travelogue kind of way. In the story a lot happens, enough to stop you questioning its actual meaning.Unfortunately about 30 minutes into the film the essential triteness of the director takes over and we have a bit of sex, a bit of dire martial arts, then a bit of Kitsch Buddhism. Great Art House film this is not, but on the level of a popular entertainment it is just slow enough to make the slow think it profound and quick enough for those without attention span to keep in touch. It was a wet day in Huddersfield and I was feeling a bit flaccid so this was just what was required!","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
114,aisultanzhumabek,Be prepared - you position about desires could be changed,9,4 February 2018,"Review
In my opinion, the main uniqueness of the ""Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter, and again... Spring"" is expressing key message through the seasons: spring as a little boy; summer as the teenager; autumn as the young man; winter as a middle age; and spring as his old age. Furthermore, it correlates with the level of consciousness of the main character: firstly, he, as a boy, learns initial rules of life from his master, then he does some mistakes, such as indulge with his desires. The next two periods - autumn and winter, as seasons of lifelessness and coldness - represent the harsh period for him. And the spring, as period of new life, shows the awakening of monk and becoming master for adopter boy. As you can see, Kim Ki-Duk made a great effort to visualize the life period of his main character. 
The main thing, which will keep you to watch this film, is the atmosphere, which definitely shows a professionality of filming crew. Firstly, the limited amounts of words, especially in the second half of film, forces you to watch with the high focus on different details, such as emotions of separate characters and etc. Secondly, several details which could not be explained logically gives for the film some charms. For example, rooms which are separated by doors but without walls; super-natural abilities of the master to force boat move or stop. Lastly, despite the fact that the film is about the Buddhist monks, there is more about personal feelings of each character rather than the Buddhism itself and its traditions. The main reason for this statement is that we discovered the only tradition of burying man from the entire film. All above-mentioned factors are key elements in the whole beautiful atmosphere of this film. 
This film got several critiques for animal abuse and too expressed sexual content. First one is due to European tolerance for all living creatures. Second critique, in my opinion, is justified by the need to make the audience feel the strength of dark desires in order to explain the failure of the naïve monk to overcome his own passions, which created him further problems. 
To conclude with, this film of Kim Ki-Duk is worth of your time if you have searched for atmospheric films with core lesson for your life. But be prepared - your position about desires could be changed.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
115,gauharanuar,The wisdom which comes by age,9,9 September 2018,"A movie by Ki Duk Kim ""Spring, summer, fall, winter... and again spring"" represents a fascinating story about the lifestyle of monks. This movie also separated to parts described as the seasons of the year. And it starts by spring. Maybe because the spring is associated with living creatures like plants growing again after winter the same as human being born again after death. So, the story begins from describing a childhood of monk living with his master. From the movie, it can be clearly seen that the young monk respects and always listens to his master maybe because he is obliged to do so. However, in my point of view, the author wants to show us that student respects his master because of the master's wisdom. For example, when the young monk tied to a stone to frog, fish, and snake, the master did not just that tell him that what he is doing wrong but showed on him how it is difficult to take actions when you are tied to heavy things. In the other words, the author trying to show us the peaceful manner of the master teaching the right path. The second part is the summer when plants are flowering and giving fruits. The same will occur to the young monk when he gets older and become more aware of what the master teaches. In addition, he fell in love with a young girl who comes to them because of her illness. However, their time spending together comes to the end when the master decides to sent the girl back after the girl gets well. However, the student wants to be with this girl and leave his master because of his unwillingness to control his emotions. The master warns his student that lust might awaken intent to murder. Again, here we can see the wisdom of the master and his true prediction because he really kills his wife with knife. And the next season starts, it is autumn when it is time when leaves are falling down from tree and weather also becomes colder. The student monk also returns to his master feeling angry to his wife and to himself cold enough to his master. Trying to kill himself because he seems not to forgive himself but the master again shows his wisdom even though he has already said the consequences of his lust, by forgiving him and helping to drive all his anger and clean the soul and be in a peace with soul and prevents him from killing himself. After short time the student 
begins to return his initial peace. However, policemen come to take him. The winter comes and plants dies and his master too. The monk student returns and takes care of the place left by the master. He gains his inner peace and become more soulful. One day one woman with closed face and head brings his son to this holy place. And die when running on the ice and child will be left to monk. This student monk becomes master to this child and teaches what he learned from his master.And again spring as it is written in the title spring comes and everything again come to the world and in the movie this child also makes mistakes as his master by giving stone to ingest to frog, snake and fish. It is like the repetition of life but with other student of monk. This movie does not clearly show what all these occurred things meant but leave the conclusion or the meaning of the story to the viewer. I was also confused but I predict this movie might describe the Buddhism where the people are being born again and again until they become wiser and come to liberation. And it is similar to the seasons of the year which repeats itself as people getting old and being come to life again. Maybe the master and his student came to liberation after dying because the master had ability to control the movement of boat and the house and his student also prepared by repetition of movements described in the book.To conclude, this movie is interesting and seems to give meaning with this story but more than one time should be watched to be able to get the full meaning.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"

Spring is a movie that follows a Korean boys life as he grows up and learns different lessons about life. What really drew me in was the heartfelt storyline. I felt really sad when the young boy has to carry a boulder on his back while untying the creatures. The movie offers a lot of valuable lessons. However, in some scenes the movie seem to drag on a little too much. For example, the director needs to delete some shots when the main character climbs up the mountain with the statue. I also think the sex scenes were too much. Overall, I gave this movie 7 out of 10.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
118,Jakah,My summary and opinion,7,20 September 2006,"Spring Summer Fall Winter & Spring tells the story of a priest/healing/master who has a young boy as his apprentice. The two of them live in a small floating pagoda or house in the middle of a small lake and fill their days finding herbs and such for medicine, praying and learning. The first season of the film, Spring, introduces the young boy as cute initially, then mischievous and finally, after being reprimanded, resentful. Summer follows showing the young boy no longer a boy but a teenager with all the boiling emotions and uncontrollable lust usually present in teenage boys. A young sick girl is brought to the small house by her mother to have the priest cure her and is left there for a while. In the meantime the teenage boys lust for the girl takes control and he is found breaking traditions of his upbringing simply to fulfills his desires. Eventually she is 'cured' and she and the teenage boy leave together to become married. Fall shows the priest alone for a bit and then shows the boy returning to the house on the lake as a man in his 30s or so running away from his actions. We find that he has murdered his wife, the girl from the summer season, because she had become unfaithful to him. He is now on the lam and has returned home to escape the law. The story thus far has showed him digressing from general mischievousness to an all-consuming lust, to a murderous rage that has become unconquerable. To have the pupil take leave of his rage the priest/master has him carve out characters on the wooden deck of the floating house to expel all of the rage built up inside of him. The law has since tracked him to this house on the lake and have been instructed by the priest/master to wait for the young man to finish expelling his rage before arresting him and taking him to court or prison. The young man finishes, is taken away by the detectives, and the priest/master is left by himself to live out his final days. Winter arrives with the young man back at the house on the lake to carry his burden of past transgressions up and away, to continue to work them out of himself. He carries his weight up a hill away from the house on the lake and out of his mind. He toils at this task for a long period of time and learn a great deal from it. The second Spring comes around and shows the young man now an old man. The now old man has taken the priest/master's position and the cycle is begun anew!I thought this film was a very nice piece depicting the life cycle on the whole and depicting reincarnation as well. The direction was well done, story line was very straight-forward and didn't require a whole lot of deep thinking. I actually found myself trying to find a different theme or deeper meaning to the film assuming that the obviousness of the life cycle theme was not the only one the director was trying to submit. The production quality was at least consistent and good, though the cinematography didn't necessarily strike me as anything superb or breathtaking. The lighting was decent, but again, not much to it as most of the film was shot in natural daylight without much in the way of special effects or lighting techniques that were specifically super impressing.Overall I'd give this film 7 out of 10","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
119,Richardc23,Simplistic Beauty,10,2 July 2008,"It's funny how down the line many films have shot in 20 - 30 different destinations aiming for that wow factor and yet along comes Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter...... and spring, who for the entirety of the film shot in just one single destination and yet the wow factor was right there in the beauty of the surroundings and seasons.It saddens me to think that some people out there will hate this film (and there will be many of you), Maybe because it's too slow? Maybe because dialogue is very few and far between? However these are the simple things that make this film breathtaking. The pace of the film allows us to develop a relationship with the two Buddhist's, the old mature Buddhist and his young and naive protégé. As for the dialogue the film is not riddled with dialogue in fact they only speak when words prevail stronger than actions and at those times the dialogue is always meaningful.Overall this film portrays the continuing cycle of life just as it reflects the continuing cycle of seasons. This is a must watch especially for fans of Korean Cinematograhphy.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"

121,federicocalciolari,"Where courage is lacking, craftsmanship and contemplative beauty remain.",7,14 December 2020,"Kim Ki-Duk's film is first and foremost a great cinematic work: the director has staged a coherent and memorable work, built around a language and poetics that are finally mature.The solemn rhythm of the progression of the plot and the dry and never rhetorical dialogues are perfectly complementary to a camerawork that acts as the only true commentator: it lingers, mocks, ponders, always with great simplicity and a soft veil of irony.Beyond the great display of style, it remains a contemplative and fascinating film, which suffers, however, from some serious discord.From the narrative point of view, there is no doubt that the intent is to help the spectator in the fruition of the work, but the outcome is a bit 'clumsy: there are many, too many, narrative archetypes simply used to carry on the plot.Many narrative choices are in fact far too familiar, and if they certainly help to bring the film closer to the more classic and codified (and therefore simple) cinematic language, they nevertheless end up flattening a film that would anyway have more than enough to capture the viewers.The imperfection of this film lies precisely in a lack of narrative courage: it is a work that rejects any space for ambiguity, any space for narrative shyness, displaying instead its naked self in front of the viewer.However, this nudity never feels sincere, nor shocking, nor surprising: it is reassuring, mute, didactic, as if it were the nudity of an anatomical table.The result is a film with little soul, and that never manages to find a good balance between the most erudite symbolism and the most earthy explanation.What remain, however, are powerful images, a solid stylistic consistency and a timeless story about good and evil, transience and eternity, revenge and surrender. And in the end, that's more than enough.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
122,kamillazhangulova,Tranquil Wisdom,6,12 February 2018,"Spring, Sumer, Fall, Winter... and Spring is a South Korean movie about unusual Buddhist monastery that floats on a lake which is surrounded by forest. This movie showcases the life story of a Buddhist monk from his very early childhood till the time of his old age. While the titular seasons - spring, summer, autumn, and winter are really represented in the time in which they were claimed to be, as it probably can be guessed, they are not just associated with the real seasons, but they also are allegorically addressing quite convoluted path of a young monk. There is not much dialogues, or a background narrative voice which would have explained what is happening in the story (while sometimes it would be good to have it), but still scenes are showed in such a way that it definitely grasps the attention of the viewer right till the last minute of the movie. Film is packed with numerous allegories, and cultural peculiarities of South Korea (through which indeed differences in Buddhism practices according to regions can be traced) which would entertain the auditory by their sophisticated, and nuanced exhibition. In my opinion, this movie deserves to be watched at least due to its quite unusual but incredibly exciting style of story representation.
 Movie starts with a rather spectacular scene depicting the day-to-day routine of a Buddhist apprentice and his master. What is interesting about these scenes is the strange presence of doors when there are no walls, and right from this moment it starts to seem that movie is going to be a quite capturing one. An apprentice is just a small boy, who seems rather childish and who tries to do everything as his master does. But, once he decided to ""play"" with a fish, frog, and a snake by tying small stones to them and laughing as they struggle. His master is watching at these three occasions all along the way. Then, in the night, in order to teach his apprentice of his incorrect actions he tied a stone, just proportionate to his size. When the boy wakes up and finds himself tied with a stone, he asks his master for help. But his Master claims that only after he would free the creatures from the torments which boy imposed on them, the master would release him. The boy becomes really surprised and amused when he realizes that his 'game' has tortured the creatures, and that snake, and a fish had died. I think that this scene is on what this movie stresses its focus because it very vividly depicts the danger of ignorance, and pursuit of one's unthoughtful desires.
 Later, in the ""Summer"", the story plot is occurring around the young lady that was brought into the monastery because of her illness, and the love to which a young apprentice would fall with her. After his Master would know about their relationships, and sends apprentice's ""girlfriend"" back, an apprentice will escape from the monastery leaving his Master alone in order to pursue his love. But, this story does not actually have a ""happy ending"". In the ""Autumn"" we see that frustrated and grief-stricken man who is looking for a refuge from the police since he has committed a crime. While the Master helps his apprentice to release his anger, stops him from suicide, and supports him - Master appears to be harshly disappointed. After the police had found the man and took him, we see that Master self-emulates him, which appears to be quite compelling scene because the Buddhist teaching does not accept it, and additionally it is a quite vivid scene. 
 The ""Winter"" depicts how a grown man, that had experienced all the ""ugliness"" of life, comes back to the monastery where has grown up. He spends some time in seclusion, which notably help him to ensure his spirituality before he himself becomes a Teacher to a young boy, that was brought to the temple by a woman that was in sorrow about her action. While some of the scenes seems rather unclear, and hardly understandable in a thorough way to one who is not quite accustomed to the culture of South Korea, and their way of practicing Buddhism, they certainly provoke a wide variety of strong emotions and questioning of these customs. 
 The film ends in an already ""acquainted"" scene - boy playing with stones and creatures. But, now it actually is a different boy. This movie unequivocally represents one of those art pieces which not only are worth watching once, but also for the second and third time as well since I believe every time, and every individual would understand it in a discrete way. This arises because of the ""room"" for imagination which the film cordially provides us for having our own perceptions about the matter of the film, but it simultaneously is depicting the fundamental wisdoms of Buddhism quite concretely.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
123,mirasukurova,Pilosophical film,10,3 February 2018,"Film review by Mira Sukurova.
""Spring, summer, fall, winter ... and spring"" is a very impressive movie about the life of a Buddhist monk. It was a pleasure to contemplate beautiful images of nature throughout the film. There are very few dialogues, but acting expressiveness of the actors, music and aesthetics of each scene do their job, and do not require words to be said in order to convey the message. The life of a Buddhist monk is compared to the seasons. The monk is portrayed by a different actor in each season. The change of actors is clear and inevitable in the spring-to-summer or a child-to-youth transition, however, later it has more a symbolic meaning, rather than a need. I think, the change of actors refers to one of the most important Buddhist doctrines of no-self. The doctrine states that there is no eternal, permanent, non-changing self or soul in each of us, living creatures. Similarly, we see a quite different personality in each of the phases of the monk's life. The circularity of time, and the change of the seasons represent impermanence as the essence of life. Buddhism teaches that no attachment should take place, as everything is impermanent. Similarly, a monk gets attached to a girl, and loses her later, as her feelings are not permanent as well. The fact that he kills her show that early in his life he did not understand this Buddhist truth of impermanence. The film is full of Buddhist symbolism. The thing that hits attention is the doors. Apparently, they do not serve their usual function and their use is more about the choice than a need. The use of doors might symbolize the discipline, the morality of everyday choices and following a right path. The first signal of a monk going away from monk's morality was when he overstepped his sleeping teacher in order to come close to a girl. I think that the main message that the director wanted to convey in this film was the need of compassion to all living creatures. From the very first scenes, an old monk teaches his disciple to be compassionate to all living things around, and later demonstrates great compassion and wisdom to a murderer. It was heart-warming to see how even policemen that came to arrest a criminal manifested compassion and belief that a person can change. Though, the monk's life path can not be called happy, the film leaves a mood of peace, hope, reconciliation and light sorrow. The other thing that I liked about the film is that it evokes interest in the viewers to the Buddhist culture, religion, traditions. For example, right away after the film I was very curious to google the meanings of the animals depicted in the film, or the meaning of face closed, or the so-called Prajnamapitra Sutra, or the procedure of tight bondage and many other details. Overall, I was very satisfied by this film, abundant of both magnificent images and though-provoking messages.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
124,ayatemirbek,The story of growing up,8,9 September 2018,"South Korean movie called ""Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter and Spring"" is the cinematography masterpiece directed by Kim Ki-duk and first shown in 2003. It depicts the life of a Buddhist Monk, taking place in a monastery in the middle of an alpine lake surrounded by forest. 
As the title provides viewers with the hint, the story is divided to 5 episodes roughly ten to twenty years apart, each portraying the important stages of novice monk's growing. 
At the beginning viewers are introduced with the little boy and his master living in a solitude praying and meditating on a small floating monastery, drifting on a lake in the serene forested mountains of Korea. Small, old boat, which is the only merit of connection with the outer world, is used to reach the bank of the lake where they walk, exercise and collect herbs. The Spring shows the apprentice discovering the power and violence, as he torments fish, frog and snake, tying a small rock to them and watching them suffer. The master, who is attentively observing all 3 scenes, punishes his disciple by tying smooth rock to his back and chastising him to release the creatures, but if boy finds any of them dead, he will 'carry the stone in his heart forever'. Wading through the forest and struggling with the load on his back, boy finds the fish, lying dead on the bottom of the creek, unties the frog frantically trying to jump out of water, exactly where boy has left it, and finds snake in the pool of blood, probably attacked by another animal unable to escape. The boy bursts into tears seeing what he has done to the snake. 
In Summer episode, viewers see apprentice in his teenage discovering the feeling of love and its dangers. He meets a mother and her daughter heading to the monastery to cure unspecified illness of the teenage girl. Mother prays all night and, then, leaves her child to Buddhist master to be healed. Over the next few days, the apprentice finds himself sexually attracted to the girl; he cannot resist from groping her breast and staring at her at night. Frightened with the absolutely new feelings, he is too shy to disembosom. Nevertheless, these feelings seem to be mutual, as two teens have sex in the forest and the affection gets stronger and stronger. The morning master discovers their relationship, he expresses neither anger nor disappointment, he merely warns his apprentice that 'lust leads to desire for possession, and possession leads to murder' and asks the girl to leave the monastery as she is already healed. The apprentice follows the girl the next morning stealing the Buddha's statue and the rooster, which symbolize the burden of his master's teachings and his own cravings. 
The Fall episodes takes place many years later. Aged master glimpses a story about his former disciple being wanted for the murder of his wife. Foreseeing his apprentice's return he gets ready to see him, modifying his monk's garments. When adult apprentice appears in the monastery, full of anger, he, then, makes an attempt to conduct suicide ritual by sealing his eyes, mouth and ears, however, master discovers him and beats him ruthlessly, declaring that killing his wife does not allow to kill himself so easily. Master orders his former apprentice to carve 'Heart Sutra' that he has written with the ink on the wooden floor of the monastery. When two detectives arrive to arrest the man, masters asks to give them one night to complete the task as it may help his apprentice to regain his temper. The following morning detectives peacefully take away the man to the jail. Episode ends with the old master building a pyre in the rowboat to conduct a suicide ritual, as he understands that his life is at the end. 
Covered by snow and ice monastery is left with nobody in it. Adult apprentice returns to his former home to bring life back to this place. Soon, he finds the manuscript with the choreographic exercise and starts his training to get ready to become new master. One night woman with shawl wrapped around her face comes to the monastery with her baby son. She leaves her son and flees into the night, where she accidentally stumbles into a hole in the ice dug by the monk. Though apprentice takes her body from the lake, her face stays uncovered to the audience. Completing tough and long process of training and self-discipline, man assigns himself the greater task. He ties the monastery large circular stone emblematic to the Buddhist culture (Bhavacakra, the wheel of life and death) to his body, takes the Buddha's statue (Maitreya) and climbs to the highest peak to meditate and leave the statue of Buddha-to-come to observe the monastery from the mountains. 
Returning to Spring, the cycle is started again. Abandoned baby, who is now apprentice of the new master, repeats the very same steps of his master, so that cycle goes on. 
The movie is full of symbolism. The seasons themselves can be considered as main characters as they depict the stages of growth which each human being goes through. The sequence of the seasons of the year is that strong, so it cannot be resisted or changed, the same is applied to the growing up and acquiring lessons. Though movie has distinct link to the Buddhism, it can be applied to anybody regardless of the religious or ethnical identity. Being humans we are prone to make mistakes as life is full of temptations. However, we also have the great gif of learning and analyzing, so that as time goes by we evolve and grow both physically and mentally, that way the endless circle repeats on and on. The old teach the young, watch them making mistakes, help and punish when needed, but discipline results in wisdom, so the young is ready to become the old. 
Interestingly, that except detectives, none of the characters have names, so that the message of the movie can be applied to anyone who has his heart and mind open to wisdom, that's why the movie 'Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter and Spring' is absolutely worth watching.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"

126,madinajumagulova,It's natural to make mistakes,10,9 February 2020,"I watched a movie ""Spring, summer, fall, winter... and spring"" three times: during my childhood, at the age of 17, and today. When I was a child, I thought about this movie as a fairytale. At the age of 17, the movie seemed to be tragic. Today I came back to the idea of fairytale: the movie, in my opinion, is full of symbols and events which are mysteriously happening during the movie. Some of them are intuitively easy to understand even though I am not a part of Korean and Buddhist society. Also, today the story seems to me not so tragic but rather more natural and daily, and the relationships between the old monk and his disciple feels like the relationships between father and son.When the movie started, I was wondered with how the temple was incorporated in the nature. We could see that the house was located near the forest and could be built inside of it. However, it was built on some platform on the lake. It may look like strange place for building a temple but if the temple was built inside of the forest, during the building of the temple, trees would be cut down in the possible place of the temple. Even from the location of the temple we could see caring attitudes toward the nature of people who built the temple and the monk who lived in it. Moreover, the temple represents the old monk. As I understood, the major part of his lifetime he spent alone and was surrounded by nature.Important participants of the movie are animals: fish, fog, snake, cock, cat. In the first part of the movie, young disciple kills a fish and a snake. In the ""Summer"" part, we could see a fish and snake. They are different from the previous part, but it was symbolic: even though you made mistakes, the life continues. I understood as a second chance given to the young disciple.In the ""Fall"" part, we met a stray cat which was found by the old monk near the gates. Ironically, not so long after that his disciple came back to the temple. His mature disciple resembles the stray cat. The stray cat was not able to come down to the earth from the statue without help, however, it's natural for cats to jump without fear. This cat was not able to do such a natural thing. The disciple who disappointed in his life and wanted to end his life, however, it's natural to want to live for human beings. Both went astray. Also, we could see how the old monk was especially emotional toward the cat although he didn't show any emotions to guests in the ""Summer"" part, when people act disrespectful in the temple. In the ""Fall"" part, we can see how the monk gentle to the cat: he was petting the cat with a smile. And it was the only place in the movie when we could see how the old monk smiles. This act reminds how he cared his young disciple when the disciple was a child. Moreover, in the scene when the disciple was carving sutra, the cat was also feeling discomfort. In the end of the ""Fall"" part, when the disciple found peace after whole night of work, the disciple and cat left the temple. I think that scene was important because it illustrated that every people have own destiny and you should sometimes let
them go even though it may bring you a feeling of loneliness and suffering.Another important aspect which I want to highlight in this story is the relationships between people, especially family relationships. As we noticed, there are not so many dialogs in the movie as we usually find in movies. This makes us more careful toward nonverbal expressions and small gestures.
In the ""Spring"" part, when the old monk wakes up, he tenderly tries to wake up the boy. In the ""Spring"" and ""Summer"" parts, we could see how the monk was observing actions of the boy and letting him to make his own mistakes. It may seem indifferent attitude of the monk toward the boy, but it was acceptance of weaknesses of his disciple. The monk didn't blame the boy even when he decided to leave and took away the Buddha's statue. This situation looked like the situation with grown up children and parents: at certain moment of life children leave, and it's natural.In the ""Fall"" part, we can see how the monk accepted his disciple. He was not blaming him for the murder, he was worried about his wellbeing and happiness. When the disciple tried to commit a suicide, the monk became furious - this act is unnatural for monks who train their patience and acceptance for years. From that we can conclude that the monk had been personally moved by the action of the disciple.Another situation I would like to discuss is when the disciple told that he killed his wife because she had left him, the monk said that you should your loved ones let them go. This action may seem alien to the monk, however, we can see it in the end of ""Fall"" part. In the scene when the disciple and cat were leaving, we can see how the monk was sad and lonely. I can not think that it's a coincidence that after the leave of his disciple the monk deiced to end his life. My feeling is that the monk understood that his disciple would be living a better life and he would come back to the temple, so the monk accomplished what he ought to do in this life. I was emotionally touched when I recognized that during the self-immolation, I saw traces of tears. We can think about it as his attachment to the disciple: the disciple and the monk were a family. In the
end, the monk let his disciple go even though it brought a suffering.In my opinion, the last 2 parts were final, they showed that all in our lives are periodical as seasons of a year. And at the first glance the nature of human beings may seem to be cruel, stupid, greedy, it does not mean that humans are not able to change and feel sorry for the things they've done. It's natural to make mistakes. As I understood from the movie, you will always have the second chance to start your life.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
127,deniskim,Deep ideas,7,14 September 2020,"The ""Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter, and... Spring"" film is imbued with extraordinary spirituality and symbolism. At the first sight it is just a life story about a young Buddhist apprentice. But the film contains plenty of deep ideas which are worth analyzing separately. In this review, I want to examine some scenes of the film which depict the religious conceptions and to investigate to what extent they correspond to reality. Firstly I will discuss the concept of a collection of changes. Secondly, I will consider how the concept of karma was illustrated in the film. Thirdly, I will write about four noble truths in Buddhism. And lastly, I will try to bind the film with Eliade's idea about sacred spaces, and will express my general feelings about this film.One of the main ideas of the film is a permanent cycle of life which goes, as seasons replace each other. Although someone can claim that the samsara concept is related to this idea, I believe that the concept Yijing Divination of early Chinese religion explains it better. Yijing Divination is a collection of changes. There is a belief system that was associated with Yijing. First is that the world/cosmos is not chaotic or random. Second is that everything that happens is dictated by a pattern just as seasons always go the same way. Considering that, it can be supposed that the Buddhist apprentice was doomed to go through all the difficulties in his young ages, in order to achieve appeasement and mature to become a teacher himself. It is believed that sages could predict the dictated pattern by making special rituals. Probably the monk from the film knew the destiny of his pupil, though no rituals were shown directly. Therefore, he waited for his pupil in a ""Fall"" scene in order to help him to forgive himself, and only after that, the monk decided to pass away.The movie well illustrates the concept of karma. Even a person who did not study religions knows what karma means. It is about that every action inevitably provokes a response either instantly or at some point in the future. We can see the effect of instant karma in a ""Winter"" scene, when a woman who gave her child, leaving the temple, falls into the hole in a frozen lake and dies. Furthermore, we can see how the bullying of animals in childhood led to the suffering of the protagonist in adulthood. In my opinion that was an illustration of karma's response after many years. Also, I believe that the in the ""Winter"" the scene of the climbing on mounting with a tied stone abstractly depicts how all wrong actions we did, all our sins (stone) make it difficult to move forward in life (climbing the mountain).In Buddhism, there are Four Nobel Truths which are undeniable. I want to write about the first three of them, that in my opinion were properly depicted in the movie. First, is Duhkha, meaning that life is full of suffering. The second is Trishna, meaning that the root of the sufferings are cravings. And the third is that to overcome the sufferings one should overcome cravings. It is obvious that the life of the protagonist was full of suffering. It can be seen by his sick appearance in a ""Fall"" scene. The reason for his suffering was that he killed his wife for treason. But he killed her because of the desire to own her, and this desire is caused by the fact that he once could not overcome his lustful desires.Another interesting feature of the film is doors without walls. We can see them in a temple, in a place where they sleep, and on a lake. It is very important for people to go through these doors, though there no walls. In my opinion, those gates represent the entrance to a special place with spiritual calm, where people can find help at any time, where they can heal their souls. There is an illustration of two deities on the doors on a lake. Although it is not directly said in the movie, I suppose that they personify the guardians who protect the entrance both from human enemies and demons. In my opinion, it is closely related to Eliade's concept of a sacred place.To sum up, the ""Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter, and... Spring"" movie has a very deep meaning, that will be useful for every person, despite his religious views. But in my opinion, there are some very protracted scenes, and therefore it was a bit boring for me. Furthermore, I did not like the cast and their acting. In general, the idea of the film is good, but I personally did not like the way it was shot, which is significant for such a piece of art as a movie.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
128,zhanarmukhtarova,Good film from which you can learn something,9,7 February 2021,"We do not always understand how often we make mistakes and how these mistakes are repeated by other people, however, you are lucky if you have a person, who could share his wisdom and help to understand your misstep, as do monks in the film. The Korean movie ""Spring, Winter, Summer, Autumn and Spring again"", directed by Kim Ki-duk, is a simple movie, unremarkable at first sight, however, it has a deep meaning, which illustrated the life cycle of Buddhist monks. Although the film contains some animal cruelty, the scenes of self-immolation and violence, it has a positive and deep meaning, which teaches the audience to ethics, forgiveness and self-discipline.The beginning of watching the film, with the slow and silent actions of main characters without any sounds, was confusing, however closer to the end of the film you stay amazed and fascinated with a great dose of thoughts and emotions. The good impression is also evoked by the great actors, interesting plot and many good quotes, which makes you be lost in thoughts.The movie is divided into five parts, which represents different seasons of the year, although I expected that movie would be concentrated on the one year of life of the monk, however, the actions are expanded during the 30-40 years and shows three generations of monks. In the film, we see an old-monk, master, who teaches his apprentice such things as differentiating different herbs, pray, discipline and gives him several important advice. I noticed how much does the master mean for a young apprentice, since he tries to repeat all master's actions, for instance, the movement of paddles during the row, he keeps respect and put his master on the highest position. However, during the film as an apprentice became older, he behaves more rudely and shows less respect, which in my opinion represents the development of the character and his personality in the wrong way. The most interesting for me was how the master tries to transfer his wisdom and teaches his protege. In the episode, where the young-monk tortured the frog, fish and snake with the stones, the masters did not say anything, however, in that night he tied the stone to his back to show the feelings and struggles of the animals, which shows the more practical and effective way of upbringing.In the film the minimal use of dialogue, which are always simple and calm. The interaction of young monk and young and ill girl, who came to the monastery to recover, occurs almost without words, but through their eye sights. In these scenes I see the idea that the words are not needed for people to communicate or express their desires, the communication happens more spiritually. The moment, which also shows the spiritual connection between heroes, was a baby, who could not find his mother and directly crawled to the place of her death, as he seemed that she was there. Also, in the film director did not use any names for heroes, which could mean that he tried to direct the meaning to all people showing them in the personages or do not give personal characteristics and equate everyone in a film, that would represent the idea of everyone being equal.The first and the last season in a film is a spring, which I suppose represents the rebirth and the start of the life cycle since in spring nature starts to grow, flowers start to bloom and the lake melts. The lake in a film, in my opinion, is a separate character, which used as the portal from the rest of the world to a monastery. Also, the lake could be a representation of calmness and peace, the monastery itself is located in the center of the lake, which illustrates monastery as a small piece of silence and embodiment. The use of rowboat in a film is used as a transmission tool from one world to another. The distance from the gates to the monastery is an individual way of every character, where they try to find peace, satisfy their desires or made an important discussion. For instance, when the monk wanted to leave the monastery, he aggressively sat in the rowboat, or when he wanted to come back, he also had to sit in the rowboat and make a trip, which in both cases shows the important decision.In the film, the most interesting character is the old monk, who represented as human, but illustrates the inner and divine power, which closer to Gods. For instance, the scene were women tried to escape from the monastery, leaving a baby there, resulting to her stumble over the hole, where old monk died, and his teeth were left. This could be interpreted as the Buddhist doctoring, ""karma"" from the old monk, who after his death had become ""deva"". Another example is seen in the episode, where young monk left the monastery with two policemen and their rowboat did not move until old monk did not wave as a symbol of his approval. Although even old monk in a film has divine power, he is not able to control the world, other people and their actions. In the film, the young monk escapes the monastery, kills his wife, tries to commit suicide and shows aggression, and the old monk is only able to redirect him and teach. This could be an illustration of the separation of people and their beliefs since some of our actions are not influenced or controlled by our religion.In a film, many animals were used as symbols, for instance, a white cat, which in the middle of the film, started to live in a monastery, represents the pureness. At the moment, when the young monk leaves the monastery, the cat sits in the rowboat with him, as a symbol of rectification, and lately, we see the young monk returning to a monastery and starting self-discipline as a new-born man. Another symbol, which appeared constantly in the film is the snake. The snake could be interpreted as a symbol of death in a film since it crawls on the clothes of the monk after his death and appeared just before the death of a woman in cold water. However, in the article ""The Past Lives of Siddhartha Gotama"", the master was saved by the Sea-spirit, who in contrast was a symbol of a saviour.The one thing in a film, which evoked negative emotions was scenes of animals' cruelty and physical violence. At the end of the film, we see the idea of the author, who tries to show that people repeat the mistakes of other people as a life cycle, the little boy uses the stones to kill fish and frog. The similar scene occurred at the beginning of the film and after was shown the dead animals, which were tortured. The physical violence was shown when the monk tried to commit suicide and was punished by his teacher. Also, we see the process of self-immolation of an old monk, which also results in unpleasant emotions.At the end of the film, represented the main idea of the director, where he shows the monk starting to intensively train, suffering in the cold, praying and as a result the scene of his rebirth. The important symbol here is the wheel, which he bounded to his back and carried to the mountain, with a Buddha in his hand, which shows the reincarnation of the protagonist. During the whole film, the monk made many mistakes, suffered and learned many things, however at the end he found his individual and right road. Also, the director tries to show the life cycle and the ideas that people constantly repeat their mistakes, therefore in the last season, the young monk became the master with his protégé, who repeats torture of the animals as he did.In conclusion, the film ""Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter and Spring again"" follows the Buddhist traditions, showing that all people do mistakes, and it is never too late to find your right way, which your master could help you to do. I recommend this film since it has good actors, many great quotes and you can learn something for you from the film. However, some scenes contain violence, therefore it would not be suitable for everybody.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
129,tiraniyaya_son,A capturing,10,18 May 2009,"Visually it was beautiful. The movie is staged in a very scenic location on a small lake in the mountains. It never goes out of it. And I counted only eight characters throughout the movie. There is very little dialog and I am not even sure there were any names mentioned. The film shows four different seasons for different stages of life. There were also different pets for each stage and according to director different emotions. I would like to believe that I had learned something about Buddism by watching this movie. It was very interesting to see how master taught the student throughout his life and the relationship between the two.In the first stage the student is a cruel little boy that tortures animals. His master teaches him compassion. By the second stage the student turns into a nice teenage boy. But the he falls for lust. Master tells him that lust brings desire to possess and that leads to murder. Yeah, right? Student leaves the temple and takes the Buddha statue as if taking a part of the temple with him. But by that moment I already felt that he would come back to become a monk and to continue the circle just like the title implies. In the third stage student comes back. He had murdered his wife in jealousy. He is in anger and pain. Master had warned him but student had to learn the lesson the hard way. Student almost kills himself but master stops him. Now it is time teach the student finding peace. And he does. The student is peacefully taken by the police. Before, it would not be possible to take him away alive. When they take him away the master seems to hold their boat mentally, he does not want to let the boy go maybe knowing that he won't see him again. But master lets the boat go and waves his student goodbye. At that point it seems that the master has achieved the highest level of mental capabilities, being able to telepathically move objects. And then he kills himself. In the fourth stage the student comes back as a man in his middle ages. He starts living in the temple, finds there a manuscript on physical exercises and starts practicing, as if master still teaches him a lesson even after he died. Then a woman with a closed face leaves a small child in the temple. This stage ends with the student monk tying a stone to himself, like he did to the animals he tortured when he was a kid, and climbing a hill. When student monk was punished as a kid for torturing animals, master monk told him that the pain of those animals would stay in his heart for the rest of his life. Who would guess that he would be right? It was like another lesson master was teaching to his student. Maybe by doing this the student monk was finishing with his student life. Now he would need to become a master himself. The final stage of the movie is spring again. A scene very similar to the one in the first stage. A master monk and a small boy, a student monk. The student monk is played by the same actor as in the first stage. There really was no need in bringing another actor for the role. And having the same person perform the role enhances the feeling of the circle. The student monk is teasing the new pet, a turtle. He must be taught. The master monk probably knows what to do. The final lesson he learned from his own master must be how to teach.The path from student monk to master was not straightforward. He left and saw the world outside and he came back. One can only guess that his master might have a worldly experience of his own.The movie might make people think about the stages of their own life and how each stage shaped them.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
130,naskeaton,Simple Beauty,7,19 December 2009,"This is a visually beautiful film, and the first two ""seasons"" are nearly flawless. I was totally charmed by its simplicity, its silence, and its youthful innocence. And while the second half of the movie is by no means a failure, I found myself wishing it would retain that simple, meditative quality. I thought there were, without giving too much away, a few tonal missteps in the fall and winter chapters. I didn't think the investigators should have shown up at the lake for two reasons: One, I loved how we were isolated from the rest of the world in this beautiful, serene atmosphere, and the detectives' costumes really took me out of that world, and secondly, I simply didn't buy that they would allow a murderer to finish the task the master gave him before taking him. There were a few other elements, introduced late in the film, that seemed to be somewhat at the convenience of the screenplay.Though not flawless, Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter...and Spring, is a beautiful film of great originality that hits more than it misses. It's not for all audiences, but if you're up for something different, definitely check this one out.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
131,kozure-okami,a template for how to make a superb film,10,5 February 2006,"Apart from my very powerful emotional response to this film--something I can't imagine would have happened to me quite the same way as a younger person, before I'd had the time to make all the typical human mistakes I've managed to make over the years--I was struck by the clarity of this film. It is like a template for how to make a narrative film properly, leaving in everything that needs to be there with nothing at all extraneous (well, maybe the one freeze-frame of Kim's double-jump kick, which seemed to be there primarily to show off).I think that all films, even those with baroque structures or elaborate plots, could use this film as an example of pure cinema story-telling.This film is also about something. Not since Ray's Pather Panchali have I felt that film was being used for a truly important purpose in story-telling, equivalent to fine literature. It goes to the heart of human experience, beyond culture, social problems, and all the usual ""important"" topics treated in film.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
132,keneda76,Movie for Those Who Love Imagery,9,19 January 2006,"I thoroughly enjoyed Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter, Spring. The team of cinematographer, Dong-hyeon Baek, and director, Ki-duk Kim, use stunning imagery to tell their version of the circle of life. It's much better than the Lion King.The strength of the movie lies in its ability to tell a tale with imagery instead of dialog. If you're one to get antsy in a Kubrick film due to his long drawn out shots, you likely will hate this movie. However, if you have patience and appreciate a director who doesn't seem to think the movie masses suffer from ADD, you'll appreciate the time the director gives you to reflect on the beauty of the story's natural settings.The actors perform well. The characters are a bit typical of the Asian movies many of us Americans had access to growing up: the wise old man, who sees everything and has a bit of a twisted sense of justice; the goofy, horny young boy (through spring and summer, anyway) who often spazzes out and does things that make no sense (like spin in circles in a row boat when horny); and the young girl who's only purpose is as a lust object.Kim takes the characters in a more mature direction than many of the other tales, and does it with a better eye than most. The hut in which the central characters reside is located in the middle of a woody mountain lake. The lake and the surrounding woods play as important characters as the actors. The changes in the lake and the land through the seasons reflect the changes within the boy monk.If you have the patience to meditate on the wondrous imagery of Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter, Spring, check it out. If you like foreign films but can't stand reading the subtitles, check it out (not a lot of dialog in this one). If you want the images in a movie to change every second, go check out the latest Vin Diesel flick.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
133,k-39820,A masterpiece,10,6 January 2019,"Frankly, I think it's a masterpiece, capturing well Buddhist concepts like rebirth and detachment that as a meditator I appreciate. The child monk, who lives in a floating temple with his master, commits bad deeds in spring, when he incapacitates animals with stones tied to their backs. He's later punished by the master who followed him with the same treatment, and told to untie the animals, ""if one of them is ever dead, you'll carry a stone in your heart for the rest of your life."" When he finds that the snake he abused has bumped its head on a stone and died a bloody death, he can't help but shed regretful tears.In summer, he as an adult-a great metaphor here, describing as the changing of four seasons the passage of life-falls in love with a visitor, escaping for her. He eventually kills her for infidelity, and in great distress returns to the temple, disheveled and lost. He continuously plunges the uxoricidal dagger into the wooden ground, and even tries to kill himself using pieces of paper to cover his eyes and month (at least this is what I interpreted, for the master later did the same, plus setting himself on fire, to end his life)When the master finds out, he furiously spanks and ties him up, crying, ""young fool!"" Although here I couldn't really understand his actions; he seems equanimous about life, cultivated by decades of meditation, then why's he so angry, which is driven by attachment, about the young monk's suicide? If he wants to help him out of the current suffering out of compassion, then why use anger like an unmindful, unempathetic parent? But anyway, though I disagree on the approach, the monk gradually stops such self-destructive acts.The master writes calligraphy on the floor and orders the monk to carve the wealth of Han characters one by one. This seems one of the many Buddhist ways to cultivate calm and patience, like the unexplainable riddle. While he's on it, two investigators come to bring him to justice, but are persuaded by the master to wait till he finishes. Their compliance is remarkable to me; if they were ignorant or dismissive of Buddhist traditions, they very probably will throw his request to the wind. But they choose not to, and even join the master in painting the carvings while the monk is fast asleep. When the morrow comes and he wakes up, he is arrested and taken away, but the officers, moved by the equanimous atmosphere and his seeming repentance, spare him the handcuffs.After waving them goodbye, the master, as mentioned above, gets on the boat, covering his eyes and month with paper, and lights himself ablaze. He has gotten a life of spiritual experience to see through life's attachment and suffering, to see life as just is, and he accepts death with the same equanimity and peace. Buddhists have done this, as well as other peaceful resistances, to American invasion in Vietnam and Chinese oppression in Tibet. What brave and poignant people.In winter, after serving time in jail, the monk, tested by time and experience, returns again to an icy world. He finds out the boat and the master's death. He stands on the frozen lake, shirtless, doing tai chi (even I feel cold for him...). Later a woman with her head completely covered makes a visit, carrying a wailing infant; she prays in front of the Buddha and cries, and later drowns in a crack in the lake. I'm not sure if this is the monk's lover, who probably covered her scars inflicted by his weapon, but I can't think of another explanation.But anyway, the sight of her seems to awaken in him a sense of atonement. He carries a large stone, just as he did to the animals as a child, and starts a long, difficult mountain journey. When he reaches the summit, he puts a statue of Buddha there, which faces the lake and the temple, depths below. Although Buddha isn't a god-a major difference between Buddhism and other main religions-Let's hope he will oversee and protect this sanctuary.In next spring, another child monk appears, with the same pranks on animals. Life is a reincarnating circle.A top review on Douban Movies, the Chinese IMDb, calls this movie ""trying too hard to send a message, thus appearing pretentious and corny."" I know well that people can have polarized views on the same movie, but I must say I don't understand this evaluation at all. Does what the master says when the monk wants to go with the visitor, ""lust leads to possession, and that leads to murder"" sound cliched to many? Of course you aren't necessarily going to murder simply because you want to ""have"" someone, but I believe ""murder"" is a metaphor for attachment, desire and therefore suffering, and this is a simple truth. Buddhism doesn't denounce desire as some kind of sin, it just promotes awareness and moderation; when you're aware of these things, it's hard to be controlled by them.In conclusion, this is a fine movie. Probably plainer than hardcore spiritual movies like The Holy Mountain, but plainness doesn't negate profundity.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
134,dinarayessimova,Mystical Dharma and the Cyclicality,10,4 February 2018,"The movie ""Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"" directed by a vanguard Korean director Kim Ki Duk is a pure illustration and the reading of the Buddhist dharma, core Buddhist teachings. The work can be torn apart into separate pieces of symbolism, yet seen as a complete cyclic work of art. Through the cyclicality of the nature and the life of one person the director could interpret basic Buddhist concept in a lens of cultural Korean Buddhism and the mystical premises which should not be taken presisely. Unlike Weerasethakul's ""Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives"" the cyclicality as an essential part of the Buddhist dharma has been shown from a slightly different perspective. The driving force for samsara has not only been the deed of one person, as we have partially observed from Uncle Boonmee, Kim Ki Duk illustrated cyclicality in all aspects of the world: from the rotation of day and night, change in seasons to the evolution of human emotions and senses to the change in generations. Even the title of the movie cyclical, as the Buddhist teachings suggest that time is not linear rather cyclical. Here the viewer comes back to the point zero at the end of the movie as well. It has been illustrated not only through the return to the spring season, which can be seen as the point of rebirth: we see the monk with the little boy both in the beginning and in the end. Other seasons can also be seen as other processes of this cycle: summer is birth, fall is life and winter is death. They can be in different levels at the same time: the development of nature, life of the old monk and life of a little boy. Even though the movie represents the small sangha, the monastic community, everything depicted by the director should not be taken literary, because it involves mystery, which is not explained by the movie. For example, even small details of the monastic life have not been shown and can raise some question: for example, the sources of food they have used to live. Another controversial moment in the movie is the one when the little boy has arrived on another shore and played with fish, frog and snake (which has been shown for the didactic reasons, as the viewer gets to see later), the old monk has also somehow arrived at that side of the shore, possibly just walking on the water. Leaving this questions without the answer, the director almost points out on the fact that even though the representation of the Buddhist livelihood seems more or less accurate, it should not be taken without a doubt. Despite this, Kim Ki Duk masterfully showed 3 Jewels on Buddhism: the Buddha, who has been depicted several times throughout the movie, Sangha, monastic community, and the Dharma, Buddhist core teachings. Even the Dukha, the suffering, which is the main driving force of Samsara, has been shown not only through different types and degrees of physical pain, but also through the moral dissatisfaction and psychological suffering: ""Didn't you know beforehand how the world of men is? Sometimes we have to let go of the things we like. What you like, others will also like,"" - as the old monk commented after the younger one's return to the temple.Even though the movie includes a lot of controversial moments, it could masterly introduce to the viewer core concepts and teaching of Buddhist community, however, the viewer should take responsibility to filter and polish the information.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
135,malikanazarbayevuniversity,Movie Review,10,27 January 2019,"Kim Ki-duk's film named ""Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"" depicts Buddhist society's concept of a cycle of life, death, and reborn. The film shows a connection between the cyclical pattern of humans lives and nature's four seasons of the year. The main character is a monk who lives together with his master in a Buddhist monastery surrounded by a lake and lofty mountains. Moving along the path of life, the monk goes through different stages of development of his personality, consciousness, and soul. This movie review will examine an analogy between the spiritual and physical development of human and seasonal changes of nature.
In the spring, nature is waking up, spring buds are blossoming and blooming. So, a child, whose soul is pure, is getting acquainted with an environment through contact with nature. His first contact with nature was when he touched poisonous snake without any thoughts that this snake could bite him. This moment shows that the child did not know about any danger, with which he faced. However, a child has no understanding of the surrounding world, he is in need of a master, who knows about life and who can teach this child the right way to live. In the film, the child did not distinguish between herbs and poisonous plants. However, at that moment the master shed light on this difference between good and bad things. The second time the child tied small stones on amphibians while not thinking about bad consequences due to his deeds. So, only when the master tied a stone on child's back and asked to see what happened with those amphibians, only at that moment, when child witnessed the death of snake and small fish, he realized that he did bad deeds toward nature. The child realized that heavy stone on his back is nothing in comparison with a weight upon his heart.
Summer is a wonderful time when the weather is hot, the sun is shining, sunny days and short warm nights create an incredible atmosphere of peace and happiness. For humans, this is the time of a blossom of life. The child becomes an adolescent with his own dreams, wishes, and values. Peculiar to this period of life, he is in captivity of his desires (passion), therefore, when he meets with a girl for the first time, his desires for pleasures take over him, meaning that he and she both had chosen a wrong way. In the film, this is depicted in the cadre when in the monastery the girl seats on the sacred statue of a lion, and the young monk let her seat there, even if the master would see such deed, he would have severely punished him. Furthermore, in the film, master holds a cock in his hands, when he finds a young monk with a girl lying in the boat. This moment shows that young monk's such deeds are symbolized by a cock, which is also represented in the wheel of life (Bhavacakra) as a symbol of passion, which turns the wheel of samsara. Despite of admonitions of his master, he escapes from monastery with this girl to a new environment.
Fall is the time of harvest. In the fall period, a person also reaps the fruits of his deeds. At one time, the teacher warned his pupil that ""lust leads to a desire for possession, and possession leads to murder"", but he did not listen to him and was self-indulgent to his desires. Therefore, a monk, after murdering of his wife due to his feelings, avoiding from justice, runs back to the monastery to his spiritual master in search for shelter. However, he wanted to commit suicide, but the master again guides him in the path of righteousness through purifying his karma by humility, patience and praying. So, human in the fall of his life receives the results of his deeds, which are not always positive. So, when human sees his bad result, he did not accept it, trying to avoid punishment. However, at this moment, the right way will be clearing karma and accepting inevitable punishment.
Winter in a person's life is the awareness and analysis of past mistakes, their acceptance, and spiritual enlightenment. After serving the term, the monk returns to the monastery with a calm spirit. He already understood that his teacher passed away. The monk collected the dust of his teacher and wrapped them in a piece of red material, which he then put in place of the third eye in the Buddha's statue, which was painstakingly cut from the ice by him. Throughout his life, the teacher was a wise man for him; he saw what the monk could not see as he was blinded by earthly life, rather than a spiritual one. After this, he remembers and returns to childhood, to the beginning of his life, when a woman came with her newborn son to the monastery. Her face was covered with a material, probably meaning that she felt her guilt that she leaves her child there. At this moment, the monk realized that he was also abandoned by his mother in childhood. This cadre may mean that he returned to the beginning of his life, that all life is a cycle. The end is another beginning.
In conclusion, I recommend watching this film to familiarize yourself with one of the basic concepts of Buddhism, such as the cycle of life. In this film, there were many hidden Buddhist symbols, which are closely related to the life of the main character. This film makes you think and reflect on the actions committed by a person at different stages of life.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
136,wigowsky,The Diamond Sutra (or the Prajnaparamita Sutra),10,24 September 2006,"After watching the movie a second time, I was determined to find out what the Old Monk had drawn on the deck of the hermitage. The only clue I had was the scene's subtitle: ""Prajnaparamita Sutra  it helps restore inner peace."" Those were the words the Old Monk used to describe the sacred teachings that the Young Monk had to carve out as penance for his crime of passion. When I looked up the Prajnaparamita Sutra on the internet, I found out it was known as the Diamond Sutra of the Buddha. The Buddha spoke the wise words in a monastery near Sravasti, saying that ""this sutra should be called the Diamond that cuts through illusion because it has the capacity to cut through illusions and afflictions and bring us to the shore of liberation."" There are 32 sutras or sections, and the 32 sections are also ""marks"" that are used to meditate on ""the Tathagata""  which means ""the suchness of all things (dharmas)."" The meaning of Tathagata is ""does not come from anywhere and does not go anywhere."" The insight into the truth of the sutras consists in a realization that ""the idea of a self is not an idea, and the ideas of a person, a living being, and a life span are not ideas either."" A self-realized or awakened ""Buddha"" is called a Buddha because he/she is free of ideas.The ""Buddha"" in the Diamond Sutra is also called the World-Honored One, and his message can be summarized by two axioms: (1) ""Someone who looks for me in form or seeks me in sound is on a mistaken path and cannot see the Tathagata."" (2) ""All composed things are like a dream, a phantom, a drop of dew, a flash of lightning. That is how to meditate on them, that is how to observe them."" Now I will have to watch the movie a third time and meditate on the 32 marks that the Old Monk draws with the cat's tail on the floor of the ashram. I will also feel the urge to count and see if there are really 32 marks.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
137,symbatbayakhmetova,"Almost silent, but with many frames with deep meaning",7,9 September 2020,"The film ""Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter and ... Spring"" of South Korean director Kim Ki Duk, which is almost silent, but with many frames with deep meaning, gave me high impression, and also left with several questions. Actually, in my opinion, it did not give right answer to particular questions, and allowed the viewers to decide themselves. All of the actions of the film were in the isolated area and temple in the center of lake. The years - entire life of two, old and young monks was shown as change of seasons. During the film, many Buddhism traditions were shown, but, at first sight, mostly it focused on human character: the whole life of a young boy, from ignorant, innocent to passionate, and redemption of his sins and retreats. Then if you pay more attention to every frame, you will notice many hidden messages, wisdoms of Buddhism. This film is more like a parable movie, which are always mean to words, acting characters and change of locations.Spring: The film starts by opening of doors to the world of monks, whose life is slow, calm, every day is like another, but there is no any fencing, so the doors are more like just a symbol of that it is a different world. The next scene showed one of the rules of monks' life - praying to statue of Buddha every morning, wooden rosary on a book, bowl with goldfish. There is nothing else inside the temple, monks do not use anything that every person do. They pray, clean the temple, sail to shore in order to collect medicinal herbs, it is their daily routines. As in usual parables, the older monk who sees the boy who ties a stone to little fish, frog and snake, do the same thing with him and command to find all of the animals and release. Here we can listen to the first wisdom: ""If one of them dies, you will carry the stone in your heart till the end of you days"". And truly, after fish and snake die, boy cries hardly, and after many years he still remembers it and again go to the top of the mountain with a big stone tied on his back. These scenes illustrate how Buddhist monks care about every living creature in the planet.
Summer: All the same, nothing seems to have changed, but there is no a young white puppy playing with boy. As I mentioned earlier, film contains lots of symbols: that animals, painting on the temple, boat, people. Young monk notices two intertwining snakes, and you can understand what this summer would be about. He couldn't control his passion, when a young woman comes to their isolated temple to find healing to her soul. And older monk, after the woman got well said her to leave the temple, since ""Lust makes the desire to possess, and possess makes the desire to kill"". He continues writing that words to the stone by water, but burning passion of the young monk make him follow her, even though she did not call him.
Fall. ""What we like, may be liked by others too"". Already adult monk returns after killing his wife to the old, peaceful place. He closes his ears, eyes, mouth in order to not to hear, see, say bad thing and words, but he could not fence off his inner emotions, older monk beat him with a stick and tied up for some time. Also, he forced to cut the hieroglyphs of the sutra, which returns peace of mind with a knife. And the adult monk goes back to serve a sentence with gained peace. After that, there was a scene that terrified me: Old monk closed his ears, eyes, mouth, prepared wood and fired himself on a boat. I guess he felt that there was little life left and he didn't want to stay unburned if he died. Mahayana Buddhists believe in reincarnation, so he did not suffer much about dying. Moreover, I want to mention the white cat with the tail of which old monk draw the hieroglyphs. Buddhists believe that when Buddha died all animals except the cat came to mourn, so they perceived the cat as a negative animal. However, they anyway believe that cats as humans can achieve enlightenment. So, here maybe they meant that a man who did a crime, also can redeem.
Winter. Adult monk comes back again after jail, put on his teachers' clothes, pray, tried to atone mistakes. One day a woman with a baby comes and leaves the baby in a temple. And it was an approaching to the beginning of another Spring.In conclusion, the film was really fascinating, even though there were no many dialogues, actions. Every situation was explained by the parable, wisdom of the old monk and the life was shown as a cycle that never stops, just humans change, the law of samsara, that is a central concept in Buddhism. After analyzing specific details of the film, I can say that it showed effectively the sense of the religion.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
138,tokishevad,A calm paradise for world understanding.,8,6 September 2020,"This film is not only a work of art that cinematographically depicted the circle of life, but also a great visual representation of Buddhists' philosophy and world perception. This work depicted significant details of the Mahayana Buddhism and gradually opened them up to the viewer, so he would feel no conflict between it and his own religion. Showing the peaceful and isolated life, without any effect from the surrounded world, helped to illustrate an ideal environment for the Buddhism practice. However, the world is not perfect, and everyone meets obstacles on their way to nirvana, it is the fight that we had to meet.
The film covers four seasons from the life of the monk-boy, who started his life path at the isolated floating temple with his teacher. As seasons change, the boy is changed too. Each of these seasons shows us a new test for the boy's faith.
It all starts with the main Buddhist's lesson. You should care about others, help them and don't harm other live beings. However, the teacher not only thoughts boy a lesson, but also introduce him to the main path to the Buddhism goal, nirvana. One of the Noble Truths says that life is full of sufferings, and the only way to get rid of them is to achieve nirvana. As it is common to that region (Korea), to believe that you make your path easier by helping others. This principle was directly shown as a metaphor with the rock, tied to his back. The boy had to carry his burden while releasing others from it, to be released from it afterwards. Director also made an interesting decision by showing us this scene one more time at the very end of the movie, when the same season came. This time the boy was fully grown up, and now he was a teacher who had to teach a lesson. This time, he made his path heavier by himself, but it brought him peace when he reached his destination. His path to the top of the mountain that finished the film was a direct visual representation of monks who have all these limitations and sufferings on their way to nirvana, having only faith in their hands. This all shows us other very important concepts of Buddhism that is the main theme of this film. Director made a great job illustrating these concepts and hidden truths.
Life is cyclical. It doesn't matter which roles we play, the universe will come to its balance. We can say that everything surrounding us isn't existing, but it has its order, so we can switch our roles to attain it. This story had so many new elements and people, who affected the boy's life that took his of, and brought him back, but we saw the same picture at the end, as we saw at the beginning. The old monk and a boy at the isolated, floating temple. Nothing changed. Everything is still the same. This also brings the feeling of the Daoism influence on Buddhism, that was common in China and Korea, as it shows the life cycle, but also the harmony of nature and universe. Moreover, it shows a very important concept of Mahayana Buddhism. It mostly relates to Buddha, but here it is also applicable to the whole picture. ""There were before him, and always will be after."" The life is cyclical and even is the old teacher died, the new season came and there are already a new teacher and his student in this temple.
The other very important thing that touched the plot of the film and acted as a turning point was a moment when he wrote the rules in front of the temple. It wasn't said what exactly did he wrote, but I can assume that those were 4 Noble Truths. The Buddha's teaching says that our mind projects the reality around us. And when the boy's mind was out of place, he left the temple and got himself in a lot of troubles. So repeating the truth's made him re-value himself and calm his mind. As it was said, ""to overcome sufferings, you should overcome cravings"". So the boy finally got in peace with his mind and makes his last return to the temple. This little element contains lots of elements of original Buddhism and an outside view from their guests.
This film also shows lots of small elements of the Buddhist monks that seems to be perfectly integrated into the picture, so the viewer doesn't even notice the unusual nature of some of them. For example, we can see that monks don't have an excess of clothing or belongings. The boy always leaves the temple without anything, except things that he needs for his faith duties, and he always returns without anything. This is a simple life that all monks have.
Another thing is celibate, that he breaks because of his immaturity. This is also a main aspect of the Buddhist monks life. It was a controversial topic in Korea and China, as it wasn't natural for their society, but is one of the main aspects of the religion, that is why it also plays one of the turning points in the film. Martial arts also a very interesting addition to the monk's routine. This element is known only in Mahayana Buddhism as they had to implement this aspect to their lives in order to protect themselves.
To conclude, This is a very interesting film that covers lots of details of Mahayana Buddhism in Korea and perfectly shows the world in which such people live and their perception of time and life. The beautiful scenes paired with beautiful music. It is certainly worth watching.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
139,adilzhanmustafin,Buddhist truths that are clear to everyone,9,7 February 2021,"""Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter, and ... Spring"" is a movie that not only touches the soul of everyone who watches it by telling a very personal story of a young monk who learns how to live right through numerous mistakes, but also, it is a movie that can change one's perception of life. What is happening in the movie is closely related to the philosophy of Buddhism; we see how Buddhism suggests a better way of living through self-discipline. Moreover, the movie has many metaphors and signs that lead to some of the Buddhist notions and concepts such as samsara, karma and nirvana. What is also important, these conceptions seamlessly infused into the subject of the picture as they do not overload the movie. Eventually, the audience of the movie can enjoy an interesting story of life of a main character and can take a brief lesson of Buddhist philosophy of life at the same time. Even though ""Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter, and ... Spring"" might not be considered as the best movie of all time which stands out for an outstanding dramatic performance of actors, it is still the movie about life which conveys a strong message to the viewers - life goes as the seasons and nothing is permanent - which is worth watching it repetitively to learn more and more every time.
This movie presents the story of a Buddhist monk, who is living with his older teacher in an isolated floating hut in the middle of the lake, and who experiences drastic changes in life as seasons of the year change. Kim Ki-duk, the director of the movie, does not give specific background information about characters; we do not know their names and how the older monk met a younger one. Things in the movie go smoothly. The audio accompaniment is matched perfectly to the scenes and makes the viewer watch without stopping for a second. Along with the soundtrack, the visual image and fascinating scenes of nature fit the mood of the narration and sometimes even make you get goosebumps. We observe a restful life of two monks at the beginning: they pray, go for collecting herbs on the land nearby, and a boy spends much of his time wandering around and exploring nature. Simply put, monks are almost isolated from the civilization and they just do their daily activities. But, as seasons change and the boy grows, he makes mistakes that will eventually affect his future life. One day he decides to escape from the hut to follow a girl he fell in love with as a result of failing to resist desires and ultimately commits a murder out of lust and then experiences sorrow. Ultimately, the master liberates himself from any attachments to the world by commiting a suicide and his student replaces him after a while.
The central argument of the movie is that our actions shape our future, i.e. every action entails some outcome, good or bad, depending on the nature of the action. What is also equally important is that the movie shows us that life is cyclical: the main character, who used to be an apprentice for his master, replaces his master and becomes a teacher to an abandoned child himself.
Coming to the main part, it is essential to discuss Buddhist notions that were established by the author in the script of the movie. First of all, four seasons replace each other by order can be viewed as four important chapters of the life of the main character and four stages of life as well. Important to note that much of the things bind around the concept of seasons. The first lesson that young boy learns from his master comes in Spring when someday he tied little animals with stones on a string and tormented them: the master did the same to the boy. ""Carry the stone in your heart for whole"" - was the first lesson, which reminds the concept of karma which states that one will eventually pay off for the thing he did, so it makes him understand the damage he did to others by experiencing it himself. It might seem that the master symbolizes the God who is watching everyone given that the movie is filled with magic, for instance, how did the master get on the land if the boy used the single boat they had. The same magic happens towards the end of the film when police workers take away the main character for a detention and the boat magically returns back.
So, the idea of karma is explicit in the movie, but there is anything else of cyclical nature too; it is samsara, i.e. cycle of death and rebirth. One can escape this eternal cycle if he achieves nirvana. In the movie, as the second spring comes, we see that this cycle is launched again and a new little boy is a reincarnation of the main character, but also he makes the same mistakes, i.e. torments the animals. In that vein, the main character becomes the reincarnation of his elder master. Along with the concepts of samsara and karma, there is also an implicit mention of the Four Noble Truths of Buddhism. The first one, duhkha means that life is full of sufferings, which we can see from the story of the main character who murdered his loved one because he went after cravings. Here comes the second truth which declares that cravings are the causes of sufferings (trishna). ""Love awakens the desire to possess. And that awakens the intent to murder,"" says the master and it turned out to be true. But, in the end our hero learned the third truth - win over cravings leads to the win over sufferings. Ultimately, the fourth truth is to follow the Eightfold noble path, on which our hero steps at the end of the movie. Additionally, one little detail about the film which can imply the concept of ""non-self"" in Buddhism is that none of the characters in the film has a name.
To conclude, this film can be understood not only by Buddhists, but by all the people around the world. Even though there are many religions around the world, we can learn new things from any of them, and from Buddhism especially through this magnificent film. ""Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter, and ... Spring"" film is definitely full of beautiful life lessons that could help people orient in life, but I cannot say that I can ever reach nirvana by overcoming all my cravings. However, the film gives an explicit explanation for why we experience so many sufferings and it shows that life is cyclical in nature and nothing is permanent, which is one of the main principles in Buddhism. I really liked the film and would definitely recommend it to others.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"

Spring,Summer, Autumn, winter..and spring is a story of one life and many, in his simplicity, nonsense, brutality and sentimentality, categories of feelings, that move us away and sometimes closer to the animals and nature's world. There is a deep austerity and spiritualism throughout the film, so you learn from the beginning to respect the rules of the story, that is to accept to know and believe just on what you see, nothing more is strictly important. The rhythm follows the slow rituals of Buddhism, in its everyday's experiences of difficulties, prices, and of course lessons. the strong symbolism with animals involved the pleasure to discover the secret of a second plot in the story. The director Ki Duk Kim, who plays the ""winter"" protagonist, builds up an optic masterpiece that reminds me a lot on Greenaway,to watch in religious silence in the dark.but he uses also interesting narrative instruments; like Jarmush, quietness, silence of pure mute images and the art of repeating, are more than enough to explain a story of an infinite spiral. it's a movie that let you the time to think about the banal tragedy that is our life seen from outside, from a forgotten world, which is depict by a delightful photography. I get more and more impressed of such a simple movies, that can express nearly everything in two hours, just developing a clear idea, simple in its geniality, from which you can not easily separate, even when the light are finally on. a movie to reflect, which stand to cinema, like Kundera's ""The Unbearable Lightness of Being"" stand to literature. vote:9 Stefano","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"

Its the only korean movie I have ever rated under 6/10 and I am a tough public. This movie took 2 hours to tell a story that could have been told in 10 minutes in Youtube video. It tried so hard to be artsy, it tried so hard to give symbolism, it tried so hard to give a morale that it failed completely to be a movie. I have no idea why this is rated so highly. This is the story of a kid that wasnt raised right, does stupid things and learn not to do bad things, only he does it 10 times slower than the average human being.

All life is suffering (the animals tied to the rock; plus the boy tied to the rock);2. Suffering is caused by desire (his desire for the girl, and when she leaves his anguish over this);3. End the desire, end the suffering (his return to the lake, and his purging of his desire via the carving on the deck);4. End the desire by following the 8-fold path of Buddhism (his return, after prison, to the lake, and his return to meditation, exercise, and his ""release"" of the weight of suffering from him by carrying the weight to the mountain and placing a Buddha statue on top of it).By the way, as for the snake... in Buddhism, it was a snake that shielded Buddha from harm.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"

The female characters are not the most positive roles, representing corruption and temptation, tho also providing the means for renewal.There are some memorable scenes not least the house in winter and the knife writing scene, this is not for those seeking martial arts action,personally i found it slipped into one of favourite films list.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"

The third time, a friend and I sat in silence in her room for an hour after the movie was over. This film is that profound, touching, and moving.Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter...Spring is the most beautiful movie I have ever seen. Visually it is fantastic, though several films surpass it in this aspect. However, the film manages to speak directly to the soul (or...failing to believe in the soul...something deep inside anyone watching it), and this is where it's beauty lies. Parts are so affecting that a painful nostalgia for a place you never knew overwhelms you.I am sorry I cannot be more helpful...the quality that makes this movie so wonderful is well beyond words for me.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"

147,bibizhamalamangeldi,Meaningful movie,10,9 September 2018,"South Korean movie by Ki Duk Kim ""Spring,summer,fall winter...spring"" illustrates Buddhist monk's changing life through the change of different seasons. To begin with, I would like to tell that this film is fascinating both in terms of its complicated and interestingly developing scenario , as well as director' deep esthetic sense and ability to show meanings and values through symbols. Starting from his early stage of life as a monk together with his master in spring, becoming an adolescent at summer and facing with the natural desire and lust to young girl, moving to the cold and dark nature of autumn, coming back to his origins, in the next spring, which represents new beginnings and reborn, he becomes a master and teaches a young child to the values and principles of Buddha. Even this kind of division of the entire film into parts and assigning young monk's stage of life to the seasons shows a fluctuating ups and downs of one' life as even the weather and seasons also have its own features that people usually associate them.In addition to that, the film delivers Buddhist value not to torture living things in a meaningful and exciting way. As an example, when the young monk ties up a small fish, a frog and a snake to stones and gets excited by watching how they struggle to walk and swim, the master does not tell anything despite watching him and what he was doing to these living creatures. Instead, he chooses more educative and more effective measure, the master ties a big stone to the back of the monk while he was sleeping. The next day young monk finds it difficult to walk and could not it untie. When he asks for his master to help him, he replies to unite those living creatures and if one of them dies, the stone would left in his heart. So, this kind of delivery of the religious belief and principles is very impressive and for the viewers who do not have any ideas about Buddhism will help to understand it, though it is hard to say that every master, guru teaches their monk in this way. So, it is on the other hand controversial in terms if showing it in more positive way.Even though the film depicts a Buddhist religious principle, I think it is more about the human nature and its change over time through the influence of surroundings. Because, not applying it to Buddhist religion, anyone in his life encounters different stages, where in some of them he/she can be ""successful"", while in others ""less successful"", do some wrong things. The important thing is to find yourself, even though you were deceived by some temporary feelings and desires and to be able t go back to your origins. In this case, we are watching the life of a monk, the one who is supposed to be away from sins and be ""pure"", but we are also witnessing his darker side, when he left his master, going after the girl and eventually killing her, because of being jealous. After, he returns to the master and the master without judging him help to get away from anger that he accumulated toward the girl he loved. From here, we can see a master who found the balance and harmony inside him. This energy is even transmitted to the cops who came after the young monk. In addition to that, it is important to note that when the young monk left his master, he takes with jim a statue of Buddha, which represents that whenever he i or whatever he does, the belief inside him and the knowledge he took over the years are with him, and this inside knowledge and belief returned him to the master and helped to find harmony and change for the better. Because, in the next spring he becomes a master, as if he is reborned in terms of his principles and lifestyle.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
148,akezh-13280,Review from Akezhan Khassenov 201558617,10,9 September 2018,"The Korean film ""Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"" represents a story of live of Buddhist monk and his apprentice throughout four seasons of the year. In my opinion, the main ideas of this film are the cyclical nature of live and the choice of your own path, which are deeply connected to each other. In this review, I will try to justify my opinion. 
First evidence to the idea of cyclicity can be noticed even in the name of the film. The name of the film represents the endless cycle of changes of seasons of the year. Summer comes after spring, fall after summer, winter after fall and again spring and so on. These seasons are shown as the main stages on which the storyline of the film. In each of these cycles, we see the episodes of the old monk and his student's lives. However, the seasons do not go immediately after another: as we see from the context, the time gap between the seasons appearing on the screen is about several years. I suppose, by this director wanted to show again the idea that the time does not matter: seasons was, are, and will go in the same order. 
The plot of the film shows second evidence for the cyclicity. In spring, we see old monk and his apprentice on the floating monastery, in summer the student grows up into teenager, in fall he becomes an adult man and monk finishes his 'mortal path' (dies), in winter the student himself becomes a monk and adopts the abandoned boy. Finally, in new spring, the monk becomes a master for a new student - the cycle has finished and started over again. There is also one very interesting scene, which clearly shows the cyclical nature of live that director tried to show us. In the first spring, little apprentice plays in the rocky pond near the forest. There, not from the evil thoughts, but maybe from childish naivety, he torments fish, frog and snake by tying them to the rocks and laughs watching them struggle to escape. Almost the same scene we can see in the new spring, where the new apprentice, in literally the same place torments the fish, frog and snake by forcing them to eat the stones. I think that these scenes perfectly show the overall cyclical essence of life that the author tried to convey to us. 
The second main idea that I think that film tried to show is the idea of choosing your own path. As it was mentioned before, in the scene of first spring, apprentice tormented helpless animals, however his mentor does not interfere and silently watches from behind. Then, to teach his student, monk ties a rock to the back of his student while he is sleeping. When the student awakes teacher tells him that he will untie the rock after the student unties the animals he tormented, to learn about harm to other creatures. He also says, that if any of those animals died, the student will ""carry the stone in his heart forever"" meaning the sin he committed. Student unties animals and finds out that snake and fish had died, student understands his fault and cries, which suggests that he had never committed such act again. Then, in summer student falls in love with a girl who was brought to the temple to be cured from illness. Failing to fight his lust with intensive praying, student chooses to follow his beloved and leaves the temple. Master understands everything, but doesn't stop his student, just warns him that lust can lead to murder. In fall, the master's warning becomes true, and student comes back to continue study. Master doesn't criticize him and doesn't allow his student to commit suicide. Instead, he tasks him to carve the sutra to restore inner peace, which also restores peace in detectives that came to arrest his student. After the departure of detectives with the student, master commits ritual suicide. In winter student comes from prison back to the temple, decides to carve an ice statue of Buddha with the remains of his teacher, and makes a choice to continue the studding through exercises. Then a woman comes to the temple, leaving her child to be the monk's new apprentice. New monk, possibly understanding that the cycle is repeating, decides to put a statue of Buddha on the top of the near mountain on the rock wheel, which represents his sins and possibly the Samsara wheel. We don't know, was the story of old monk the same the new monk's, did the new monk made his decisions with his own will or it was a destiny. However, I suppose he put this statue as a symbol, because the Buddha was the One who escaped this cycle, for his apprentice not to repeat his master's mistakes and to make decisions that will bring him on his own path, rather than repeating the cycle again. 
To conclude, this film showed two main ideas, first - idea of cyclical nature of live shown by stages of seasons of the year and repeating stories of old and new monks. Second - that there is a possible way out of this endless cycle, shown by the special decision of the new monk to put a statue of Buddha to symbolize that the way out of the cycle exists.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
149,tulenovagulnaz,Film Review by Gulnaz Tulenova,9,9 February 2020,"""Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter ... and Spring"" is a South Korean movie about a Buddhist monk's life, which takes place in the monastery that was located in the middle of a forest. As its title says, the film is divided into five seasons of the year and five moments of monk's life. At the same time these five seasons of the monk's life could be associated with evolution of his life and transformation of his character. Below, I will discuss more about how each season is connected with his transformation of character as a young monk and about the distinctive features of the film.Each time period of a monk's life has its own explanation in each season of the year. The life of a little boy who later becomes a monk starts from the ""Spring"" season. In this period of the year, he is shown as a thriving little boy who is an apprentice of an adult monk. Even in this period, he is shown as a sinful person who is harming nature. However, he gets a lesson from his master about the relationship he should have towards the environment and about respecting the living force of nature. In the next season, ""Summer"" he discovers love and human affection. He falls in love with a girl who came to the monastery for a temporary period of time. He also discovers the danger of love at this period of his life.
Nevertheless, in the following season ""Fall"" we see that he did not get lesson from the sinful actions he has done previously and continues doing them. In ""Fall"" he needs to take responsibility for all his evil acts. This period of his life is depicted as the culmination of his life. He returns to the monastery that he left for the pursuit of affection in ""Summer,"" however, he will leave the monastery to get the lesson for his committed crime and sinful actions to the jail. Then in ""Winter"" he returns to the monastery but as a different person inside. As winter is the coldest period of the year, thus his transformation will coincide with the transformation of nature. He has to overcome all the obstacles and challenges of body and mind. This season is the time when he truly becomes a monk since, as its sign, there will appear a woman with his baby who then intended to leave his child to the monk. In the ""... and Spring"" period, we see that the baby left to the monk has grown up and is living his audacious life as his master monk did many years ago.These five seasons, besides explaining the life evolution of monk, also implies about another point- life is a cycle. The fact that the new master is living in the monastery and now he has his apprentice. In a broader sense, it can also imply that everyone on this Earth will continue to experience the challenges. Only after some time when one is ready and honed enough to escape the samsara will voluntarily become the monk. A young-monk when he was living in the monastery and could smoothly without leaving the monastery became the monk. However, he had to escape the monastery and after experiencing many life situations and doing wrong and good karma( it is not shown in the film about his life outside of the monastery, but most probably he has gone through many karmas). After all, to escape the samsara he returned to the monastery and became the monk to attain the nirvana. This was the period when he was ready to become the monk and accept the monastic life.Moreover, if we observe, it was clearly shown from the lifespan of the monk how he has gone through from all four noble truths. Also, all the four fundamental ideas of Buddhism are demonstrated even without putting on emphasis. It is the way how director tactfully presents the ideology of Buddhism. The other distinctive features of the film that need to be discussed are the visual approach, delivery of the movie where more emphasis is put on imagery. Moreover, the location of the shooting and performance of the actors contribute to the harmonious articulation of the film. The animals that were always accompanying the monk throughout his life are another distinctive feature of the film. There is no doubt that these animals have special meanings and facilitate the explanation of each season of the monk. Further investigation could be done to explore the meaning of each depicted animal in the film, according to Buddhism and Eastern countries Culture.
From my point of view, this film skillfully illustrates the Buddhist philosophy and life cycle of human beings according to the Buddhist religion. Keeping in mind the delivery of the film, which was not much dialogue and narrative, instead, focus on nature and the environment again reveal the Buddhist philosophy aesthetically and distinctively not as just religion but as the lifestyle.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"

154,almirabiss,"It's difficult to handle the fatal mistakes of the past, but the movie teaches us...",7,9 February 2020,"Almira Biss****
The name of the movie ""Spring, Summer, Autumn, and... Spring"" defines one of the key ideas embodied in the plot of the work. The recurrence of life being the main idea of the movie, connects other concepts engaged in Buddhism, such as reincarnation, Samsara, and Dharma. Although these ideas were not clearly stated through verbal way, it can be seen that the scenes definitely convey the audience the feelings of characters by their actions and surroundings. The very first scene (5:10) of the picture painted on the Master's boat gives us the basic thought about the correspondence between the phenomenon of recurrence and the name of the film. The picture on the boat depicted a giant man, carrying a lotus, which in its turn carried a little man praying inside of it. The implied meaning of the scene which accidentally can be noticed by the attentive ones, draws the attention to the same idea and highlights it. This work was intended to demonstrate the existential thought of cyclicality by focusing its audience on the changes of seasons, birth and death, mistakes and redemption.
The story of a Master and his student is central in tangling these ideas, thereby revealing us the tenets of Buddhism.Throughout the seasonal and spiritual changes the background remain fixed. A deep valley with a peaceful lake and the floating temple. The exotic forest isolating a Master from idleness of the outer world..., Although remaining the same, the location transforms as a new season comes, which symbolizes another shift in personal vision of the main character. As the time flies, each season epitomize same person with different views, which we can attribute to the particular season. In the first scenes it is the spring. The time of renewal and growth, the time of innocence. The nature is young and childish, and so is the student of a Master. Naive and stupid, he follows his heart without understanding the point of his actions. The boy ties a thread to a fish, a frog, and finally to a snake. The Master silently observes the actions of his pupil. After all, he treats the child with the same, tying the thread with a stone to his back. The scene that reveals the stupidity of a child and sage mind of the Master can be interpreted very differently. However, the duality of the scene is not a mistake, but the versatility of life. At the first, the Master can be seen as the God, or Karma, or Universe, etc. Whatever person believes, there is the universal law in the face of such Master that will observe your deeds and penalize for the bad ones. Boomerang or cyclicality is a universal principle here, and the Master teaches the young to understand that. Secondly, it can be seen that in comparison with a mature pupil seen further in the movie, if you're a child, you still have a chance to grow up morally without being penalized for the mistakes, as the adult would have been. Adults are not innocent, even though they still can be stupid and have childish mind. Developing this idea further, it can be said that although everyone can grow morally, but the strikes for mistakes remain, as it leads people to realization of their deeds...Summer. The time of flourishing nature and flourishing youth. The temper and energy of a young man that been alone all this time, were finally realized when he met the lady brought to the Master one day. Being unable to restrain his physical desire, young man neglects the principles taught and steps over the lines, without using the entries, which importance can be noticed since the first sight at the movie (42:45 min). The doors or gateways are symbolical in Buddhism, and neglecting this ritual, young Buddhist implied the superiority of natural desire over life principles in temple. He secretly allows his beloved one to sit on the stone statue, which before was not allowed (43:13 min). His actions apparently reveal that he chooses ""normal"" life over sacral service, and entailing the silent furriness of the Master, he escapes to pursue his love. Before he escapes, the Master tells him the following:""the desire to possess awakens the intent to murder""
(47:41 min)
By saying these words, the Teacher warned his pupil to refrain from desires, as such possession blinds people and leads them to sinful things. You cannot control others but rather they will control you, as you give them your everything. It's better to chase your inner peace and harmony. The pupil did not understand it.Autumn. Nature fades away. Death of living creatures. The decline of life energy. The Master finds out what happened to his pupil after he accidentally saw the excerpt of newspaper with his portrait. He understood that the student will be back very soon. The flat colors of autumn epitomize the dark mind of a wanderer. The Master physically punishes him for murder, as it happened since the pupil forgot about the sacral beginning of his life and became ignorant. The Master commits suicide, as he realizes the mistake he made. He could not raise the follower, the next master.
This scene describes the dark side of the life circle. As the life continues, the mistakes, sometimes fatal, are inescapable, if people will not follow some principles. However, as the lessons taught in Spring season, everyone still has a hope to grow morally. The Master, before he dies, teaches the last lesson to his pupil, by making him carving the symbols with the knife. The last lesson was a last spark in the dark mind, which started thinking recalling past experience.
The shining ice and snow in the winter embodies purification and pure mind. As the pupil comes back to deep valley, he finds a snake in the clothes of his Master. That reminds us of reincarnation; as the snake keeps living with him as if they used to live together before, and does not distract anyone, the symbolic meaning becomes clear. The snake is a symbol of wisdom, and it's interesting parallel with the Master that left as human, but came back as snake. As the winter was going to end, the woman brings her child, which she could not keep with her. That apparently brings us to the logical beginning of the story of the Master and his pupil. As the woman escapes, she drowned in the lake, accidentally stepping into the hole. The new Master walks out and instead of woman he finds the Buddha statue. This symbol of coming back to sacral traditions means the acceptance of a new Master. The last gesture that can be seen as a gesture of respect and tribute to dead Master, can be seen the scene, where his former pupil does the same punishment to himself as in childhood (1:32:36). Since this moment he realizes his role in the world.
Spring. A new pupil plays with fish, making it eat stones and sees how it drowns. The turn comes to frog, and finally to a snake. Is he going to repeat the Master's lifelong cycle?After watching that movie which idea was the inevitable cyclicality, there's one thought that I believe stuck in minds of people. If the circle is infinite, can it be escapable? Yes and no. The author leaves us with the same question, as the end of the movie remains open. Who knew, whether this pupil is going to repeat the fate of his teacher, or the teacher will save him from his mistakes...
Whatever the answer is, it happened before, it happens, and it will repeat itself...","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
155,hitchhikingtheseas,so relevant - so powerful - opens your mind,10,14 April 2020,"Watching this film and thinking about it afterwards was what made me sign up here and write this review. I've never written one before. This is only what I got from it - I'm sure it holds a thousand messages.
There are very few words spoken, and what is said therefore holds great importance. One of the first things the master says is that the boy will carry the weight of the dead animals throughout his life. And he does. Then the master says that part about lust leading to possession leading to murder. And he does. I think the master kills himself because he realizes his own responsibility in the boys life: the way his words have the power to create, and how they perhaps got the boy into jail. I'm not a Buddhist but suicide is a huge deal and I'm sure it is in Buddhism too. Or maybe he wanted to free the boy of himself. He did have creative powers: we saw him will the boat to come to him, or to stop. And then, once out of prison, the ""boy"" realizes he has to become a master himself to a new boy. But he understands The Cycle and wants to get rid of it as well as The Weight. So he takes it all as far as he can get it from the house but still within view as a reminder. And then is free to teach the new boy, and be master himself. And when the new boy goes torturing animals, he is no longer there, like the original master was, watching over the new boy's shoulder. And so the cycle is broken.
The message I got from this film is that as any figure of authority, one needs to really really deeply think about their own responsibility, and scrutinize the power they have.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
156,daulettoibazar,Short telling deep story,8,11 September 2020,"Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and SpringThis South Korean film directed by Kim Ki-Duk metaphorically represents the life of a Buddhist monk and his disciple in the center of the lake. The location of the lake is a remote area from civilization, makes it a perfect place to attain soul calmness and deep meditation. The main story of the film was divided into 5 parts, each assigned with the season, as seen from the film's title. The very first Spring corresponds to innocent childhood, summer depicted as young adulthood, the feeling of love, and its subsequent conversion to lust and anger. Continuing in the same manner, fall corresponds to adulthood errors, where the former disciple murdered his wife on the emotional bases and subsequent perception of those errors as they are. Finally, winter was a time of awareness, which depicted in the film by a returning student to his previous master's hermitage. What I found peculiar and intriguing about ""Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"" was the absence of conversational dialogue between the main characters or any kind of explanation from the filmmakers during the film, despite, the story itself attract and acknowledge viewer into the meaning and cultural traditions performed in the film. Based on the symbolics, prayer, and activities they performed, it is obviously seen that they are followers of the Mahayana Buddhism branch, where people used to pray upon Buddha. Coming up to the main point, there were lots of cultural and metaphorical elements used, such as a boat that automatically returns to master, swiftly changing animals with the change fo season, and the weirdest one was gluing stickers to face when the master burned himself on the boat. However, among all of these signs, the notions mostly related to course material were the depiction of karma and samsara.
Karma is the belief that any action in the present inevitably provokes an echo-like response in the future. Either negative or positive, depending on the nature of the deed itself. In this particular case, karma was represented in the film by the childhood action of the boy, when he bound a fish to the stone via rope, then repeated the same action with the frog and snake. Despite the obvious suffering of these animals, observed scenes made the boy laugh. At this very moment, his Master observed a young student from behind. To teach him a lesson master bound his young disciple to the heavy stone that night and ordered him to find and free those animals if he wants to take off the stone from his back. Along with this, the following phrase was said by his master: ""If one of them has died, you will always carry that stone in your heart"". However, when the child found fish and snake, they were already dead. Carrying this in mind, the last scenes from the film should be discussed to have a whole picture. In the season of Winter, man (previously disciple) carried the statue of meditating Buddha to the peak of a nearby mountain by bounding himself to huge and heavy stone. At this moment, previously scenes of suffering animals were inserted by filmmakers, which in my opinion was a representation of karma. So the action he made in childhood returned to him as his own anchor, both physically and metaphorically.
Next, samsara is the Buddhist or even Hinduism term to describe the endless and beginningless chain of lives, where each and every person must rebirth after his death until attaining the state of nirvana. This is the main goal of Buddhist practitioners, to attain nirvana to escape the endless life chain, and dissolve oneself within the universe level. The samsara was depicted in the final part of the film, where the newly arrived disciple of a monk, repeated almost exactly the same animal bullying actions with fish, frog, and snake. Also at the moment when the monk burned himself and ceased to exist, the small snake appeared beneath the boat. This can be interpreted by Buddha's (Siddhartha Gautama) approach toward the nature of the soul as a flow of the river. And when the monk has died, his appearance simply changed or acquired another form. In other words, errors of the past are made to make correct conclusions in the future, in the same manner, life someone lives in the past, define the status and flow of the next rebirth.
Summing up all points, the film ""Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"" is a mixture of both well-written scenario and Asian minimalistic art style, because of the lack of excessive speech, complex actions, or transition of location. Despite the fact that all details were kept simple, this did not negatively reflect on the film quality. The film combined a physical representation of a monk and his disciple's life path, along with a metaphorical depiction of ideas. From the numerous symbolics and traditions, the idea of karma and samsara was discussed in this review, which in my opinion gives a solid explanation, why Buddhist monks adhere to this kind of lifestyle and the essence of Buddhism as a religion.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
157,beyssenova,Buddhist Cyclicality,8,12 September 2020,"Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring is an aesthetically pleasing work with a great soundtrack to complement the stunning visuals. The scene of the protagonist's frosty ascent onto a hill with the attached stone that symbolizes the weight of all the hardships and suffering the monk has caused to himself and others, which is accompanied the traditional Korean song Jeongseon Arirang performed by Kim Young Im, is a cinematic masterpiece. In general, the rural setting and slow pacing of the plot during each season make the occurring events seem timeless, which creates a tranquil feeling that eases the mind. Bar the masterful directing itself, much of this feeling has to do with Buddhist symbolism, which is unsurprisingly plentiful in this movie. This review will discuss such recurring Buddhist themes in the movie, particularly the cyclicality of life.To start from the metaphorical imagery of the film, the main theme is that of the cyclicality of life - a motif that is essential in both Hinduism and Buddhism, which is a shramana religion - that is, an offshoot of Hinduism. Time passes in cycles, and history always repeats itself. We are shown this circularity through the life of our protagonist, who is a man that spends his childhood in a small Buddhist monastery in the middle of a lake under the guidance of his teacher - a bodhisattva who is referred to as the ""wise one"". The protagonist's life - from childhood until old age - is presented in the course of five seasons: spring, summer, fall, winter and spring once again, which represents the renewal of the limitless cycle. The four seasons interchange every year regardless of what era it is - this cycle had been present well before human beings emerged, and will persist long after humankind is gone. Hence, they symbolize infinity and repetition - the endless cycle of birth, death, rebirth and suffering - the concept of samsara - to which humans are subjected unless they are liberated from this physical realm by achieving Nirvana through the Noble Eightfold Path.This repetition is reflected not solely in the fact that the film begins and ends in spring - the very scenes on the screen are identical. In the beginning, the carefree young protagonist torments animals - he plays with a fish, a frog and a snake by attaching a stone to them and considers the results quite amusing. Children may do such things in real life because they do not yet understand the concept of pain and suffering. The main character's mentor teaches the child that lesson of empathy and karma by attaching a large stone to him as well and making him find and release the animals. It is revealed that the fish and the snake died while the frog survived. In the very end of the movie, we are shown a similar scene with the new boy, the student of our matured protagonist, who torments the same three animals by shoving a stone into their mouths. This is symbolic of the fate of human beings in samsara - doomed to repeat the same mistakes again and again.Another important feature of the movie is the theme of Buddhist monasticism, particularly celibacy. Of course, Buddhist monks are supposed to renounce everything materialistic in order to achieve the spiritual bliss. Hence, they must renounce wealth, alcohol, sex, father no children, and so on - anything that may lead their journey towards Nirvana astray. Our protagonist breaks this rule by falling in love in with the sick girl and eventually choosing to flee the monastery and live with her. What the main character at that point did not understand, however, is that his love was doomed. According to the main principles of Buddhism (The Four Noble Truths), life is full of suffering - the concept of dunkha. The root of all suffering is craving - people have carnal, material desires that can never be fully satisfied, which is the notion of trishna. In order to overcome suffering, one must overcome their desires and relinquish the earthly by following the Eightfold Noble Path. Therefore, because the protagonist wanted the girl and lusted after her body and love in general, his craving inevitably led to suffering.The protagonist's teacher, on the other hand, that realizes how fleeting the material world is. Enlightened, he possesses prajna - a state of mind, the ability to see the true nature of reality, which is a mere abstraction of ties and relations in our minds. This concept is somewhat reminiscent of Plato's cave and the Chariot allegory, which postulate the notion that ordinary human beings are not able to grasp the true Form of things and can only see mere shadows. This emptiness of all phenomena that the Master recognizes is called shunyata. Consequently, the monk understands that the protagonist's romance with the girl is merely evanescent. He warns his student, ""Lust awakens the desire to possess. And that awakens the intent to murder"" (Kim Ki-duk, 2003) - foreboding the impending suffering. A little bit later, the protagonist tells his new girlfriend that he becomes crazy when he cannot see her - proving his obsession with this lust, which is discouraged in Buddhism, especially for those who strive to be a monk. The mentor's prediction becomes true, for years after the main character murders his girlfriend-wife for alleged infidelity and comes back to the monastery in a fury of rage. The loss of his love may also be attributed to the fish and the snake he killed earlier in the movie - the stone that he had to carry in his heart for the rest of his life, which is connected to the concept of karma. Only after letting go of his anger by carving out the Heart Sutra, serving his prison sentence and returning to the monastery once again, the protagonist resumes training and finally liberates himself from carnal desires and becomes a bonafide monk.After which the cycle begins anew and the time comes for our protagonist to be the mentor and show his protégé the path towards liberation - the Nirvana.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
158,ZhibekDildayeva,Some thoughts about Buddhist teaching in the movie,10,12 September 2020,"First of all, I would like to say that after watching this movie to write a review straight away is not so easy as for many other movies people can do. This movie is deep and touching so that it leaves behind many thoughts to think about. It took me around two days to fully understand the movie. Here, I would like to concentrate on some aspects of Buddhist teachings and symbols appeared in the movie.Movie begins as the door with the picture of two muscle-rich men and the scenery of a floating monastery in the middle of the lake. The door stands on itself without any walls around and acts as the entrance to the land from the lake. The other door without walls is in the monastery in the space between sleeping and praying areas. I believe the door symbolizes division of two places as sacred and profound. Also, it shows how people follow traditions and customs as the act of going through the door even if there are no walls there. On the summer part of the movie adolescent monk in the night approaches the girl forgetting to enter to her space through the door. In this way, he disobeyed the Buddhism precept of refraining from sexual misconduct.There is another percept of Buddhism which tells not to harm living creatures. In the first spring, boy monk tied three animals to stones which in turn caused death of two animals. Older monk taught him a lesson by making the boy to carry a stone himself. In this part, we can see not only animal liberation of Buddhism, but also instant karma reached the boy. In the next spring, man carries Buddha statue along with the stone tied up to his belly in order to clear his karma the past sins his done to dead animals last spring. When he brings Buddha on the top he finds himself a redemption and freedom from his sins.
Animals play an important role in the house too. During different periods of time we can see different pets in the monastery, this presence indirectly relates to different stages of younger monk and shows how Buddhism teaches us to share our space with others since we cannot own any property by ourselves.Older monk had very interesting attitude towards the boy. He did not stop the boy hurting the animals though he was observing him secretly. Instead he just taught him a lesson which I understood as giving a direction of right behavior. Older monk did not stop him from boy chasing after the girl, he was just observing. The reason for that I believe is that life goes as it is. In Buddhist religion people are born pure, they make mistakes and they suffer, but most importantly they must learn from the past. Furthermore, older monk taught him Dhamma in fall, which was about overcoming dissatisfaction and sufferings.Perception of life, body, and soul in Buddhist teachings is something special. We can see this phenomena through death of older monk in the winter. Firstly, he felt gradually that his time has come and prepares. He has left all his belongings in the house and did his cremation outside on the boat, because according to the Buddhist teachings we are just guests in nature around us, in the house, and in our own body, so everything will be there after we die. When he sets himself on fire he feels nothing because he could separate his body and his soul during his meditation and could attain enlightenment. After his death grown boy monk finds white little stones (Sarira) on the place of the self-cremation. White stones or Sariras are left behind after Buddhist spiritual masters, which means that older monk has attained Nirvana. Adult monk wraps Sarira in red tissue and put in the forehead in the ice Buddha statue. This is another belief when tissue is freely floating around the soul has completely gone.In the next spring, man carries Buddha statue along with the stone tied up to his belly in order to be free from the past sins his done to dead animals last spring. When he brings Buddha on the top he finds himself a redemption.By the end of the movie we can observe that life goes in a circular manner, just like Buddhism notion of Samsara. Adult monk taught himself the martial arts and diligent praying. One day woman with her face covered leaves her little baby to the monk. And in the next spring we can see grown boy just like the monk was at the beginning of the movie. At this point viewer can notice clearly how life goes the same way only the people are changing. The fact that names of the characters are not given suggests that it does not matter in a life cycle. This is what Samsara, or wheel of life can teach us.Director of the movie Ki-duk Kim played the role of adult monk and did it, in my humble opinion, perfectly. From the technical view, the major pearl of this movie is the choice of scenery and shooting angles. Despite the shooting was done at the same location and the cast was limited, change of seasons and development of the main characters made this movie very catching and appealing to watch. I would suggest this movie to watch for anyone interested in Buddhism religion or for those who seek some mental pabulum.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
159,yerassyldildaim,"Karma, samsara and Prajnaparamita sutra",10,12 September 2020,"The ""Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"" masterfully reflects some major aspects of Mahayana Buddhism teachings through serene depictions of the Buddhist monk life. We are introduced to the ideas of karma, samsara, and the role of desire in our sufferings, as well as we could observe many minor details and cultural references. The symbolism in the movie as in the case of changing animals with each season tells the story more vividly than any dialogue could have. So, let us review how Kim Ki Duk reflects on the aspects of Buddhism through his movie.
Throughout the movie, the main topic that we can observe is the Buddhist idea of samsara and karmic debt. The movie follows the main character from his youth to the point when he himself has a pupil, and each season represents the critical points of his life. It becomes especially apparent to the end of the movie in the winter and spring seasons that the movie reflects samsara and the cyclical nature of things. In the following spring, his pupil repeats his master's youth actions with stones and animals but in a slightly different manner. It might hint that his pupil is bound to repeat the previous monk's path while accumulating and releasing karmic debt in a different manner. Also, in fall, when the elder monk self-immolates we can see tears in his eyes, it is not that clear whether he feels compassion for his pupil or that it might be an indication that he himself has a karmic debt but tears more likely to represent that elder monk is still in the cycle. So, as we can see the movie has masterfully illustrated the cyclical nature of life and samsara.
Another main aspect of the movie is the topic of karmic debt that might be depicted in the form of stone. When the monk tortured animals, his teacher tied a stone to him similar to his tortures which could be metaphorical to the karmic debt that makes an individual's path to nirvana burdensome. This idea is facilitated in the winter when the main character travels to the top of the mountain with the statue of Buddha and stone tied to him, indicating how his path to nirvana is burdened by his past deeds. The statues of the Buddha are also quite symbolic and might indicate the body of knowledge about the path. For instance, when he escapes following the girl, he brings with himself a rooster and a stone statue of Buddha, which might tell that despite he is led by his desire, the knowledge given by his master lies like a burden in his heart. Returning the statue to its place was a sign of returning to the path. In winter, while the statue of Buddha equally burdened his path to the top of the mount as a stone tied to his body, it was also the whole meaning of his trip, to begin with, and might symbolize the significance of wisdom to obtain nirvana. Another interesting observation is the monk's attitude to the path and girl reflected by the haetae, stone lions, so if at first, he prohibited her to sit on them, later he encouraged it. So, it is quite intriguing how the author managed to use stone and statues to reflect upon karmic debt or to tell about the journey of the monk.
Finally, we have to look at the Buddhist concept of three poisons that keep individuals inside samsara, which are anger, attachment, and ignorance. The plot of the movie is focused on two of the poisons that are attachment and anger. Respectively, we have scenes with rooster and snake, which are the symbols for these poisons. The central quote of the movie that ""desire to possess leads to the intent to murder"", ties attachment and aversion together. It also reflects one of the Four Noble Truths of Buddhist teachings that sufferings are caused by desires. Also, we have a scene when the master makes the main character to carve Prajnaparamita sutra, which perfectly summarizes the plot. Sutra states that there is no suffering or desire since everything is in the void state. We can see how an understanding of the sutra helped him to regain inner peace. So, the monk's affection towards woman, which followed by her murder, not only reflects on the Four Noble Truth that sufferings are caused by desires but also illustrates his path to wisdom.
Overall, the ""Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"" managed to introduce the viewer through scenery and symbols to the main aspects of the Mahayana Buddhist teachings. Karmic debt, samsara, and the emptiness of existence are conveyed through various symbols without the use of direct dialogues. While some symbols as the rooster are more apparent, the meaning behind others as tears during self-immolation could be debatable. It could be concluded that Kim Ki Duk not only created a film that helps us to observe the main aspects of Buddhism but also to raise questions about our life paths.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
160,alyonakrapivina,The endless circle of samsara,10,13 September 2020,"The South Korean film ""Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter ... and Spring"" directed by Kim Ki-Duk not only creates the unique atmosphere of the floating temple that helps to feel the spirit of Buddhism but also delivers several important messages in the framework of Buddhist religious beliefs. The beautiful setting of the films in terms of dense forest, mountainous terrain, and lakes transmits calmness and unity with nature. While a stone statue of a Buddha on the top of a mountain that appears several times in the frame, as it were, reminds of the essence of a Buddha around us and in our lives. Along with the importance of the environment and landscape, the film also conveys several important ideas about Buddhism. The major Buddhist ideas that film represents are the wheel of life concept, monk's teaching, and the experience of the monk himself. The film as the whole piece transmits the idea of the wheel of life and helps to understand how life is the infinite circle. Monk's teaching of the boy through his lessons helps to understand basic concepts and wises of Buddhism such as karma or no harm for others. While through the monk's life we can understand the pass of the Buddhist monks to achieve liberation. In this review, I would like to focus on these three major concepts of the film that seem for me as the representation of Buddhist beliefs and that helped me to see and understand the religion deeper.The title of the film and how the plot is presented already contains an important message from Buddhism. Years in the film are presented in the form of seasons, which, as everyone knows, are repeated from year to year, so that after winter there will be another spring and the cycle never ends. The same as the endless wheel of life in which one life ends up being reborn in another form. This concept of reincarnation is one of the majors in Buddhist religious beliefs. When a monk dies or, more precisely, achieves liberation, an already grown boy comes to his place, who at one time was a student of a monk, and now, having taken his place, he is a teacher for the child. The circle has closed, spring has come again, which represents how the wheel of life continues to move forward. These two ideas of the wheel of life and reincarnation are best at presenting the important Buddhist beliefs since the desire of the true Buddhist is to escape samsara while others remain in the wheel and their soul continues to live the next life. I think the general form of the film and the story helped to depict these important notions.Other important wises of Buddhism can be understood from the presented relations between the old monk and the boy. Monk teaches the boy lessons based on practical experience rather than theoretical ideas. So that when the boy tortures animals and the next day finds the stone roped to his back he and the viewers themselves can understand the meaning of the karma and the wise principle of ""no harm to any living being"". By the power of the monk's lesson comes the understanding of the Buddhist pearls of wisdom. The film is not rich for long dialogues but when the monk says something his words contain important thoughts through which Buddhism can be understood. Such that ""you will carry the stone in your heart for the rest of your life"" as a response to the boy if he finds the tortured animals dead or ""lust awakens the desire to possess which leads to intent to murder"" when the boy starts sexual relations with the girl. Through these words, we can understand why Buddhists promote no harm to others and dismissal from sexual relations. All these words and depicted lessons for the boy help to understand the principles that form a basis for the monk and thus Buddhist religion in general.And finally, regarding the image of the monk presented in the film we can understand more about their path in attaining enlightenment. As in Buddhist societies, monks are highly respected and supported people who can attain nirvana it is important to understand how they live and what path follow. The monk in the film possess not many belongings, lives in the distant temple surrounded by water and other nature. His life does not include any entertainment or other benefits that ordinary people can enjoy. This can be understood by one of the Nobel truths of Buddhism when one can overcome suffering by abandoning cravings and passions that cause these sufferings. We see his life focused on praying, teaching the boy, and helping other people through Buddhist religious principles. So that when the girl comes to him, he helps her soul and body to recover with praying and herbs. I see the monk as a central figure in the story as he was the one who wanted to help the boy attain the right views and thought, direct him on the Noble Path through the Buddhist religion. So that in the end the boy himself became the monk and was ready to teach another boy all he knew from his life and lessons of the monk.In conclusion, I regard this film not only as of the cinematic art but as the illustrative example of some ideas presented in the Buddhist religion. From the characters and story presented in the movie, the viewer can grasp the way of monk's life, their principles, and some basic concept as samsara or karma.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
161,aidanabikenova,Made me think,9,13 September 2020,"After watching this movie, I was left with many questions that did not let me write anything about the movie until I dug deeper into my thoughts around it. First, I tried to absorb everything in before connecting it to things I recently learned from the course. I think that the movie was made so well that even without any knowledge about Buddhist traditions, I would have still understood the message: karma always follows the person. Positive actions lead to beneficial results, whereas negative actions lead to unwanted consequences. In this review, I will discuss how ""Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter and... Spring"" demonstrates the Buddhist belief system, particularly, its aspects such as anatman, karma, samsara, upaya, and karuna.
First, the movie starts with a beautiful scene of a monastery floating on the lake. There are a Buddha's figure, candles, and other tools used for praying and rituals. It is clear that the monastery is a special place. According to Eliade, religion is based on the division between the sacred space and the profane space. (Eliade, 1973) In this movie, monastery implies a hierophany, the manifestation of sacred. The set it a sacred place, thus, the movie gives a full picture of the Buddhist religion and its values.
The first season depicted in a movie is spring, where the little boy gets his first lessons from the master. The master teaches the boy to appreciate other beings' lives as your own and punishes the boy for misbehaving and demonstrating egoism. I would say that this lesson is an example of Karuna, which is a limitless compassion to all beings. It helps to overcome cravings by cultivating altruism. (Lecture on Mahayana Buddhism)
Another lesson master tried to give to the disciple is anatman. According to lecture, anatman is a belief that soul is an unstable and ever changing phenomenon. In ""summer,"" the teen disciple falls a victim of lust and desire to possess. The master warns him that ""lust leads to desire for possession, and possession leads to murder."" It is implied that soul is not stable, so you cannot possess anyone. The desire to do so is contrary to Buddhist beliefs and karma would punish the boy for that.
There is also a clear demonstration of four noble truths.
1. Life is full of sufferings. Buddhists recognize suffering beyond its physical appearance. For instance, in the movie, the master says that when the girl finds peace in her soul, her body would return to health. When he learns about the intimate relationships between the young monarch and the girl, he calmly states that if it was a medicine, then it was meant to be. However, he does not let them continue their romance since pleasure is also considered a suffering. It leads to the dependence on the partner, which causes dissatisfaction since possession is not real.
2. The root of sufferings are cravings. In the movie, the young monarch's desire for pleasure caused a lot of suffering such as anxiety, anger and jealousy.
3. To overcome sufferings one should overcome cravings. 4. To achieve this, one should follow the Eightfold Noble Path. The young monarch achieves the right state of mind only when he starts following the Eightfold Noble Path (gaining better understanding of the life, leading a lifestyle that cleans the karma and practicing meditation.) (Lecture on the early Buddhism)
Since I learned it was a Korean movie, I have tried to figure out which Buddhist tradition it upholds to. I supposed that it was a Mahayana Buddhism since Korea was one of the main Mahayana Buddhist branches due to lecture on Mahayana Buddhism. While watching the movie, I got surer of it. As it was already mentioned before, there is Karuna, which is one of the four key Mahayana concepts. Tantra is another practice demonstrated in a movie that helped to categorize it as a Mahayana Buddhism. According to lecture, tantra is ""an advanced practice for attaining enlightenment integrating meditative, physical, and psychic exercises"", (Lecture on Mahayana Buddhism) which helps to attain Nirvana. In season ""winter,"" the monarch progresses his spirituality by doing some physical exercises and training his body. We can see that his body is fit and his soul is nourished. Tantra can also be a considered a part of Upaya, which is another key Mahayana concept.
Finally, how do all of the concepts above are connected to samsara and karma? Samsara is a wheel of life, the round of rebirths. (Spiro, 1966, p. 1169) Karma is the net balance of one's merits and demerits, (Spiro, 1966, p. 1169) which means that what one does in their life affects the future existence of the soul. In order not to make mistakes and have good karma, one should understand the four noble truths and practice upaya and karuna. When the boy completes the sutras in the end of the movie, he finally realizes that life is a suffering and everything is impermanent. The soul changes just like the seasons in the movie: spring, summer, fall, winter and spring again. So, the young monarch turns into a master by going through redemption and liberating his soul from suffering.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
162,aliyatolepbek,Movie Review,10,13 September 2020,"Movie Review on ""Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter and... Spring""
The movie about Buddhism was filmed by South Korea. It is about the endless circulation of life, the teacher continues in student. Even for the person, who have never heard of it, it will be pretty clear what this religion is about. The name itself signals on the main idea - circulation of life. The years like seasons.
It highlights the main points - 4 Noble truths or Basic formula of the religion: suffering, the cause of suffering, the end of suffering, the path of achieving the end of it. All of these truths were shown in the movie step by step.
The truth of suffering is shown through the whole movie, from the beginning till the end. It starts with the scene where a boy tortures a fish, a frog and a snake. He ties them to a stone and makes them suffer while laughing at them. The master doesn't clean after his student and doesn't lecture, instead, he allows him to make mistakes and suffer. He points his student a way to discover the life. The student feels guilty when he sees dead fish and snake, so he should now live with a stone in his heart - life is full of sufferings.
The next is the truth of the cause of suffering which are people's desires. It is clearly explained when the student meets the first woman and love in his life. The student gives in to feelings, lust and instincts. His cravings make him blind, emotional and uncontrollable. He lost his head and inner peace with the love and lust. In one of the scenes, at the very beginning when the girl just came to their hut in order to get some therapy, she sits in one of their sculptured stone which is precious for the master. The boy warns the girl that it is very important for the master. But then, we notice that he no more cares about these sculptured stones and lets his love to sit on it. So we can see how love, his desires blind him quickly.
Finally, he kills his wife because of his desires, lost of control and the master points out the philosophy of Buddhism: ""sometimes we have to let go things we like"". So, sometimes we have to let go people we cannot live without.
The wise master helps him with no words, but actions. He helps his student to restore his inner peace with ""Prajnaparamita Sutra"" - collection about forty texts. So the student cuts each character with the knife with which he killed his wife, and gets inner peace. So, the third truth about the end of the sufferings is here. In order to end the sufferings, one should end with his/her desires, cravings. And it is not about suicide, as the student tried to do with sticked character which means ""shut, stop up"", but to accept all your mistakes, have a life lesson and move on, no matter how difficult it is.
Finally, the fourth noble truth is about the path leading to the end of these sufferings. I think the film represents it with the coming back of the student from the jail or the death of the master. They truly found the inner peace inside, by following the Eightfold Noble Path: right views, thoughts, speech, action, livelihood, effort, mindfulness, concentration. The millstone and the sculpture of Buddha represent the killings that he regrets about all of his life at the end. He carried this karma through all of his life and carried to the hill, finally sets free and finds the end of the sufferings.
The young boy at the beginning and the ending represents people. Good life is not achieved by having no bad thoughts, but by mastering your thoughts. By overpowering yourself and being better. Our behavior does not choose us, but we choose it. We choose whom we want to be, and only we can control ourselves. For some it is more difficult than for others, but it is possible to achieve the end of sufferings with following the Eightfold Noble Path. Everyone is born with the sin, and everyone has its own path to divinity. By showing the same boy at the end of the movie and the beginning, the movie shows the eternal cycle of human beings. The teacher continues in his or her student.
The movie shows the main points of the religion, such as the Four Noble Truths which is the main and basic formula of the religion. They show ""Pajnaparamita Sutra"" which helps a person to restore inner peace; that everyone has his/her own path of achieving the end of sufferings by two scenes: the boys who make animals suffer both at the beginning and at the end. The idea is one, but actions are different. Summarizing all of it, the movie explains the idea of Buddhism very effectively.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
163,orazospanov,"Spring,Summer,Autumn,Winter...And Spring",10,13 September 2020,"The film is about the unusual life of the Buddhist monk, undergoing through consecutive stages of life and circumstances which he brings himself into. The main focus was on the concept of cause and effect relationship, which is known as the law of karma in the religious realm, shown in monk's actions. The peculiarity of the film is in it's details, with the help of which the author tries to show the various aspects of Buddhist religious tradition. In my opinion, the film's ability to represent the aspects of Buddhist religion through the contrast of the main protagonist's viewpoint of life and his master's viewpoint is demonstrated quite well.Life is full of sufferings. This is one of the points in the four Noble Truths in Buddha's Teachings and namely this concept is demonstrated in the film as the starting point in the life of the young monk. The film clearly shows the master's intention to make the student realize that he should be ready to bear the mental burden of his action's implications on himself and only himself. And not only a monk's wrong actions eventually bring him to the sufferings, but the pleasures as well. And one can see that this is illustrated by means of the teenage monk's psychological attachment to the girl, which eventually brings him into disappointment and horrible consequences. In contrast the master's viewpoint tells us about his vision as where he tells the boy to not follow his cravings as it will result in bad implications for him. So we can conclude from the Buddhism point of view the young monk is setting the seeds of his karma due to his ignorance of life's aspects.Secondly, the evolving consciousness of the monk will bear the seeds of karma set in his earlier life. For example, he can not simply finish his life after killing a person or an animal, where the intention was to show that he will live with that for the rest of his life and carry that 'stone' with him. So, during the rest of his life he always will get the 'prompts' about his deeds he has done.To conclude, one can see that the film clearly demonstrated the concepts of Buddhism to the viewer, where the main focus was to show the law of karma. Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter, and Spring showed us the Buddhist concept of continuity of life cycles and that to exit from these cycles one should get rid of all his cravings.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
164,kamilabazylbekova,Review for HST/REL 110 course,8,14 September 2020,"The film ""Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter and ... Spring"" tells a story of a young Buddhist monk, whose lifetime lasts like the four seasons of nature. The boy goes through the periods of his life, along the way learning the valuable lessons and trying to achieve his inner peace. The boy's teacher leads him through the path of hardships and sufferings, and the boy comes back to his Master even after leaving him for some time. Throughout the plot many references to various Buddhist concepts can be seen, symbolically and in hidden meanings. The ending of the film also proposes an important idea of Buddhism about the infinite chain of lifetimes of the person - samsara.
The boyhood of a monk is shown in the film as spring - the symbolical beginning of life, traditional image of innocence and joy. In this period of his life the boy learns his first important lesson - that every living being should be treated as one would treat him-/herself. When the young monk tortures a fish, a frog and a snake by tying them to a stone, the Master does the same to the boy, making him endure what the tortured creatures have gone through. The Buddhist concept of karuna - compassion to all living beings - can be traced in this episode, when the teacher explains to his apprentice this lesson of life. Buddhism, like many other religions, propagates the non-violence practice, an idea which is also strongly present in this episode. Besides, the concept of upaya could be noticed here too, as the Master teaches the lesson through applying a technique fit for the young boy to understand it through experiencing the torture himself.
The next stage of life of the monk is the adolescence, which is compared to summer. In this period the boy discovers the worldly pleasures which are forbidden in the monastic lifestyle. Upon violating the celibacy, the boy is not punished by his teacher, who rather pronounces that it is just the way of nature. However, when the boy leaves the temple to follow his object of affection, he is warned by the Master of dangers of the passion and lust. This reflects the ideas of the Four Noble Truths of Buddhism, which state that the reasons of sufferings are our cravings and desires, and to overcome the pain it is necessary to overcome the cravings. The boy does not listen to the warnings of the teacher and leaves, led by his passion and desire.
The next episode of the man's life shows that the Master's words and, therefore, the Four Noble Truths were right. Before the boy left, the teacher told him that lust awakens desire to possess, and desire to possess leads to murder. The exact thing happened indeed, and the now young man came back to the temple, after killing his wife in flush of jealous anger. The Buddhist conception of Eightfold Noble Path teaches that one should maintain right views, thoughts and actions, to obtain the Four Noble Truths. However, the main character of the film is shown to divert from this path of righteousness despite his teachings, by submitting to his irrational feelings, which caused him to suffer and to commit crime. This is another valuable lesson that the monk, as well as the viewers learn from his life - that it is necessary to monitor one's thoughts and deeds and not to follow blindly the rush of feelings.
Another wise saying of the Master in the film states that sometimes it is needed let go of things we like. The monk learns this in the ""autumn"" of his life, after coming back to the temple. As he is tormented by anger, the teacher attempts to drive these negative feelings inside the man away, by making him do an exhausting task, which eventually brings peace to the man's soul. This is yet another illustration of the Buddhist idea of training to overcome the suffering. The man has calmly accepted his fate and voluntarily submitted himself to detectives who take him to prison. The central idea of Buddhism - training one's spirit and body to achieve the inner peace - is the focus of this episode of the film.
The winter shows that the monk is now a middle-aged man, who was freed from prison. He pays respect to his late Master and continues his monastic life in the temple, learning martial arts and training in severe conditions. The man's spirit has become strong and tough, and he is shown to achieve the most of his physical and psychological potential, thus overcoming all his fears and weaknesses. Once again, we see the cornerstone of Buddhism in this story - the triumph of the human body and spirit over the hardships, vices and cravings. Only through excruciating training, meditation and effort one can achieve the inner peace and liberty, and become a true Buddha.
The episode also contains a story of a little child, brought and abandoned by his mother. Spring comes again, and the monk becomes a Master, while the child is now an apprentice, and the cycle continues. The young boy learns how the world around him works and acquires life lessons from the Master, just as the Master did himself in his childhood. The goal of the Buddhist monks is to reach the nirvana - liberation from this endless cycle of lifetimes, but the central idea of the film is different - it shows that life never ends and goes in its own path like the seasons of nature.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
165,yerzhankabylda,Film review for REL 110,9,16 September 2020,"This is an approximately two hours lasted film about a Buddhist monk and a child, who is being brought by the monk. From the first 5 minutes of watching, it can be ununderstood that the film is going to be mostly silent rather than wordy. Even though it has a few dialogues in it, those conversations were provided mostly in order to make the situation clear for the viewer and for a deeper understanding of the concept of the religion. From my point of view, the main ideas in the film are depicted in the actions and decisions of characters. The film was shot to deliver to people some of many concepts of Buddhism, such as Samsara, Reincarnation, and the four ideas, which are considered as fundamental ones in Mahayana.The concept of Samsara can be revealed straight away from the name of the movie - four seasons of nature flow one after another in repeating order. This concept demonstrates that no one has the ability to change this set of flow of nature and life.
Some of the Eightfold Noble Path is depicted in the Spring part of the movie. There displayed a monk and a boy, both of whom live in a pagoda on the lake. A man teaches the child to the core concepts of Buddhism. After that, there is a scene where the boy walks near a small pond and starts to mock a fish, a frog, and a snake, binding them with a stone. All of these antics were observed by a monk, who then decides to do the same with the boy in order to teach a lesson. A child finds out that it is painful and is told to free the animals. ""If any of the animals died, you will forever have a stone in your heart,"" the monk added. The child goes back to the places where he found the animals. He cries because a snake and a fish are dead and buries them.
The Four Noble Truths are presented in the Summer part of the movie. The boy grows and becomes an adolescent. A woman addresses the monk due to the illness of her daughter. The young man sees such a beautiful girl for the first time. The mother leaves her daughter to be treated. The boy starts to look after the girl, and his feelings grow as time flows while the girls do not perceive his intentions. Two days later, she finally accepts his attention and does not resist anymore. This led to a sexual act between them. The monk notices everything, finds the girl cured, and tells the boy: ""Lust awakens the desire to possess and that awakens the intent to murder"", which matches with the content of the lecture ""the root of sufferings are cravings (trishna)."" Then the Master sends the girl back, for which the boy cannot stop to think about and decides to go after her.
In the Fall part of the movie, the monk gets old ages, and his pupil gets 30 years. One day the latter comes back to the Master to achieve Prajna and to hide away because he killed his beloved for some reason. The monk greets him with no bad flashbacks and talks to him in a positive manner. The pupil gets angry with himself and tries to commit suicide. The Master tells him it is impossible to kill yourself so effortlessly and makes him curve out the characters on the floor in order to drive out the anger from his heart. While doing that, two policemen appeared and wanted to arrest the criminal. Still, the Master stopped them because his pupil has to end the work began. The policemen understood and stayed in the pagoda until the pupil finishes. During the time spent there, all of those three ones became kinder, and on the other day, the pupil goes with the policemen without any enforcement. Later, having understood what are Shunyata, Prajna, Karuna, and Upaya, which are key concepts of Mahayana, the Master burns himself on the boat.
In the Winter part of the movie, the former criminal becomes a monk himself and stands on a halfway of understanding all of the abovementioned concepts. He returns to the pagoda and does the basic Buddhist rituals, thus continuing the previous pace of the life of his Master. He finds an old dictionary, where the basics of Yoga are demonstrated. Besides that, there are scenes where previously killed animals are living again. At the end of that part, an unknown woman comes to the pagoda and leaves her child to be raised by the monk.In the last part of the film, the wheel of Samsara closes. The child raises and does the same things that this monk did in his childhood.
Such a fascinating film made to think about life profoundly and from various perspectives. The concept that the life cycle never ends still does not leave me.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
166,alirezanadjafi,Can I rate this zero stars?,1,29 September 2021,I hate it it's so boring and some annoying sense are in it please censor it.I HATE IT.,"Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
167,aizhanomargaliyeva,"""Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter, and... Spring""",10,7 February 2021,"The movie ""Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter, and... Spring"" introduces the viewer to the Buddhist culture and traditions. Director used an interesting technique with transitions from one season to another, showing different stages of the life of a monk and a boy. Every season portrays a didactic lesson about Buddhism. The movie finishes with a similar scene from the beginning and suggests the continuation of the story. In addition, every season is replaced by the next in another year, showing the beginningless and endless chain of lifetime's continuation. Moreover, the actions in the second shown spring seem to be repeated with a slight plot change. It can suggest that the director wanted to show important religious concepts such as samsara, wheel of existence with the idea of anatman.
According to the belief that Buddha is nowhere and everywhere, the movie is full of symbols suggesting his presence, without him being anywhere. Nikolay Tsyrempilov, in the lecture ""The early Buddhism"" (Lecture, Nazarbayev University, January 25, 2021) suggests that Buddha statues, trees, and lions are symbols of Buddha. Some symbols of Buddha in the film are the tremendous statue of the Buddha at the edge of the forest, statues of lions on the floating temple, trees around the temple, and especially the one in the river. Regarding the main characters, as both of them are monks or in a state of becoming monks, they follow celibacy. It can be seen that they have dietary restrictions, live a non-violent life, meditate and pray a lot. Their heads are shaved, however, when the boy left the temple it can be seen that he had grown hair back. This can also be interpreted as a sign of him distancing from the religion for some period of time.
Dividing the film into semantic parts, it would be useful to analyze each season separately and note the Buddhist practices in each of the seasons. Firstly, as the movie starts with the spring, the movie narrates a story of an adult monk and a little boy. From the beginning, the movie introduces viewers to the concept of karma. For torturing animals little boy was punished by his master. As he was tying up substantially big stones to the animals, the master tied up a little boy's back big stone. He had to free the animals before he could be freed himself, and the responsibility for the death of the animals he had to carry as a burden in his heart. This way, the monk showed how karma works, and how every action has a repercussion.
The second part is about the same monk and a young pupil. The young guy who lives away from people, not familiar with sensual desires is faced with something new for the first time. A new concept of desires and cravings is presented in this part. Awakened lust made the young guy give up some principles of celibacy, as he had sexual intercourse with a girl, who came to get well. After the monk found out, he told a boy about desires and craving and their detrimental effect on life. This is a reference to the four noble truths, the basic formula of Buddhism (Tsyrempilov, "" The early Buddhism"", Nazarbayev University, January 25, 2021.) According to Trishna, the roots of all suffering are cravings, and later this backfired on the young guy. The season ended with the guy leaving the temple.
The next season is Fall. As monks don't earn subsistence but beg for food, already an old monk returned to the temple with food he was given. From the news, he found out that his former pupil committed a murder. As he was telling before ""the desire to possess awakens the intent to murder"". As a pupil returned, he was tortured by the mental sufferings. According to the duhkha, the first noble truth - life is full of suffering, both physical and mental. As the third noble truth states, to overcome sufferings one should overcome cravings. The scene of how a young pupil was etching the Pranja-parpamitasutra, shows the spectrum of his emotions and how he freed from anger. This practice demonstrates how religion helped the pupil to overcome desires take the path of religion firmly again. Also, it can be noticed that monks are highly respected in society. The police officers did not immediately detain the young guy at the request of the monk but gave him time to complete the religious practice. The season ended with the old monk's death. It worth noting that under the boat, where the monk died, the serpent appeared. It might be that reincarnation occurred and the stream of dharma took the form of a serpent.
Winter. Pupil returned to the floating temple. The idea that the serpent is reincarnated old monk, enhanced by the fact that the serpent was lying on the monk's left clothes. Moreover, throughout the season serpent was looking after the new monk. This might indicate the important aspect of the Mahayana Buddhists- bodhisattva. Sanghas' motivation other than to achieve Nirvana, is to help others to achieve enlightenment and become Buddha. Moreover, it can be seen that monk and his pupil, try to help other people in need. During the winter, a woman left her child in the monk's temple and the monk became a master for this child. After the winter, comes another spring and it indicates that the wheel of life continues.
In conclusion, the movie illustrates miscellaneous Buddhist practices and introduces various concepts. The film ends with the statue of Buddha looking down on everything. Again highlighting the idea of Buddha's ubiquity. Even the person, who is not familiar with the Buddhist traditions, can learn a lot after watching this film.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
168,samaltazhibayeva,It changed my viewpoint on life when I was 10. And it changed it again after 10 years,10,7 February 2021,"This masterpiece of Kim Kiduk lacks the dialogues. However, it is rich for symbolism and hidden messages, so dialogues seem unnecessary.
Film describes the fate of a child Buddhist monk disciple living in an isolated floating temple with his master. The painting on the side of the boat representing the lotus birth of Buddha symbolizes the original purity of human mind at birth. As lotus blooms spotless clean in the mud so human is innocent when he is born. In this film you can see how child is influenced by different emotions as temptation, desire to possess and anger through his life, and how stages of this maturation is beautifully aligned with the seasons of a year.(SPOILER ALERT)
SpringSpring symbolizes the beginning of a new life. As the new sprouts appear, they seem tender and inexperienced. You can see how the older generation teaches the younger their wisdom and knowledge.
One interesting detail are 'useless' doors inside the temple. They divide the room into 3 distinct area, yet there is no real wall. Despite that both monk and his disciple use doors instead of bypassing it. I guess it is made for self-discipline: to follow the rules that master set despite how ridiculous it seems.
Also, the biggest message in this part is a first point in a Buddhist code of behavior: ""Refrain from harming living being"". Master punishes his disciple the same way as he tortured the animals so he could feel what he did and warns him: ""If one of them dies you will carry the rock in your heart for the rest of your life"".SummerSummer is often associated with youth, freedom, and pleasure.
We can notice the symbolism of the doors once again here. As he becomes more tempted with desires, he breaks the habit of using the doors. When he crawls to the girl he steps over his master and avoids both doors. There was no actual prohibition for any kind of action, no matter if it is a lust or crime. 'Door' gives you a choice if you want to take that action or not, but once those 'doors' fall you will stop being conscious about those choices.
As monk learns about the relationships between his disciple and the guest, he says that it is natural. However, he sends the guest back to her home as ""lust awakens the desire to possess, and that awakens the intent to murder"". But doors have already fallen for the disciple and he leaves following his desires.FallFall is a decline of life when nature goes to its 'death'.
The disciple is also in the lowest point of his life. Full of anger and rage, after revenging his unfaithful wife, he comes back to the temple.
He feels lost, his mind is not peaceful, and he feels like he has no control over himself. Sealing his eyes, mouth, and ears with a character 'Close' he possibly wanted to abstract away and remove all the senses. His master makes him to carve the heart sutra on a wooden floor using a weapon, with which he committed a murder to bring the peace to his heart back. The frame where the monk hits the can with a rock that detectives could not shoot shows the high level of self-control and mindfulness. After the disciple finishes carving, he seems to regain the peace in his mind.
Fall represents the down of the monk's life too. The snake swimming away the boat after monk's death may mean the transmigration of his soul and rebirth.
You see the snakes a lot throughout the film. Master warns the boy about abundance of snakes in the beginning of the movie, boy kills the snake, he notices the mating snakes in his adolescence, the monk's soul transmigrates into the snake. It may be the referral to the Nagi, the divine creatures from the Buddhist mythology.WinterWinter represents the death and still life. As the disciple comes back to the temple he founds it in abandoned state and learns about the death of his master. He collects the Sarira of his master and places into the ice Buddha statue as a relic.
Another meaning of the winter is a confrontation. Harsh weather tempers the mind and raises the resilience. He starts the confrontation the 'evil' in himself trying to temper both his body and mind. He still 'carries the rock in his heart' from his past actions and he is mindful about it. Meanwhile another person could not confront the 'harsh winter' in her life and leaves her baby to the monk.and... SpringLife is cyclic. This is a law of samsara.
As seasons of the year replaces each other there is a younger generation that replaces the older ones.
Peace came to the life of the monk as spring relived the nature after the long winter. There is a new sprout that is just developing his buds. And he is yet to learn about life around him, about violence, about love, about temptations and desires. And he is yet to carry his own rocks in his heart.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
169,sherniyaztolganbayev,The Gates with No Walls,10,11 February 2021,"Kim Ki-duk directed the South Korean film ""Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter, and... Spring"" in 2003. The film tells a story of a Buddhist monk and his apprentice, who live in the lake's floating temple. As the Buddhist disciple grows, he faces various challenges on his way. However, according to the Buddhist teachings, existence is not a linear or transient entity; it is a cycle of life, death, and rebirth, accompanied by suffering. This philosophy serves as a framework of the character's path: the cycle will resume at the very end. Despite the peaceful setting of an isolated forest with picturesque views and a light tone of the initial minutes, the film raises complicated, even intricate, yet compelling questions about life, death, and everything in-between. However, what makes this film an outstanding example of visual art is excellent storytelling and the combination of symbolism, paradoxes in Buddhism, and perhaps the inexplicable tranquility even during the tensest episodes. This review will attempt to present a novel viewpoint about the film, namely, that the film's central idea revolves around the blurred boundaries between various ideas relating to human existence: innocence and cruelty; love and lust; the sacred and the secular.The film's first scene depicts the opening gates that are not attached to any walls (Kim, 2003, 0:01:28). The gates are freestanding and serve as a barrier between the lake with the temple and the rest of the world. There is no indication of a person who opened them, and throughout the film, there will be times when the gates will magically open or close by themselves. However, such instances will not necessarily stand out and be easily spotted. Somehow, this particular magical element is embedded into the reality of the film. These gates illustrate the first example of a blurred boundary between the spiritual-magical world and the profane reality. The temple is not enclosed, not physically separated from the forest, there is no fence, yet all the film characters abide by the unspoken rule - every time they want to go to the temple or see the master, they go only through the gate.
The film proceeds to a significant example, which will set the tone for the unfolding events later in the film. Sometimes it is hard to distinguish between the poisonous herb and the one that can heal the sick. How can one tell the difference if they look almost identical? ""Look closely. Here at the tip, you can see a white line"" says the master to his apprentice (Kim, 2003, 0:08:47). It is notable how easily the master spots the poisonous herb and throws it away. The apprentice observes and then light-heartedly asks, picking another bundle: ""Is this one alright to eat?"" (Kim, 2003, 0:09:02). The young apprentice has a lot to learn, but the master is patient and is willing to teach him everything he knows. Although the herbs will not be mentioned anymore later, this example prepares viewers for deeper insights and acts as a precursor for further questions.Moreover, it touches upon one of the fundamental concepts in Buddhism - suffering. The painful death would have been inevitable if not for the knowledge and attentiveness of the master. Once again, signifying the blurring between two closely related concepts.Keeping in mind the herbs' lesson, the young apprentice plays with the dog and the next day goes to the forest to play with other animals. First the fish, then the frog and the snake - all of them were tied to a stone one after another - such an amusing entertainment for the young disciple. The viewer might even forget that it is no longer an innocent game; it is cruel or even torturous. One can wonder how the young apprentice did not know the difference between those two, but the earlier example with herbs showed the boy's indifference and absentmindedness in the face of such decisions. The boy can neither differentiate between a poisonous herb and medicinal herb nor between game and violence. That is why the young apprentice will carry the stone in his heart for the rest of his life. A small mistake will transform into a heavy burden.Finally, the film presents the blurriest border of all - the one between love and lust. Love heals the sick, as the master put it, it can be the ""right medicine"" (Kim, 2003, 0:47:27). However, it is not valid on all occasions, as under the influence of love, person's mind can be clouded, and one will not notice how love will transform into lust and the desire to possess. According to the Buddha's Four Noble Truths, there is a cause of suffering, which lies in the attachment. Indeed, the disciple will eventually acknowledge his feelings to the young girl and run away, succumbing to his feelings. The disciple will not try to end suffering, and he will fall into the trap of killing his wife at the end. Only after violating the first of the Five Precepts (Do not kill) will the disciple return to the ""right"" path.Eventually, the master will die, leaving the temple behind, and his disciple will take his place after returning from prison. The disciple becomes the master, and there will be another young apprentice. The cycle continues; however, some of the questions are yet to be answered. Will they make the same mistakes all over again? Will there be the same amount of suffering, or is there hope? Will the master teach the apprentice the blurred boundaries of human existence? However, one thing is clear: just as the gates with no walls secure the spiritual world from the profane reality, the blurred boundaries will persist.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
170,chingu0,This is the story of life.,10,29 June 2010,"When I plan to see a movie, I usually choose a fun and simple one. Besides I don't see the same movie again even though it is very amusing. However this film is totally different from the other ones I have watched. It tells me a story about 'a person's normal life', a part of nature, and makes me reflect on my life. Just like a fairy tale Grandmother tells me, I never feel sick and tired of this movie no matter how many times I see it. While I am watching the movie, I feel as if I were in it and I contemplate my life, not the monk's life (main character), in a serene state of mind.The story starts off as 'spring', symbolizing 'an early years of life', and an old monk's (Yeong-su Oh) leading a child one (Jong-ho Kim) to a right direction. He then becomes a young man (Jae-kyeong Seo) who is interested in girls and he falls in love with a beautiful girl (Yeo-jin Ha) who visits his place. Finally he leaves the temple looking for her. After committing a terrible murder, he (Young-min Kim) returns to the temple but is arrested. When he (Ki-duk Kim) comes back to the temple after being released from prison, he finds that his teacher monk is already dead. One day a baby comes there and again spring begins.Unlike many other movies, this movie expresses what it wants to say by showing the changes of seasons and not excessive acting rather than many lines between characters. Amazing cinematography made me feel like I was admiring oriental paintings throughout the film. The smooth and peaceful changes of the seasons showed a humans' whole life and the lake surrounding round the temple also made a perfect match. Especially, along with nature giving a silent lesson, the old monk's teaching was very touching because he usually waited for the younger monk to get spiritual enlightenment by himself. It seemed that this movie tried to show that humans experience birth, love, lust, pain, jealousy, despair, death and rebirth as nature is constantly changing. I can't help saying the exquisite and harmonious landscape of the temple, the lake and colors of seasons is the piece de resistance.The plot in this movie was more of a narrative structure. As time flowed away together with a change of season, the young main character experienced a checkered life. The development of the plot was shown through the change of the scenery around the floating temple. Spring full of vividness, summer of lust, fall - the season of harvest, and winter of loneliness and beauty are humans' normal lives.The music in this film also played the similar role to dialog. Thus, even when actors didn't express any feelings or emotion with dialog, music said more than words. The music without too high or too low pitch like natural sounds and Korean traditional music, 'Arirang,' touched something deep in my heart and illuminated my life.Finally, my favorite things about this movie are the doors as a gate and in the temple . The doors had no walls so we could look inside from both sides of the doors even though the doors were closed. The old monk and the young one always used the doors, not the passage of its sides but when the young monk couldn't curb his lust for a girl, he used the side passage. It meant he couldn't control himself.Most people do not live as a monk, so the whole plot may seem to be unrealistic and very far-fetched but this movie illuminates humans' innermost problems, not two monks' lives. To anyone who goes through difficulties in their lives or wants to find comfort in something, I highly recommend seeing this film again and again.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
171,josephvkellyiii,The Arbitrariness and Absolute Necessity of Doorways,9,22 May 2005,"This movie alone challenged my interpretation of film; basically the very fundamental framework of film-making -- the aperture -- is itself a doorway to the experience of film, a meta-language within the common visual dialect, and now thanks to Ki-Duk Kim's gentle tutelage, it illuminates an understanding of the harrowing and impossible role of the subjective experience in the grander scheme of the nature of this world we inhabit.Ki-Duk Kim's stage in this piece of illustrative theater, a floating monastery, is itself a 1.66:1 framework, first framed by the 1.33:1 of an ornate gate which reveals the stage framed in the grander and somehow less accessible (and impossibly fractal) proscenium of lake-tree- mountain-sky.Thus Ki-Duk tells us within the first 2 minutes that beauty is the intractable edge between nature and sentience; while many have seen this as a ""morality play"" or a ""Buddhist parable"" of the evils of attachment and desire, we are quickly assured (and sometimes even jarringly corrected) that oftentimes morality as we view it -- with its opinions, its judgments of good and evil -- is really itself a distraction. In its place -- a rare commodity it seems -- simple empathy will suffice; empathy say with a fish tied to a rock.But alas, this state of a simple empathic morality cannot be sustained. In the western culture, we are familiar with a fall from grace -- it's parallel in the Ki-Duk universe is the awakening of desire that all sentient beings must encounter. For instance, the old monk does not chide his pupil for succumbing to his temptation; instead he plays a silly trick (one that indeed gives me a chilling flashback to Peter Greenaway's ""Drowning By Numbers"". In fact, I could not flee the fear of submersion and drowning which permeates this film, nor could I cast away the similarities between Ki-Duk Kim's and Greenaway's early -- i.e. not composited -- visual storytelling).The old monk is not at all moralistic about desire and its fulfillment -- he admits that it has healing purposes. He is clear, however, that desire as natural as it is, leads to possessiveness which leads to murder. Desire, because of its selfish possessive nature, precludes empathy, and thus leads to ""murder"" whether literal or allegorical (in order to live we must make others suffer).This film touches many more facets of human existence -- repentance, the inescapable cyclical nature of time, simple compassion in the face of personal hopelessness. In addition, it challenges our understanding of film -- both in its manufacture and consumption. At what point does the framing of the narrative become observable; which framing is intended, and which framing do we bring to our observation of it?","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
172,corporalmortification,Long and slow but pretty,3,19 April 2011,"This film bored me all the way through. It was a bit like watching a beautiful documentary of a small family living in hut on a lake in Tibet. But, somebody hit the mute button and I'm too lazy to get the remote. So, I'm left to imagine what I'm supposed to be getting out of this movie with my ample time between interesting events and/or plot progression.Imagery yes, story no. It was very Buddhist, but that is all. The plot moved at a snail's pace. The movie went mostly without dialog. It was like a 15 minute comic book had been turned into a full-length movie.All picture no plot. Not as offensive as Twilight though.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
173,earinsound,beautifully made,9,31 January 2004,"This is the only film I've seen by this director, so I can't compare this film with his others. ""Spring, Summer..."" is a moral tale--somewhat simplistic, but nevertheless effective. It's a film that never ends. I say this because the movie merely illustrates one link in an eternal tale (this is suggested by the end). One belief in Buddhism is of ""eternal recurrence."" Karma. It's also of a man who pains himself to seek to rectify his mistakes, his selfishness, his egotism. This in turns produces a much needed balance in his life.I do wonder about one thing: I thought Buddhist monks were forbidden to touch women. Is this not so in Korea?","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
174,kristian-34,Terrific movie!,10,23 March 2004,"This movie keeps taking surprising turns, and whenever you think you've got it figured out, it changes again. It tries to show how craving for sensory pleasures will ultimately, and inevitably, bring you suffering. Everything, and everyone, comes to an end. Knowing nothing about the film beforehand certainly helped me keep a rather naive state of mind throughout, much like the boy in the movie itself, so you might not be as surprised as I was at the turn of events. However, this movie will definitely make you think about life. If you're into Buddhism, it's spot on. If not, you'll still be able to find a lot of interesting points being made. Each season shows a different part of their lives, and even a different degree of suffering. It's not as gloomy as it sounds, though. I found a lot of positive energy in it, as well as charm and humour. Don't miss this movie!","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
175,us4divas,Visually beautiful and quietly wise!!,10,5 April 2004,"Visually beautiful and quietly wise!! I like movies that offer me a different kind of experience, an occasion to ponder, and a topic to discuss with others. This unexpected gem of a movie met all these criteria of a worthwhile film.  Watching this film was more than just a movie-going experience, it was an enlightenment, a meditation, an experience on an epic scale. Simplicity, beauty, and genius describe the work. You fall into it, experience it, and resurface somewhat differently than how you had fallen in. If you want to experience a film so profound and exotic yet so basic and naked, I recommend this film wholeheartedly. You will be subtlely captured.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"

177,zwgeem,Avoiding Negative Karma,10,1 June 2004,"Last Saturday, I visited a movie theater in Bethesda to watch the Korean movie ""Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter ... And Spring."" When ""The Passion of The Christ"" on Ash Wednesday was still lingering in my eyes, the new movie gave another uncommon impression.In the Mel Gibson's film, I ruminated again the meaning of Jesus Christ's redemption on behalf of mankind, from the story where he was born of the Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, and died. Thus the movie just visually intensified the familiar story from the bible, Good Friday's passion play, or J.S. Bach's passion music.On the other hand, what is the meaning of the Kim KiDuk's movie occurring in a small temple on the tranquil waters of a pond? The movie does not give any clear conclusion like rewarding the good and punishing the wicked. Instead, rather vague ending becomes the topic of meditation for the audience.Based on private analysis from the viewpoint of Buddihism, the movie teaches the lesson that you should not do any bad action which causes negative karma in transmigrating world.Spring anticipates summer, summer does autumn, autumn does winter, and winter repeatedly does spring. In this circulative nature, one human, as a part of nature, sometimes gets pleasure in bothering others. In the movie, a boy monk takes pleasure in tying animals with a heavy pebble. This misconduct which deprived animals' lives is subject to boomerang. However, the chief monk who wants to prevent the nemesis sacrifices himself by cremation and the boy monk is born again to live another new life.Likewise, does our evil conduct to others or destruction to nature become a bad karma? While Christianity teaches that whoever repents and believes in Jesus can be forgiven and go to heaven, Buddhism says that as a man sows so he shall reap in the life to come. This also seems to become the major lesson of this film.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
178,RobHunter,Trans-cultural insight into ultimate reality.,10,3 September 2004,"It is rare today to be able to find a movie that is not only emotionally moving, but is also so very spiritually insightful. I only know a little about Buddhism (and being more familiar with its religious details would have made my experience even more meaningful, I'm sure), but something inside of me resonated as I followed the life of the two primary characters, watching them handle everyday human experiences and knowing in my own heart the universal struggles they were facing. I have never, that I remember, left a theater feeling as much at peace about life as I did after I saw this film. The scenery, characters, and life principles are all worth meditating on.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
179,nehahn08,Best Movie Ever,10,25 October 2004,"This is probably the best movie ever made. The humanity and drama of it is profound. This is by far my favorite movie. Kim Ki-Duk is a self-taught master. The visuals and sound, including ambient noise and the flow of dialogue are some of the most peaceful and mesmorizing images you will see. The main theme of the song is fantastic. This is what movies are supposed to be, original, unique pieces of art. The man-made lake that this film was shot on is one of the most beautiful places I have ever seen, and Kim Ki-Duk take full advantage of this setting. I do not speak Korean, and saw the movie with English subtitles (of which are few), I do not know if that takes away anything from the movie, though I am sure it does. What a sublime buddhist story. I highly recommend this movie.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"

It is from a Buddhist perspective but everyone can learn something from this movie. It has some great moral teachings in it that makes this movie both deep and soothing at the same time. The story is easy to follow and is a beautiful story. The environment and scenes was absolutely stunning to look at and it made the movie so much better. Every frame is like a painting.But I have some negative opinions as well: A bit too slow pace for my taste therefore the 7/10.It follows the Zen school of Buddhism (maybe that is the reason the movie is slow) but the dramatic scenes is kind of boring. But this film is an nice,pretty and well acted movie. I absolutely think you should watch this movie.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
181,brat_boy0,Nature has a nature to repeat itself.,10,29 January 2016,"The plot of the movie revolves around an old monk (master) and a young monk (disciple), living on a floating house at an isolated lake.As we grow up, we go through certain changes at different stages of life. The movie has similarly depicted those changes, in a beautiful way of seasons. While the young monk grows up, he goes through various life learning experiences respective of his age and finally leave.The movie is about how our life goes on to have different seasons and don't end there. Nature repeats its seasons, year and year after. Likewise, the circle of life continues to have the same stages in a different form, through the following generations. Even if the monk was living isolated, oblivious of what in the rest of the world is going, he had to go through same seasons of life as we all do. Here, the thing to learn is that, irrespective of what our future generations will do, the basic human characters are always going to be there and repeat it as someone else.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"

183,daearen,Challenger of belief systems,10,27 December 2014,"Perhaps the year 2000 heralded the inspirational decline at Hollywood and a new dawn in Asian cinema. ""Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"" is one of those movies that leads someone to this conclusion. Masterfully set amidst breathtaking landscapes, brilliantly inspired Ki-duk Kim manages to blend flawlessly the western central doctrine, expressed in Freud's theories, with the oriental belief in Karma leaving the viewer at the end with a strong taste of Heisenberg's principle of uncertainty. Kept simple, with few lines of dialog, the emphasis falls exclusively on the visual aspect. By using the symbolism of the collective unconscious, the movie challenges the beliefs of both oriental and western viewers in a subtle and elegant manner.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
184,munchkin-17,This movie is a sumptuous feast for the eyes..,7,26 May 2006,"..but an appalling advertisement for Buddhism (and I am no Buddhist). There is much to enjoy in the superb visual richness of this film, but I was left deeply concerned about its presentation of Buddhist principles and practice. If you hope see a film about a novice Buddhist monk being taught the great mysteries, learning to respect all forms of life, and exploring the nature of cause and effect in dialogues with his 'master' you will be deeply disappointed. Instead viewers are privy to a few religious rituals that fail miserably in preparing a novice monk for a compassionate, wise or peaceful adult life. Time and time again in the movie the novice monk fails to relate compassionately to either himself or those about him, and there are several scenes of simple (but repeated and extended) cruelty which made me cringe as a human being.I found the various subtexts of the film (as I saw it) disturbing : that desire for sex (ie. desire for union of polarities & transcendence) is essentially a path that leads to suffering for all, and that the only way to find redemption for oneself is through time and ritual, rather than through practicing self-knowledge, kindness, and observing the nature of cause and effect.Ultimately I found this quite a depressing film about the potential of the human spirit. The message of the film, that human beings can_only_learn through suffering, worries me most. The movie begins and ends with a human being causing suffering to other sentient beings (admittedly through ignorance). That (to me) shows very little insight into the real beauty and essence of Buddhism, and it's also not very hopeful at all! After seeing this film I want to be a tree, for they have the most beautiful, untroubled existence in the film. The scenery in this movie merits much of my seven star rating.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
185,danagabitova,"The ""Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter and ... Spring (2003)"" is South Korean movie about inhabitants of the floating Buddhist monastery at the center of the lake.",9,4 February 2018,"Directed by Kim Ki-duk, and had a lot of positive reviews around the world. This movie tells the story of a person by showing the four seasons of his life which has changed him and taught the philosophy of the Buddhism from his childhood to the older ages. Throughout his life, the Master at the temple was his guide and influenced him. 
From the start of the movie, an everyday routine of Buddhist monks are shown. Throughout the film, the older master is a representation of a true Buddhist monk, whose views of the world differs from the boy's. He tries to teach the boy through the lesson about pain and guilt, cruel consequences of desire, releasing the anger and about reaching inner peace, but already without being beside. At the end, we can see that the little boy in the past became a master and from spring the cycle begins again with another little apprentice. Through this cycle, I understood that being a person with inner peace is not inborn, but reachable.
I want to talk about one interesting thing in this movie. The door which opens the view to the floating monastery, and another two doors in it are actually do not serve as simple doors continued with walls. They are standing alone and anyone could just walk around them. But, mostly people use them as actual doors that help us to enter certain place. Even in the monastery, people sleep behind the doors, open them to look at someone. In my point of view, walking through the door is an established tradition, while breaking this rule is going on a string of desire. I think this symbolizes the teenager, who made a decision in the wake of hormones, and had unexpected consequences.
I think the camerawork of this movie should be mentioned. Watching this movie was pleasure because of soft transitions between scenes and stable shooting. Also, cameraman showed the beautiful nature of that forest surrounding the lake and hills. When picture is enjoyable, perception of the movie is always better.
The quality of the sound was also good, though the film was shot in 2003. However, the musical accompaniment was not rich. Sometimes, the Buddhist music (?) or sounds come out, but basically they focused on life sounds. 
Ki-duk said of the film: ""I intended to portray the joy, anger, sorrow and pleasure of our lives through four seasons and through the life of a monk who lives in a temple on Jusan Pond surrounded only by nature.""
To sum up, I would like to say that this movie by Kim Ki-duk is very touching and realistic. All these teachings give an opportunity to all people to get to know with Buddhist religious traditions, philosophy and life of the monks. The story tells us that every monk become himself and reaches inner peace through experiencing and realizing the importance of it. But I think this can be related to anyone, despite the religion, nationality and gender.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
186,bogdannick,A beautiful and very simple allegory about thresholds we must overpass in life...,9,31 July 2006,"This is the second film directed by Kim Ki-Duk that I saw. The first one was Bin-jip and I can say that I really like both of them.Despite the very long and difficult to remember title (Spring, summer, autumn, winter...and spring), in the final, seeing the film is a rewarding experience.First of all I love in this film the idea of an floating hermitage (monastery) in the middle of a lake. All the ""action"" (and there is little action, but more frames of action) takes place on this hermitage. In the beginning of the film there are only an old monk and a little boy (his protégé) in this monastery. Being surrounded by water gives the sensation of isolation from the outer world, a space of loneliness where man can resonate perfect with the nature. The door that opens at the beginning of each one of the five seasons could be interpreted as a gate, linking the two worlds: our world and their world. To go-in and go-out in the idyllic space where the hermitage floats every people must go through this gate.In fact the film is a very simple allegory about the cyclic evolving life. The beginning and the final of the film encloses a cycle: in the first season we find the old monk and the little boy; the boy grows-up, evolves, learns, suffers, loves, is punished and self-punishes him for his mistakes. After all these experiences the boy, an adult now, is capable to guide through life another human being. In winter he is the adult monk and he has a little boy as a protégé. And the cycle starts all over.Also the film is about the thresholds that we must overpass in our life from the childhood till the adulthood, and the fact that these thresholds are very similar for all of us.Allover the movie there are very subtle Buddhist symbols like the five animals (a dog, a rooster, a cat, a snake and finally a turtle) each one of them being associated with one season.The film is a superbly visual experience and has a musical theme that repeats in the beginning of each of the five seasons creating (for me at least) a dreaming sensation.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"

It is not necessary to put talking scenes in a film if you add environment, events and music.Although i gave 9 of 10 for this film, it is in my top ten list. I highly recommend anyone wants to see something different and soulful.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
189,abdissamadaldanazar,Cycle of Mistakes and Lessons,10,9 September 2018,"""Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter...and Spring"" is a breathtaking and fascinating movie that tells a story of a Buddhist monk and his disciple. A perfectly shot masterpiece that ideally transfers emotions and ideas through carefully constructed dialogues, scenes and music. 
The film is a representation of a never-ending cycle of life shown through the struggles of the Master and his disciple. Beginning with the disciple's early life and his education, moving on to his first love and unbearable struggles of love that further resulted in a murder, flowing into the death of the Master and ultimately ending with the disciple becoming a master himself. Only in ""again Spring"" a viewer may notice the same pattern of human behavior, whereby ""lust awakens the desire to possess, and that awakens the intent to murder"". 
And the movie shows the aforementioned lesson not only on the example of innocent animals, but on the example of relationships as well. The disciple's lust and desire to possess led him to a murder of his wife, after she decided to leave him. Therefore, the movie gives a fundamental philosophical lesson of too much emotions leading to catastrophic results. 
Despite this critical lesson, the movie ends with another one: life is a never-ending cycle of people constantly making mistakes and learning. On the example of the disciple, we see growth of a person, more precisely spiritual growth. Where a person surrendered to lust and murder learned his mistakes and ultimately became a monk and a master to a boy. Another example is the 'new' disciple, a boy who just as his 'new' master harms animals resulting in their death. Hence, just as the name of the movie, this film symbolizes the cycle of life with constant mistakes and lessons. 
Another major detail to be mentioned is the deeper Buddhist philosophy shown in the film, particularly philosophy of Mahayana branch. For Mahayana Buddhists, Arhats (advanced disciples of Buddha) are those that help others attain nirvana, or in other words social workers of Buddha. Mahayana Buddhists also believed that every individual is able to attain nirvana with the help of Arhats. Philosophy shown in this movie resembles that of Mahayana, whereby the master represents an Arhat and his disciple being an ordinary individual in the very beginning, attaining nirvana during 'Winter' and becoming a master to another boy in 'again Spring'. With the cycle, this movie also shows philosophy very much similar to that of Mahayana Buddhists'. 
One more important message that one might interpret having watched this film is the law of cause and effect, or in other words 'what goes around comes back around' law. The law of karma, if you wish, is represented throughout the whole movie, beginning with the master giving a hot and strong lesson to his disciple ending with the new disciple making the same mistakes just as his 'new' master did before. This yet another important lesson is beautifully and masterfully represented throughout the movie teaching its viewers one more crucial lesson of philosophy of life. 
One of the most beautiful and meaningful things about this movie that I would like to mention is the scene of the temple flowing around the lake. The rapidly shot scene is meant to represent the pace of life, more precisely the swiftness of the cycle of life. This peculiar scene reminded me of the importance of life joy. In the rushing pace of today's world people often forget to enjoy and cherish little things in their life. In the rush for a successful career, houses, cars, people become blind to what they already possess. To avoid this issue, I find this scene to be a great reminder of how fast-going life is and how important it is to dedicate yourself to truly important things. Material possessions come and go while inner peace is difficult to obtain. 
With regards to cinematography of the film it is undoubtedly a masterpiece.

190,yerassylassylbekov,Eternality of the life,9,13 September 2018,"How many at the same time silent and simple movies did you watch, so that you got a great feelings and deep thought about the meaning of our life in this world? I will venture to assume that you can mention only a couple of movies you remember, if any. How a silent and simple movie can be a philosophical and give a food for deep thoughts about the existence of the human being? Isn't it intriguing? If not, you definitely should watch this movie, as it offers so many emotions and makes you think, although, the film is not completely silent, and it has some occasional dialogues, still, they are so rare that you will not realize much difference between totally silent movies and this one. What is more, the movie is full of metaphors, a feature which can often be found in other Korean movies. Even the title of film is itself a metaphor, referring to the five stages of the human being. The movie starts with the spring, and it is a first phase of the human, a childhood, warm and cheerful period. Main characters are old monk and young boy, who live in a hut and follow the day-to-day duties and strict discipline of the Buddhist religion. Every attribute of the hut demonstrates the total adherence of the old and wise monk and young boy to the religion. For instance, doors in the hut and by lakeside are illustrated as a symbolic rather than prescriptive, demonstrating the discipline. On the other hand, hut plays the role of a self, which controls our mind and body in conscious condition. When a person is out of self, he commits a crime and does bad things, same as with hut, when young boy killed frog and snake when he was out of the hut. 
When comes a summer, an energetic and romantic period of the human, a youth, a young sick girl comes to the hut of grown up boy and monk to get a help of the Buddha and get rid of the heaviness in her soul. This season is illustrated with the period, when boy recognizes his lust and falls in love, and consequently do mistakes, which will cost his future. Here, doors are again given as a symbol of the discipline, which a boy brakes first time crossing the imaginable wall past the door in the night to lie down next to a young girl. Afterwards, a boy makes a critical choice to leave the hut to follow that young girl, symbolically leaving his self, and it will determine and change rest of his years. 
The next stage of the human development is demonstrated in the form of autumn, depressed and bewildered after the continuous search of short-term enjoyment and pleasure, a maturity. A boy is now an adult man, who became a wiser enough person to understand his lifechanging decisions, and tries to get back to his hut, to his self, and restore everything. However, he struggles to solve his problems, which remind him a choice he made in his youth every day as a nightmare. At the end of the season he ends up suffering a penalty for his wrong deeds.
Winter, which is cold and calm, refers to the advanced age of the person. He incurred a punishment, and he is now old and wise, as was old monk in his childhood. He reached a stage, when he is conscious enough to return to his roots, his self, and to his hut. And he returns to his symbolic hut and continues the old ceremonies, which he learned in his early childhood. Interesting moment here is that a wild snake, which was a victim of a man when he was a young boy, becomes a ""pet"" in the hut, while old monk had different but more domestic pets in each season, including cock, and cat. Moreover, man becomes the reason of another death of human completely unintentionally. All of these symbolize a karma, a spiritual principle of cause and effect in Buddhist religion. 
The last period of the human is illustrated as a spring, again warm and cheerful period. New born baby grows up to a young boy and becomes the mate of the man, and follower of the Buddhist religion, identically, as in his own childhood. Interestingly, the actors, which play both children are a one person, thus symbolizing the idea that life is eternal. Another metaphor, which was one of the most powerful ones in this movie is the game of a new child, who plays the same game of killing symbolically the same animals: frog, snake, and fish. It again reminds us about the karma, that everything what we do in our lives returns to us soon or later. 
In general, although movie does not have many dialogues and very simple in action, and even frank in some moments, it gives lots of emotions and makes to meditate for a moment about our life, our decisions, and our consciousness. I would rate this film 9 out of 10 and strongly recommend to watch it, as it is about a human life in a broad sense rather than just a Buddhism or any other religious prescriptions.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"
