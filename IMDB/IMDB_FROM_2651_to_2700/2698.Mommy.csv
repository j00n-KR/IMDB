0,SnoopyStyle,volatile performances,7,15 September 2015,"Diane 'Die' Després is an outrageous widow struggling with her troubled volatile son Steve after getting kicked out of the detention center. There is a new law to institutionalize disturbed people but Die won't hear of it. Her male boss is gone and the new female boss is immune to her tricks. After a violent outburst by Steve, their mousy neighbor Kyla comes over to help out. She's a teacher on sabbatical suffering from speech problems.These are volatile performances. At 30 minutes, there is a crazy confrontation that takes the movie to another level. The middle does meander a bit. I think a few violent confrontations would be quite compelling and would add to the reason why Die ultimately does in the end. It's also a bit too extended. I recommend this for the great volatile acting.",Mommy
1,Horst_In_Translation,"Impressive given the filmmaker's age, okay by general standards",6,9 December 2019,"""Mommy"" (the title is linked to a necklace the protagonist is wearing and even if it may sound and look sweet, it is still a direct connection to the violence linked with the moment she gets it) is a Canadian French-language (not French French, but Canadian French, no surprise as it is set in Canada, made by a Canadian filmmaker and all three leads are Canadians) movie from 2014, so this one has its 5th anniversary this year already and what stands out the most about it perhaps is that the writer and director is Montreal-born Xavier Dolan, who was only 25 when this came out and still it is his fifth full feature film already. That definitely explains why many see/saw him as a bit of a prodigy, when it comes to his profession, especially because he is pretty much always also the one who comes up with the screenplays for his movies and not rarely he also plays central characters and he does so actually not just in his own movies. So he is really really active it seems and has been for years that I hope he won't suffer from exhaustion or burnout at some point. Anyway, his movie here is one in which he does not act and it runs for almost 2.5 hours, so very long, which is not too unusual for Dolan and it is by far not even his longest work. Still a massive running time and the good news is that it did not feel that long I'd say. Which makes sense because I believe that this is the movie with the highest rating here on imdb from everything Dolan made. And if you take a look at the awards recption, it really is self-explanatory. The numbers I mean, over 50 wins and over 100 nominations in total. Massive.Now let's take a more in-depth look at the film at hand: The cast is really not too big. There are only 3 big players I would say in terms of screen time: Dorval (the title character), Clément (the neighbor) and Pilo (the son). That really is not a lot for such a running time. I mean there are supporting characters of course too like the neighbor's husband or the lawyer who is interested in the main character, but these really do not have a lot of screen time or overall impact, even if they are still more significant than those who only have one brief scene like for example the women who speaks to the central character at the very beginning. (But I do want to mention the girl that the boy sings this Italian song with at the club. She was amazing and really stole the scene and her voice was a thing of beauty too. I think I'm in love.) And still these two I mentioned had a somewhat major impact on the story like with the date that went wrong (kinda surprised Steve was with them, but I guess his mother did not know what else to do with him, where else to put him, especially as the man did not complain at all, maybe even encourage if I remember correctly) or at the end, when it is basically her husband's decision that the neighbor is going to leave town. But now let's focus a bit on the three protagonists as well as the key plot. Right at the beginning, the boy returns home with his mother and before that he was in state custody. That was a reference to the lines we get to read at the very start on the screen and these indicate that it could somewhat be a film that is critical about society, but I did not really feel like that honestly. It's much more of a character story. Anyway, when the boy gets home, things seem alright at first and the two are happy to be reunited, even if occasional outbursts (racism, violence, destruction) are inevitable. But the boy's real struggles in terms of anger become visual when he attacks his mother extremely violently and one could even say he tries to kill her. But this is when the neighbor, played by Clément, comes into play and she definitely turns out to be a soothing influence on the young man. Quite a surprise when we see her take care of his wounds. He also definitely expresses sexual interest in her right from the start, but when she puts him into his place after he grabs her boobs, he knows that he crossed a boundary and accepts it. This putting in place seems to be something he needs because even when he touches his mother's boobs on one occasion, she does not do so. She does not show him it's unacceptable. His ADHD and hyperactivity and anger problems are definitely too much for her to handle. Still things get better and better the longer the film goes and the three turn out to be a harmonic trio in which the boy seems to feel comfortable. There are moments that are shocking really like the choking scene I mentioned already and it can be said that the film moves back and forth between really shocking moments and really harmonic moments. Two examples for true harmony are the dancing scene with the three in the kitchen and also when he is pushing his shopping cart on the street and really enjoying himself while we see the two women on the boardwalk nearby. This was actually a nice contrast to early on when he was out buying groceries and stuff for himself and the mother says he stole it all and then it completely escalates.But yeah, eventually the harmony vanishes. Out of nowhere, we find out how unstable the boy is as he cuts deep into his wrist and has to be taken to the ER when the three of them are out shopping at a home improvement store. And from that moment on, things go really south again, even if initially it does not seem that way. They are out on a trip again, it seems all innocent, but then we see the mother get out of the car and return with three men in white vests who are instructed to take him to a mental institution. When he realizes, he runs of course and a wild fight ensues with lots of screaming and crying too, also from the mother of course, who now really questions her decision. Things escalate again there when the employees of said hospital are not able to calm him down and convince him to follow them. Eventually a taser does the job, which was also one of the most shocking moments of the film. At the end, we get all kinds of pseudo harmony. Steve is in a straightjacket making a call to his mother who is not present to accept it and he seems happy, but that is only because he is really seriously drugged. Then we see his mother again and we find out that since the incident at the hospital she and her neighbor did not have too much contact anymore, so their conversation has turned to fake basically as the mother pretends she is not sad about the neighbor's decision to leave town, but is happy for her that she gets to a big city. Honestly I thought in this scene that the mother was heavily drugged too with moodlifters or antidepressants, but apparently not, she was just acting. So quite a challenge for the actress to act twice you could say at the same time. And for the neighbor, pay attention to the speech impediment during this scene. Also, as for her friendship with the other woman (the title character), it appears that it cannot stand the test of time without the young man. Obviously, Mommy's words that she will visit the neighbor in her new town seem very unlikely. As for the speech impediment, it was literally gone when she was around her two new friends earlier during the film which shows how much she enjoyed their company. The moments when we hear her daughter for example call her (pay attention to how it is the other way around, normally it is mother calling daughter to stop playing and come in for dinner) or her husband she immediately struggles again with being able to get out the right words. So in the end, as sad as it may seem especially given the progress everybody was making, all are losers again and at very low states of happiness. No forced happy ending here, that much is safe.So overall, Dolan did a fine job. One thing that came to my mind here and also came to my mind when I watched other movies he made was how much he reminded me of Fassbinder. That one was also incredibly active as writer, director and actor in his pretty early years, though not as early as Dolan. And also the characters Dolan wrote reminded me sometimes of modern versions of Fassbinder's. I'd be really surprised if the young Canadian filmmaker would not list RWF as one of his idols and inspirations. Plus music is always a key factor in their works. There were some nice song selections in this film here, not just the one by Dido early on. Or that both seem workaholics. I do hope though things eventually do not go as bad for Dolan health-wise as they did for Fassbinder. He was always on the edge. There are more parallels between the two I think, such as both filmmakers often casting the same actors for their movies. Maybe you will see these similarities yourself when you check out this film and other works from Dolan. And have seen some of Fassbinder's stuff. I should not take this for granted really only because I have, for after all I am from his country and he is still considered sort of an icon these days here and many people know him, even many who weren't even born when he died back in the early 1980s. Just like myself. So back to this film here now: Like I said in the title of my review already, it deserves a thumbs-up for sure, even if I do believe that the rating is a bit too high. Truly outstanding moments I did not see too many here and I was not on the edge of my seat too frequently either. But I was kinda baffled how full the showing was. I've been to this theater frequently and I don't think this room was ever that filled, there were even people sitting on the floor. Dolan seems to have a loyal following and fanbase it seems, especially in the LBGT community here. And probably everywhere else too. So yeah, not one of the best films from 2014 and also not my favorite Dolan film, probably not even top3, but I give it a thumbs-up all in all. Go watch if you don't mind the length.",Mommy
2,kosmasp,Family issues,9,6 September 2015,"This movie feels real! It actually feels like someone secretly just filmed all this and then edited it. The performances are raw and the story is actually simple, but very gripping. A boy who cannot escape what he is and what he does. A mother who loves her kid, but is incapable of helping him. And a neighbor who seems to be the solution (or is she just a facade?).Whatever the case, the movie is strong and if you can get with it, you are in for a very strong emotional ride. Superbly acted and played, I don't want to say much about where this is going, because you could argue not much is happening ... but there is, if you like a good drama, that is about characters rather than fancy effects or explosions. If that sounds like something you want to see, go for it",Mommy
3,evanston_dad,Phenomenal,10,10 November 2020,"I had heard magnificent things about this 2014 film by Xavier Dolan, and I have to say after getting around to see it for myself that all of the praise is justified.""Mommy"" is anchored by three absolutely phenomenal performances by Anne Dorval, Antoine Olivier Pilon, and Suzanne Clement. It tells the story of a mother's fierce and at times borderline inappropriate love for her delinquent son and a shy neighbor with a sketchy past who enters their closed circle and bonds with both of them. Dolan plays around with aspect ratios, filming most of the movie in claustrophobic squares and rectangles, but occasionally and gloriously opening up the frame when the troubled youth's world shows signs of promise. The movie explores the impossible and heartbreaking decisions parents must sometimes make for the sake of their children, and the ending Dolan chooses for each of his characters is emotionally stirring in its own unique way.Grade: A+",Mommy
4,anaconda-40658,Mother Figure.,8,19 June 2015,"Mommy (2014): Dir: Xavier Dolan / Cast: Anne Dorval, Antoine-Olivier Pilon, Suzanne Clement, Patrick Huard, Alexandre Goyette: Emotionally charged French Canadian drama about responsibility. Anne Dorval plays 40th single mother Diana Despres who removes her son Steve, played by Antoine-Olivier Pilon, from the institution for which he set fire to a cafeteria, seriously injuring another boy. He has violent outbursts and constant mood changes but also a love for music where his mind is free. Suzanne Clement plays neighbour Kyla, school teacher who is on hiatus due to a stutter. She is emotionally detached from her husband yet finds a need at the Despres home when a violent outburst occurs. She agrees to tutor him, but ultimately becomes his friend when she matches his rage with a counter attack that is the single greatest moment in the film. He sits shocked, broken, and in tears while she notices a massive wet spot on her thigh where he urinated. Director Xavier Dolan seems to be somewhat quoting his earlier film I Killed My Mother, and he makes great use of music and locations. Well written with an ending that seems depressing and somewhat unresolved in terms of where Steve and Kyla stand. Dorval plays off the thick skin frustration of a single mother making every mistake. Pilon is fired up as Steve who channels communication through destruction. Clements steals the film as this timid neighbour with heart and understanding with a will not to break. Patrick Huard plays a lawyer and neighbour interested in Diane. Kyla's husband is unfortunately barely explored. Powerful film about failing at parenting or being parented. Score: 8 ½ / 10",Mommy
5,zetes,"Very good, but it kind of lives in the shadow of I Killed My Mother",8,1 February 2015,"The Quebecois wunderkind directs his fifth film in as many years. It bears a lot of similarities to his debut, I Killed My Mother. It's decidedly not the same movie, but the way it echoes that one makes this one feel a little bit like a shadow. It's a little too soon to be revisiting old ideas. Still, this is a good, nearly great movie. Mommy again features Anne Dorval as a mother of a teenage boy. Her big struggle here is not with her son's rebellion, but with some major behavioral problems. Played by Antoine-Olivier Pilon, Steve is a 15 year-old with some powerful ADHD. He can even grow violent when he gets in one of his moods (and Dorval is quite a bit smaller than he is). During one of these violent rages, a quiet neighbor (Suzanne Clement) attempts to help, and she ends up becoming a close friend to both Dorval and Pilon, almost a member of their family (meanwhile, her own family across the street stays mostly silent about her newfound relationship). Frankly, I don't think the neighbor character ever really worked. If not for Clement's very good performance, I think it would have stuck out as much worse than it actually feels in the film. It feels very much like Dolan wanted a big part for one of his favorite actresses, but I don't think the role ever makes much sense and is a little too showy (she's a stutterer because her son has died). The film never reaches the heights of I Killed My Mother (the autobiographical nature of that one made it extraordinarily powerful), but it's a strong movie. Dolan's filmmaking remains vibrant. Without a doubt, he's one of the brightest talents in cinema today.",Mommy
6,lasttimeisaw,Dolan's future cannot be brighter,8,6 September 2015,"Xavier Dolan, Canadian infant terrible's fifth feature, MOMMY is gratifyingly his maturest work to date, won the Jury Prize in Cannes last year, and gutsily challenges our traditional cinema habit by altering the frame to an idiosyncratic 1:1 aspect ratio - bar two exceptions of 16:9 ratio sequences involving a soul-liberating celebration of life and a fanciful imagination of a mother indulging in her proudest moments of his son, which is quite a bravura to pull off, centralises its characters and dramatises their interactions and emotions.Retracing to the central theme of his smash debut I KILLED MY MOTHER (2009, 7/10) at the age of 19, but sans the queer label, MOMMY is concentrated on Diane (Dorval), a middle-aged widow and his teenage son Steve (Pilon), who is diagnosed with ADHD and afflicted with a proclivity of violence and self-abuse, apart from other misconduct in the present Canada. Their intimate mother-son life-pattern has gone through an extensive scrutiny from Dolan's invading camera with a tagline like this - sometimes love cannot save one person, anticipates the finale. They fight and reconcile, confess their love but also swear to each other and even roughhouse, she has to walk on thin ice with him while he is recalcitrant and rebellious.Their volatile relationship has been wondrously balanced out since a new neighbour Kyla (Clément) barges into their life, her first intrusion happens exactly after a most violent incident could ever occurred between mother-and-son. Then the triangle starts to stabilise into a wholesome dynamism, Kyla, a compulsive stutter who claims to be a high school teacher on sabbatical and very evasive about her past, albeit she lives across the street with her husband and a young daughter. A semi-friend-semi-family liaison is luxuriantly budding between Kyla and the family, she home-schools Steve so that Diane can earn some extra money as a house cleaner, life is not easy, but all of them feel content and optimistic, they dance, bike/skateboarding, prepare food and dine together, here is when the first 16:9 ratio sequence exuberantly inserted literally by Steve extending the screen on his skateboard.When Diane receives a citation from court, due to a previous wrongdoing of Steve, which demands a great sum of compensation, the screen retreats back to the square frame, life is just a winding road, a tentative plan to befriend with their lawyer neighbour Paul (Huard), who has always been flirtatious towards Diane, goes awry thanks to the uncooperative Steve. Strife emerges again and after Steve's unsuccessful suicidal attempt (or just a way to raise attention and state his point, since who with a firm intent to die will cut his wrist in a packed supermarket?), Diane must make the most difficult decision after she ravishingly envisions a perfect future for Steve, the gorgeous-looking 16:9 section accompanied by Ludovico Einaudi's sublime EXPERIENCE is the long-waited high point of this intensive drama, Dolan's usual tricks - slow-motion, soft focus, close-up - are all consummately deployed in a fantasy we could only wish would be true for our protagonists. Not too soon we are sucked back to the grim reality, staring at the square again, a coercive separation, a heartrending goodbye and the ambiguous/unambiguous ending (Lana Del Rey's BORN TO DIE is the closing credit melody), after all, it is not a film for those faint-hearted.Within this close-knit cast, Dolan successfully sheds his pompous swagger to be overtly impressive and ostentatious which is often associated with a devil-may-care resolution among young filmmakers, and has trespassed the threshold of intolerance in HEARTBEATS (2010), my least favourite among his 5 features, instead, he patiently teases out the top-notch chemistry among his three main players, calculated in minute precision. Dorval, is utterly majestic to personify a stimulating mother image poles apart from I KILLED MY MOTHER, Diane has an uncouth and kitsch temperament which she cannot hide, then it materialises that it is a useful approach to communicate with her equally bad-mouthed son, but her unconditional love to Steve, sincere affinity with Kyla, and a strong faith in hope (the poor man's luxury), all marks her as a remarkable and vivid human being out of Dorval's outstanding dedication. Clément, another muse of Dolan, comes to the fore in her more introvert characteristic to hide her secret (a dead son in her past only fleetingly implied but never actually revealed), Kyla's stutter is a convenient barometer of her emotional state and Clément is amazing to the hilt. As for the newcomer Pilon, his Stevie is a spitfire with explosive fierceness, a nightmare to any parenthood, with fitful charisma on the verge of dissipation at any minute due to inappropriate external stimulation, it is a prime casting choice and he chalks up a grandstanding presence.From Sarah McLachlan, Dido, Counting Crows, Oasis, Lana Del Rey to Andrea Bocelli until the national treasure Celine Dion, etc. MOMMY's soundtrack is an ear-worm hits collection, measures up to Dolan's eclectic taste in music, emblazons the youthfulness and urbanization in his filmic tack, better than lighting up the mood, it coherently indicates the progression of diegesis which will continue to be one of Dolan's trademarks. Finally, MOMMY positively attests that a prodigy can survive the inevitable backlash and hopefully evolve into a bonafide maestro, Dolan's future cannot be brighter in this regard.",Mommy
7,paul2001sw-1,The tragedy of the misfit,8,19 July 2021,"Xavier Dolan's 'Mommy' tells the story of an eccentric single mother struggling to bring up her difficut child; a neighbour also plays a major role in the plot. Although often harrowing, the strength of the film is in the precision of its portrayal of its characters' particularities; this is not a generic misery-flick but a story of three very specific individuals. It's mostly very good, although the director is a bit self-indulgent in his use of mood-setting, musically backed scences. What's a little odd is that the story is set in the context of a fictional law allowing desparate parents to abandon their children; while this provides the final dramatic punch, I don't think it is a strictly necessary invention. Likewise, the final ending (with it's echoes of 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' also seems misplaced. My take home message was not one about how the system grinds down the individual, but rather a portrayal of the tragedy that inevitably follows when someone, though not intrinsically evil, cannot learn to play nicely with others; and I don't think it needed a fictional law to frame that story. Nonetheless, I recommend it strongly.",Mommy
8,gbill-74877,An emotional grinder,9,27 May 2020,"Unflinching and emotional. The characters are tough to like in the first half of the film, as the son spews racist comments and does all sorts of wildly inappropriate things. We find out he has ADHD and an attachment disorder, and that his father passed away a few years ago, but his behavior is still quite a test of our ability to empathize. While his mom deals with issues of her own (not the least of which is trying to make ends meet), we see he isn't getting enough guidance and medical/psychiatric attention, and the situation seems hopelessly stacked against him. It reminded me a little of The Florida Project in its depiction of the struggle they're going through near the bottom of the economic spectrum, and far from being glamorized, presented flaws and all.I loved how Xavier Dolan played with the aspect ratio here, giving us an almost claustrophobic sense of their limited prospects in life, and then widening it gloriously when things begin to go well. The relationship with the neighbor across the street is pretty special, and the scene the two women (Anne Dorval and Suzanne Clément) share at the end is brilliant. Dorval's reaction as the other woman crosses the street, privately breaking down, is especially well acted. Antoine Olivier Pilon is fantastic too, and one thing I admired about his performance is that he never softens it, never artificially attempts to be liked by the audience, even in in his character's introspective moments. I won't spoil it, but the scenes showing the future and what follows, touching on dreams and angst, are an emotional grinder. This is a great film, one that will probably churn you up.",Mommy
9,A_Different_Drummer,The Elephant In the Room,8,24 September 2015,"A powerful well-acted and brilliantly directed film which may never reach the audience it deserves ... and that is because of the ""elephant in the room."" Some auteurs, possessed of a single vision, will ""paint"" their story against an unusual backdrop to make it stronger. That backdrop can be anything from the emptiness of space, to the time of a past world war, to an imaginary future to a village in a country that never existed.Such is the magic of film.MOMMY uses the backdrop of French Canada. In its own way, with its own unique history, as exclusive and remote location as the one Sandra Bullock found herself in when her shuttle was damaged.Everything about the film deserves attention, even the bizarre use of an exceptionally tight Aspect Ratio -- other reviewers have heaped praise on this bizarre affectation, but the TRUTH is that audiences around the globe will be on the phone with Tech Support 3 minutes after the credits roll, trying to figure out what just happened to their $5k home theatre system...? The film is not only shot in French Canada but is one of the only so-called ""mass appeal"" films from Quebec to unleash that unusual Quebec dialect to the max (a dialect so obscure that even tourists from Paris France have trouble with it) and actually parade it, like a badge of honor, from scene to scene.And therein lies the agony and the ecstasy.As the earlier reviews show, Canadians in particular will look (listen?) past this and patiently seek the cinematic rewards therein. For them this is not a problem -- they have been trained to do this from birth, it is now part of their DNA.Viewers from other parts of the globe may not be as forgiving, however, and this creates both paradox and dissonance. And limits the ambit of the film's true audience.Which is a pity. Quel dommage.",Mommy
10,howard.schumann,"Lacks substantial character growth, plot development, or psychological insight",7,12 November 2014,"As you probably already have heard, Xavier Dolan's Mommy is not a laid-back inquiry into the joys of motherhood, but a shout-em-down contest of wills between Steve (Antoine Olivier Pilon), an out-of-control teenager suffering from Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and his mother Diane Després (Anne Dorval), whose parental skills are severely challenged. Needless to say, there can be no winners in such a contest. Winner of the Jury Prize at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival, Mommy is shot in a 1:1 aspect ratio which is like living inside of a cardboard box with no windows. This choice may seem appropriate to the director, but, for the viewer, it feels like always being short of breath.Supported by a potpourri of 90s biggest hits, Mommy takes place in 2015 in a fictional Canada where a new law has been passed allowing parents to put their children in an institution without the need for any messy legal proceedings. If this is such a futuristic development, one wonders why the setting is not like maybe a few more years into the future. ""Mommy Dearest,"" who wears a chain around her neck with the word ""mommy"" on it perhaps to remind herself of who she is supposed to be, has to come and rescue her son from a boarding school that he seems to have playfully set on fire. Steve, however, does not seem overly thrilled with the idea of going home.Diane, whose clever nickname is ""Die,"" tells the school that she is poor, has no job and is not able to take care of Steve, but this alleged poverty is never seen in the film. Once the slender, blond teenager who looks like a male fashion model on Ecstasy, is home, as they say in the vernacular, the something hits the fan. If you are enamored by yelling, screaming, cursing, fighting, and a large helping of general craziness, you have come to the right place. The mood lightens a bit, however, when Diane asks her next-door neighbor Kyla (Suzanne Clement) to tutor Steve while she looks for work. Kyla actually reminds us of a real person and introduces a touch of sanity to the household, but we should not get carried away with the sanity stuff.Though she provides an antidote to the dynamic duo, Kyla has some problems of her own, not the least of which is a speech impediment that prevents her from working at her job as a 7-9th grade teacher. Steve seems to like her okay at first, but soon tests her resolve. When he grabs her necklace, she shows him who's boss, and his respect for her increases, at least to the point where he doesn't swear at her every minute of the day. Mommy moves from crisis to calm and back again without any substantial character growth, plot development, or psychological insight. While I have had only brief experience working at a psychiatric hospital for adolescents, what seems obvious is that children, ADHD or not, feed off an adult's resistance and that a softer tone often works better than always getting sucked in to their tantrums.This director, however, does not appear to be genetically engineered for subtlety and restraint. Ultimately, while there are individual moments when everything comes alive such as the scene when the three of them dance in the kitchen, individual moments of uplift do not make for a meaningful experience as a whole. In spite of some superb performances, Mommy is less a character study than a lack of character study. One is tempted to ask what the point of the film is. It seems to be saying that those who tell you how much they love you are the first ones to betray you. Not a happy or even a truthful message.",Mommy
11,Turfseer,Searing portrait of extreme ADHD teenager impresses but novelty eventually wears off,7,13 February 2015,"""Mommy"" is Xavier Dolan's fifth feature and he's only 25 years old! Set in a suburb of Montreal, Dolan's ""dramedy"" is the tale of Diane ""Die"" Després (Anne Dorval) and her extremely hyperactive son, Steve (Antoine-Olivier Pilon), who suffers from ADHD. Dorval and Pilon are both brilliant in their complementary roles, playing off one another's inability to control their repressed anger.Steve, of course, is far worse off than his mother—at the beginning of the film, Die is bringing him back home from a juvenile facility where he assaulted a youth and was basically incorrigible in relation to the staff. Die wants to give it another try with Steve but doesn't help things with her constant insulting outbursts. There's something almost comic in the way Steve talks to his mother, often calling her ""bitch"" and other sundry expletives. For awhile (until the character wears out his welcome), Dolan's ""Steve"" is fascinating because you want to see how far he'll go in his social interactions outside the family. He knows how to ""push peoples' buttons"" and takes delight in setting people off. There's a great scene at the beginning of the film where Steve goes at it, insulting a black cab driver with a series of racist epithets, that leads to a harrowing confrontation. Later, Steve rips into his mother's ""date,"" a lawyer who lives across the street, accusing him of wanting to get into his ""mother's pants."" Die was counting on this man to help her with a lawsuit which was instituted as a result of Steve assaulting a kid at the aforementioned youth facility. Sure enough, the lawyer is completely alienated and curses both Die and Steve, right before walking out of their lives for good. Also in the mix is the neighbor across the street, Kyla, a teacher on sabbatical, afflicted with a stuttering problem. She bonds with Die and helps Steve with his academic pursuits. Even Kyla is not immune to having her buttons pushed by Steve (she knocks him down to the floor after he provokes her). Interestingly enough, Kyla is the only person Steve seems to listen to. When Kyla tells Die that she's moving to Toronto with her husband and child at film's end, Die puts on an act that she's not upset. Only afterward do we see her break down as it's obvious the relationship mattered quite a great deal to her. The Steve and ""Mommy"" show goes on a bit too long and the novelty of Steve's machinations, wears off. The fact that the film was shot in a 1:1 aspect ratio is also annoying, as the truncated square that appears on only part of the screen, makes us feel as if we're watching an old video from the 80s and early 90s. A couple of times Dolan expands to full screen, particularly in the fantasy sequence where Die imagines a much more optimistic fate for her son. But unfortunately that sequence also goes on for too long.At the beginning of the film, title cards posit a future scenario where parents have the right to commit their children to psychiatric facilities without a court order. While Dolan makes clear where his sympathies lie, the fact is that he's tipping us off to what happens at the climax—Steve's institutionalization is a foregone conclusion. It might have been a better idea to dispense with those title cards!There is no doubt that Mr. Dolan is a very talented writer and director. His ear for realistic dialogue and sophisticated characters is quite apparent. Nonetheless, sometimes too much of a good thing is not good at all. ""Mommy"" would have been much better had it been at least 30 minutes shorter. That said, go see ""Mommy"" because there are many good things in it that will impress the discerning film-goer.",Mommy
12,estebangonzalez10,A remarkable and challenging family drama,9,6 April 2015,"""We still love each other, right?""Mommy is Xavier Dolan's fifth feature film (but the first time I was exposed to his work) and it deserves all the recognition it received from Cannes, including its Jury Prize win, because it's a unique and powerful movie with all around outstanding performances from the cast. Experiencing Mommy without knowing anything prior about the Canadian director was fresh and rewarding. Mommy isn't an easy watch and at 138 minutes some might have doubts about wanting to watch this raw family drama, but it is well worth your time. The film centers on a widowed mother, Diane (Anne Dorval), who is trying to make ends meet as she tries to raise her troubled teenager, Steve (Antoine-Olivier Pilon). He has recently been expelled from the institution he was studying at for setting the cafeteria on fire. The directors of the institution realize they can't do anything for Steve and they give Diane (who goes by Die) two options: educate him herself or let the government raise him. Die is infuriated with the proposition because she loves her son, so despite not having the time it takes to look after him she takes him home. Steve suffers from ADHD (Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) so at one moment he can be cheerfully dancing along to his music, and all of a sudden a trigger sets him off into a violent behavior. He's also very attached to his mother (the Oedipus complex is present), but their relationship is a love-hate one. When their reclusive neighbor, Kyla (Suzanne Clement), befriends them she offers to help Steve with his education since she is on her sabbatical year from teaching. Kyla has trouble communicating and has been deeply affected by something from her past so she has issues of her own. Mommy builds on the relationship between these three characters and the explosive dynamics between them. Mommy is a raw family drama about characters that we don't usually see on film because they are hard to engage with. Steve has ADHD so he is constantly swearing and saying all kinds of hurtful things to the people around him, but at the same time he can be sweet and loving. His mother, Die, has no clue how to deal with him. She loses his patience with him, but she doesn't accept when others try to correct him and will do anything to defend Steve. She doesn't qualify as your standard parent of the year candidate, so typically she isn't someone the audience could relate to. Kyla perhaps would be the likable character here, but Dolan manages to direct this film with such grace and elegance that all three characters end up being people we care about and sympathize with despite their flaws. At first I was thinking there was no way I would end up caring for this kid and her mother, but after carefully setting the stage Dolan manages to give each one of these characters depth. There is a scene at a karaoke bar in which you connect with the kid and the more time you spend with this family the more you understand the mother as well. It is a very raw and explosive film with several emotionally engaging scenes. There was one specific dream sequence that touched me, and it is rare for a film like this to have such an enduring impact on me. Mommy makes me want to go and watch Dolan's previous four films now because this was one of the best dramas of 2014.The film was shot on a 1:1 aspect ratio which gives the movie a sense of claustrophobia and enables us to focus on the characters faces and emotions. It is like watching a film through a square box, but it definitely works. The performances enhance this powerful film even more. Suzanne Clement, Anne Dorval, and Antoine- Olivier Pilon are frequent collaborators with Dolan. I was surprised by Pilon's emotional performance. He was an explosive force of nature and delivers one the most memorable performances of the year. Anne Dorval is also a standout here and depicts the different emotions the mother goes through with her troubled son in a very authentic way. Even the way she walks through the streets of her neighborhood says a lot about her character. Clement has the most restrained performance of the three, but she also delivers in a much more quiet way. These characters aren't easy to relate to at times, but the cast humanizes each one of them in such a way that we sympathize with them. The performances along with Dolan's solid screenplay turn this family drama into a stunning work of art. It is a film that will stick with you long after the credits role. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",Mommy
13,Kdosda_Hegen,Beavis and Butthead in real life.,4,9 March 2021,"While it is a very arty film, it's too barebones and plain annoying. I did love the soundtrack, those musical scenes are awesome, but the characters are very unlikable. This film is shot in 1:1 aspect ratio which is just painful to look at. The screen is so small I can barely see anything in it. It is supposed to make us more focused on the characters instead of background, but I think that it's a terrible trade off. The ending is so ambiguous and just feels plain unfinnished the story is cut too soon.",Mommy

16,guisreis,Xavier Dolan did it again!,9,2 November 2021,"Xavier Dolan, the director of awesome film ""I killed my mother"", made here one more fantastic film on a similar issue. With outstanding acting (Anne Dorval, Antoine Olivier Pilon and Suzanne Clément have, all three, great performances) and a magnificent cinematography under unusual 1:1 ratio (which often seems vertical instead of square), the drama movie (perhaps a dramatic comedy) portrays the relationship between a sensuous and quarrelsome penniless mother, her violent teen with ADHD and problems in several institutions, and a stuttering neighbor with great heart, teaching skills and enotional problems. Their relationships have ups and downs and they make good to each others. Will it be enough?",Mommy
17,Sergeant_Tibbs,Messy and shamelessly indulgent but with a powerful performance at its forefront.,7,19 October 2014,"People who know Xavier Dolan know what they're walking into when they buy a ticket for Mommy. While he has a loyal fanbase that seems to grow more passionate about him by each film, some don't like him at all. This is my first of his films and I can immediately see the case for both sides. However, as Mommy is being called his most mature work yet, I take pause to imagine how infantile his previous films are as this has its moments of worrisome juvenility, though the 'mature' moments have a gutsy weight. At only 25 years old and on his 5th film in as many years, there's a cathartic energy to the way he approaches cinema that is quite refreshing to see. He throws everything at the wall and sees what sticks. Some of it does, but I regret to say, much of it doesn't, and what falls off drags the film down. Frequent headliner for Dolan's previous films and having starred in 4 of the 5, Mommy stars Anne Dorval as the titular character Diane 'Die' Despres, in a whirlwind performance of tantalizing vigor and sensitivity. She's a widowed single mother who takes her thuggish son Steve, played by Antoine-Olivier Pilon, back home after his time runs out at a delinquent center due to an incident where he caused another boy to be seriously burned. Arguments in their house always escalate to the point of violence, but they find solace in bonding with their stuttering but kind-hearted (with a lioness bouncing inside) neighbor Kyla, enticingly played by Suzanne Clement, who begins to tutor Steve so he can have the potential for a future. Immediately you can feel Dolan's hand ready to sculpt the film beyond reason. It begins as an unnecessary fantasy set next year with a fictional law to serve the plot. Perhaps it needs this disconnection from reality. It's wired with high-strung melodrama that escalates outrageously. Granted, that is the point of the film, that a little spark can ignite a forest fire, but it crosses a line where it ceases to be involving or convincing, and nor is it darkly comical. At first it's difficult to invest in the film, the characters are so unlikeable and unsympathetic, victims of their own tempers and ignorance. Dorval wins you over handedly, channeling Marisa Tomei better than Tomei herself. She's grounded enough to make the drama work. However, Pilon overdoes the irritation to the point where you sincerely don't wish him to succeed and that's a major problem with the performance and the way Dolan treats him. It's unbearably obnoxious. But when it's finally toned down in the tense calms before or after the storm, it's really great. It's thoroughly embroiling, enrapturing and heart-breaking drama, or a complete joy depending on the scene. That's the flipside of a film that's heightened to 11 on either end of the scale. It was constantly losing me and winning me back. Eventually, the losses were weaker and the wins were stronger. Sometimes the stylistic indulgences were enjoyable and added to the tone. Otherwise they disrupt the flow of the film entirely, with the use of slow motion, out of focus shots and unnecessary interludes of music videos. Those of which were poorly chosen iconic tracks that I can't tell whether Dolan actually knows how done to death and unsalvageable the Dido and Oasis songs are for instance. He exercises zero restraint – but he does not care. There's somewhat of a charm to his contrarianism. What's most fascinating about the film and what particularly sets it apart given the familiarity of this type of melodrama is the aspect ratio. It's boxed in at an unusual 1:1, imprisoning the characters so they feel crushed by the weight of the stresses of their personalities and consequences of their actions. It occasionally breaks free of it when hope floods back into their lives. It's an incredibly expressive way to use the space of a frame, much more emotional than the intellectual way Wes Anderson did it this year for The Grand Budapest Hotel. As such with a melodrama, the cinematography is vibrant with alluring colour, making good use of that voyeuristic box we watch the story from. Fortunately, when Mommy hits the sweet spot, it's utterly overwhelming. Dorval is the only consistent aspect in an unashamedly bloated, indulgent and messy film. It could be too polarizing to be a serious contender for the Foreign Language Film Oscar, but a nomination remains to be seen. 7/10 Read more @ The Awards Circuit (http://www.awardscircuit.com/)",Mommy
18,proud_luddite,Anne Dorval leads a great cast,9,27 April 2019,"In a Montreal suburb, a single mother with financial and employment difficulties reunites with her violent teenage son who is being released from a detention centre. More chaos ensues.It would be very tempting to call this film a ""kitchen sink drama"". There are many explosive scenes which are cathartic. Most films would have only a few such scenes, maybe only one at the climactic finale. While the catharsis might seem too much, every one of those scenes works well because of the great talent of director Xavier Dolan and his equally talented cast.There are thankfully lighter scenes that show the love in the dysfunctional family and their ability to have fun especially as they are joined by a mysterious neighbour across the street, Kyla, who seems to have her own troubles. Her troubles seem lessened as she bonds with the unusual mother-son duo. Kyla's situation seems a bit too mysterious at times. As a subplot, it could have used a few hints to tap viewers further into the reasons why she prefers the family across the street to her own.The film's greatest strengths are two scenes near the end. One is the perfectly executed climactic scene. The other is the one that follows - a very melancholy scene of transition with which most viewers could sadly identify.As mentioned, Dolan has directed a superb cast. As the troubled teenager, Antoine Olivier Pilon has the perfect balance of rage and vulnerability. As the neighbour Kyla, Suzanne Clément is very believable as someone facing change and loosening up especially when she has fits of uncontrollable laughter. As the mother, Anne Dorval gives Dolan another superb performance as she did with ""I Killed My Mother"" (2009). Her range in the final two pivotal scenes display true brilliance. - dbamateurcriticRATING: 9/10OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENT: Performance by Anne Dorval",Mommy
19,cultfilmfan,Mommy,10,26 February 2015,"One of the hardest parts of reviewing a film online like this, is when you get a film like Xavier Dolan's Mommy. It is a masterpiece in every sense of the word and is just all around great filmmaking and sometimes as the writer, I feel it is sometimes hard to explain to my readers, just how good a film like Mommy is, so I will do my best here. Mommy, is the type of film that reminds me of the films John Cassavetes, would have wrote and directed in the late 60's and through the 70's. Films that have excellent character study and acting as well as being extremely powerful and very emotionally intense. Films that you can identify with the characters on the screen so well and you see them going through various ordeals and trials and sometimes the acting and filmmaking depicting this is done in such a realistic and accurate way that it leaves you for the time being, feeling exhausted, drained and almost maddened. And yet at the same time you are so glad that a piece of art as every good film should be, has gotten this type of emotion from you. One thing I always tend to feel is that if a film leaves you with some type of emotion, whether it be good, or bad it has at least done part of the job it is supposed to have done on you the viewer. Watching the new film Mommy, by genius young director Xavier Dolan reminds me of everything I have just written above. The story is so powerful and the acting by the three main leads here is absolutely fantastic. I would go as far as to say that Anne Dorval, Suzanne Clement and Antoine-Olivier Pilon, do not just give some of the best performances of last year, but do indeed give the best male and female performances that I have seen in any film throughout the year 2014. The film is certainly heavy at times, which unfortunately may turn off some viewers and it is emotionally devastating and at times draining to watch because we really learn to care and have empathy for these characters and it is one of those films that when these characters are laughing and having fun, so are we, but at the same time when they are going through pain, difficulties, or situations that would cause most people to have nervous breakdowns, we feel for them inside. Sometimes it is an unpleasant and gut wrenching feeling, but as I said before, the film is so powerful and so excellently done, that we as viewers actually appreciate and admire the film all the more for making us connect and feel with the characters the way that we do. Writer/director Xavier Dolan, is only in his mid 20's and yet he has given us more emotion and seems to understand both men, women and just people in general than filmmakers who have been working twice as long as he has, or who are much older than him. Dolan, certainly has a gift of observing others and getting everything down to perfection in how he analyzes these characters and makes their situations both realistic, believable and relatable. There were certainly times during this film where I laughed with the characters on screen and times during the film where I was very emotionally moved and even cried a bit in times during the film of both sadness and joy. The emotions conveyed through the actors, direction and writing in this film is never done in a sappy, or melodramatic way, we feel for these people because we can relate to them and their situations and because we care for them. We are not all going through exactly the same situations, or scenarios that they are, but that doesn't matter because as human beings, no matter how old you are, you will always go through difficulties in your life and when you get older and see other people hurting, whether it is an experience you have gone through, or not, you still empathize and care for the person who is hurting, not because you have gone through the same thing exactly, but because you have gone through hurts in your own life as well and can relate and feel for them at the same time and in ways that you were hurt in your own life. Because this film is so emotionally powerful and draining, it will unfortunately turn some viewers off, which I think is really a shame because you don't have too often when you have a film of this caliber coming out and just truly making a mark on you as it did me because of what a great masterpiece and film in general it is. I mentioned John Cassavetes, earlier in this review who is truly a genius and one of the best American independent filmmakers who ever lived. Even though he is still young and hopefully has many more films to make, I think that Dolan is one of this generation's best directors and writers. He surely has a knack for getting under your skin and delivering one powerful message and taking you along for the ride. I am so glad to have been able to see Mommy, on the big screen and as it stands it is the single best film I have seen of 2014. Nothing else even comes close. Also, I hope in this brief review I was able to convey how great a film this is and how much it meant to me and I hope it makes you want to discover it also.",Mommy
20,SameirAli,Really Good in square frame.,9,23 August 2021,"An unusual aspect ratio 1:1 (square) except the happiest moments, to convey the emotions of the characters in the movie. The film is really good. I am huge fan of ""We Need to Talk About Kevin (2011)"", this is another version, rather a very different version of that film.",Mommy
21,garethcrook,I wanted to like this.,5,18 May 2018,"It's interesting. The characters are, well they're very annoying, which makes it hard to like or even enjoy. It's fast paced, tiring and kinda claustrophobic. This last bit partly due to the square frame. Yeah, square! Like Instagram. It's seriously intense. A mother trying to deal with her mentally unstable teenage son, trapped by their spiralling lives. That is until the half way point, soundtracked by Wonderwall, the screen is literally pulled wide open with enthusiastic happiness. Our troubled boy screams ""I'm free"" and it's quite spectacular. It's short lived though and as the screen pulls back to its square format, it feels even more constricted. It's painful, awkward sometimes to watch, tense, crushing. Thankfully more highs do follow, but the whole film is up and down, with happiness seemingly only a dream. It does have a rather rousing finale and it has to be said that the acting throughout is stellar. I can't quite shake the feeling of disappointment though.",Mommy
22,MikeyB1793,High Energy,6,27 May 2015,"This is an extreme high-octane energy film from the two main characters – mother (played by Anne Dorval) and her son (played by Antoine- Olivier Pilon). They dominate every scene in this film. They are both abusive towards each other and to others – and there are borderline uncomfortable scenes, so be warned. Seldom have I seen a movie that takes off so rapidly from the get-go.Somehow the energy dissipates during the second half of the film. Things start to sag with scenes dragging on too long.. And questions start to arise – as in where exactly are we going with all the insults, the screaming...? And, aside from all the ugly confrontations – what is the story? I did not feel the ending to be a good wrap-around. Through-out I was rather quizzical of their lonely next door neighbor who awkwardly popped in and out of the scenes. Her performance in all this seemed artificial. But the two main characters remain credible throughout.",Mommy
23,MattBrady099,Film making at it's best,9,3 July 2015,"You know what sucks? I already did my top movies of 2014 list, now if I only watched this movie before making the list this would have made the list easily. Well I got something to learn next time.The story is about a single mom's drama about raising her son, who's behavior deteriorates into violence, due to a mild mental illness.I first took interest in the film Mommy just because of the hype and the positive praise it got from the 2014 Cannes Film Festival and the amount of awards it won from the Jutra Awards and Canadian Screen Awards for best Foreign Language film, but not a Academy Award for Foreign Film at the Oscars. Since I am watching more Foreign Language films and searching the ones that got high ratings or just the ones that may interest me, because I'm taking a break from some movies today as they normally not very good or just too Hollywood for me, I mean movies today are getting pretty stale and cliché as nothing feels originally anymore. When Hollywood tries to make a original movie that's down to earth it's laughable. These something about Foreign Language films that always feel real and sometimes so tight with it's story and ending that most movie studios will shy away from and I love it. So I checked out the 2014 Award Wining Mommy and it was absolutely brilliant, I mean how could I even dear overlook this I mean this is a great movie right here and true film making at it's best.Not only did the Oscar screw up for not awarding this for Best Foreign Language film, they also didn't nominate Anne Dorval for Best Actress, because she did one of the best, the most heart felt and the most real piece of performance I've seen in 2014. I felt her struggle and the mix relationship between her and the missed behaved son. There was many scenes in the movie were the son and her have this argument over each over and it never felt like I was just watching actors reading out the script and pretending that they related, no they back and forward arguments always felt real and I bough it. Oh and I found out most of the awards that this movie won are not just for the Foreign Language Award but most of the awards went to her and she deserves it and a Oscar too for god shake. At the Cannes Film Festival Julianne Moore won for Best Actress for Maps to the Stars and I haven't seen Maps to the Stars yet so I can't really judge on her performance in that movie since I haven't seen it, but Anne Dorval was nominated in that category so it was disappointing that she didn't take the award, but I have seen Still Alice and she won a Oscar for that role, but Anne Dorval should have took that Oscar home as she did a much better than Moore as I connected to Anne Dorval more and how her performance made me feel different emotions that I never felt before while watching the movie.Antoine-Olivier Pilon is a unknown star to me as I haven't seen him in any other movies before so this is basically the first ever performance I get to see him in and man god can this kid act, I mean he was so good in the movie. Just like I said about Anne Dorval and that is all the time it never felt like acting to me, it felt real. Antoine plays the misbehaved son perfectly that he actually catches the trouble child very well since I have seen young people like him in real life and how they act is just like him. I also love how they never force the message of ""He's got a mental illness oh feel sorry for him"". The movie never puts that in your face like most movies do when they try to be realistic or make you feel something for the character. He's performance showed both angry, goofy, troubled and damaged but all that is in he's performance and it never feels force and that was so well done that movie didn't slip into that cliché that happens in most movies and that's due to Antoine-Olivier Pilon excellent performance.The director of the movie Xavier Dolan which I haven't really seen any of his last work so this is my first movie directed by him and a great start. This is film making at it's best, I mean the cinematography is beautiful, the tone of the movie can switch to serious drama but quickly change to happy and many other tones and it didn't ruin the movie like most do. Xavier Dolan did both a excellent job on directing the movie and making this as down to earth as possible showing characters and they problems that most people can relate to. Awesome work Xavier Dolan.For problems with the movie I haven't really got any to be honest, but I'm not going to give this the perfect rating as I think this isn't on the level of 5/5 rating it can ever get it, but the rating I'm giving it is really outstanding and it's the highest rating I give this week.Overall I say that Mommy is worth checking it if you haven't seen it yet. It's worth your time and don't do the same mistake as I did and not watch this fantastic movie.",Mommy
24,asc85,Darn good,7,17 May 2015,"Well, it won all the Canadian ""Oscars"" last year, so I thought it deserved a look. Of course, winning the Best Picture doesn't necessarily mean much (example: Birdman), but I digress. I thought this was a very good movie. Anne Dorval, who won Best Actress, Suzanne Clement, who won Best Supporting Actress, and Antoine-Olivier Pilon, who won Best Actor, are all very good. My favorite scenes (spoilers, of course) were the fantasy sequence where we see a happy and well-adjusted Steve getting older and getting married, and the scene where they finally take him away. As an American, I thought of the Sandy Hook massacre in Connecticut, and if that could have been prevented if that fictional law of being able to commit a child without any red tape was a real law, and in America at that time. But again, I digress.",Mommy
25,W011y4m5,Wow.,10,9 August 2019,"I smiled constantly throughout the first hour & cried during the second. ""Mommy"" is wholesome, layered & brutal; beautifully performed, uncomfortably familiar & uncompromisingly real. It's breathtaking filmmaking & a deeply impactful movie.",Mommy
26,jayjaycee,Born to Die...,10,16 January 2021,"""Mommy"" is a 2014 French-Canadian film directed by Xavier Dolan starring Anne Dorval and Antoine Olivier Pilon.
⚪
All in all, Canadian director Xavier Dolan brought an utterly intense and shocking family drama in this world that simultaneously amazes and astonishes with its sheer narrative intensity, and even if it is a dramatic story in its core, it surprisingly displays a dazzling emotional range, going from gracious to ferocious in the matter of seconds most of the time, and thanks to intelligently used and sensitive cinematography, outstandingly portrayed and written characters as well as fitting soundtrack, it becomes an utterly intriguing, equally fascinating and harrowing rollercoaster ride that convinces with its brutal realism and merciless emotiveness.
⚪
Because it was the birthday of my buddy, the outstanding @officialnerdhub, I decided to make him a small present by watching one of his favourite films of all time, and since both ""Interstellar"" and ""Lawrence of Arabia"" simply run for too long for a Friday night and I have watched ""The Shining"" recently, the winner was Canadian director Xavier Dolan's most praised drama ""Mommy"" - and holy hell, what an incredible film it was. It once again proved to me that there are several masterful films out there many apparently haven't seen this far, simply because they are in a foreign language, so at this point one small piece of advice: go watch more non-anglophone films. In many cases you will probably end up like me - shattered to the very foundations - because what Dolan has created here is nothing short of outstanding dramatic writing. In a fictional Canada, independent mother Diane ""Die"" Després, tries to raise her seemingly ineducable son Steve, an obnoxious brat suffering from ADHD and violent outburst, and with the help of her mysterious new neighbour Kyla, it all seems to be possible ... at least for a while. This premise is yet another project of which the success of the film depends solely on the execution, because if you don't have a sufficiently sensitive screenplay, capable actors and an empathetic design, it will most definitely fail to unfold its full intensity. Thankfully, this film has got all of it. What makes it so indescribably intriguing is the fact that the film's plot somehow mirrors the emotional world of its protagonist, because if it is per se a drama, it is divided into totally different phases, and each is defined by an entirely different mood. In one scene, verbal and physical fighting takes place in all its ugliness and ferocity, and after that it turns into a calm and optimistic feel-good film. The thing is, this duality is noticeable throughout the entire film, but as predictable as it sounds, it is anything but this, because like violent outbursts, the atmosphere and the nature of the scenes shift in the matter of seconds. Seriously, at first it seems like Die and Steve will get along peacefully, and after a minimal issue, it suddenly turns into a horrifying scene - in one case ending with attempted murder. There is this certain type of discomfort and menace accompanying every single scene, since it is just impossible to tell what is happening next. Only after Kyla, a mysterious woman herself, steps into their life, it becomes comparatively organised. Even though it is factually never mentioned, I think that she has had severe problems in her past herself. She is a teacher on sabbatical, and next to her shyness, she also stutters nervously most of the time - and that makes me conclude that she was most probably bullied and humiliated by students at her old school. I know, it is a long shot, but it would fit perfectly into the context of the story. Anyway, after initial difficulties, Kyla seems to become the only person Steve respects in some abstract way, and a while later, the three become an inseparable trio. Honestly, to a certain point I thought that we would get a happy ending, but what comes after that is just the total opposite of that. Even if he seems to be on the mend, Steve remains a troublemaker, and the things he has done in the past begin to catch up. A major lawsuit forces Die to sweet-talk their neighbour Paul, who happens to be a lawyer, into helping them, but as she succeeds in her undertaking, Steve just cannot deal with it. As it shockingly turns out, he loves his mother more than previously assumed, and even if it was hinted in some occasions, it was still a shocking revelation - next to his hyperactivity and anger issues, he also suffers from an oedipal complex - and then the tragedy is perfect (in a classic Greek way as well). The justified rejection by Die makes Steve think that she doesn't love him anymore, and it all goes downhill from there. Die really wants to save her one and only son, even if he pulls her down. It is a simple yet utterly heart-breaking dilemma, and everything she does would hurt her in some way. It is self-destruction in its rawest form, and I think it couldn't get any more shocking - and I was wrong, once again. After an attempted suicide by Steve, Die decides to commit her son to an institution, and oh my god, this scene packed a punch. After a day-dream sequence depicting how Steve reached his goal, got his life together and eventually married, the bleak reality sets in. Once again, it was this the suddenness of this transition that made it so incredibly excruciating, because after that it is shown how Steve tries to resist the male nurses trying to capture him, and the feelings of betrayal, disappointment and anger written on his face - simply shattering. Subsequently, Die seems to live an easier life, Kyla moves away once again, and everything of the triangular friendship is gone forever - and thus, it ends heartbreakingly. As already mentioned above, what makes this so even more intense are the practical features. Dorval, Pilon and Clément, portraying Die, Steve and Kyla, respectively, are the driving force behind everything. The way they play their respective characters, how they convey their personalities and the connected emotions is downright mesmerising, and that makes it even more heart-breaking. Furthermore, the movie is entirely presented in a 1:1 aspect ratio, and that allows the viewer to experience the emotional intensity even more. Many close-up shots make for this uncomfortable yet ingenious intimacy, and it works out perfectly. However, just as I thought I saw through the meaning behind this unusual creative decision, the screen suddenly widened during the day-dream sequence, and I new that it also emphasises the lack of perspective and the feeling of being narrowed perceived by the characters, and how this all changes only in a figment. In the end, this film turns out to be distressing rollercoaster ride and probably one of the best foreign films I have ever seen. Every little aspect fits perfectly, and it still haunts me as I write those sentences. The soundtrack underlining the end credits, a famous song by Lana Del Rey, was added to my playlist shortly after, and it made me chuckle, because Steve was ""Born To Die"" in more than one way ... and the brilliance of that film increased, once again.",Mommy
27,Rendanlovell,A work of art,9,17 March 2016,"'Mommy' is the fifth film from 26 year old writer/director Xavier Dolan. Who burst into the film making scene with 'Tom at the Farm' and now 'Mommy'. If there is one clear fact about Dolan it's that his films display a sense of maturity and restraint seldom found in directors twice his age. After watching 'Mommy' this is even more clear. It is quite possibly the most raw film from 2015. It follows a mother and her only son. Diane, a widow, has been hardened by lifes constant beatings. And is trying her hardest to raise a son that is prone to aggressive behavior. He throws temper tantrums, breaks things, and is in constant search of a fight. Needless to say, this film is difficult to watch at times. But It's a bold testament to how great a film can be when you have deeply fleshed out characters. Who, at first, seem like very unpleasant people to be around. But just like their across the street neighbor they some how grow on you.Whether it's the awkward dance parties they have or the total lack of social awareness I couldn't say. But one thing is clear, these characters feel undoubtedly real. Dolan has written people that you can not only relate to but feel for as if you stood right beside them in the best, and worst times.Each hard decision they make will send one into a panic as it does the characters. Through all the crap the film puts its characters through it's somehow a magnetic watch. In fact it seems to dare you to take your eyes from the screen. Even for the shortest second used to look away can easily cost you a heart wrenching scene or beautiful moment between mother and son.But all this wouldn't have been possible without this films performances. Each actor involved in 'Mommy' delivers an unflinchingly honest portrayal of their respective character. They are absolutely breathtaking to watch and display superb chemistry between each other.This is all captured by exquisite direction and cinematography. The film is shot mainly in a 1:1 aspect ratio, or a perfect square. This choice helps to elevate the emotional impact of each scene. It creates a claustrophobic and tense atmosphere that is meant to show how the characters are feeling, as if the walls are closing in around them.'Mommy' is a seriously impressive all around film. The direction, cinematography, post work, performances, and script are polished to perfection. And the result is a brilliant, undeniably original piece of cinema. It may have a few minor issues here and there but rarely do they detract from this visceral experience.",Mommy

29,noahgibbobaker,Very nearly perfection,9,27 October 2020,"My most recent review was on mother! by Darren Aronofsky so I decided to watch some films with 'mum' related titles. I know, hilarious.Mommy is a thoughtfully presented film and is technically fantastic as well. But what holds the film together in the relationship between the characters, if the relationships were not so ridiculously well written, believable and, again, so thoughtfully presented nothing would work. Fortunately the writing is fantastic and relationships are believable and the presentation is brilliant and unique. Xavier Dolan clearly gave his all and really cared about this film, unfortunately as time goes on more companies are just pumping out movies month after month and I find it insulting to the artists who love and care about what they are making. Disney is the worst example of this, but far from the only one.I mentioned the characters and how they are the integral part of the movie but I want to talk more about this. I knew a kid all through school who had ADHD and acted very similarly to Steve, like Steve he had outbursts of rage and obviously was very hyperactive. Steve is also diagnosed with attachment disorder or RAD. I added a link to what attachment disorder is but I'll give a brief overview if you don't want to read some of the article. RAD is a condition where a child is unable to establish a healthy relationship with their parents or caregivers. This often leads to difficulty connecting with others, trouble managing emotions, fear of getting close to others, lack of trust, lack of self-worth. What I'm getting at is that Steve is portrayed realistically and respectfully, this is absolutely something to admire as most disabilities in films are either extremely exaggerated, or extremely disrespectful. Anne was also a complex and realistic character who made believable decisions which is really important for her character. And finally my favourite character Kyla, I relate so heavily to Kyla as I have confidence issues of my own, I don't think my issues are as severe as Kyla's but she is still portrayed amazingly well. These three phenomenal actors also have really good chemistry on screen together which is important and their performances are some of my favourites, ever.The soundtrack is fantastic and oftentimes a song would start and end in unison with sequences in the film. I found wonderwall a little bit distracting but it's nothing in the grand scheme of things. It fit the scene it was used in just as well as the other songs fit their respective scenes. WhenI don't want this review to drag on but I really want to mention the technical aspects, especially the aspect ratio. Don't be put off by the 1:1 aspect ratio, it serves a purpose, it's not just shot this way for the sake of being artsy. I won't say why it is shot this way because I think you should experience it yourself. The aspect ratio isn't the only brilliant technical element of this film though, it is shot beautifully and the 1:1 gives such an amazing claustrophobic feeling. The editing is great and the production design is as well.The only significant issue I have is text at the start of the film, it was unnecessary, everything could have played out in the same way without this text. I would have preferred if it wasn't there. That is my only issue that holds any weight. Please watch mommy if you can, it's such an amazing, emotional movie that got a proper visceral reaction out of me which doesn't happen all that often.",Mommy
30,10086cn,WOW!!!,10,5 July 2021,"Just finished watching this movie on Film4 on 6th July 2021 and, all I have to say is... WOW!!! I might even consider this to be one of my most favourite movies OF ALL TIME!!! A little gutted that Film4 would air this so late at night, but, you know...it was worth missing out on sleep!",Mommy
31,nikxatz,This film is a FILM,9,11 April 2018,"Mommy is pure cinema.It is a film that speaks a cinematic language and creates genuine feelings to the viewer.
 
 Xavier Dolan, both by his extremely powerful and impressive direction and by his ability to write such a realistic,simple but effective story achieves something that few movies have done:he makes s a part of the film and immerses us in an unforgettable experience.
 
The film,for its most part, is shot in a 1:1 screen ratio.In this way, it instantly provokes a strong sense of claustrophobia and seems like it has the role of a small camera that moves around the characters' problems and desires.This technique makes the film more realistic and sad.
 
The movie has a beautiful soundtrack, from ""Born to Die"" to ""Wonderwall"".The songs add so much emotion to the scenes and the lyrics really fit to the movie's theme.Mommy is, surprisingly, one of the most well-acted movies of all time.The there actors are masters of their craft give powerful performances.During the movie couldn't distinguish the actor from the character.Moreover, their characters are perfectly developed and totally realistic.The film talks about our desires for a happy life and shows that an ideal life may never be achieved.We have to struggle and try unconditionally.Although it is a depressing film, it manages to deal with themes like love and care in a wonderful way.It is a haunting and magical film.The movie had an incredible impact on me and I can't wait to see it again, despite the fact that I will burst into tears after seeing it.",Mommy
32,varun_120,Too damn addictive,10,23 April 2015,"I have become a fan of French Cinema, TV series. Recently I saw a TV series Les Revenants. I saw many French films in the past like Au Revoir Les Enfants, Intouchables, Incendies and many more. French films have subtlety that others don't have. This is what makes French cinema different than the rest. Now, the film i am going to review is Mommy (2014)Mommy is directed and written by Xavier Dolan. Xavier Dolan is known for his film I killed my mother (2009). Now, in Mommy also you can find some resemblance of I killed my mother. Its amazing how talented & imaginative, Xavier Dolan is at the age of just 25.I saw the movie yesterday, and I am almost compelled to write a review. The movie is very powerful and gripping. It mainly has 3 characters Diane (Anne Dorval), Steve (Antoine-Olivier Pilon) & Kyla (Suzanne Clément). Diane has been widowed for 3 years and does earns her living by doing meager jobs. Her son Steve, following his violent nature has been imposed, institutionalization, which is one degree lower than juvenile detention. Steve was institutionalized shortly following his father's death due to his attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and his violent outbursts. He was just kicked out of the latest in a long line of facilities for setting fire to the cafeteria, in turn injuring another boy. Diane made this decision to deinstitutionalize him as she didn't like the alternative, sending him into more restrictive juvenile detention from which he would probably never be rehabilitated. He brings him home & the craziness begins.They have a very different mother-son relationship. Both are crazy, but where Diane can control herself, Steve just can't. They come across the neighbor Kyla who has a stammering problem. She meets Diane & Steve, mingles with them, becomes their friend. Her stammering goes away whenever she's with Diane & Steve while, when she gets back home to her daughter & boyfriend, her stammering too comes back. Kyla tutors Steve, as he does home learning, as he has been deinstitutionalized. All three of them get bonded and have a good time. But later Diane gets a legal notice that she has to pay for the damages caused to the boy who got burnt up to 70% in the cafeteria, Steve set afire. She tries very hard to get a good lawyer, but fails. After Steve, attempts to commit suicide, she admits Steve in the mental institution as it would save him from the juvenile detention. That was not the right thing, as Kyla insinuates- ""I can't abandon my family"", almost a reference, that Diane didn't do the right thing. Steve is absolutely devastated, but later on realizes that his mom did it, as she thought iy would be best for him. In the end, it is shown that Steve is running towards a window/door, suggesting he is trying to attempt suicide again as he lost all hopes to be with his Mommy.As Diane once tells Kyla that, there is not a dull moment with Steve, is indeed true. The film seems loud on certain occasions, is never boring though its 138 minutes long. Xavier Dolan once again uses music to perfection in this film. The pop songs that Xavier Dolan chose for the movie are simply amazing and each song has a meaning with the scene in it. From Sarah McLachlan, Oasis, Celine Dion, Andrea Bocelli, Lana del Rey, Counting Crows. Specially 2 scenes, one where Kyla comes over for party at Diane's and secondly the long dream sequence. Both the scenes fit with the music used in them. There are many scenes that could take your breath away. Particularly I liked the scene where Kyla bullies Steve, and Steve pisses his pants. It was very intense, you wouldn't imagine someone like Kyla dominating someone. The chemistry between the 3 main characters is flawless. It never feels like they are acting, they live the characters and also force you to get involve with them. Its as real as it gets troubled mother, troubled son, troubled neighbor. We never get to know the full story of Kyla, just that she was a teacher, now on a sabbatical and has developed a stammering problem. Diane is troubled too, who is considered white trash by many, Diane does whatever she needs, including strutting her body in front of male employers who will look, to make an honest living. That bread-winning ability is affected when she makes the decision to get Steve back.I really admire the work of Xavier Dolan and looking forward to watch his other films too. He has a gift that no 25 year old may have. He has the vision, he makes it look as real as it gets. He also plays with aspect ratio in this film. Almost entire film is in 1:1 aspect ratio, but only 2 scenes are shot in 1.85. Entire film gives a feeling of claustrophobia by using that 1:1 aspect ratio. This film is not be missed by true lovers of cinema. Dolan will only get better. Mommy is the best film of 2014 that I saw in 2015. There is something about this film, the restlessness, that I can't express in words. I was left in emotional instability. I may have to watch it one more time to ebb out that uneasiness.",Mommy
33,Degree7,Awful,1,24 April 2019,"I had to watch this amateurishly made student film in one of my classes. After being tortured with a few minutes of this nonsense, I came to some observations: Terrible overuse of Oasis, and their dreadfully overplayed song ""Wonderwall."" Watching a kid skateboard down a street while 90s Britpop blares in your ears just screams pretentious hipsterism, and is a poor attempt to galvanize audience investment. The annoying aspect ratio doesn't help either. Overall this ""film"" is just another example of overrated Western filmmaking. Shocked that this won top awards.",Mommy

When you gather top notch directional skills, very good understanding of human's deepest emotions and a bunch of sinceres performances that engrossing, I can only say BRAVO!
And don't even get me started on the cinematography !!",Mommy
35,ben06,"Decent, artistic, predictable",7,29 December 2020,"Artistically shot film, charged with emotion and violence. The relationships of the mother and sin really draw you in and you can't help but feel for each character on a deeper level. Throughout the film however leaves little to the imagination and you do somewhat feel like the storyline is absolutely spelled out to you.",Mommy
36,kylerafa,Stunning!,9,13 December 2018,"""Mommy"" is one the best films I've ever seen in my entire Life. Dolan plays with our emotions all along the film. The actings and cinematography are so real that you do deep into it the first minutes you watch it. It tells a lot about love and life and how to spend it, it tells a lot about being strong and fight for what you love, despite the numerous problems you can fight. It's simply a Masterpiece !",Mommy
37,asen-75377,Dolan is a genius!,8,13 April 2020,"A story of the contentious relationship between a mother and her son filled with delirious swells of unrestrained love and sudden plunges into madness and hate. This film is screened with 1:1 aspect ratio which is very innovative I think. Dolan also told that he shot on this aspect ratio which allowed him to be very close to characters, avoid distractions and therefore the audience would only concentrate on the expressions of the characters. Btw he widened the aspect ratio to 1.85:1 for the two hopeful moments on the movie..that was best part of the movie for me..he tried to show the main character's life in a positive way...now all three main casts did a great job..Antoine is just brillant in this film..the expressions on his face really made this movie more perfect.
A very good movie. Xavier directed the movie at the age 25 or 26, that's is really incredible.",Mommy
38,flcntk3-856-986017,Like a snake that eats itself,9,21 May 2015,"Xavier Dolan's ""Mommy"" is more than a movie, it is an experience of being choked up in a jar and forced to rub shoulder to shoulder with an estranged pair of mother and son. Steve the son and his mom Diane co-exist in an imploding world that is part mesmerizing, part love hate, part compulsive obsessive, part oedipal and very co-dependent. This phenomenon of total inseparability is one of a relationship that is destined, unresolvable and self-devouring. Picture it as a snake that is condemned to eat itself from the tail up and you are watching it so close you can smell its breath. On that, the brilliant part about this movie is the clever use of the aspect ratio which like Abel Glance's ""Napoleon"" changes its size in midair to make a point. In this case, the breadth of screen becomes either the audience's interlocking prison to force feed you intensification or the characters' sudden, fleeting and momentary reliefs like the feeling of someone opening the lid to the jar where you are kept. For the characters, although their behaviors are recurring and with predictable consistency, they however possess immense hidden depth as to who and what they are to each other. For example, behind the veneer of nonchalant calmness from Diane and the explosive burst of destructions from Steve, there is an unsaid need of constant confirmations from each other as proofs of their own completeness. The thing that makes this movie so connecting is that in each of us, we all share this feeling of affirmation from our mothers and our love ones, only for the most of us, they come in much milder forms.",Mommy
39,Fiurilli,A unique cinematic experience,8,2 September 2016,"The movie 'Mommy' written and directed by Xavier Dolan takes place in an alternate version of Canada where any parent has the option to rid themselves of their troublesome children by sending them to an institution. One of the movies main characters Diane Després finds herself in exactly that situation when her son Steve who has ADHD gets out of a youth detention center. Immediately Diane is presented with the option to send Steve away, but his undying love for his mother paired with her own stubbornness and pride stops her from making such a drastic decision. Right from the start this unique family seems to be heading into a disaster but things change when a mysterious neighbour inserts herself into the lives of Diana and Steve.The concept of a mother struggling with a troublesome child is not all that unique, and even though this movie has quite a few interesting story elements up its sleeve, at its core it still is a film about a dysfunctional family that has been told many times before. That is not to say that this movie is as mundane as possible since the manner the story is presented in is anything but generic. Characters are extremely well defined and never seem to say or make any decisions which one could consider inconsistent with their usual behavior. The exposition necessary to set up these characters is masterfully woven into the dialogue. The movie never really goes out of its way to tell the viewer something about the characters and instead lets it happen naturally throughout its runtime. What makes the characters even better are the amazing actors portraying them. The actress Anna Dorval does an excellent job at showing the human side of Diane. Often times when her character is either laughing or crying it comes off as genuine so genuine in fact that it is not hard to forget that you're watching a movie and not a documentary. Even when her character is not speaking it is quite clear that internally she is struggling with the decision to send her son away in order to live a normal life. This struggle also resonates within the viewer via Antione-Olivier Pilon's portrayal of Steve. There is always a noticeable sense of built up frustration and when his violent nature paired with his ADHD sends him on a tantrum his anger seems real and almost scary at times. Afterwards there is always a small sense of regret when he sees the fear he induced into his mother. The mysterious neighbour Kyla is not as on the forefront as Steve or Diane as she is more of an introvert. That is not to say that this character is very forgetful as Suzanne Clément, the actress behind Kyla, masterfully shows that there is more to her character than first meets the eye. Every performance on its own was very good, but what's even better is the way the director shows the relationship they have with one another. As a family, albeit a dysfunctional one, Steve and Diane really come off as one that probably exists somewhere in this world and the interplay between them and Kyla is also very believable. Almost the entire movie is filmed with an aspect ratio of 1:1. Characters are literally locked up in a little box in the same way as they are locked up in a lifestyle they cannot get out of. Instead of it being a gimmick this feature almost comes off as its own character. Because of this small frame in a lot of scenes there really is only one character that appears on the screen at any given time. This really puts the emotions being portrayed at the forefront and further enhances the already great acting performances. As a viewer the small frame made me feel as if I myself was cramped into a little box. When things are looking up for Steve and Diane the frame widens and when the characters finally get their breath of fresh air the viewer experiences the same as they are finally able to escape from that little box they were trapped in. This aspect ratio does have its side effects though as it comes at the cost of the quality of some of the set-up shots. Some were still fairly well done however, but others probably would have turned out a lot better if it had been done in a regular aspect ratio. This is just a minor thing though as it really does not matter in the grand scheme of things.What the movie also does not do well is the pace in which the story is told. The movie slows down tremendously just halfway through its runtime and again just before it reaches its ending point. These moments don't last long however as they are over just before the viewer would lose interest but the movie in its entirety would probably have benefited a lot if a good twenty minutes was scraped of its 139 minute runtime. All in all 'Mommy' is an extremely solid movie with great acting performances at its forefront. Xavier Dolan's incredible use of the aspect ratio provides a unique cinematic experience that is absolutely worth the watch.My rating: 8/10",Mommy
40,mmaaddllyy,Everyone deals with their lives their own ways,8,10 May 2020,"But I found this movie was just like life and that's maybe why I liked it so much.
Some people were disappointed with the lack of depth in the characters but people don't always show much depth and are just who they are.Some people were also annoyed with how mental health was portrayed. Mental health can be portrayed in multiple ways and I don't think that any person with a critical mind would think that every ADHD teenager would be like Steve.Some people criticised the frame. I think it's a great way to change it up and watch a movie differently. Cinema needs innovation and this was a welcomed one.As for the end, it's not necessary what I expected but at the end of the day, it's also pretty realistic to me.Some people hate how the person who said to love the most acted apparently with the least love and the fact that it teaches a 'bad lesson'.Movies don't need to be like fables and teach lessons. Again, life is life. We have to stop looking for specific lessons.A good movie is an experience full of emotions. This movie is a good one. It's not perfect. For example it is hard to patch the mum's work life but I'd rather watch this than the polished boring crap our cinemas are full of.",Mommy
41,Prabhat_KS,The film is a riot. Excellent piece of cinema.,10,29 March 2016,"When I thought of watching 'Mommy' there were two factors which militated against it. One was language barrier. The movie is in fluent French and I know from experience that a lot of meaning is lost in translation via subtitles. Second was the cultural barrier. Being a middle-class conservative Indian, I usually find it difficult to connect with many foreign thematic films. But to my sheer surprise, 'Mommy' was a complete riot – far better and stimulating than 'Batman vs Superman' crap which I crawled through the previous day. 'Mommy' is one of those movies where screenplay moves fast yet the story unfolds slowly. This ingenuity shifts the film from art-house to entertaining realm. 2-3 months of characters' lives take around 130 minutes of screen time which give ample time for all details to unfold. Despite the subject matter being serious, the film never appears to be dry. Thorough importance is given to character development. I must add that I haven't seen such marvelous character development in my recent history of film-watching. We get to know and empathize with all idiosyncrasies of the characters. We laugh and cringe with the on-screen characters. The plot of the film is not predictable at all. Just when you think you figured out what is happening the story throws up a new dimension. At places hidden emotional feelings of Patrick are insinuated which compel the viewer to churn his mind. Die's dream sequence towards the end of the film showing Patrick's life successful and happy was truly surreal and well placed - a mother's dream for his son. Overall, 'Mommy' is the finest Canadian film I saw in a long time. The film is truly a riot - an excellent piece of cinema.",Mommy
42,michaelsharples96,A truly emotionally riveting drama.,10,15 September 2015,"'Mommy' is a captivating drama about a recently widowed mother who has moved to a new home and is trying to raise her violent son. She finds hope as he gains the interest of their new neighbour. It is written and directed by Xavier Dolan (Lawrence Anyways) and touches on some very emotional and riveting stuff, which I will get to in a few moments. But ultimately it shows the limits a mother would go through to protect their child and keep them safe. At least, that's what I took from it.As you can tell by my page I haven't really delved deep into many movies for a while and have mostly given quick careless remarks but this is one I feel like talking about. I'm going to go a less linear way about this and start with what I didn't like about the movie, which I must say, isn't much. There are all but two things I didn't like about this movie. First of which being the dialogue. I'm not talking about the quality of the dialogue here because there is really nothing I dislike about that, more so the speed of it. I've been watching anime for years now so I have absolutely no problem following subtitles. The dialogue here though is incredibly fast, It doesn't at all harshen the quality of the movie but I sometimes felt myself having to go back a few steps and watch the scenes again and that kinda takes out out of it when it comes to the more dramatic scenes. You might not all have this problem but do take into account when watching this that there will be very speedy dialogues.The second thing being the music. Now this may not have occurred with anyone else but the music in this film felt quite tonally different. Following emotional scenes with cheery pop songs just didn't feel fluent to me. I like the songs in their own right but It felt like I turned the channel over to something different, which I know many people will disagree with me on. That's pretty much the only thing I wasn't big on, I LOVED everything elseStarting with the three leads. They had phenomenal chemistry, I believed absolutely every single scene these guys interacted with one another. The performances themselves are breathtaking especially from Antoine-Olivier Pilon (Steve) for someone of his age to completely and psychologically delve into his character the way he did shows tremendous talent, definitely one to look for in the future.The cinematography and the score were also incredible. The wide shots were used to perfection and the actor close-ups were used necessarily and timely with utmost precision. The score that accompanies the dramatic scenes are brilliant and impact the viewer just that much harder, which is what they're supposed to do. It MORE than succeeds.The confrontation scene between Steve and Kyla (Suzanne Clement) is some of the most gripping stuff i've seen all year, even more so than recent action movies. It also illustrated just how damaged Steve is as a character and just how amazing Antoine is as an actor. I feel like I'm not talking enough about Steve's mother, Diane (Anne Dorval). She was fantastic. There really isn't much more I can say about the cast and performances that hasn't already been said, let's just leave it at that.**SPOILER TERRITORY**Penultimately I want to talk about my favourite scene of the entire film. Which is the flash forward into a future that could have been. The scene shows what could have become of Steve's life. It show's him growing up, happy, getting married, having a child, the so, called ""perfect life"" but we know this just simply cannot happen it is foreshadowing for what will eventually happen. The score and the lighting choice that accompanies this scene is breathtakingly beautiful, one of my favourite scenes of the year, or maybe even the decade so far. Finally, the scenes that follow of Diane turning Steve over to the mental institution is one of the most gut wrenching experience I've witnessed in modern cinema. The undying love this mother had for her son and wanting him to get better lead to her doing something she didn't want to, and she REALLY didn't want to, she felt she had no choice. Incredibly emotional and saddening along with incredible performances that really make you feel it and believe it. I also love the final shot of Steve running towards the window, ready to escape and leave the painful life he's been gifted. Truly astonishing.",Mommy
43,ReviewingFilms,10 minutes of plot stretched over 130 minutes,4,8 September 2021,"This film drags. And drags. There is a lot of shouting and make-ups. The director/writer was only 24 - which is possible when, like him, one of your parents is already a successful actor in the business. Pity talented 24 year olds without the rocket launch of nepotism didn't get a chance to make something better with the five million dollars used to make this film, not to mention the distribution and marketing resources.The 1:1 aspect ratio is a pretentious annoyance that adds nothing to the viewing experience, to put it mildly.The most moving moments are cheats since they piggy-back on the artistry and nostalgia of popular songs - ones which were certainly not composed for the soundtrack. A good film is enhanced by a score, and doesn't need to resort of the cheap trick of acting as a top 40 DJ to compensate for weaknesses in the screenplay.That aside, the acting is convincing, in a documentary sort of way - at least the acting of the crazed mommy and psychopathic son. One doesn't doubt their mental illnesses for a moment.If the intention of this production had been to create a message or a work of art, this would have been a wonderful ten minute short film on Youtube.",Mommy

45,kraljevic411,Mother's Immortal Love,10,13 March 2017,"Mommy is a drama about a problematic teenager Steve, diagnosed with ADHD, kicked out of school, and his not much less problematic single mother Diane. The two are not an ideal combination in making the best life decisions but they most certainly remind you what true bondage between a mother and a son represents.The whole story is quite overwhelming, with a lot of ups and even more downs. The basic point is to show how every mother loves her child eternally and to indicate that the love can't be broken whatsoever. Every child knows it but rare are the ones who are truly grateful and who cherish it each day... Which they should, because a mother is a person who loves you most from your first to the last day of life, even though it may not always seem that way. So, this movie makes you wonder if you are enough thankful for having a caring and loving mother.I liked that this drama shows in fact an extreme situation in family and it is more than interesting watching oscillations in relationship between Steve and Diane. It was honestly an emotional roller coaster for me too and, as I said, inspired me to revalue my priorities and encouraged me to value immaterial things in life. I highly recommend watching this movie. It is a rare, but a well deserved 10/10 from me.",Mommy

48,lefkiosvanrooy,A defining point in Xavier Dolan's career; one that truly shows what this director is capable of,9,28 March 2016,"By this point, I can say with confidence that each movie Xavier Dolan has made has been a unique experience, quite distinct in form and feeling from the rest. While I may not have fully enjoyed each and every single one of his films, I can still appreciate the art and film making technique that has underpinned each and every one of them. Mommy however, is a movie made with such tenderness, such whim and such charisma with its characters so lively so passionate and so louder-than-words that it manages to touch you in a way no other movie of his has managed to do in such extent. Hence why I believe this film is a defining point in Dolan's career, one that truly shows what this director is capable of. The film's protagonist, a foul-mouthed, hyperactive and completely inappropriate child-like soul, carries out some of the film's best comedic moments and at the same time some of the most emotional and breathtakingly human moments. The majority of the film is shot in a 1:1 aspect ratio, allowing for a widening of the screen in moments of pure and exalted emotion, like the absolute sense of freedom Steve feels riding in the streets with his trolley, throwing lemons to the car drivers furiously waiting before him. Another one of these times is when his mom, in a moment of hope, envisions what she wants her son's life to be and all of the wonders of life she wants him to experience (this particular scene is the 1st part of the script written by Dolan after hearing Ludovico's incredible piano piece). Xavier presents us with 3 characters that are so dysfunctional in their own lives, yet together they manage to create a family so strong and unbreakable. Despite Steve's mannerisms continuously pushing the 2 women's limits, the two never lose sight of the enormous heart this volatile kid has, and become determined to help him pursue his dreams and defy a constitution that wants to deem him unsafe and a potential threat to society. When the mother sees no way of truly helping her son in the long run, she places her final shreds of hope to the hands of specialists, and chooses to believe that her son will be safe in their hands. Steve however, after a few words of remorse and appreciation for all his mom has done for him, chooses to flee from the entrapment of the institution, and chase the feeling of ultimate freedom that once allowed him to be truly and utterly alive. These characters, this score and this sweet, heartfelt and ultimately tragic story therefore manage to touch in the most profound of ways.",Mommy

Also, Diane becomes friends with Kyla, who lives across the street. However, the life is poor because Diane can't work very much and must pay the cost of treatment of the man who Steve injures. This movie is sad and painful. Steve only wants his mother to be glad, but he bothers her. Steve is very cute. I want to watch again when I become the mother. Also, this movie is a camera-work and the mood only the director is capable of. You will have a strange feeling after you watch this movie.",Mommy

Firstly, I decided to watch the movie, after I almost gave up because I thought the movie file or my player software had a problem because the screen appeared squeezed and short-sized and I didn't know what was going on, then I kept watching it and I realized it was made on purpose by this fantastic young director, the screen wideness got wider or smaller trough the movie regarding the mood, the feelings or the situations in the plot. It was the first time I saw such approach in films, to be honest. Then, there is the actors performance, which is brilliant trough the whole movie, mainly the main actress' performance, but the performance of the main male actor is a standout to point too. This plot addresses some interesting points, such as a dysfunctional mom-son relationship ala Nornam Bates and his mother, a maladaptive behavior of a person with ADHD and its percussions to the people around him, simple themes as love, friendship. The whole movie is just filled with emotions. Not to mention the soundtrack of this film, it is indeed proper for the scenes, well chosen and great. I certainly hope to see more of these cinema art pieces from this director.",Mommy
51,Irishmonk,Film made to be watched on a phone.,2,18 October 2021,"I'd say watch this on your phone but it might annoy the OS assistant. This is self-important, egomaniacal claptrap from a director so far up his own a$$hole that he has to fart to say action. It is pretentious, annoying rubbish starring characters you wish you could stick in an industrial blender and feed to feral cats.And DON'T EVEN GET ME STARTED on the utterly dickish decision to use a 1:1 aspect ratio. 10 years in cinema jail for that pathetic, ""artistic"" gimmick. Widescreen worked for Kubrick in The Shining which is a pretty claustrophobic film, and he made that work. But I guess this young gun director thought he knew better. Guess the gimmick didn't actually start a trend, dingbat. Take your ass back to film school and learn something by watching directors who know how to direct and shoot.",Mommy
52,NutterJr,Kick in the guts,10,20 March 2019,"This film leaves you feeling as if you've been kicked in the guts (similar effect had the 'We need to talk about Kevin') with truly stellar performances, a mature direction with striking images that carve into your mind, and a story that even though most of us have never faced feels very personal indeed. Highly recommended!",Mommy
53,oranjestad-99120,Extremely bad feature-film,1,24 July 2017,"The director of this film seems does not know anything or does not want to know (even worser when so) about dramatisation. The story is very boring and uninteresting, for sure for the general public. Acting is awful,mostly ""over the top""=overacting, you feel and see that the actors/actresses are acting (very bad when you got that feeling!) This film is one of the most bad films I have ever seen in my life(I am now 71) after seeing about 4400 films and of them most of all the films made by the famous filmdirectors in the world history of filmmaking, as is : Bergmann,Fellini,Kubrick Another good second very bad film is Paper soldier ( made by the son of the Russian filmdirector Herman) That this film has won so much prizes and admirers is nearly only by making a hype about a film which seems to be quite normal nowadays. It seems also because the voters in Cannes etc. cannot find another film to promote of its real values!",Mommy
54,tacpamir01,Sorry but I didn't get the hype.,3,22 May 2021,"I have never watched any of the Xavier Dolan's films before. I sympathize with the directors effort to demonstrate the situation with changes in the aspect ratio. He emphasized the characters emotions via inserting some details like when Steve forced the cinema screen itself to open up while skating. But at all the beautiful scenes the director was hiding behind the beautiful chosen music. The story left so many unexplained points like the motivation and background of the character Kyla. Acting was exaggerated and mediocre except for Antoine Olivier Pilon. Running time of the film was too long and most scenes were dull.In brief summary, this movie is nor a masterpiece neither a trash. It is somewhere between.",Mommy
55,valentinavinci-27177,Mommy is a masterpiece!,10,19 October 2019,"Every kind of disease, whether it is cancer or mental illness is serious ... this is a film that I consider a real masterpiece and it is the story of a boy with attention deficit that after having spent so many moments of despair and depression is locked up in a psychiatric clinic by her mother, disappointed and saddened that she cannot keep her child with her at home.
This guy tried in spite of himself to react positively and his dream was to graduate but life in his case could not change for the better ... if it could never get worse ... this is the demonstration of the fact that the pain inner and mental illness can lead to death, especially if one suffers for long years and the illness is considered chronic. When you suffer intensely you only want to let off steam and be free ... free from all that suffering ... free from all people's prejudices. There are people like Steve who will never get out of it ... yet in all this suffering there is something special about him ... something magical ... fascinating that makes him unique. When he opens the screen, it means to me that he opens up to world and life !!
A genius!
Beautiful and original the shots and beautiful details, thrilling soundtracks ... in short the film Mommy: a masterpiece !!",Mommy
56,walterbruno37,If you're fond of ADD and histrionics go see it,5,7 December 2014,"A brave acting effort that entertains in moments, but tends to miss its target. This film will please some and frustrate others, hence my rating of 5/10. In general, the film is too schematic and too brief in the quiet moments, opting instead for highly theatrical poses. This is more about a mom and mental health than it is about the characters of Diane and Steve. There is little character development, and, when it does develop, it's due to external circumstances. The transitions in Steve, from calm to manic, are disconnected and ungrounded, making for random slice-of-life, not drama. There are too many nice-but-dysfunctional people in this film and they don't say interesting things or embark on any story arc, but merely prattle their dysfunctions. They're wildly improbable and ornamented and often ring hollow, e.g., Steve's mother, a potty-mouth pole-dancer, but who suddenly becomes a literary translator; ???? She may be a decent mom, but still bristles at being called Madame by the authorities, a psychological nonsense: is she a peasant, a hippie, or a grad student? Here and there, there are bits of anti-English bias, all gratuitous and juvenile. Gratuitous too, is the Steve-Kyla interaction. Instead of anchoring the story of the homeschooling within a thematic subplot, Kyla's part merely throws us off the track, as she suffers, giggles, and then explodes in Steve's face, a moment that's as histrionic and arch as everything else in the film. The character of Steve is a type, not a person; he's an enigma who presented too few reasons for me to care about him. By film's end, this (overlong) journey is sketchy. The main plot device does work well, but is ruined by a ludicrous and self-indulgent last scene.",Mommy
57,gerard_chaouat,tabernacle !!!!!,9,23 September 2014,"I just saw this movie tonight at the monthly ""Positif"" avant-première ! the movie was so good that despite a ""urgent prostate problem"" to be medical (I am Md....) I stayed stuck to my seat till the end... The movie is not to be seen by faint people, for it contains a few hard sequences, which are absolutely necessary to depict the gravity of the problem Diane is encountering with her son. 99 % of the people will have no problems with that. Another ""problem"" is the language. It is in ""full Quebecois"", and despite having been many times to Quebec, la Malbaie, and other places, I found the French subtitles .... very useful..... to say the least. But it has to stay like that : it gives the full cultural flavor to this movie. I just wonder how it will sound for English speaking only people with English subtitles. You might lose a full dimension. Well , this is a brilliant cast, and the 3 main characters are both wonderfully playing and directed. The story itself is poignant. At one brief moment, I was almost lead to think there was a happy end ...but , no, this was a dream, and return to earth from the moon was heart breaking..... I will not spoil the developments, but again, I emphasize, this is not a relaxing movie. But it will catch you entangled from the very first minutes to the dramatic end...... Masterpiece ....",Mommy
58,andreas-sellfors,A love story between a mother and a son whit ADHD,10,10 April 2018,"Xavier Dolan is hardly 30 years old, but has already made eight movies. For me is mommy the first film of him that i have seen. It is settled in Quebec in the near future, and in accordance with a new Canadian law (S 14), that allowds parents of children with neuropsychiatric disabilities to place their uncontrollable child in health care institutions. For Diane Désprés (Anne Dorval), mother of 15-year-old Steve (Antoine-Olivier Pilon), it this completely ruled out as a option. When Steve is thrown out of his last youth home, after firing in he cafeteria school and causing severe burns to another student, Diane takes him home to her house It obviously leads to a lot of problems even if they love each other, which I recognize, as I also have an ADHD-diganos. It makes it extra hard to see Steve suffer in the tumult that occurs between them, no matter who is ""guilty"" for the moment. All the scens in the movie quickly switches between the characters' both negative and positive emotions. As for the style of the has Xavier made it in 1.1 format, which gives the feeling of that is as recorded whit a verry expensive mobile camera. It gets you grasped by the people's facial expressions. However, In the scene, where Steve goes on a longboard and cries out freedom!, the format enlarges and captures the environment. You really getting touched by Steve's longing for freedom when he does not live up to the demands of the environment. His feelings are enhanced by film music, which are well-known hits like Oasis Wonderwall and Lana del Reys Born to die.",Mommy
59,dvehampton,Unbelievable!,10,28 June 2021,"This film has been on my radar since shortly after it came out. I thought ""A French language drama? Not for me."" I just assumed it'd be dull. I watched Tom at the Farm(another movie I've known about but resisted watching for years that's directed and lead by Xavier Dolan) last night and realized Xavier Dolan isn't messing around. I could pretentiously break down what makes this a great movie but it would be easier to just say ""Everything"" about it is brilliant. Acting, writing, incredibly real, multi layered, complex characters perfectly developed. The soundtrack fits each scene as if they were made together for this specific purpose. It conveys the emotions of the scene maybe the best I've seen in any film. Drama is not my favourite genre. It just so happens that many of the best all around movies and hence many of my favourites are drama's. This is now among them. It provokes a wide array of emotons like so few others. A truly brilliant movie! Watch it! You won't be disappointed if you have a beating heart in your chest. I hope that wasn't too pretentious. I'm sorry but the review titled ""if you like ADD and histrionics see this film"" is so hilariously telling of the person who wrote it. The reason you don't get it the way the majority do is because you either live an incredibly privileged life, a very sheltered life where your only examples of real people come from TV(or any kind of media) or you're a sociopath and can't experience the empathy(the identification with the characters and their life situations) that this movie demands for it to be felt or appreciated as it was designed. That must be a boring, dull existence I imagine. That's empathy! Not to necessarily feel bad but to be able to put yourself in another's shoes and imagine how they must feel. The depiction of Stevie going from calm as you described it(which of all things he never really is)to manic is the most realistic of how a young man struggling with mental illness reacts or behaves. He is provoked by what is said and how it makes him feel about himself many times. If you had any experience to draw upon that would be obvious.",Mommy
60,Alexyyz,Intense drama about a young man with family issues.,7,23 October 2014,"This film is loud and will keep you riveted but be prepared to be verbally assaulted. The actors are excellent and convey their roles perfectly. They never waver. You never lose your train of thought. That said, the subject of the film is difficult to watch and you feel trepidation as it moves along. It does have moments of respite and the soundtrack helps alleviate the tension, but it keeps reminding you that the business of this film is unsettling.I gave it a lower score because I found it too abusive to watch in places. Yes, thats the reality the film is conveying, but perhaps it was too real for me.",Mommy
61,Kosmologia,Visceral,10,20 January 2015,"There is definitely a lot to say about ""Mommy"". So many sides to it that I honestly do not know where to begin. The first aspect that really got a hold on me was the cinematography, as well as the photography. The camera, directed by Xavier Dolan, manages to make the viewer breathe an aura of beauty and gleam in most of the scenes, insofar as the movie as a whole can actually be classified as one of those rare masterpieces in which you may - and often you do - easily get lost. And the soundtrack certainly plays a role in this game. From Dido to Céline Dion, from Eiffel 65 to Andrea Bocelli, from Oasis to Ludovico Einaudi, each artist and each song is perfectly accurate for the moment in which it is played. Especially and eventually Lana Del Rey with her ""Born To Die"". But I think the greatest aspect of the entire movie, if you can find one single aspect better than another one, is the structure and the interior complexity of the very few characters. Both *Die* and Steve, and Kyla as well, have a both strong ad anguished personality, and the bounds that exist among them are, in one word, visceral. As visceral as their true essence. As visceral as the situation in which they are imprisoned, and from which they can escape only in very few moments of « Liberté », as Steve screams to the sky. Only in this coinciding moments the framing widens, turning from a square to a giant rectangle, and the spectator is suddenly swallowed by the excitement of the characters, by their joy. By their innate and genuine HAPPINESS.",Mommy
62,gustavomaranhao-24378,"""Loving people doesn't save them.""",9,27 December 2020,"The film is aesthetically too beautiful with an analogue footprint, the format of the screen 1:1 talks to the audience representing the feelings of the characters and the scene that plays Wonderwall is breathtakingly beautiful. I intend to re-watch this film in the near future.",Mommy
63,alvarobustamante,a movie that leaves you speechless,10,5 September 2021,"How difficult to talk about this movie, it seems that there are a thousand things to say, but the first thing that comes out is that it is a masterpiece. I do not know I can expect less from the director Xavier Dolan who this time tries to show us the life of Steve (Antoine Oliver Pilon) a boy with anger and hyperactivity problems who returns to live with his mother (Anne Dorval) after being in the hospital psychiatric and to show us their complicated relationship due to their problems. Before this, a new neighbor also joins that will help Steve to serve as a guide in his life for him. With this scoop, the director takes us on a one-way journey down a path of violence, music and personal growth, where everything will be shown from very dark tones with a 1: 1 screen distribution to let us see how suffocated they are. Characters with their lives and when things are better the screen will open for us, and also let us see beautiful colors in a scene that personally captivated my hearts by the song and the meaning of it. The performance by me seems incredible, as real as it is destructive, each scene of anger makes him inhibit himself and bdndbd is the opposite, he generates pain and suffering for the things he has to endure around him but always facing it as best he can, and please do not leave Suzanne Clément aside as the most tender neighbor and with a past that without knowing much always gives us empathy, in addition to the affection and quick chemistry that she gives with Steve.In conclusion, this film in its genre is one of the best and the first to be shown when it comes to films with and for adolescents, it touches sensitive issues in a huge way, without falling into excessive sensitivity or exaggerating things but showing the reality , its ups and downs, that happiness can be found in an old woman on skateboard listening to oasis and the rest does not matter.",Mommy
64,williambrown-53298,Devastating,9,3 October 2021,This film is shot beautifully! The soundtrack is one of the best out there and I'll never be able to listen to Experience without getting emotional. I was so invested in the characters' lives. The ending broke me. Dolan has a real gift!,Mommy
65,movie-op,A daring film that will stick with you,9,29 November 2014,"A winner of the Special Jury Prize at Cannes, Mommy is filled with daring choices, from the 1:1 screen ratio, the prominent use of familiar pop songs, and the introduction of a world exactly like our own, only with one small legal change. That last one might not seem very daring, but when you realize how subtly it changes the world around these particular characters, the fact that the legal change is only explained in the beginning and never mentioned again is extraordinary. In fact, it's remarkable how much of the film revolves around things unsaid when you take into account the verbosity of two of its leads. The mother-son pair at the center of Mommy are rough, unrefined people, although the son proves to be the more volatile of the two. Their neighbor, for reasons only vaguely stated but emotionally understood, becomes enmeshed in their family, and the two women struggle together to correct the path of the troubled son. The film doesn't demonize any of the characters, no matter how many wrong turns they make, and lovingly shows the way that families can be made and broken. This was the only film I've seen all year to achieve what Roger Ebert called elevation, to the tune of Oasis's growling Wonderwall. Unfortunately, this film just misses all-time greatness with an ending that seems unsure of when to stop.",Mommy
66,Vladdus,'Not a dull moment with Steve',10,16 February 2015,"Five months ago, I had no idea who Xavier Dolan was. Now, after watching 'Mommy', I have no hesitation in saying that he's one of most talented artists to have come into prominence in the past few years.What director and writer Xavier Dolan, who is 25, achieves with 'Mommy' is quite spectacular. Not only does he manage to impress with top-notch directorial skills and an impressive and complex understanding of human relationships, but he has successfully accomplished the ultimate goal of a filmmaker: transmitting emotions -- pure, unaltered feelings.I was never a supporter of the idea of re-watching films; I thought that by re-watching a movie, you would lose precious time that could have been used to watch a potentially even better film. However, 'Mommy' has completely destroyed this concept for me. Leaving the cinema room, I had a sense of restlessness that went away only after watching it for the second time. And guess what? The feelings the film transmitted remained as fresh and relevant as they were the first time.There are a myriad of aspects that are worth discussing when referring to this film: the fabulous actors, the impressive use of music, the clever use of colors, the numerous jaw-dropping cinematography-related details and the variety of raw feelings 'Mommy' explores. But, by analyzing each of these aspects in detail, you may risk to experience a film whose surprises will not be as poignant as they would be by discovering them yourself.I can safely say that 'Mommy' left an indelible mark on me. Its honesty, the beauty it exudes and its life-affirming tone make for an enthralling chef d'oeuvre that will undoubtedly have a certain effect on whoever decides to watch it. To sum up, 'Mommy' manages to do what an important piece of art does: communicate authentic feelings. And, for this, I am grateful. Bravo, Dolan!",Mommy
67,emarcesse,Sublime,10,16 December 2014,"My judgment is probably a bit biased since I've seen all the work of Dolan and I loved it. I Killed My Mother was a cinematic shock. I waited for over eight months to watch Mommy. And yet, I was a little apprehensive. Afraid of being possibly disappointed . It often happens with me when critics and public is too unanimous. But Nay! The film is sublime, a master piece. It's beautiful. It's a pearl of sensitivity. We sail with the characters on a delicate balance between hope and fatality. It's just beautiful, genuine, fragile and strong.How a kid gets to build that kind of realization so sophisticated, so pure ? Attention let us be said, Dolan is a genius ! Congratulations to you Xavier and long life to your creativity !",Mommy
68,SpookyTaylor,Dolan Does It Again!,9,22 November 2014,"I absolutely adored this film. Dolan has a way with cinema, weaving together stories that are difficult to watch, fascinating, touching, disturbing at times... Mommy was no exception. The film is emotionally taxing to say the least. These characters experience the highs and lows of life, and through excellent filmmaking we are just as involved in feeling these emotions as they are. One of the things that really stood out to me was just how carefully the form reflected the content in this film. In moments of sadness or stress, the aspect ratio was very boxy. When I say boxy, I mean even more narrow than 4:3 - the ratio was almost claustrophobic. By doing so, not only are the characters being framed in a more up close and personal way, but we also (due to the fact that we're generally used to very specific aspect ratios) feel that we are somehow missing information. It's almost as if we're peering through the crack of a door. Like we are spying, voyeurs. In the moments of happiness, the frame blossoms into widescreen. Suddenly, we are a part of what's going on. We are free. We no longer have only restricted glimpses into Steve and Diane's life, instead being welcomed with (at times literal) open arms. The best part of the changing aspect ratio was how seamlessly they transition into one another. It's very impressive. Other important mentions are the incredible performances by, well, everyone involved, and the Home Alone references! My only reason for not giving the film 10 stars was the choice of music. I found that it was often distractingly recognizable, and it took away from the powerhouse performances. Of course there are exceptions to this, such as the Celine Dion scene, but otherwise I would have preferred more obscure music to play throughout the film. Still, seeing as most of it was diegetic, I can understand why it was used.",Mommy
69,massyk-34198,POV disconnect,6,10 May 2020,"Aside from exceptional performances and a decent script, I took issue with the choice of music in the film, more specifically at the moments they were used. Although I listen to these artists myself on occasion, I just felt the choices didn't quite mix too well with our protagonist (Steve). Not really sure if they were meant to be from his direct point of view, but perhaps different choices may have aided in our connection with him; some were a touch too ""mellow"" at points. But I understand the discretion of not trying to be too explicit.Also, the issue of paying for Steve's past behaviour at his former school wasn't really resolved. Perhaps his mother could have been in a small apartment in the ending scenes or we observed her saying thanks again to a person wearing a suit and toting a briefcase leaving her house as her neighbour entered. Not sure, maybe I missed something.What I took from the mothers ""flash forward"" scene near the end kind of made her seem a bit more selfish in terms of not wanting to potentially lose the connection with her son. It made me question her motivations of truly helping him for him and not just for her own insecurities.Nice Job overall.",Mommy
70,valentinavinci-92094,Mommy: the most punchy and emotional movie ever.,10,12 July 2020,"Sometimes love cannot heal completely but it always wins because it is able to heal wounds that can do much harm. It is the story of a boy with attention deficit disorder. After having spent many moments of despair and depression, he is locked up in a psychiatric clinic by his mother, disappointed and saddened by not being able to keep her son at home but stubborn in having him locked up in a structure.
This boy tried in spite of himself to react positively and his dream was to graduate but life perhaps had raged too much on him, especially when a parent takes over the different expectations of a child.
The scene that makes me more serene and gives me a feeling of freedom is the one in which Steve, his mother and their friend dance carefree and sing a piece by Celine Dion. Hence their desire to escape from problems through music. This is the demonstration for which
inner pain can sometimes lead to death especially if you suffer for long years. The freedom to live peacefully and to love should not be denied to people. When you suffer intensely you just want to let off steam and be free and from here I quote the scene in which he turns on himself with a shopping cart and throws it away with determination almost to represent that cart as his rival who is depriving him of his dignity and freedom from all that suffering and all those people's prejudices. There are people like Steve who can never get out of it. Maybe. Yet in all this suffering there is something special about him. There is so much love and lightheartedness that although exaggerated for many people, it frighteningly envies them since from the moment Steve opens the screen, he himself decides to open up to the world and life !! It is a film considered by me personally, a true genius as well as a masterpiece!",Mommy

72,gaara1231,Absolutely Stunning and Powerful Masterpiece,10,5 October 2014,"Wow! I was left with tears and emotional instability after watching this film. I mean this in the best way possible of course. I've never been so emotionally AND PHYSICALLY moved by a film. Mommy is so powerful and touching in so many ways because it captures a lot of problems, turmoils, and emotions that we all experience. In fact, it didn't feel like I was watching a film. I felt like I was living with these characters and experiencing everything they were going through. Laughing with the characters during their happiest moments, crying with the characters through their darkest times, and feeling frightened of what would happen next were all sentiments I felt throughout the film. This brings me to one of the most amazing aspects of the film-the acting.The acting was absolutely superb! Everyone was terrific. The three main characters depicted by Anne Dorval, Suzanne, Clément, and Antoine Olivier Pilon were so engaging and compelling. They WERE their characters. I didn't feel like I was watching actors acting-it was so real! Bravo to all the whole cast!The cinematography was breathtakingly beautiful. Xavier Dolan films are always a treat because they are all so visually stunning. Dolan captures many of the activities we do such as dancing with our family and friends, falling onto our beds, riding our bikes/longboards, and karaoking so majestically. Dolan is truly talented.I was very excited to see Mommy for the longest time and I was not disappointed. I was transported to a different, magical, yet realistic world. I want to thank everyone involved in the production of Mommy. It was extremely powerful and so painfully relatable. I think about this film everyday and still get emotional. The soundtrack was lovely-I listen to it everyday and the songs evoke so much more meaning now. EVERYBODY, GO WATCH MOMMY!",Mommy

As a gay man I have always loved his voice, so young and so fresh what's not to like?No gay content here but human drama and real people in real life trying to get through. The boy isn't always likable but his charisma shines through and u cant help but grin at his awful antics. And in the end its totally about them all, all 3 of them each has a presence and a character and a story.In this movie, for me its that scene, the future forward one towards the end. I didn't see it coming and I didn't realise it had come until the final scenes, Rewind and watch it again after you've seen the end.

She is explosive in Mommy! I haven't written a review yet but her performance encouraged me to do so. Antoine-Olivier Pilon was great, and Suzanne Clement was also top notch.I've never been so deeply affected by a movie. I went back and forth between laughter and tears throughout the entire movie. There were several scenes that I related to....Something that really resonated with me was the scenes where the 3 main characters were laughing, dancing, enjoying life. I personally have a hard time remembering the moments in my life where I was truly happy. I believe that is because in those moments I was so deeply immersed in conversation and laughter that my brain was incapable of creating a memory. While watching Mommy I wasn't able to remember those moments in my life but I was able to make the connection because the performances and script were so realistic. Thank you Xavier Dolan! Waiting for more...",Mommy
75,anidaa94,One word: A Masterpiece!,10,12 July 2016,"I have seen this film a couple of months ago. However, the initial feeling, still, lingers. The emotions it conveys are so profound, that they make a long-term mark on the audience.Dolan has really outdone himself this time. Especially, the part with experiencing with the different screen ratio. Even though he is not the first one to use this technique, it found an excellent spot in presenting the constant inner conflicts that all main characters are experiencing, especially, their inability to find a solution and get out of the cages they have imposed on themselves. The one time the screen widens for a moment is during the Wonderwall scene, where Steve feels free for one a slight moment, then it comes back to the mundane life problems.After the gradual introduction, I was really starting to feel a bit driven up the wall with this small ratio, like a small crack in a wall through which I am trying to make a complete picture of the characters. Hereupon, the On ne change pas scene took place, which literally knocked me down. An extraordinary scene, music depicted both situation and their emotions so vividly: Steve's dance, feeling emotionally free for a moment. Another important aspect is the acting. Stunning performance by Anne Dorval, loving, determined mother, who wants to keep her child no matter what, as she is driven by her guilty conscience that she hasn't given Steve appropriate childhood. Also, young Antoine-Olivier Pilon gave an excellent role of the disrupted adolescent, who is trying to find his place under the sun and fight his psychiatric problems. In a summary, breathtaking experience, strong, visceral movie, that will not leave you indifferent. Highly recommended!",Mommy

79,Luchsor,Masterpiece,10,4 October 2016,I have a habit when I have seen movies at home at my desktop. Alone. I clap hands. And the more and the louder and the longer I clap - the more benefit it might had caught. But this one? It's just to hold your head down for a many seconds and admire how talented and extraordinary some people are. How they are able to create and deliver story and circumstances that transport feelings and impressions like this ... one of the best movies in the last ten years. Thank you. There's a melody behindeverything you see in cinema. There's a sense behind nearly half of everything you like to touch you. But there are only a few movies in a century that allow you to emphasize throughout a hole moving picture - and this one is definitely one of them.,Mommy
80,maximebertrand,"Priceless, Intelligent, Profoundly Crafted",10,24 September 2014,"This film is an incredible depiction of a large group of the Province of Quebec inhabitants. The language is perfect, the styling, costumes, relations, everything is so poignant by its accuracy. I believe this movie is a historical piece for the culture of the nation. Out of this, it gives a true feel of what love is, of what a mother and a child, and vice-versa, live as emotions. It is a beautiful piece of art, a sociological treasure, and it also has a strong political message. Must see!",Mommy
81,ailtonjosepereira,If I remember I watched this film I'll start crying again.,10,22 October 2014,"I went to Lausanne to watch this movie with a good friend of mine, it would be his second time watching it but he was as excited as I am. It was a masterpiece I don't know if this is considered a spoiler but I honestly felt like I wanted to cry for the rest of the night... I couldn't even speak properly of how astonishing and moving this movie was especially that last song that played on the last scene and goes on for the rest of the credits but there's a bit of a downside to this because if you're not able to relate or identify the songs played during the movie you won't feel the same as I or my friend did because it plays such an intense part in the entire thing. I really don't even know how to describe that feeling but every time I listen to a song from the soundtrack or even think of the movie I just want to cry and cry and re watch it all over again also I can't wait for the bluray and wow Xavier... good luck on your next projects cause it's going to be hard to top something like this, the characters in this movie were so believable and I heard some people thought it was exaggerated well I only have one thing to say about that, your life till now must have been a breeze and be thankful. It was sincerely one of the best movies I think I'll ever watch and I'll stick to this for as long as I can when Xavier stepped out of his own movies thats when he was able to shine the most.",Mommy
82,louise-nissen,The incredible attention to detail,9,26 April 2017,One thing that struck me was the incredible attention to detail that Dolan possesses. As we learn about Dies financial problems and struggles with making ends meet one scene in particular backs up this statement. The nail polish bottles in the refrigerator. A thing that people who buy cheap nail polish is familiar with and such a beautiful use of mise-en-scene. The film works solely because of Dolans unique attention to detail and is a delight to watch because of it.,Mommy
83,catarina-frp,One of the best movies so far,9,6 June 2020,"Incredible shots and awesome colors.
So simple and so good.
It's a must see",Mommy
84,sloj3,Neurodivergents are scary and abusive!,1,26 September 2017,"Just what we needed: yet another movie that portrays people with mental illnesses/differences as predatory and abusive. Especially when it's coated with apologism because he's a white boy, even though it didn't particularly get into what passes for mental health care in the US. Then again I got too fed up with using mental conditions as a bogeyman that I turned it off. But hey, it passed the lowest bar ever: The Bechtel Test.",Mommy
85,canberk_songur,Absolutely Stunning Film,9,23 May 2018,"It can be easily said that Xavier Dolan is one the foremost directors of our time and he proved this by making this gorgeous film.
The film contains so much dramatic elements and uses them accurately. Furthermore, there are some scenes that are so humorous.
You might see yourself while giggling those scenes.If we talk about cast and performances , we could say the actor,playing Steve, showed us one of the most perfect 
teenager performances who tries to deal with psychological problems
and the mother made us feel the reality of the low class Canadian family.Of course the other leading actress succesfully accompanied them.The way of Xavier Dolan's using musics was great. 
Although the musics were well-known by people by us, we literally effected all of them thanks to Xavier Dolan's wise.
Espically the scene that consisted of the music Exprience by Ludovico Einaudi is the best scene of the film.I just froze. The film has some shortcomings, one of them is scenario.The Script was relatively standart.
It was usual and not able to make us really suprise. But don't worry probably you won't care while watching because of its awesome atmosphere.
Another shortcoming is that The film ,towards in the midlle of it,was dull. It was not only dull but also boring.
Nonetheless, it was be able to overcome after some boring scenes.
You were being able to find yourself watching the film without even taking breath.
 
What is great about this film is that we could see marvelous performances and of course the expertism of the Xavier Dolan's directing.Score : 9/10",Mommy
86,lozoyarrafael,Awful,2,5 July 2020,"This film is one of the heaviest anda worst I've seen the last years. Histrionic, exagerated... It's impossible todo believe one scene...Avoid it",Mommy
