0,TheLittleSongbird,An under-cooked recipe that never reaches the boil let alone burns,4,20 March 2018,"People are probably tired of hearing me say what is going to be said now, being not the first time it's been said. Only because it is applicable to more than one film. 'Burnt' had an interesting idea that indicated a good story if done right, a talented cast deserving of material worthy of them and it would certainly entice anybody who enjoys their food and likes fine dining. 'Burnt' is not an awful film by any stretch and certainly is not a film with no redeeming values, but it is not hard to see why reviews were lukewarm to negative. There was a good film somewhere in 'Burnt', sadly despite such great promise it never emerges. Essentially it was a lukewarm bland film that would have basically fared better with less ingredients and cooked the remaining elements all the way through. There are things that work in 'Burnt's' favour and stops it from being completely raw. Sorry for the food/cooking references, can't resist. The best thing about it is Bradley Cooper, an excellent performance that burns with intensity regardless of the one-dimensional and trying-too-hard-to-be-a-demon-chef way his character is written. Daniel Bruhl also rises above the material. Sienna Miller gives 'Burnt' some heart and charm, a very competent performance actually considering what was given to her (which generally was not a whole lot to write home about) and her personal life, while very clichéd, is somewhat identifiable and just about avoids the over-sentimentality route. It's competently filmed, the soundtrack while not unforgettable is nice enough and the food is delicious-looking and how the ways it's cooked is portrayed makes one want to cook something in your own privacy.Not all the cast come off well, well actually the rest of the cast. They all try their best, but they are either wasted (Emma Thompson), useless (Alicia Vikander, her character and writing rather than her) or forgettable (Uma Thurman). They are undone by a half-baked script that not even the excessive swearing can give heat to, apart from the odd witty line, and sketchy characterisation where any attempts at development is generally vague. Its portrayal of how kitchen life works came over as over-heated, as fulfilling and exciting it can be it is also very stressful but not to an extent that feels like a wannabe version of 'Hell's Kitchen', if nowhere near as fake or staged but without the savage and hilarious one-liners and insults (at least on that show Gordon Ramsay has a reason to act that way, the main character's behaviour was far too extreme and out of order regardless of his struggles to atone). It certainly does not make one seriously consider going into cooking as a profession, have dealt with my fair share of pressure but this amount shown here would see me quit within hours. Even with the presence of food, it could have featured more and 'Burnt' never feels like a celebration of it and lacks any kind of joy or colour. Its attempts at dissecting the chef's mind never goes deep enough or explored properly, it just feels vague and under-done. The underworld debt subplot never catches fire and lacks tension completely, wouldn't have said no to it being left out and the film finding another way of the main character starting afresh. The film and its messaging may have been identifiable and relevant, if it rang true, had subtlety, had a main character worth rooting for and didn't override itself in clichés. 'Burnt' is a failure at all four (though the third point has no bearing on Cooper), big missed opportunity.At the end of the day, 'Burnt' was an at times digestible but empty experience, an under-cooked recipe that never reaches the boil let alone burns. 4/10 Bethany Cox",Burnt
1,SnoopyStyle,formulaic but good enough,6,25 April 2016,"Adam Jones (Bradley Cooper) had a meltdown as a two-star Michelin chef in Paris. He was addicted to drugs, alcohol, and women. He burnt down all his bridges, and spent the last couple of years shucking a million oysters in New Orleans. Now clean and sober, he decides to achieve the third star in London. He convinces maître d' Tony to get him started. He recruits many of the old mates and some new ones including sous-chef Helene (Sienna Miller).Bradley Cooper is doing an angry brat looking for salvation. This movie crystallizes when his character tells the therapist that he's gathering a team like the Seven Samurai. Most of these characters become story constructs. There are still good stuff here. I like Sienna Miller and her character. The longer she held out against the inevitable romance, the better her character is. I like the switch with the villain of the movie. I'm always up for some food porn. Overall, it's too formulaic, too much flash, but is good enough of a watch.",Burnt
2,Prismark10,Cooking does not get any tougher,4,14 August 2016,"Top star chefs tend come over as spoilt brats who treat their staff like dirt. Maybe their is an interesting film to be made about a chef at an employment tribunal justifying why treating grown up human being's who happen to be their employees in a humiliating fashion is fine and legal.Burnt centres on Adam Jones (Bradley Cooper) a top chef who went haywire with his addiction issues while working for a high end restaurant in Paris under a prestigious Michelin ranked chef.Adam does not want to make fine cuisine that you eat, he wants to make orgasmic food. A one of a kind experience. After bumming round for a bit he comes to London with an aim of creating a three Michelin star restaurant and tries to get his old crew together some of whom were burnt by him in the past with his drug, drink and sex addiction issues and he still has people chasing him for all debts.Whether Adam has truly reformed is a thorny issue. When something goes wrong in the kitchen he throws tantrums and plates including insulting his sous chef Helene (Sienna Miller) a single parent who he had head hunted from a rival restaurant.The film makes great fun of passing cooking fads such as the recent trend of boil in a bag food or boiled in a condom food as Adam calls it which is presented as haute-cuisine as it seals in the flavours.The story is not very original, the characters are sketchy than fully cooked. Cooper injects enough passion to produce something edible but it is more disposable fast food than gourmet.",Burnt
3,kosmasp,Not as good a(s) Chef,7,25 July 2016,"The other movie that is, where we followed a Chef trying to get back on his feet. But Favreau had other issues than Bradley Cooper has in this one. Favreau was ""burnt"" too in a way, but it was a different kind. He also didn't have the luxury of a budget, someone backing him up who loves him (more than some would like, though through all his flaws and faults that's the one thing that never bothers Coopers character).And talking about downfalls, there is a lot of animosity and rivalry going on. There is also a scene that is a bit too sweet for my taste where things get resolved too quickly. But having the acting talent at hand (even in smaller roles), gives the movie the credibility and the gravitas to go places and succeed in the end nevertheless. Will the Chef succeed though?",Burnt
4,blanche-2,"Bradley Cooper, Master Chef",7,13 May 2017,"The film Burnt came out in 2015 and won six awards here and there. Nevertheless, it did not do particularly well at the box office.It must have been badly marketed, because I found it delightful and well acted by Bradley Cooper, Sienna Miller, Daniel Bruhl, Matthew Rhys, Emma Thompson, and Uma Thurman.Cooper plays Adam Jones, a highly successful chef in France who wrecked his life with drugs, booze, and women. He comes to London to reinvent himself as a premiere chef and wants a third star from Michelin. He looks up people he worked with in Paris and attempts to convince them to work for him, and he also looks for new people. He's impressed with a sous chef (Sienna Miller), who doesn't like him at first. Adam decides to take over his friend Tony's (Daniel Bruhl) restaurant by showing up the night that Michelin is in the restaurant. With his reputation on the line, Tony has no choice but to let him cook.With a team in place, Adam shows himself to be a complete perfectionist who yells, screams, and breaks dishes when the food isn't the way he wants it. One night, after what he thinks is a complete disaster, he shows up wasted at the restaurant of a rival (Matthew Rhys) who tries to help.Such a fun and interesting film, and who minds looking at Bradley Cooper? We get to see some of what goes on in the kitchen of a top restaurant - the film used top people as consultants - and learn just enough to make us curious about what is a truly fine art.Highly recommended.",Burnt
5,tavm,Burnt was a pretty good film about a recovering chef trying a comeback,7,3 November 2015,"This was the only one of the current movies playing at the cinema my friend works at that I hadn't seen yet that I was willing to watch. It was quite entertaining as it went along the narrative. Bradley Cooper plays a once-disgraced chef trying a comeback. So he goes to England where his former boss from France has another restaurant operating there and attempts to work for him again. He also gets some of his former crew back. Then there's a female chef (Sienna Miller) who also reluctantly agrees to work for him. That's because despite his recovery from various vices, he's still quite a jerk as my friend pointed out in the middle of the film. In summary, Burnt took a while but I was pretty entertained as was my friend. Oh, and nice reunion between Cooper and Miller from American Sniper.",Burnt
6,edwagreen,***1/2,9,29 January 2017,"The portions might be small, but the food and film seemed delicious.Having been the master chef, but losing everything due to his lifestyle, Bradley Cooper sets out to rebuild his reputation in this film.A perfectionist to the core, part of the film is devoted for him attempting to assemble a group to work with. He proves impossible to work with. He is a visionary, and against consistency in food. Something variable or different must be on the menu and he instills his love for the culinary among his workers.Other parts of the film are dedicated to pleasing the food critics.I wonder how much weight was gained by Cooper and others while filming took place. With the relatively small portions, probably not that much.",Burnt
7,LeonLouisRicci,"Slightly Interesting, but a High-Brow Decadent World Hardly Worth Exploring",7,24 February 2016,"Inconsistent Character Study that is all over the place and Never Attains a Tone for the Viewer to Settle in and become fully Involved in the Slightly Interesting Story and Offbeat Setting.There are Few Movies About Chefs and the ""Type A"" Personality it takes to attain a Three Star Rating, and it is a Good Attempt, but the Execution leaves Something to be Desired. The Montage is Clunky and Awkward and the Presentation is Rough the Way the Film never Quite Latches on to anything approaching Verisimilitude. Bradley Cooper and the rest of the Cast give it a Good Try but the Film is Never fully Engaging and Interest Wavers. Worth a Watch but is Disappointing and delivers a Frustrating but sometimes Beautiful Display of what passes for a Dinner and a Night out for Snobs and People that have Money to ""Throw Away"" (just like a dish that isn't picture perfect) to Look at Food on a Plate presented as Art, that Ironically Hardly Resembles Food.This Whole World is Foreign to most Folks and when Viewed from a Distance it Reveals Just How Ridiculous, Decadent, and Wasteful it is.",Burnt
8,oscaralbert,Though the racist BURNT isn't the best Foodie flick of all time . . .,7,5 November 2015,". . . it constitutes a partially palatable snack if you can stomach its anti-Black racial bias. Would Andrew Lloyd Webber cast the title character of JEZUS CHR1ST, SUPERSTAR--along with all His disciples--as a Lily White crew, EXCEPT for the betrayer's role (Judas Iscariot), filled by a Black face?! That's exactly what the Weinstein Co. people have done with BURNT, as the only Black character with a speaking part, Michel, turns out to be a sneaky Iago-type biding his time, waiting to gain vengeance against all White People for some perceived wrong in the distant past (maybe his great granddad times nine was kidnapped to Europe in the 1600s). The title for this racist flick seems to single out Michel, referencing his skin tone and intentions toward everyone else, while portraying Blacks as untrustworthy, back-stabbing ticking time bombs. At a Real Life juncture when half of European Whites are engaged in a War against their current influx of darker-skinned refugees, Weintein's Co.'s schedule for releasing a flick set and shot in Europe such as this racist BURNT is tantamount to throwing gasoline on a theater fire!",Burnt
9,neil-476,Why are people saying this is a comedy?,7,12 November 2015,"Chef Adam Jones burnt himself out on drink, drugs and sex by way of achieving too much too young and, in so doing, made some enemies and stored up some problems. Now clean, he is seeking to re-establish himself: but does he still have what it takes, because his people skills are sadly lacking.For some baffling reason, this is labelled as a comedy: I have no idea why, because it is almost devoid of any element of amusement at all. It is a straightforward drama which blends Adam's gradual character development (by virtue of friends who, frankly, he doesn't deserve to have) with very generous helpings of what, I believe, is called ""food porn"" – teasingly lingering shots of exotic foodstuffs being prepared and served.Bradley Cooper as Adam is rather good, and his development arc is believable. The food porn does nothing for me, other than make me think that I would never for a second consider eating at a restaurant which charges an arm and a leg for a minuscule helping of pretentious food on a silly shaped plate which would look more at home in the Museum Of Modern Art. Food fans will have their own views, of course. There is some nice London location work.Cooper gets to show off a bit, the support cast are enjoyable (especially Daniel Bruhl as the restaurateur/hotelier who really shouldn't let Adam through the front door) and the story moves along efficiently, if rather inconsequentially. I didn't actually care very much, though, apart from on short sequence which, to my surprise, moved me immensely (I'll just say ""birthday cake).This is one for London-based foodies.",Burnt
10,ferguson-6,Lightly crusted,6,30 October 2015,"Greetings again from the darkness. This one is not just for all you foodies out there – though there is plenty to digest for those who fancy themselves as some hoity-toity chef to the rich and famous. Don't go in expecting a ""How to Cook"" seminar. Instead, simmer down and prep yourself for a serving of massive ego topped with arrogance and a side of narcissism. Blend those ingredients into one character, and this chef somehow remains likable  when played by Bradley Cooper.Enough with the cooking terms, but let's heap more praise on Mr. Cooper. When first we meet his character Adam Jones, he is readying himself to bounce back after self-destructing his career as a two-star Michelin chef in Paris. He simply walks out the door of the Louisiana diner where he has been serving his self-imposed penance  shelling 1 million raw oysters, each one recorded in his pocket notebook. This provides our first glimpse into the obsessive-compulsive personality of Adam, and helps explain how he has managed to kick his drug, alcohol, and women addictions. Feeling refreshed and on a mission to garner that rarified third Michelin star, Adam begins assembling his team in London and encouraging his old co-worker Tony (Daniel Bruhl, Rush) to entrust him with his restaurant.We can't actually taste the magnificent food that's served on screen, but the colors and textures are a kaleidoscope to our eyes. The movie is beautiful to look at. The restaurant dining rooms are showplaces, the kitchens are pristine, and the customers are mostly dressed like runway models. On top of that, Bradley Cooper and Alicia Vikander (in a small role) are two of the grand champions in the gene pool sweepstakes. All of that beauty is balanced out by the quest for perfection and lack of interpersonal skills displayed by Chef Adam. It's not until his star pupil Helene (Sienna Miller) shows him another way, does Adam even start to resemble a human being.Drug dealers, old flames, a therapist (Emma Thompson), an arch rival (Matthew Rhys, ""The Americans""), an unrequited one-way love, a deceased mentor, a ridiculously cute kid (Lexi Benbow-Hart, sporting hair that would make Julia Roberts envious), and a wronged co-worker (Omar Sy) combine to add plenty of action. Even the quick cut shots in the kitchen manage to make grilling onions and carving a fish interesting.Never digging too deep, director John Wells (August: Osage County) delivers an entertaining movie with wide appeal, and a message of teamwork and family. The story is from Michael Kalesniko and the script from Steven Knight (who also wrote last year's Michelin star-centered The Hundred-Foot Journey). The dialogue is sharp enough to deliver some laughs, though the element of danger doesn't really work, and a couple of times it teeters on gooey melodrama. It doesn't reach the level of Mostly Martha (2002), and is a tick behind last year's Chef (Jon Favreau), but it may offer the most creative lesson yet in how best to serve a dish of revenge. It's a tasty enough treat for those in the mood for an entertaining movie and an endless stream of pretty things to look at.",Burnt
11,anaconda-40658,Well Cooked Entertainment.,9,25 December 2015,"Burnt (2015): Dir: John Wells / Cast: Bradley Cooper, Sienna Miller, Daniel Bruhl, Omar Sy, Matthew Rhys: John Wells presents a realistic view of the hectic work in a kitchen as well as a professional so good at his job that all he can do is sink in despair in hopes of regaining success again. Bradley Cooper plays chef Adam Jones who walked out on a job in a restaurant in Paris thus creating enemies out of former co-workers and employers whose business suffered as a result. He owes money to heavies and struggles with drugs. Now he desires to return to the restaurant business but his dominating personality and his forceful desire to succeed creates divisions with everyone. Cooper plays off the anxiety of someone aiming to be the best yet struggling to erase mistakes. Sienna Miller plays single mother Helene, an accomplished chef in her own right who is reluctantly enlisted by Jones. Conflict follows allowing these two actors a better platform than what American Sniper gave them. Daniel Bruhl plays the homosexual manager of the restaurant that employs Jones. He is frustrated with Jones and his fitful antics but comes to terms with the fact that it comes with dealing with the best in the business. There is great supporting roles that form the core people whom Jones had screwed earlier in Paris. One ends up getting revenge at a pivotal moment, while another ends up demonstrating surprise grace when Jones attempts to suffocate himself inside his restaurant. This is a film about second chances and giving chances to those around us that can prevent us from burning ourselves out and further assisting us in our goals. Score: 9 / 10",Burnt
12,phd_travel,Ignore the silly story just watch the food,5,2 November 2015,"If you don't pay attention to the overblown melodrama of the tantrums and shouting and druggie background and loan shark nonsense, ie ignore the story then this is a mouth watering movie about a gourmet chef trying to make a restaurant get 3 Michelin Stars.It does make you understand somewhat why they charge so ridiculously high prices for food in these fancy restaurants, there is a lot going into it. But the movie could have shown more dazzling creations course by course and identified them clearly. For example this is whatever dish and show it's preparation and serving. In the end the silly story overwhelmed the food and that's why this movie has flopped.The likable cast can't save this movie. Sienna Miller made to look less glam is still very appealing (and too skinny for a chef). She can act anything. Bradley looks a bit plump still from Sniper days I guess but suited to a chef. The supporting cast is likable from Emma Thompson who looks very old to Daniel Bruhl as the Maitre'd. Even Matthew Rhys speaking in a British accent.Compared to the other great food movie of recent years 'Julie and Julia' this movie isn't half as delightful. Despite it's faults there's something that still makes it watchable.",Burnt
13,gradyharp,'People eat because they are hungry; I want to make food that makes people stop eating.',5,7 February 2016,"One of the many memorable lines in this rather odd film is 'If it's not perfect, you throw it away... regardless of time.' Somehow that rather tidily sums up this film. Steven Knight adapted Michael Kalesniko's story in to an overindulgent whine of a movie that despite the presence of some very fine actors, the influence of John Wells' direction (Shameless, ER, etc) shines darkly through.Adam Jones (Bradley Cooper) is a chef who destroyed his career with drugs and diva behavior. He cleans up and returns to London, determined to redeem himself by spearheading a top restaurant that can gain three Michelin stars – a restaurant whose maître'd is Daniel Brühl. Apparently Adam was the former infant terrible of the Paris restaurant scene had earned two Michelin stars and only ever cared about the thrill of creating explosions of taste. To land his own kitchen and that third elusive star though, Jones will need to leave his bad habits behind and get the best of the best on his side, including the beautiful Helene (Sienna Miller). Other cooks fill the endless kitchen screaming tantrums and such fine actors as Alicia Vikander, Emma Thompson, Uma Thurman and Omar Sy try to make it work, but the film just gets tedious – unless you are studying to be a chef. Yawn.Grady Harp, February 16",Burnt
14,deloudelouvain,Boring kitchen movie about a wannabe Nazi chef,2,15 January 2016,"First of all I would like to ask why IMDb puts this movie in the category Comedy? Can anybody enlighten me on this? There is absolutely nothing to laugh in Burnt. It is not a comedy. The first one that tells me it is has to explain me exactly which part he thought was funny. Now back to the actual movie. It's very easy for me to rate this movie because I absolutely hated it. And that's maybe because I hate Gordon Ramsay. Because the whole movie is Bradley Cooper acting like that asshole Gordon Ramsay. If I had to work with a wannabe Nazi like those two they should watch out very carefully because a kitchen has big knives and I might use it to slit their throat. I don't get why people would put up with that kind of behavior? So basically, if you like to watch a chef acting like a petulant child and arguing in the kitchen for almost two hours then you are going to like this movie. If you, like me thinks this is very boring to watch just avoid this movie.",Burnt
15,StevePulaski,A fast food restaurant in five-star clothing,4,2 November 2015,"John Wells' Burnt asks us to suspend our disbelief of characters and their actions as if we're watching one of the multitude of Marvel films that have graced the multiplexes in the last few years. It's a film that gives us a contemptible lead character, who is contemptible without merit. He doesn't have the swagger and intelligence of Jordan Belfort in The Wolf of Wall Street and he doesn't have the charisma or the troubled qualities of your average anti-hero. He's a miserable, nasty human being, who manages to make everyone around him think so irrationally that they serve him despite their ability to find more appealing and admirable work elsewhere. I'm only reminded, yet again, of comedian/political pundit Bill Maher's comments on the new Steve Jobs film, in which he said that film is definitive proof that Americans love movies about a**holes.The character in question is Adam Jones (Bradley Cooper), a chef who strives to make ""orgasmic"" cuisines for his customers and create an experience where they do not come to expect the same kind of meal each time they go out to eat. Unlike most chefs, he fears consistency and rote process, so he meticulously chops, stirs, cooks, and prepares food in different ways in effort to accentuate different flavors. A recovering drug addict, Jones lost the restaurant he once owned and is now looking to rebuild his empire by hiring people like Michel (""The Intouchables""' Omar Sy), somebody he screwed over at his old restaurant, and Helene (Sienna Miller), a renowned chef he implores to quit her job in order to work for him. His ultimate goal is to earn three Michelin stars, which will, in turn, make him one of the most credible and highly rated restaurants in Paris.Jones' relationship with Helene is the first problematic one, simply because Helene is less a character and more an object for Jones to fire insults at like he's Gordon Ramsay and this is a film adaptation of ""Kitchen Nightmares."" To see Jones physically and mentally abuse Helene is bad enough, mainly because it's so caustically handled and unwarranted, but the coffin-sealing nail is that Helene continues to work for him, despite having a better option. The same goes for Michel, who doesn't need to work for the guy who back-stabbed him. Both characters are blindsided by this faux-idea of greatness that Jones apparently exudes with every sentence he says and motion he mistakes. He's an empty vessel that strives to be ""the best"" in his field, and those are less character traits in this film than reasons alone to justify abuse, betrayal, arrogance, and cruel violence throughout the course of the film.It's as if Jones is a God and his actions make all the other characters act irrationally. This also wouldn't be so bad if we were supposed to take characters like Helene seriously. Helene is yet another character so ill-conceived that it shortchanges Sienna Miller's ability to captivate. Much like in American Sniper, where we usually saw her character on the phone with, surprise, Bradley Cooper's, crying and pleading for him to come home, here we see her in tears again being at the mercy of Cooper's own self-absorption.And yet, I could forgive all of this if Jones wasn't such a flat, static character that lacks any kind of dynamic qualities. He's a faceless brute, so cheerless and witless, that I shivered at the thought that I was supposed to watch a one-hundred minute film with him. If he had some insight, some charisma, or even a shred of intelligence, like, once again, Steve Jobs in Danny Boyle's new film, then he'd be at least a fascinating and layered presence. Instead, he's an empty coward that abuses in the name of ""good food"" and that's enough to make you lose your appetite.One of the only merits of the film is the ability to showcase the hustle of a restaurant kitchen that doesn't feel like a reality show or an over-dramatized rendition of Hell's Kitchen. The energy in the kitchen scenes slowly rises like a flame in a pan of vegetables, and the results, especially during the scene when two restaurant critics are presumed to have arrived, work in the film's favor and almost effectively take us out of the emptiness of this entire experience.Wells directed both The Company Men and August: Osage County, two dramas I hold in high regard because of their conflicted, interesting characters and their biting dialog and social commentary. Burnt is the result of what happens when a film is robbed of all three of those features and leaves us with nothing substantial to chew on other than characters that are either miserable and bitter or void of any of characterization.Starring: Bradley Cooper, Sienna Miller, and Omar Sy.

16,Hellmant,"There are a lot of movies with very unlikable heroes, and heroins, this is one of the good ones!",8,11 November 2015,"'BURNT': Four Stars (Out of Five) Another movie about an amazing chef; this one stars Bradley Cooper, as an arrogant has-been, trying to have a comeback in the cooking world. It was directed by John Wells (who also helmed 2013's outstanding 'AUGUST: OSAGE COUNTY' and 2010's 'THE COMPANY MEN') and it was written by Michael Kalesniko and Steven Knight (who also wrote the 2014 chef flick 'THE HUNDRED-FOOT JOURNEY'). The film also stars Sienna Miller (who also costarred with Cooper in last year's 'AMERICAN SNIPER'), Daniel Brühl, Omar Sy, Matthew Rhys, Sam Keeley, Alicia Vikander, Lily James, Uma Thurman and Emma Thompson. The movie is flawed, but very entertaining! Cooper plays Adam Jones, a very successful chef, who lost it all; due to drugs, sex and alcohol (of course). After disappearing for three years, he decides to make a comeback; by opening his own restaurant. He's now sober, from drugs and women, and enlists all of his old friends to help him; including several he betrayed. His dream is to dazzle his customers, with tastes they've never experienced before, and gain his third Michelin star! The cast is amazing, the directing is top-notch and the screenplay is clever and witty! There's not a lot to dislike about this movie, except it's main character; he's just too immoral and unlikable. He does grow, and learn compassion, throughout the film (of course); and Cooper is spectacular in the role. There are a lot of movies with very unlikable heroes, and heroins ('STEVE JOBS' to name one recently), this is one of the good ones; despite what the critics say.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/wb45jfQumZ0",Burnt
17,Lejink,Kitchen nightmare,1,14 February 2016,"With cooking the new rock and roll, I suppose it was almost inevitable that Hollywood would get round to giving us a movie like this, with its main character a burn-out superstar chef, previously the talk of the town in Paris, now down and out in London, looking to get back on top. Enter Bradley Cooper, as the handsome but petulant, talented but temperamental ""name-above-the-title"" chef who is now ready to put his hell-raising past behind him and achieve the elusive third Michelin star to complete his comeback.Quite how the viewer is meant to be on-side with this boorish, washed-up diva is anyone's guess unless it's down to the pardonable excuse of mad genius. So we get to see him beaten up by debt-collecting heavies from his past, insult his boss - patron and get away with it, throw spectacular tantrums in his kitchen, abusing his terrified staff, break about a million plates in the process and worst of all, he won't let the pretty young single mother chef in his kitchen have the day off to be with her daughter on her birthday, the absolute swine!As for characterisation and plot development, the clichés just keep on coming. From his gay employer who has a crush on him, to his deadly head-chef rival across town, his old French chef colleague who clearly hasn't forgotten Paris, believing that revenge is a dish served hot and as for that pretty young single mother, whose bed do you think she ends up in?Of course it all ends up happily for our super-hero man-in-whites but really this ridiculous, empty, patronising movie proved completely indigestible to me and left a sour but thankfully brief after-taste.",Burnt
18,ThomasDrufke,"No, Chef",3,29 October 2015,"After just reading that David Fincher was originally supposed to helm the project with Keanu Reeves attached to star I became instantly more ticked off at this movie. I have no doubt that proposed film would have been a whole lot more interesting than this mess of a film.Burnt's biggest issue is it's poor directing and writing. For the first 20 minutes I had pretty much no clue what was going on. Each scene would last a minute or two and each with an entirely new character meeting Bradley Cooper's character. Everything was rushed into a few scenes and chopped together. The editing, which is probably partially the director's fault as well, is horrendous. Food is something we all want to enjoy for as long as possible, but the editing style is exactly the opposite. Each shot is so quick you would think you were watching a Bourne fight.Perhaps I'm being too harsh on the film. Perhaps I'm in the minority, although Rotten Tomatoes seems to agree with me. It's just that I really didn't find anything to like about this movie. In fact, I was constantly checking my phone through my pocket for the time to see if we were nearing the end. For a film that is merely 100 minutes, that's sad. The reality is that there's a good film in there somewhere. The performances are fine. But considering the entire cast's history, it's surprising that nobody stood out. I never really bought into Cooper and Miller's chemistry or why they would be together. I was constantly thrown off by character's decisions because there was no development whatsoever. I feel like this film went through a ton of rewrites and there's likely a bunch of deleted or extended scenes. Man I really disliked this film.-Choppy editing-No character development-Too many characters with no real purpose-Character decisions didn't make sense3.8/10",Burnt

Adam Jones (Cooper) is one of the best chefs in the world, but has an attitude that gets him fired from one of the most elite restaurants in the world. Now, looking to once again be on top he moves to London, but once again his attitude is the obstacle that stands in his way. For some reason I have always been a fan of watching people cook. I love the food network and its calming for me to just watch food being made. Even though I am a little tired of Bradley Cooper being in every other movie made I was looking forward to watching this. I will admit that I did like this movie and was entertained by it, but Cooper played a version of Gordon Ramsey and was just a little too unlikable to root for. On the other hand, it was a really good character choice. As for the movie itself, it is worth seeing and I enjoyed it enough, but when compared to other movies like Chef it wasn't as good. Overall, good movie and worth seeing but nothing amazing and I though Chef was much better. I give this a B-.",Burnt

They are very different actually. That said ""Burnt"" isn't just about the creating of food, it is a about a very flawed character, who tries to put together his life back on track as well as receiving a 3rd Michelin star - which would make him a ""Yoda"" of chefs as one character puts it.""Burnt"" is very well paced, and although it's editing might distract someone (very quick cuts a la Michael Bay style), it fits very well into showing what is happening in the kitchen while you are waiting for your order. It's very nicely acted, especially by Sienna Miller who is becoming one of hardest to recognize people in movies these days - she is always looks and sounds different - she might pick up Oscar nomination one day (not for this movie though).Overall, ""Burnt"" is very good movie, and it has lots of action... in the kitchen. If you like these kind of movies, you will probably enjoy this picture as well.",Burnt
21,Reno-Rangan,"It is not perfect, but delicious.",7,4 February 2016,"Movies about foods and chefs are quite popular since the beginning of the cinema. Not only among the food lovers, but the movie fans, critics as well common people decides to book a table at a nearby best restaurant after watching a delicious film like this. At least one movie in every year makes us to talk about the foods for that entire week. Like the Jon Favreau's last year's 'Chef', this is 2015's.On this theme, movies are always quite similar, except subplots like family, friends and sometimes foods from the different part of the earth as well. This film was not that brilliant when it comes to innovation in the story. The same old chef who comes back strongly after losing everything to get a another star. So what makes this special is that the actors, everyone was awesome. Even in smaller parts, especially the lead one Bradley Cooper makes all the difference.There was a twist, but it does not make us say wow. Definitely it was a bit fun, filled with some dark humours. The slow, dull storytelling was almost like a soulless product, but anyway, kind of it worked well due to the style of film setting that created to narrate it. Feels like in the many scenes, characters were intensely dragged in like the cameos, otherwise it would have been very plain. Overall, it's not a best food/chef movie I've ever seen, but very much watchable and enjoyable.7/10",Burnt
22,Floated2,Angry Chef film,4,13 November 2017,"Burnt is another film about a top chef, and in many cases the chef is a world class known chef. In Burnt, Bradley Cooper plays an over the top angry chef with several past struggles about drug abuse and such, quite like Gordon Ramsay. The film is labeled a comedy but isn't too much of one, more so a struggling drama as it takes itself a little too serious. There are some decent scenes showing the foods they make but overall, Burnt is quite predictable, as we know in the end everything will work out, and his character will become more likable and nicer once becoming more comfortable in his surroundings. Sienna Miller is there to play the love interest which was very clear it was going to happen but somewhat feels forced. The language could have been toned down a little and done without as many F- bombs, which is the reason for the R rating.Perhaps had they reduced the film to PG-13 it would have been more of a success. In comparison to the John Favreau film ""Chef"", that feels more authentic and much more enjoyable, fun and doesn't take itself as serious.",Burnt
23,eddie_baggins,Avoid like an uncooked Mexican street burrito,2,2 March 2016,"There wasn't a singular moment throughout Burnt, a film seemingly designed exclusively to jump on the back of the food craze that for some reason inhabits the world with shows such as Masterchef and My Kitchen Rules, where I couldn't help but think, who cares? Such is the lack of likability in John Wells' film and the characters that are a part of it, that Burnt becomes an arduous excursion through the heat of Bradley Cooper's Adam Jones' kitchen where you'll find it mightily hard to care about whether or not Sienna Miller's sauces are up to scratch, whether or not Daniel Bruhl's waitresses wait tables correctly or whether or not Cooper's hugely annoying seeking redemption celebrity chef Jones will get his long desired 3 Michelin star.There was clearly desires for Burnt to be a feel good hit and thankfully something that never eventuated, awards player but Well's, screenwriter Steven Knight and their talented cast were never going to be able to turn this dreary material into an engaging prospect and its quite evident in the way the films shoddily put together and actors misused (seriously how could recent Academy Award winner Alicia Vikander be so underused?) in roles that neither suite them or feel naturally progressive.Cooper in particular, who's recently become one of those easy to like presences struggles most with his role as Jones who has to be one of the most uninviting character creations in some time and as added punishment gets laboured with what just could be the most unintentionally hilarious suicide attempt ever captured in the history of cinema involving a sheet of Glad Wrap. Never once do we feel like his quest for success it anything more but an arrogance fuelled dream and it's likely that Jones was based around producer Gordon Ramsay's real life persona which didn't exactly help the films causes. Cooper also shares uneasy chemistry with co-stars Miller, Bruhl and Omar Sy and the film gives off a sense that no one was particularly enjoying their time spent in the kitchen.Neither funny, lacking in heart and generally just unoriginal barring its kitchen setting, Burnt is a film that could be summed up in many a harsh food related analogy and if you could pardon the bun, Burnt is akin to one of your grandmas unappetising stews that seems as though it threw in a lot of left over ingredients to create something that is neither tasty, appealing or hearty. Avoid like an uncooked Mexican street burrito.1 Burger King lunch out of 5",Burnt
24,leonblackwood,Great performance from Bradley Cooper! 6/10,6,6 March 2016,"Review: I quite enjoyed this movie, mainly because of Bradley Coopers performance and the original concept but I would have liked to have seen more depth to the various characters, who constantly get shouted at in the kitchen. Its not a big shock that Gordon Ramsay produced this movie, because of the way that the head chef, Adam Jones (Bradley Cooper) belittles the cooks and strives for perfection and the director cleverly added other elements, like the love story between Adam and Helene (Sienna Miller) and the debt collectors who are hunting down Adam for there money. I also liked Tony (Daniel Bruhl) character, who secretly loved Adam but knew that there relationship would never turn out to be more than friendship. The director could have given Michel (Omar Sy) a bit more depth and it did seem like Adam was going a bit overboard to get the extra Michelin star but I don't know anything about that world so I can't comment on how real the competition is between the head chefs. I find it hard to imagine why someone would want to get into a profession were you get treated like a lab rat and have to work your fingers to the bone, without much appreciation but once you become the head chef, it must be a nice feeling to have full control of bringing beautiful and tasteful food to the masses. Personally, I'm not one to pay loads of money for a lettuce leaf on a plate, with little swirls around the edges but thats just me. Anyway, from an entertainment point of view, this movie is quite good and straight to the point and the mixture of drama and wit really worked in an environment which is so tense and full of pressure. Enjoyable! Round-Up: With all of the hype that surrounded this movie on its release, I really thought that it made more money at the box office. Bradley Cooper, 41, who first came to light in the Wedding Crashers in 2005, can't seem to do anything wrong lately, and with 4 movies in pipeline along with Aloha and Joy due to be released, he has a lot to be thankful for. This movie was directed by John Wells, 59, who also brought you the Company of Men and August: Osage County. He hasn't got much experience behind the camera, but he done a great job with this movie, mainly because it delves into a world which is unknown to many people. The person who really made this project a success, has to be Bradley Cooper, who showed realism and emotion throughout the movie and each character played a part in making this an enjoyable watch.Budget: $20million Worldwide Gross: $35.6millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their comedy/dramas starring Bradley Cooper, Sienna Miller, Omar Sy, Daniel Bruhl, Emma Thompson, Uma Thurman, Lily James and Riccardo Scamarcio. 6/10",Burnt
25,TheMovieDiorama,Burnt cooks its finely produced ingredients in an unsanitary frying pan.,5,19 March 2020,"Buttered halibut fillets drizzled in white wine, served with finely chopped parsley accompanied by an aromatic cream sauce. Soft four-tiered celebration cakes baked to perfection, enveloped in decorative fondant icing. Chorizos oozing paprika-hot orange oil over deliciously sweet, white scallops. To become a Michelin starred chef, takes sacrifice. Devoting precious time and substantial amounts of elbow grease to culinary cuisine. Achieving perfection no matter the cost. For Adam, an ambitious American trained by a high-class Parisian chef, one Michelin Star was not enough. Neither was two. He yearned for that elusive third star, notifying the world that he is the best of the best. Producing ""orgasmic"" food, not to satisfy hunger, but to create new experiences. Journeys into new unknown flavours.Wells' dramatic cookery insight into the pressures of producing perfection, is a meticulously cold feature that singes its potential. The underlying theme is ambition. The strive to become a better person. Adam, epitomising ambition with the exaggerated Gordon Ramsay persona, blurs the line between aspiration and arrogance. Humiliating his staff members, notably forcing single-mother Helene to openly apologise to a piece of turbot, and regularly shouting at his employees that their standards do not match his own. Any cook will tell you that the heat of the kitchen provides a ferocious environment, where pressured remarks should not be taken personally. Unfortunately though, Adam fortifies his arrogant attitude when out of the kitchen, forcing a protagonist to lack humility and humanity.Knight's screenplay is undoubtedly the overdone crucial meat ingredient in this feast. Sprinkles of captivating culinary conversations cannot forgive a poorly handled main character whom nobody can relate to. Adam, for all intent and purposes, was an ex-addict whom nearly destroyed his career. Knight attempts to embed a layer of sympathy, persuading us to empathise with Adam whom has progressed optimistically since his downfall. Problem is, the overwrought clichés that infest this succulent dish prevent viewers from wanting to become emotionally invested in his story. The inevitable romance with Helene which destroys her strong-willed character, the underdeveloped bond with Tony (waste of LGBT potential), a second opportunity arising and predictably Adam changing his attitude in a sudden fashion. They diminish a potential savoury character study by succumbing to overdone plot points. Much like a fine-dining kitchen, it's an incredibly frustrating experience.Cooper plays the role of arrogance perfectly, and the several moments of anger held much command from his side. Miller, when not falling in love, seamlessly portrayed a strong female cook that could rival Cooper's vexations. Thompson, Vikander and Thurman offering memorable cameos that added additional delight to the frying pan. Goldman's cinematography, especially when displaying the scrumptious food items, exerted a clinical yet clean shine. And of course, whilst not impacting the film, Marcus Wareing training Cooper and Miller was the additional red wine sauce to this beef fillet.Burnt is a competent drama. It has intent. Offering a central ferocious performance amidst its hyperbolic culinary warfare for perfection. Yet, Burnt remains exasperating. The unsavoury nature of the main chef, embodying a personality deemed impossible to relate to, and the eye-rolling clichés of Knight's script added ""enough garlic to kill every vampire in Europe"". Sorry, had to get a Ramsay quote in there somehow...",Burnt
26,lisafordeay,Criminally underrated starring Bradley Cooper as a Gordon Ramsey wannabe,7,27 November 2018,"I stumbled on this by accident as I wanted to watch something that I never seen before and saw this on Netflix.
The story is about a struggling chef named Adam (played by Bradley Cooper)who's life inspires around Drugs and Alcohol as he owns money to some drug dealers. But when he opens up his own restaurant with the help of a divorced mother (played by Sienna Miller) will he become sober and be the best chef there is.With a strong supporting cast including Emma Thompson as Adam's nurse,Lily James (in a 5 minute cameo in the beginning of the film as Adam's friends girlfriend), Uma Thurman as a food tester(also a cameo) and Alicia Valderker as Adam's ex girlfriend the movie was actually fairly good. Bradley Cooper was brilliant as always as a Gordon Ramsey wannabe chef who drops ALOT of F bombs and throwing tantrums like a schoolboy. Himself and Sienna Miller had good chemistry.

27,subxerogravity,Bradley Cooper's cooking film is slightly under cooked.,6,1 November 2015,"Lying somewhere in-between the style and elegance of The Hundred- Foot Journey, starring Helen Mirren and the heart an personality of Chef with Jon Favreau, is Burnt, which in ranking is not as high as those two movies.True to the title, Cooper plays a burnt out chef trying to get it together so he can get back in the game and get the third star all chiefs push themselves to achieve, and pressure is not good for a recovering addict.It's an OK movie. It's one of those movies that has really good moments that touch you with humor drama and raw emotion, but for the most part the movie is all fluff and no substance. If this was a meal prepared in the kitchen of Cooper's character, Adam Jones he would toss it up ageist the wall for not being prepared right. It's too bad, the relationship Cooper develops with the other actors in the film like Sienna Miller Daniel Brühl and Omar Sy are prepared to perfection and displayed on the table nicely.

28,iquine,"Solid Ingredients, Flawed Preparation",4,1 November 2017,"(Flash Review)It appears the director aimed to portray Gordon Ramsey and what life may be like if you interact with him, only leave out Gordon's unique and arguable charm. The story arc was rather vanilla about a phenomenal chef who ruined his own early success for a decade and now is revitalized and wants to make another go at it in hopes of achieving the rare three Michelin stars. Yet he is still rude and harshly passionate while in the kitchen and in life. There were too many cliché moments and the romance angle was not believable. The plot focused more around the protagonist, his emotions and problems with the food as an afterthought. That's OK but they had a slew of elegant food shots but the editing was so frantic during those scenes that you couldn't even see what the food was or the beauty of the plating. At least give us that much in a high end food movie. The positives were the production and the acting as Bradley Cooper was great and Sienna Miller was invisible as her character. The Hundred-Foot Journey was a better food/chef movie and that was just a step above average.",Burnt

31,peterp-450-298716,Warning : Eat before watching this highly entertaining but unfortunately very predictable movie.,7,9 January 2016,"""To get even one Michelin star, you have to be like Luke Skywalker. To get two, you have to be... whoever Alec Guinness was. But if you manage to get three... You're Yoda. Well, what if he's Darth Vader?""Adam Jones (Bradley ""American Sniper"" Cooper) once burned his fingers by living a fairly dissolute life, filled with alcohol, women and drugs. As a top chef his primary concern is to create a perfectly cooked and not burnt exquisite dish. And once more he has that burning desire to get a third Michelin star with his new restaurant in London. Three propositions that perfectly fit with the movie title.Perhaps you start to sigh in a frustrated way after reading the synopsis. At least I did after I found out it was again about a renowned chef. But then I was thinking about the movie ""Chef"". It wasn't so bad. So I gave ""Burnt"" the benefit of the doubt. My opinion about cooking programs generally hasn't changed a bit. As I already explained in my review of ""Chef"" : ""I'm sick and tired of hearing the terminology like baking, flaming, roasting, steaming, filleting, Bain-Marie, stewing, poaching, ragout, caramelize and the hype-word in recent years ""cuisson"". I'm not sick of seeing those plates with tasty food, but the oversupply of television programs with people cooking enthusiastically"". Just explore your television channels on an average night and before you know it some would-be Jamie Oliver pops up while waving dangerously with a spoon.Cooking has become an art and world-renowned master chefs are being adored in a similar way as famous rock stars. They are showered with praises, have tons of salivating fans who marvel at the delicacies created by their idol and became mega-rich with their published cookbooks and television programs. And of course a breakthrough with movies was inevitable. So now it's just waiting for the first dance hit sung by such an important ""cuisinier"" while shaking his cholesterol-rich body on the dance-floor. As in ""Chef"" we are treated with delicious dishes that look like real works of art. The occasions that wonderful dinners are prepped, we see all kind of colorful dishes as a set of photos. One looking tastier than the other. And this at a pace that can compete with the pace of some dialogs. At those times, I thought this film was very amusing and interesting to follow. The witty and sometimes pretty funny dialogs, interspersed with magnificent dishes. But honestly I must admit (the accusation ""cultural barbarian"" will be used against me) that my taste buds were very enthusiastic at the sight of that juicy hamburger at a fast food restaurant.For the female viewers, there's also the advantage in the form of Bradley Cooper, who looks as appetizing as his own dishes. I'm 100% straight (believe me), but I can understand that women (even lesbian) could succumb to his charms. His lovely smile, those bright deep blue eyes and his uninhibited behavior. A smooth talker with a tough look. And he's also great in the kitchen. It's obvious that many women would like to offer themselves as dessert. And preferably with a bit of whipped cream. Fair is fair, Cooper played a decent role. As calm and laid-back as he was in ""American Sniper"", so hot-tempered and arrogant he's in ""Burnt"". Sienna Miller wasn't overwhelmed and managed to keep herself standing next to Cooper. But especially Daniel Brühl was brilliant as Adam's old friend. There was also a tiny part played by Emma Thompson and Uma Thurman.A dazzling film filled with talented actors and actresses. That sounds promising and guarantees an energetic film. Only this film can't escape the phenomenon of superficiality. It's all a bit too predictable and clichéd. You automatically feel which direction it will go. As intense as it was in to the kitchen early in the film, so cozy and homey it ends. They could have ended this film with a large campfire while they were singing ""With a little help from my friends"" and meanwhile embracing each other amicably. And what did happen in Paris? You can only guess because they stay rather vague about that. I feel it went from a high culinary, inventive dish to a dull, everyday dish. And yet I found it a brilliant film in an inexplicable way. But still a caution: make sure you have eaten before you watch this film, because otherwise you are plundering your fridge after wards.More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT",Burnt

Having learn the trade in Paris and on the field, he's now in London trying to rebuild his reputation by gaining the third Michelin star for the restaurant where he's currently employed.Adam works for Tony, who used to be in love with him, but reconsidered and he's also trying to fight his demons attending regular sessions with a shrink.Life inside the kitchen of a Michelin-starred restaurant is pretty much as one would expect, with Adam constantly edgy and shouting orders to a team of sous-chefs who admire and fear him.Helene is one of them and the obvious love interest. She's dedicated to cooking just as Adam and also highly strung.Despite good interpretations by the leads, who learned to move like professional cooks (as it can be seen in many cooking programs) it's difficult to sympathise with Adam's plight.

34,Seraphion,Incomplete and too quick for a story,5,15 November 2015,"The movie's story looks promising to be developed into a full feature movie. Bradley Cooper as a chef is also somewhat interesting to see. But the movie went over its own abilities and ended up messing things up. The movie goes very much too quickly. It goes too fast that it seems like every new scene, especially on the beginning parts, has its own new character being introduced. The thing is that this movie didn't really care about any of its supporting character; it just laid them around after it introduced them. Except for Tony and the female chef, the other characters didn't get any development at all. This makes all the time introducing them goes to waste. Also the movie ended kind of abruptly and without a sure decision. The acting overall seems decent enough. Bradley Cooper's arrogant chef portrayal seems legit enough. Sienna Miller's aspiring female chef also hit its mark. It gets easier after their chemistry in last year's American Sniper. One thing I find annoying is that All the chef in this movie didn't really cook completely, as to what we see in Jon Favreau's Chef. Furthermore, the food of Adam Jones depicted here looks like children's artsy school work, so it takes quite a bunch of the mouth watering displays one expects from seeing a culinary movie.",Burnt
35,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Burnt,8,31 October 2015,"Burnt (my latest review) is well done. There I said it. Let's get all the puns out of the way shall we. With fast cutting that will make your head spin, close-ups of food that will cause your mouth to water (even though I noshed right before a viewing, I still had a hearty appetite), and a showcase for what I believe to be the best performance of Bradley Cooper's career, this 2015 release is only the third foodie flick I've seen. No Reservations and Chef are the other two and they're mere child's play in comparison.At times overdramatic as well as borderline predictable, Burnt is nevertheless, highly effectual. This is due to the speedy direction of John Wells and an enormous attention to detail. You wanna see the distance measured between forks on a table setting? Oh you'll get that. You want to witness cooks being unsanitary by putting their hands in people's food for taste testings? You'll get that too. You wanna see a culinary staff clean the bejesus out of a kitchen (by scrubbing tables till their hands fall off)? You'll get that as well. Finally, do you have a taste for noticing lead Bradley Cooper making an employee apologize to a piece of fish (for not cooking it well enough)? That happens about a half hour in. Ultimately, Burnt is the be-all, end-all of restaurateur pics. Along with its eccentricities baited towards a dinner service, the eateries featured here are so sterile and white walled, it's as if Chili's, T.G.I. Fridays, and Ruth's Chris Steak House never even existed.Shot at a whirlwind running time of just over 100 minutes, Burnt registers former drug addict/cooking aficionado, Adam Jones (Cooper). He lost a restaurant years ago due to some messed up behavior (he also planted rats in another chef's sit down spot while calling the health inspector at the same time). After punishing himself by shucking oysters back in the states (1,000,000 to be exact), Jones then ventures to Europe once again, this time sober and clean. He needs to get a crew together for a comeback tour. He enlists his former head waiter (Daniel Bruhl as Tony), an up-and-coming female cook (Sienna Miller as Helene), a distant rival cook (French actor Omar Sy as Michel), and a paroled criminal (Riccardo Scamarcio as Max) to open up a London hotbed with his name on the title. Bradley Cooper who's in pretty much everything these days, is all will as Jones. With a cocksure way about him, various enemies, and very little in pocket change, his Adam is still able to get the whole world on his side. Jones doesn't like people, he doesn't normally count on them, and he's kind of an a-hole. His heightened intelligence about food though turns the beat around (this includes his acquaintances who despise him). The first hour of the film displays this notion and it's the strongest section. Burnt unfortunately starts to bog down towards the end but everything that happened past tense, washes away the shortcomings.All in all, the look of this vehicle is slick and unblemished. The screenplay by Steven Knight (he wrote and directed 2013's Locke) is juicy in that it deals with themes of anger, absolution, irony, and alienation. In terms of casting, Bradley Cooper really brings to life the persona of an unsound, head chef (this is based on all the Food Network shows I tend to watch). The role of Adam Jones really caters to his fast-talking, manneristic style of delivering lines. About a quarter of the way in, this messy character study acknowledges that Jones is striving to get his third Michelin Star (the mark of excellence given to only a few European eating establishments). Heck, I'll just bite and give Burnt about three and a half of them. Bon appetit!",Burnt

Only the story is muddled and poor with the filmmakers trying to sell us why we should care on Michelin ratings or hip expensive food places along with the screaming a-hole character and awfully directed Cooper. As if we can't figure out the character has problems, its paraded around and blasted. In short, it doesn't work and the movie is a failure - there's no subtlety, only burnt melodrama.

The film had a couple of questionable changes of focus (Omar Sy's character disappears for too long, and Sierra Miller does a bit too) and Cooper's character eventually begins questioning what he is doing; is he doing it just to get some sort of recognition and three stars in Michelin guide book, or is he doing it because it's what he loves and wants to do?

38,tomsview,Rock star chef,7,3 April 2016,"One of the things that really pleased me about watching this movie about top chefs in the rarefied atmosphere of high-end dining is that I knew what they were talking about.Not because I have dined at top restaurants in London or Paris at £300 a cover, but because I'm an avid viewer of the ""Lifestyle Food"" channel i.e. ""MasterChef"", ""Great British Menu"" and ""World's Best Restaurants"", featuring chefs like Michel Roux Jr., Marco Pierre White, Monica Galetti and Marcus Wareing. In fact Marcus Wareing was one of the consultants on the movie.Bradley Cooper plays chef Adam Jones almost like a hit-man on the road to redemption. He is a chef with baggage from burning out in Paris. Years later, he comes to London to build a failing restaurant into a top dining spot, and earn himself an elusive third Michelin star. He pulls together an elite band of chefs including Helene (Sienna Miller), a clever, level-headed and hardworking single mother.Adam's head chef style makes Gordon Ramsey seem like a man racked with self-doubt. He is full on and in everyone's face. However after watching numerous episodes of ""MasterChef: The Professionals"", the dictatorial approach of Adam isn't really all that far-fetched – he just smashes a lot more crockery.Adam is more than driven, but his passion and single-minded commitment counteracts the ego-tripping and self-absorption that could have made him totally repellent.Mind you, I was a little surprised that Bradley's character was considered a little old fashioned by Helene as he championed his flambés and butter sauces, especially when he didn't seem to be overly familiar with the sous vide method. Of course, every second contestant on ""Great British Menu"" or ""Top Chef"" has been shrink-wrapping turbot fillets and asparagus spears for years – I almost found myself shouting at Bradley to get out of my kitchen.Fine food apart, Adam's past also catches up with him when heavies arrive looking to collect drug money he owes them – he's clean now, but he still owes. Things look likely to boil over when Anne Marie (Alicia Vikander), his hot ex-girlfriend and daughter of his late mentor, turns up just as he and Helene seem set to dress the plates together.By the end, I was wondering how they were going to get this soufflé out of the oven, but it rises beautifully, and the whole thing ends with a lightness of touch that makes the wait worthwhile.We've had a few movies that feature love of food and fine dining: ""Chef"" and ""The Hundred-Foot Journey"" for starters, but this one is the main course; it takes us over the pass and into the heart of the kitchen – after a while, I think I wouldn't mind a second helping.",Burnt

His destruction in Paris would've added thickness to the stereotype of every hot-tempered chef we've ever seen, and yet this backstory is alluded to, but not included. Without the meaty conflict provided by losing everything, his tale of redemption tastes pretty bland.Not to mention that the details the story DOES turn on are a little unconvincing... The entire minutiae of the quest to acquire a third Michelin star was ridiculous. The whole point is for the assessors to be undercover so they can observe usual practice... so the idea that they have a set routine that the chefs can easily spot would be counterproductive...However, even if they DID and DO have such a routine, the notion that some random software salesmen from another part of the country would unwittingly duplicate it EXACTLY, just so the movie can create a false crisis, is ridiculously unbelievable!

Chef, Cook, Dishwasher, Busboy, Hostess, or any other title isn't going to improve the story. If they had spent a fraction of the money their lawyers probably gouged from them on a better script this could have raised itself up a few stars.Enter tortured artist with a tortured history. He returns to claim his throne. Chef meets woman who doesn't like him but you just know that will changeand more paint-by-numbers set pieces taken from the Microsoft boilerplate screenplay program. What saves this project from utter forgetfulness is the cast and by cast I mean Bradley Cooper, Daniel Brühl, and Matthew Rhys. The lavish production doesn't hurt either and this script needed all the help it could get.It's almost humorous how us normal slobs can be made to care about a type of restaurant we would be lucky to work at let alone sit down and have a meal in where the check amounts to a month salary at minimum wage before wine. That's probably a good thing because if you actually have to work for a living the half-a-mouthful size entrées wouldn't supply the sustenance necessary to make it through the day for a school teacher. I have a similar attitude about paintings which are simply decorations for the homes of the elite so why should I give a crap? Mostly I don't and I mostly don't care about ultra-high cuisine but I'm a pretty good home cook so I played along. It's curious that I didn't learn a single thing about cooking from this 1h 41min film.The product placement of a bad fast food franchise (is that being redundant) was a brilliantly ironic move in a film about food only the CEOs of these places can afford. I watched it without leaving yet I can't remember anything that I liked about the movie except the likability of the aforementioned actors. This could have made a great TV series with more time to develop more than two dimensional characters, especially the love interest.

41,RforFilm,"Burnt is a by-the-books, boring frozen TV dinner of a cooking story",4,3 November 2015,"As soon as I saw the first preview for the new cooking drama Burnt, the first thing I thought of was the famous chef Gordon Ramsey. The trailer showed Bradley Cooper as an arrogant but talented chef who was victim to his mood swings and lack of patience; all the traits that exist within chef Ramsey. Ramsey has made himself a big celebrity partly through his world-renowned restaurants, though mostly through his reality shows like Hell's Kitchen and Kitchen Nightmares. This was a guy who was not afraid to speak of his mind, but still had enough good judgment for when it was necessary to make or break an aspiring cook.The image I had developed for Burnt was that it was going to give us the kind of cooking drama that Gordon Ramsey would have written and directed. There is potential for taping into the world of fine dining for a cinematic story. Chef was a fun look at a regular chef's fall from grace and return, and Ratatouille (a Pixar favorite of mine) looked at cooking and how talent can come from the most unexpected placed. So I was intrigued at what Burnt could bring.American chef Adam Jones (played by Bradley Cooper) has completed his own punishment for falling under the influence to drugs and alcohol while trying to run a high class restaurant in Paris, France. He flies out to London where he finds two old friends of his, Michel (played by Omar Sy), his former sous chef in France, and Tony (played by Daniel Brühl), a wealthy son of a hotel owner who is also a professional maître d'. These people all know that Adam has the potential to be the best, but also know that he has erratic mood swings and a stubborn ego.Adam is able to convince Tony to fund his new restaurant in order to try and acquire the legendary three Michelin star rating. He also gets Michel to come on board along with young Anne Marie (played by Alicia Vikandor) who also shows talent, but may not be able to handle the heat that is brought both by the kitchen and Adam's anger. Along with creating the perfect dishes, Adam also has to see Dr. Rosshile (played by Emma Thompson) to regularly test his sobriety and learn about how the show isn't always about him, but rather the team he works for. Ironically for a movie like Burnt that seems to promote high class dining, it comes off as mass-produced like a frozen TV dinner. A lot of it has to do with the general plot, which is simply about getting the Michelin stars. While it's a situation for the restaurant, I don't see how this would allow growth for Adam. Regardless if he got the stars or not, he would stay the arrogant prick he is. Speaking of which, Adam is too much of a negative character to support, as he lacks the charm to make him likable. I like characters that are full of themselves, but they need something that redeems themselves or are at least trying to do better. That's not to say he doesn't try to do better, but when the final result is in, it doesn't feel earned. Apart from the by-the-books story and boring plot, it's clear that the actors are trying to make this work. They all seem well casted and even have something of developed personalities that should help the plot get going, but the heat of cooking a good story seems too much for these amateursI'll give this four frozen TV dinners out of ten. Burnt is just a boring cooking movie. While not as egocentric as a lot of the reality cooking shows on television, it's too pampered in it's own right to see how plain their flavor really is.",Burnt
42,Anurag-Shetty,"Well done, even though the title of the film suggests otherwise.",9,2 November 2015,"Burnt tells the story of a chef named, Adam Jones(Bradley Cooper). During his youth, Adam Jones reached the pinnacle of his cooking career. However, he ruins his career, due to his arrogant behavior & addiction to alcohol & drugs. Adam Jones gets his act together & returns to London. Here, he is determined to redeem himself by taking over a top restaurant & earning three Michelin stars. Burnt is a great film. The professional kitchen environment has been depicted accurately. All the food in the movie looks delicious. The meticulous preparation & presentation of all the dishes make them look mouth watering. After watching this film, you will feel like eating at a fine dining restaurant. This film is very similar to Chef(2014) but, I like Burnt better. There are a few elements of comedy in the movie but, it is primarily a drama. Bradley Cooper is outstanding as Adam Jones. Cooper portrays the chef's vulnerability, aggression & attention to detail, flawlessly. Sienna Miller is brilliant as Helene. Daniel Bruhl is superb as Tony. Riccardo Scamarcio is effective as Max. Omar Sy is great as Michel. Sam Keeley is good as David. Matthew Rhys is awesome as Reece. Emma Thompson is spectacular as Dr. Rosshilde. Alicia Vikander is impressive as Anne Marie.

43,Ruskington,Cooper's Kitchen Nightmares,5,26 September 2020,"I generally like Bradley Cooper's intense style but this movie felt like overkill. While it may be a perfectly entertaining fast-paced ride, Burnt is let down by substandard writing, plot errors and tacky dialogue. Cooper's character is far too much of a stereotype flawed genius to be taken seriously and the corny bad guys and predictable romance just cheapen proceedings even further. Ultimately, the whole film feels like a feature-length episode of a Gordon Ramsey show.",Burnt
44,dave-mcclain,"In ""Burnt"", chef Adam Jones wants 3 stars from a restaurant rating. I'll give the film 3 stars, but out of 10, not 3.",3,31 October 2015,"Perfection is unattainable. As long as human nature and the human body are imperfect and the world insists on throwing us curve balls at random moments, perfection will remain a myth. Tell that to Adam Jones, the central character in the comedy-drama ""Burnt"" (R, 1:41). Jones is a world-class chef who relentlessly pursues perfection in his food, if not in his personal life, and demands it from others as well. What Jones never seems to realize is, besides the concept of perfection being a fantasy, it's subjectively judged. Jones is arrogant enough to think that he knows what perfection is and that he can get there. That also makes him a narcissist. In addition, he fails to apply his ideal of perfection to his personal life, even while he holds others to a higher standard than he holds himself. That also makes him a hypocrite. If, at this point, you think you'd enjoy watching such a character dominate a feature film, then read on.At the beginning of this story, American-born chef Adam Jones (Bradley Cooper) is a fallen idol. He tells us through an opening narration that his bad habits with drugs, alcohol and women cost him his Paris restaurant. He also callously damaged the careers and reputations of others in the process. All this led to him having to leave Europe entirely. He works in New Orleans shucking oysters until he feels that he has completed his ""penance"" and is ready to go back across the pond. Apparently believing that there are no restaurants here in the colonies worthy of his talents, he goes to London with the intent of getting another restaurant for himself and achieving his ultimate goal of earning 3 out of 3 stars from Europe's ""Michelin Red Guide"". Jones has laid the groundwork for his comeback by going two years without the vices that nearly ruined his life, but his talents – and his arrogance – are still very much intact.In London, Jones gets reacquainted with former colleagues (who apparently all had to leave Paris after he did and all settled in London for some reason) and then he sets his plan into motion. He uses a combination of dirty tricks and persuasion to gain control of a restaurant now owned by his restaurant's old maître d' (Daniel Brühl), hire previous colleagues Michel and Max (Omar Sy and Riccardo Scamarcio), and add a young talent (Sam Keeley) and the beautiful and talented Helene (Sienna Miller, who played the wife of Cooper's character in 2014's ""American Sniper""). Jones' remodeled restaurant opens, but he feels the evening wasn't perfect so he throws plates, then yells at, insults and even lays his hands on cooks who work for him. As he goes about the business of RE-launching the restaurant, he must learn to update his techniques a bit and depend more on his team. In his personal life, he must face the young woman (Alicia Vikander) whose heart he broke in Paris, another former co-worker (Matthew Rhys) who is still angry at Jones for his Paris behavior and who now runs a rival restaurant, a therapist (Emma Thompson) whom his financiers require that he meet with regularly and, last but certainly not least, drug dealers from Paris to whom he still owes a large sum of money for the poor choices of his past. All things considered, Jones has a lot to overcome if his restaurant is to earn that third Michelin star.This movie is one Bradley Cooper beyond an ""art house"" film. Not to disrespect art house films. Some of the best theatrical surprises go relatively unseen in those venues. And that fate would have likely befallen this movie, were it not for Bradley Cooper's star power, but that's not enough of a reason to see the film. As great as Cooper is and as solid as the rest of the performances are, in the end, ""Burnt"" is merely a foodie's fantasy populated by mostly unlikeable characters learning valid, but obvious life lessons. (Drugs and alcohol can ruin your life. Got it. Owing a lot of money to bad people is a bad idea. Roger. Teamwork is important. No argument here. Everyone deserves a second chance. Absolutely.) The problem with this movie is the filmmakers seem to think that Movie Fans need 101 minutes to get these points – and we won't mind sitting through a niche movie with mean, selfish and arrogant characters willing to make themselves and each other miserable while pursuing the fantasy of perfection.If I want to be around someone who will settle for nothing less than perfection, I'll get back together with my previous spouse. If I want to experience people yelling at each other, I'll sit back and remember my next door neighbors from my childhood, or the couple who lived on the other side of the wall when I was in one of my first apartments. If I want to watch arrogant perfectionism for almost two hours, I'll research or write one of my movie reviews in front of a mirror. None of those things would cost me any money, or any more time than I chose to spend in such unpleasant situations. I did, however, choose to spend my time and money at a theater showing this movie. It looks like I was the one who was burnt. Jones scolds his cooks by saying ""if it's not perfect, we throw it out."" Well, this movie is far from perfect, but I have more respect for the best efforts of others than Jones does. I can't give this drama set in a restaurant kitchen the recommendation it desires, but that doesn't mean I have to trash it either. ""C""",Burnt
45,witster18,"I don't get the ""it's not funny"" criticism!?! Under-rated film.",7,26 January 2016,"It's hard not to compare this with ""Chef"" - so let's get it out of the way shall we. ""Chef"" is a 9/10 for me and just a delightful film with dashes of humor and a lot of heart. ""Burnt"" is a far more realistic look at the pressure cooker of being at the pinnacle of the craft. Now, obviously you see I gave this film a 7/10, but let's take these ridiculously low scores and terrible reviews and strike them mostly up to some hoping that Cooper would reprise his role from the first two ""Hangover"" movies. The thing is - this movie was never marketed as a comedy. Just the name implies something more serious. So look down at the reviews and you'll see 90% of those 1-2 star reviews talk about the film being unfunny. Ignore them. Burnt is a dramatic, stylish, and deadly serious film about what it takes to get and stay at the top. There's a really nice under-lying theme about relying on others, and putting the past behind you. The kitchen scenes are truly fantastic, and Cooper is a juggernaut of an actor. Nice to see him taking roles like this.That said. The writing is less than perfect. The back-stories a bit vague, and the ending a bit bland. It's more of a slice of someones life rather than a full course, but that aspect isn't all bad actually. I've also read some reviews about Sienna Miller not being a good actress, but to that I ask ""what film did you watch?"". I thought she was pretty good, as was Emma Thompson and the under-rated Daniel Bruhl. Overall, I thought it was good. Certainly better than a 1 or 2 out of 10. I need to watch all the ""Great"" films that those people are watching. Better than the 6.6 rating here. It's the 62nd film I've seen from 2015, and it will be edging its way(albeit temporarily) on my 2015 top 25 list.. somewhere between #21 It Follows and #24 Chappie.71/100 It isn't funny! Now go enjoy it for what it is. You might like this if you liked:Rush('13/about even or slightly better...nah even), ROgue Trader(not as good), Spanglish(about even), or Inside Llewyn Davis(better).Go rent it!

46,RResende,hell,1,13 September 2016,"Food and Film can be a powerful mixture. But when you have people like Ramsay involved, inevitably there is a third F word which will be more important the other 2 F words. This is what we get here: a film that panders to the lowest denominator of any cultural expression: competition in the basic sense of ""finishing first"", ""being the best"". That kind of football mentality that TV food shows have been feeding the public with for the last decade, at least.This film came out at around the same time as another film about cooking, by Favreau. That was the complete opposite of this. That one was (at least superficially) about not caring for the critics, even running away from them. This one is abound pandering to the them, cooking (and in fact everything in life) as some sort of a run, as some sort of coming first to the end. That's the Anglo-Saxon way of doing it, which the British and the Americans (but not the Australians!) have been imposing upon us. So our broken Cook gets his second chance by convincing a critic to convince the owner of a restaurant (who incidentally is in love with the cook) to give him the kitchen. And the purpose would be to receive a third Michelin star.Couple that with a series of relatively common prejudiced clichés: the main character is an American Chef who goes to Paris and out- Frenches the French in their own game. Like when Jamie Oliver goes to Italy to teach the Italians how to cook Italian food, or Ramsay to Thailand to validate Thai food. After Paris he goes to London and his style is deemed old-fashioned and so his female kitchen (and sentimental) partner brings a couple of plastic bags and gadgets and suddenly he is back on top of the game. Because of course, if you get a couple of new gadgets, your cooking will be suddenly renewed.Kar-Wai tried an association between food and memory in his ""in the mood for love"". Itami tried food and sensuality. Favreau tried Food and passion (fullfillement). These guys instead link food to the lowest form of competition, the one that replaces passion with the need to be recognized, the need to succeed, the one that it's all about getting there first, out-running the guy next to you. The one that makes an idiot almost jump out of a bridge because he will probably get a bad review the next day. Well, we should thank Ramsay and his other buddies for this attitude.",Burnt

You care about the characters, even Cooper's insufferable protagonist. You cannot help but get sucked into the food preparation and quieter moments. But the screenplay just left a lot to be desired. This is not what opening a restaurant looks like, and this is not how people talk with each other in real life. If you want a chef rehabilitation story, go watch ""Chef"" with Jon Favreau. The fact that this story is still moderately enjoyable is a testament to Cooper, the cast, and the way they gradually/silently became a team over a couple hours. Still, there were some pretty big flaws here.

Daniel Bruhl was also as great as usual, and was totally convincing in his role, as a top restaurateur. The production was done in a way that made it obvious how passionate the crew was about great food. Very adoring. Wonderful sequences, with great editing and cinematography. If you are looking for a fantastic story, well there are a couple of subplots that I could have lived without.

In the central character Adam Jones (Bradley Cooper) we have what initially seems a plausible protagonist - drug addict gets clean and seeks to re-ignite his career as a super chef. The trouble is, Adam is still an a--sehole, and the movie suggests that throwing childish tantrums and threatening even your closest friends and employees is the way to succeed. I was not convinced by the end of the film that he was any sort of hero. He hadn't resolved much. Although he was prepared to actually eat a meal with his kitchen staff. Wow. The movie Whiplash, about elite jazz drumming. was far more nuanced and thrilling than Burnt. It was far more convincing in portraying obsessive people. Some tantrum scenes in Burnt almost made me laugh out loud. It was almost like a Will Ferrell character from Anchorman or Blades of Glory. In real life, if a chef smashes up kitchens like Adams does you would sack them, not look on mournfully and carry on as normal like his boss does. Adam doesn't have redeeming qualities. The love interest (at least she has a decent chef position) Helene (Sienna Miller) oddly loves Adam despite his deep narcissism and abuse of her. He only grudgingly bakes a cake for Helene's daughter -- it's the nicest thing he does in the film.

52,akcenat,Disappointing kitchen melodrama,5,21 January 2016,"The success of shows like ""Master Chef"" and ""Hell's Kitchen"" have brought food and competition into our living rooms and made certain chefs (Gordon Ramsay for instance) like pop stars. So, it's not surprising then that the food trend has been making its way into more big screen stories like ""Burnt"". But, strangely this film dwells more on Adam Jones burly mannerisms than his actual cooking, which makes it hard to invest in his struggles. Cooper and Miller (one of Adam's kitchen stuff) so fine in ""American Sniper"" here are just dots to be connected in a script off a moldy menu of predictability and clichés about relapse and recovery. I'm not also sure Uma Thurman needed to be hired for two scenes to put on a British accent and play lesbian food critic who earlier slept with Adam (really!!!!). ""Burnt"" often feels conflicted about the kind of movie it wants to be. It's not worst kitchen flick, but the melodrama is overwrought and overdone.

53,WhimsicalVonia,A Delicious Story on Courage and Redemption,8,10 October 2017,"This is why critics can only be used as a guide. I understand why the reception for this film might be low, but I do not agree. I feel that the pros outweigh the cons in this situation and that criticism was harsh overall. Why? The Good. * Yes, it was mostly cliché and predictable. Key word, mostly. It was not exactly an accurate representation of the chef life. However, there were enough unexpected detours and plot twists (admittedly, ""twists"" might be a little strong) to make it a pleasure to watch. *Bradley Cooper plays his usual role, tough boy hiding his soft heart with his defense mechanisms, but he does this character splendidly. I, for one, do not tire of it. When a great actor had found something he does well, he can mix it up enough in each performance to perfect it. * Supporting cast including Sienna Miller, Daniel Brühl, Omar Sy, Matthew Rhys, Alicia Vikamder, Emma Thompson, and Uma Thurman may not have had much screen time, but they were nevertheless impressive all around. * Cinematographer Adriano Goldman is meticulous with his magnificent food shots, but also gives notable care to showing us the city of London from different perspectives. * Quite the quotable film. For one thing, it had quite a lot to teach us about leadership and success if we take the time to really analyze the dialogue. Sara: He scares me. David: He is a two-star Michelin chef. He is supposed to be scary. Sara: Well, ""two"" doesn't seem like many. David: To get even one Michelin star, you have to be like Luke Skywalker. Okay? To get two, you have to be whoever Alec Guinness was. But if you manage to get three, you are Yoda. Sara: Well, what if he's Darth Vader?Adam: Consistency is death... No, a chef should strive to be consistent in experience, but not consistent in taste. It's like sex. It's like, you're always headed to the same place, but you got to find new and dangerous way of getting there.Adam: Cooking is an expression of what? Tell me. Helene: At its best, of sustaining someone with love. Adam: I do not want it to be a place where you come and eat. We should be dealing in culinary orgasms. When's the last time you had an orgasm that was interesting?... People eat because they are hungry. I want to make food that makes people stop eating. Cooking is an expression of who we are... I want people to sit at that table and be sick with longing. Reece: You are better than me. But the rest of us need you to lead us to places we would not otherwise go. Doctor Rosshilde: There is strength in needing others, not weakness. The Bad. * Admittedly, the plot was a little generic, full transformation for our hero. But, sometimes generic is generic because it works. * The LGBT part where Tony is in love with Adam was weird and distracting. Since it did not add anything substantial to the story, it probably did more harm than good. * I would have preferred the film take that risk and have Adam not get that third Michelin Star. Like the psychoanalyst played by Emma Thompson, ""What happens when you get that third star? What happens if you fail?"" It would have been nice to see this bad boy actually not get this and see how he deals. * To elaborate on the accuracy of this film, perhaps I should clarify that it might be accurate as a guide, but as most Hollywood films unfortunately do, it focuses on more entertaining situations than the mundane duties. In general, I support accuracy over watchability, but I have to admit that sometimes we simply want to be entertained. (http://firstwefeast.com/eat/2015/11/a- professional-chef-critiques-the-movie-burnt) The Amazing. * Above all, I am a food lover. I read about chefs. I always try to meet them when I know their name. I respect them. I go out of my way to try new cuisines, new establishments, different approaches to dining, and especially unique dishes and even novelty ones. I do not discriminate against the local hole in the walls because those are often the best. Marcus Wareing and Mario Batalo were behind this film as Chef Consultants. Gordon Ramsey was a producer. Clare Smyth trained with Bradley Cooper. You better bet that, with their names on this, it was at least a somewhat accurate representation of the culinary world, or ""The Industry"" as those in the know tend to call it. It does not surprise me that, as a boy, Cooper wanted to be either a chef or an actor. He also played a chef previously in the series ""Kitchen Confidential"", based on none other than the eminent Anthony Bourdain. Last but not least, there were some pretty orgasmic food shots and montages in the beautiful kitchens as Adam was in his element. * Maybe it was cliché to some, but the final scene almost bought a tear to my eyes to see Chef Adam sit down for the first time with his crew for a family dinner. His final lines were to give appreciation and the closing shot was Helene smiling at him, acknowledging the significance of this. He is finally letting go a little, learning to trust others. As evidenced in his reaction when Michelin showed up this time (composed, carrying on as always versus panicking & yelling at everyone in the kitchen), he is finally working on his Lone Ranger Syndrome. It should be noted that I am actually the first person to react cynically to a bow-tie Hollywood ending, but this time it worked for me.",Burnt

A washed out burnt down Chef has cleaned up, buffed his act up, and put himself together in an endeavour to pursue perfection. He is reaching out for a third Michelin star and anything less would end up getting burnt by his wrath.So we know how recalcitrant chefs are. Seen enough Gordon Ramsay to reach that conclusion. Bradley as Adam Jones touches that nerve wrecking breakdown to achieve what he has planned to do. He shouts, despises, scorns and insults his crew to get their juices running. He doesn't care how evil he might look or sound while trying to get results. He is unaffected by emotions, reckless with his life but careful with the food he is preparing. If his preparation doesn't meet the standard in his head, he flings it away and doesn't even hold himself from bashing it to the wall. He might be a man with a mission, but he is arrogant, mean and a heartless prick. He is also in a huge drug debt which gawks him from a distance, and occasionally batters him up good. He is trying hard to reach it, and there is always someone or something that messes him up and compels him to start at Ground Zero. What is quite interesting to watch is the brilliant presentation of its frames. The food shown in Burnt will at once make you hungry. There are great close up shots that will sizzle your palates. But everything disappears leaving you wanting for more. Also, there isn't one great recipe that is highlighted marvelously or shown being cooked proper which will bum foodies out. The story lacks substance which is sad. Screenplay of the flick is good. The score is kind of okay, but could have used some more depth. Cooper fans are gonna love him in this new avatar. His acting is still very engaging. His dramatic bits are great to watch and Siena Miller complements him yet again quite beautifully. Daniel Bruhl plays Tony beautifully too.

I did get a sense that creating a menu could be the most exciting thing in the world but I wouldn't want to work in his kitchen. I really enjoyed this film, made a refreshing change.",Burnt
59,eberkerbatur,"Watchable movie,Great actor especially Daniel Brühl (6.9)",7,11 October 2019,"First of all it was an above average movie, it was definitely not bad but it is not very nice.Acting was really good, maybe it was the most important thing that made the film good.
It's about a chef who used to be a great cook, but later finished his career because of drugs and other bad habits,in fact we don't know the story exactly
there are a few details other than that he didn't exactly tell how he became so bad when he was a good cook.
I think that was one of the missing parts of the film events developed very quickly find a job again to be a top-level cook all developed very quickly so to me the story was weak,multiple scene errors,but the actors have closed most details, especially the daniel brühl acting was tremendous.
as a result I would say good acting is a normal movie but it is watched",Burnt
60,Rendanlovell,Offers nothing new.,2,1 November 2015,"There is nothing that makes this movie recommendable. 'The Human Centipede' has more going for it then 'Burnt'. At least that movie held nothing back. 'Burnt' Just rolls over and dies before it even begins. It captured no attention in early screenings and it's capturing no attention now. Again, this is because it is to scared to try something new.For a movie all about trying to be the best, you'd expect more. Instead this film aims its sights at mediocrity but doesn't even get there. It seems to know that it isn't anything special so it never tries to be. If 'Burnt' had turned into the typical Disney sports movie it would've been more interesting. At least those movies know how to construct a story. But this isn't even the biggest problem.The film is, in fact, so set on being mediocre that it decides to cut scenes short and leave them without an explanation, all to avoid conflict. It doesn't want to face the main characters obvious drug problem so it decides to just cut to something else instead. It doesn't want to show the moment the entire film had been moving to, so it just cuts to something else. It felt like the director was consistently saying, ""We can fix it in post.""But instead of fixing it, they just made it worse. There are countless scenes that the film should've made an effort to explain but just cut away instead. That is so incredibly lazy. But the editing isn't the only thing to blame. The screenplay is absolutely atrocious. Almost every line of dialogue feels artificial. Nothing actually feels like that is what the character would have said. One character says or does something dumb and Bradly Cooper overreacts to it in the stupidest way possible. Tossing plates at a wall is not character development. Especially since it only happens one time. All the film does is check boxes off of a list that the studio handed to them. Not one scene in the film connects to another. It is full of pointless actions being highlighted by meaningless dialogue. If you were to jumble up the scenes in the film, I doubt it would be any different. 'Burnt' is easily the laziest effort I have witnessed all year. The film is altogether terrible. The awful plot is only made worse by the lack of risks being taken. Not to mention that the screenplay is so uninvolving that it could pass for a six second YouTube video. The film wastes a talented cast and crew by serving its audience a plate of garbage. Do yourself a favor and invest somewhere else.",Burnt

It was claustrophobic as hell and I wanted to get out and looked at my watch 20 times when I was not pinching myself to stay awake.This was sheer torture.A movie so boring that only women who find Bradley Cooper dreamy can enjoy watching. Along with either their boyfriends that they forced to watch it with them or their girlfriends.The movies running time of an hour and 41 minutes felt like 3 hours.And the lead is basically an a-hole and an arrogant douche bag that it's impossible to care for.I recommend this to women and gay men and chefs.

Bradley Cooper plays Adam, a supposedly brilliant chef whose temper tantrums and other personality flaws make him impossible to work for. He's so abusive and fragile that when the guys from Michelin finally arrive you want to shout, ""Don't tell Adam!""Cooper is of course playing the familiar figure of Gordon Ramsey. The problem with that is that Ramsey's childish behavior - screaming fits laced with obscenities and crockery smashing - might be considered (although I confess not by me) to be appropriate and even entertaining in a kitchen full of students, but certainly not when the kitchen is staffed by your own hand-picked employees.

64,Moviegoer19,Blame the Script,5,30 January 2016,"After reading several reviews I feel compelled to throw in my two cents. As my subject line says, the screenplay of this film doomed it from the beginning. To me it was predictable and contrived, with the most glaring offending passages supplying information to us, the viewers, rather than being an organic part of the story. For example, when Adam runs into the character played by Uma Thurman, she says a couple of things, then says something like ""I am a lesbian so why did I sleep with you?"" Who would say this in a two-minute or so long conversation with someone you haven't seen in years? There were a few other instances like this which sounded so phony. During the dialogue between Adam and Sienna Miller's character in which he's trying to describe his idea of what eating should be or do to people, I was waiting for him to use the word ""orgasmic"" and guess what? He did! Plus a couple of absurdities quoted in some previous reviews, as if, the writer was trying to make the script deep but was somehow off.And, finally. I've come to understand that just about any film that has a recovering addict of any kind is going to have them relapse at some point. I'm trying to think of a movie in which a sober addict stays that way throughout and I can't. Maybe I'm just watching too many movies?",Burnt

It's an amazing story overall, really one that holds you down to your seat till the end of the movie!

66,magnuslhad,shallow,2,15 March 2016,"If you think angry chefs like Gordon Ramsay are provocative and entertaining, then this film is for you. If you hate the guy's bully-boy antics with a passion, then you too might be stimulated by this. However, if you think Ramsay and his ilk are sad bores allowed to parade their little-man complexes on screen, and you find the fetishism around restaurant food absurdly theatrical, then Burnt will leave you cold. An alcoholic chef chases some Michelin starred dream, but in order to achieve glory has to become a team player, rather than try to hog all the limelight. Yes, just like Lightening McQueen in Cars, except without the heart, subtlety, comedy, and with more swearing. And lots of exposition. Three times we are told the Michelin people's MO: arrive and sit at the bar for 30 minutes till partner arrives. In suits. Tap water. One a la carte and one set menu. Fork on the floor. They say it so much I remember it. And yet, when it is relayed in the climactic scene, one character has to say ""Michelin!"", in case, you know, we forgot.

67,lucasversantvoort,Insert cooking joke here,5,14 December 2015,"It's always fun to review films centered on cooking, because it allows for plenty of culinary wordplay. I could make a joke about how Burnt is an appropriate title, but I'm not going to, because I'm better than that. You'd think with all the talent involved in this production, the end result would've been something to see, but it's not.Adam Jones used to be a great chef. Then he got hooked on liquor, drugs, what have you and he lost it all. Then he started to atone for his sins by shucking a million oysters in a restaurant. Eventually though, he decides to go back to London and help a restaurant attain a third Michelin star.The big problem with Burnt is that it doesn't render Adam as a particularly likable character in its first act. How do you have a character seeking redemption, played by Bradley Cooper no less, and make him so unlikeable as to render you inert to his inevitable character development? That's the kind of achievement that deserves a Michelin star all on its own...if that star was a picture of Gordon Ramsey flipping you off. You've got the basics like the main character falling from culinary grace through sex, drugs--and everything in between--and then trying to get his life back in order. I get that the script has to therefore make Adam unlikable in the beginning, but it's too much and irrevocably harms the way you view the rest of the film. All the references to his dramatic past that are never fully explained don't help things in the likability department either. When Adam has one of his temper tantrums in the kitchen, you just want to smack him instead of empathizing with his feelings of frustration.The other downside is the amount of well-known actors. Usually, this strengthens a film, but here it just makes the film feel clogged, like an overly stuffed chicken. The presence of familiar faces automatically makes you assume these will be well-developed at some point, but they never do, though Sienna Miller carries herself well as usual.It's frustrating to watch all the talent involved and see the final product go to waste. From the unlikable protagonist to the bevy of underdeveloped supporting characters, this is a chapter in the history of film we'd better just all forget asap.",Burnt

71,vistheindian,Need a little more meat to the bone,6,23 December 2015,"Quickie Review:Adam Jones (Bradley Cooper) is a gifted chef who ruined his life and career with drugs and alcohol. Determined to get set his life and career ambitions straight, he returns to London to lead his kitchen to Michelin star status. Burnt is packed with talented actors such as Bradley Cooper, Sienna Miller, and Daniel Brühl. A lot of the weight of the movie is on their shoulders, unfortunately they could not carry it all the way through. The main problem is the beats the movie goes through are largely predictable. Quality performances make Burnt an acceptable, decent film, albeit a forgettable one.Full Review:Was I excited for Burnt? Honestly, not really. Then again looking at the cast I thought you couldn't go wrong to give this movie a chance. After all last year I saw Chef another foodie related drama that I happen to really like. I also like the TV show Hell's Kitchen, so any flair of Gordon Ramsay should be fun.Actually Bradley Cooper ended up being more like Gordon Ramsay than I expected. He is a hot head, striving for perfection, and if you do anything wrong, there's going to be a huge mess of broken plates to clean up. As brilliant of a chef as Jones may be, his weakness in the kitchen is that he is old school. So seeing him fit back into the changed world of high class cuisine was interesting. Sienna Miller was also a good addition, as she's the only one who is able to stand up to the head chef. This led to some interesting face-offs in difference of opinions. For me, the best of the three main cast was Daniel Brühl. This actor deserves more praise than he receives. His portrayal of the character is subtle, his actions are motivated by love but he never draws focus to it. To him he is just doing favour or a job, nothing more. In many ways that made him feel more real of a person than any other character in the film.That being said, I couldn't really care for the character development for long because I knew exactly where everyone was going to end up being. This includes the obligatory love story, the sweet moment with a kid, and the acceptance of responsibilities of a leader. As in any typical story structure there has to be a crisis. However, in this film that crisis occurs way too abruptly. I'll admit that in that point in the story the moment was very effective, but then every character conveniently changes to their perfect selves I didn't see anything before that said these people were on their way to better themselves, and all that was needed was a catalyst. In other words, things happen in this movie not because it's a coherent flow to the story, but because it must fit the typical story structure of beginning, middle, climax, and resolution. So there all these pieces to the movie that are good on their own, but don't fit well together.By no means do I hate this movie. It is sufficient. If you are looking for some good performances with great looking food being prepared by great looking people, you couldn't ask for anything more perfect. On the other hand if you require a little more meat to the bone (substance to the story), you are better off waiting.",Burnt
72,randymcbeast,Bland,3,30 December 2015,"This movie was pretty pointless. It was more about dressing up Bradley Cooper as a Chef and hoping for the best. The story was bland and even the cookery was outdated. A dish that should not have been served.I just don't understand how studios can invest so much time and money into a movie and then produce such an uninteresting and meaningless film. Do they not watch it and realize how bad it is? I can only guess that some executive thought that pairing Cooper with the hot trend in cooking and cooking shows would be an instant hit. Well, you can pair the most expensive wine with Burger King and there's a high probability that you won't enjoy the meal.The movie overall was shot well and the acting was fine. It just went nowhere in the end. Sure, many viewers will just enjoy watching Cooper in a Chef's coat and without, but if you're expecting anything more than that cancel your reservation for this one.",Burnt

Here the direction (John Wells; ""The Company Men"" and ""August: Osage County""), though, really tries hard to make it all seem human to but doesn't suffice, though good editing, music supervision and sound design make it worth watching.The war-like situations depicted in a kitchen are definitely a different film-viewing experience. Transition from chaos to calm - more in metaphorical sense of a figurative journey to make it all better, seems ""okay-ish"" to revisit.

74,tjgoalie13,A Little Boring,5,2 November 2015,"Burnt, Bradley Cooper's newest endeavor is a movie I believe his fans will enjoy, but not much more than that. After seeing last year's ""Chef"" directed by Jon Favreau I realized that food related films can be great, they can show that cooking is an art form, and make you hungry at the same time. Burnt, however, borrows too many elements from the superior ""Chef"", lacks good character development, and is sporadically paced. The one saving grace of the film was the great performances by it's main cast.Watching Chef I was completely engrossed is a movie about food, that also had a story behind it. The difference between Chef and Burnt, is the fact that Burnt deals with the world of petite dishes, and psychotic chefs, not as much about the food. The film resembles last year's Whiplash, with a psycho leading a group of talented pupils, Ratatouille, and Chef, but fails to reach their level of excellence. Throughout the film, characters come and go, most of which have next to no development. Bradley Cooper's character has some development, and so does Sienna Miller's but beyond that they are all flat and one dimensional. The acting, however, is excellent, for instance I struggled to even tell who Sienna Miller was until about halfway through the film, she totally transformed. Cooper as per usual was a reliable main cast member, but the film fell flat way too much.That may be the film's biggest problem, is that it failed to elevate way too often. For a two hour film, it often felt like two and half, dragging very seriously at times. The film had next to no humor, the food wasn't very appetizing, and it all felt a little too familiar. The story is clichéd, the conflict doesn't always make sense, and the climax falls a little short.In the end Bradley Cooper fans will likely enjoy Burnt, but besides that it lacks any real appeal. The acting is good, dare I say maybe even Oscar worthy, but way too many things go wrong for the film to elevate and be great, or even good. It may be a good idea to spend your money at another film.",Burnt

It was basically a chef who wanted to be the ""Yoda"" of all chefs by obtaining a third star in his career.This was literally a few steps down from the TV series ""Hell's Kitchen"". That is what it was trying to mimic, but it did not take any risk with it. Any of the scenes where there was a mistake made with service, a reaction would happen. But it was not too convincing. There was one part where the restaurant was being rated, and one of the chefs intentionally sabotaged the food. The anticipated reaction was something that was going to be volcano-like. But instead, it was an utter disappointment.There was not enough risk taken with this movie to make it good. Playing it safe is not always the best thing to do.",Burnt
76,TheCasualReviewer,"Though some flaws, wildly underrated.",8,11 January 2020,"SYNOPSIS:
Adam Jones (Bradley Cooper) is a 2-star Michelin chef who is trying to make a comeback after bringing his Paris restaurant down a few years prior. Now, he has a brand new restaurant in London and is looking to receive his 3rd and final Michelin star.REVIEW SUMMARY:
I have to say that I am honestly astonished with how poorly reviewed this film is. In the middle of the movie I looked up the 2016 Oscars expecting this to have been a nomination for Best Picture. It came out in a strong year so I understand why it didn't win, but when my curiosity struck and I checked Rotten Tomatoes... 28%??? Film is subjective, but REALLY? I proceeded to read reviews and I started to understand a little more. This film has a very strong and promising premise, then sprinkled in are a few sub plots that are really misplaced. Jones somehow destroyed the restaurant he prospered in, in Paris and that's only referred to and never explained which I'm completely fine with, but then they keep referring to it. To the point where the major twist (which I loved) is related. Then there's a maestro/love story going on between Cooper and Sienna Miller that I vividly remembered, but really hoped I remembered incorrectly. Then a couple of guys who he apparently owes money to show up a couple of times, Jones's relationship with Reece, which appears to be important, but isn't fleshed out in any way and finally side story of Tony being in love with Jones, which doesn't do anything for the story in the slightest. With all of that being said... what a gorgeously messy film. The acting is amazing, the twist is spectacular and the direction is so beautiful and wonderfully paced. I understand how misdirected the film is, but there is so much good there that I don't understand the extreme hate. I'm thoroughly shocked. 8.3/10.---------------------------------------BREAKDOWN----------------------------------------DIRECTION:
The direction in this film is beautiful. The shots are so amazing and the color palette is great. Maybe the writing has a few flaws, but the direction of a flawed movie was quite impressive. Especially from someone who doesn't really direct anything or more-so TV shows. He picks the right shots for the right moments that really collect the emotion straight from any of these amazing performances. I haven't seen every rating for every movie that I've seen, but this might be the most underrated film that I've seen. OH, and the seen with the little girl and the cake in the middle of a full dining area! A complete flip of the character, but so pure and grounded. Amazing work.WRITING:
Okay. Okay... OKAY. Listen. Look. Listen... I kinda get it. KINDA. Get it. BUT... but... I don't really. The reviews I've seen on this film would make anyone who hasn't seen it, feel like this is possibly one of the worst movies of the decade. Sheesh, maybe ever. It's not even close. The title isn't great and everything I mentioned in my review summary may be true, but this film so VERY entertaining. This film is just a couple tweaks and a harder focus on the main characters journey to his third Michelin star away from being damn near perfect. You can't be that close and land so far. Some spectacular writing was in this film. From ""I was almost as good as I thought I was"", really giving you a short and sweet self-perception while he also made himself shuck one million oysters for his failure. Then the encounter where tony says, ""instead of falling in love with me"" which although that subplot was quite pointless, the exchange in that moment was beautiful. There are many flaws in the writing sure, but there are also a lot of gems.ACTING:
The acting is superb. Bradley Cooper is riveting as a fictional chef and then amazing supporting roles from Sienna Miller, Daniel Bruhl, Omar Sy, Matthew Rhys, Emma Thompson, etc... I mean Lily James being in the movie was completely wiped from my memory. I do want to speak specifically about Matthew Rhys and Daniel Bruhl. They were next-level in this. I mean, Daniel Bruhl's best performance to this day is Inglorious Basterds (every actors best performance was in Inglorious Basterds), but he is so solid in this. I can say the same thing about Matthew Rhys. I just found out he's British, today. I mean what the actual fluff is with these Britishians. I'm going to spend a year in the UK just so I can get a more spot-on American accent cause I'm not even sure anymore. Anyway... he also had an almost interesting wish-it-was-fleshed-out role in this film. Either way, the acting was great in this film and aside from messy subplots, I don't really see much issue with this film. It's too bad I found out about the hate so late. I could've maybe saved this film slaughtering.",Burnt

It's practically using Bradly Cooper's sex appeal luring audienced into theaters which unfortunately unsuccessful. I picked up the movie because of the box office bust and was curious to know the reasons. After watching it, I would say it's not worthy of 20 million production cost. The storyline is not a convincing or even an intriguing one. Alcoholism could be employed into the plot without overly dramatized on Cooper's part. Somehow it's just becoming a usual hotchpotch bearing Bradly's name. No wonder audiences were not interested going to the theaters. I am vastly disappointed.

His goal is to have the current restaurant attain 3-Stars from Michelin, the tire people. A given in this movie is that we will see erratic behavior from Adam since Gordon Ramsay is rumored to be a producer of this film. We liked Cooper as Adam, but we were never comfortable with him as almost anything could set him off. In due course we do learn about his previous drug use, alcoholism, and money troubles. As we see him in his new environment with all those bad things - supposedly in the past - we can only hope for the bestAdam gathers his crew even though he did some of them wrong in the past. They still go with him because they knew of his talent. And, of course, he yells a lot and break a lot of crockery. (Ramsay must have been so proud) Begrudgingly, he learns a few things from Helene (Sienna Miller) who is up on the latest chef tricks and we are off to the races. The love relationship between Adam and Helene didn't really materialize and one had to read into it if one wanted that to happen. A few kisses don't a relationship make, but. we were kind of disappointed there wasn't more romance – if you will – between Adam and Helene as they were very good together.Notables: Emma Thompson as Dr Rosshilde as Adam's shrink; Matthew Rhys as Reece a current Chef competitor; Alicia Vikander as Anne Marie a former love of Adam; and Daniel Bruhl as Tony, the matre'de.A real downside was Tony's French accent. Often it was difficult to understand what he was saying mostly because he talked very fast like he was on roller skates and here I blame the Director for this. We see many scenes that seemed to have been cut short and we wished they were longer. Pity.The best scene in the movie is when Adam bakes a birthday cake for Helene's daughter Lily (Lexie Benbow-Hart) and he asks her how it is when she takes a bite. She says, ""I've had better."" to which Adam smiles. I was hoping that the very last scene in the movie would have seen Adam in Helene's apartment where Lily makes something of her own for Adam and asks him how he likes it and he replies, ""I've had better."" and we see smiles all around. Fade to black. But no one checked with me so that didn't happen. Would have been a nice touch though. The way this started out I felt this could be one of the best ever Chef movies, but I changed my mind later on when it became too sketchy. Okay, but sketchy. (5/10)Violence: Yes.

80,winopaul,Sub TV-movie,6,4 March 2017,"Pretty awful. A TV movie would be better. At least watching a Lifetime flick I will care a little about the characters and have a lump in my throat at the end. This thing, I wanted to waterboard the characters with soup from the Seinfield episode of the Soup Nazi, ""Plenty soup for you!"" I wish IMDb had a way to tag writers so that there is a pop-up warning displayed anytime you look at any of their movies. I gave this flick a try since I watched ""Chef (2014)"" a few weeks ago and I liked it. This one is perfectly incoherent. They trot out the worn-out tripe that a great chef has to be an infant terrible, emphasis on the infant. Then they have Bradley-Brad's competitor telling him that Bradley-Brad is a better chef, and that the competitor ""needs him"" ya know, to be better and give him something to strive for. What crap.If Bradley-Brad did stumble into the competitor's kitchen drunk and raving, the competitor would have filmed it with his iPhone and posted it on Facebook 20 seconds after it happened. Then he would have let Bradley-Brad put the bag over his head and walked out of the kitchen smoked a cigarette, and gone to a pay phone to call the cops, explaining ""This drunk raving lunatic came into my kitchen and put a sous vide bag over his head"".And sous vide as some avant garde cooking technique, please. How 2000. Maybe having Samoans roast a pig in the yard every night, that would be something different. Chez Poly. All the supposed food porn just turned me off. It was like real porn, over-demonstrative and completely unable to convey the subtle joys of the activity.And the story arc is as unbelievable as the supposed avant garde cooking. He was a rotten viscous dope-fiend prick. Then he shucked a million oysters, and found redemption?! And he is now a good person when he finally goes to group therapy. A rotten prick never ever changes, it wired in, hardwired. But being humiliated and given an old set of knives and he becomes a decent loving step-dad role model. Judging from the waif-like appearance of his ex-girlfriend Bradley-Brad would have started abusing the little girl daughter in a couple years, while holding her mom's job as leverage to keep the whole thing quiet.Chef Ramsey might throw pans around the kitchen, but that is just drama porn meant to keep people watching something on par with seeing paint dry. If a chef did that in real life he would be drawn up before the labor relations commission and sued for his entire net worth every time it happened. And how about the female lead for mother of the year? The way her kid bosses her around, no wonder she takes Bradley-Brad's BS. If she didn't give in after 12 seconds her kid would have eaten the oatmeal instead of bribing the little rotten monster with coco puffs (deleted scene). Maybe if the rotten hell-child was wearing the oatmeal and made to go to school a few times, she might learn the social utility of listening to her mom.What a hollow empty narcissist, to try an please some French frog idiots, rather than make a decent meal for the customers paying him exorbitant money. ""The Hundred-Foot Journey"" was pretty good. But note it was about the people, not the food. Burnt is like some Asperger examination of the food more than the people, since none of the people made any sense and none of them were consistent or believable. So I guess it had to be about the food. To fix a movie with such a bad script is not a matter of a few re-shoots. Since this is pretty much a sausage fest, like a war movie, lets make the girl lead into the star. All the actors are great in this thing, a tribute to their professionalism. So make Bradley-Brad a believable narcissist sociopath by having him stay a narcissist sociopath the whole flick. Have the gal battle him the whole movie, until by the end the staff and owner and customers band behind her to get Bradley-Brad tossed out onto the street, a homeless bum. Maybe have her end up with the competitor, who helps her destroy Bradley-Brad, a commentary on how society can defeat sociopaths if we stick together.Another theme could be how narcissist sociopaths so need to hurt people, they will start hurting themselves when the victims wise up and shun them. So sure, have Bradley-Brad seduce the gal and use his charm and cooking and witty repartee. Then after he tries to rape the little girl, lets have mom destroy him. And lets shoot a lot of new footage showing the mom to be a decent mother, not a phone-it-in mother. Eighty five million domestic gross and think of the action figures and marketing tie ins. Maybe go really dark and have her stab Bradley-Brad as he tries to rape the little girl yet again, and then you could sell the knife kit as a great tie-in. Its not just a Ginsu, its a statement of social justice.Meanwhile, am I the only guy that will place a fork on the floor every time I go out to eat? I suspect the Michelin people were laughing as hard as all the real cooks when they watched this. That is not to say a Michelin taster never tried the fork trick, sometime in 1950, and that is not so say the tasters were exclusively two middle-aged men, back in 1960. But even if the fork play is pure BS, the wanna-be restaurants don't know that and I thankfully meet the demographic of the supposed Michelin taster. Next movie lets have them check the tires on the customer's cars to find the Michelin men.",Burnt

Or just watch one of those cook off shows on TV since that portrays as you feel that there are actual stakes in their effort, and real emotions.

82,PeachesIR,"There is meat, but not nearly enough",6,19 September 2021,"""Burnt"" is the story of a lionized star chef who is recovering from an alcohol and drug addiction that nearly destroyed his career in haute cuisine and damaged his most cherished personal relationships. He gets a second chance to helm a top restaurant in London, but must conquer many of his lingering demons (obsession with perfection and control, anger management) to achieve three Michelin stars, the pinnacle of success in his field, which he seems to desire above all else.The movie features quality acting from its star-filled cast and plenty of shots of sumptuous cuisine, but it suffers from a cold detachment. As a viewer, you feel as if something important to the story was cut, perhaps to shorten the film. We are told Adam left a wake of destruction in his addict period, but we never see that, and I think that omission hurts the film. Adam winds up looking like nothing more than an obnoxious, egomaniacal perfectionist who screams at his staff, perhaps typical for chefs, but it's hard to watch him behave this way and care if he succeeds or not. The romance plot line seems forced, mainly because it is terribly underdeveloped. Fully fleshed out, the love story could have lent the film the emotional depth it needs.""Burnt"" is a mildly interesting, glamorous movie rental, particularly if you're a foodie, but it left me as cold as a pickled fish appetizer.

Or ""Chef"" without the comedy and the cute kid. Despite starring Bradley Cooper, ""Burnt"" is under-cooked. For foodies, the photography is lovely, but there's not much love interest, no real character development despite plenty of predictable yelling going on in the kitchen. Of mild interest is the fact that Sienna Miller and Bradley Cooper are back together in this film after playing husband and wife in American Sniper. Emma Thompson and Uma Thurman are just another couple of big names being thrown into the mix for a couple of scenes. Overall, ""Burnt"" is pretty unsatisfying. After Bradley Cooper's star turn in ""American Sniper"" it makes you wonder why they all signed up for it really.",Burnt

86,ryanmark-57919,Great for People that Take Themselves Way too Seriously,6,31 October 2015,"Honestly, the trailers for this film really didn't do anything for me. I know people take their cooking seriously sometimes, but I saw that trailer and I actually started laughing to myself. I just couldn't take so much drama over something as mundane as preparing food. At least, it's something I don't take very seriously but the movie did a great job of explaining why these characters are so obsessed with it and why I was having trouble understanding all the passion. It's true that they're chefs, but they're also artists. So, I was able to get over that hurdle in my mind but the film still has a few issues that keep it from being great. It's a decent movie though and is worth a watch if you're a fan of people taking themselves way too seriously. Let's get to the plot.Adam Jones (Bradley Cooper) was once one of the world's greatest chefs but went into seclusion after some self-destructive behavior tarnished his reputation. After a few years of sobriety, he decides to get back into the fine dining world by coercing, er..., convincing a former colleague of his named Tony (Daniel Bruhl) to let him cook in his restaurant and assemble his own team of top notch chefs. Adam has a bit of an obsession with obtaining the third Michelin star for a restaurant that he cooks in. So, he has a restaurant and a great team backing him up but Adam doesn't exactly play nice with others and his desire for perfection are the biggest obstacles in his way towards making his dream come true.The cast is actually pretty good in this film and they help to make the movie as watchable as it is. Bradley Cooper shows off quite a bit of passion as Adam, and a little insanity. That's not really fair, he's not insane as much as he's completely obsessed with being considered one of the best chefs in the world. He comes off likable one minute and the next he's just bonkers and yelling at everyone. He reminds me a lot of Gordon Ramsay, except even harder to work with. Next, we have Helene played by Sienna Miller. She's also a very good chef and brings her talents (after some coercion) to help Adam in his new restaurant. She's also the love interest of the picture. Miller does a fine job and I believe her passion for cooking but I had trouble taking the budding attraction between them seriously. Yeah, they both like to make food but the chemistry just didn't convince me.Daniel Bruhl does a great job as the restaurant's owner Tony. He obviously cares very deeply for Adam and wants him to get back on his feet but he also doesn't want to put up with a lot of unnecessary drama in his restaurant. I'm actually surprised how much this character was willing to bend over backwards for Adam. The last character I want to mention is Reece played Matthew Rhys. This guy, along with Adam, are the reasons I had trouble taking the story seriously. They're like arch-rivals that both make good food but they don't want each other to succeed. Their rivalry serves to make both of them better chefs but the hissy fits they throw are way too over the top for me to take seriously. Still, Rhys is another great actor and he does a great job throwing those hissy fits.I enjoyed the movie but the pacing felt a little weird too me. The film is directed by John Wells, and I'm honestly not a fan from what I've seen. Some scenes play out at breakneck speed when we really could have used some more explanation and other scenes just drag on to nowhere. I thought some more consistency overall would have been nice. I did enjoy the story more then I thought I would, even if it's nothing new. Basically, a guy pursues a dream of glory and finds out there are more important things in life, like friends and family. Like I said, nothing new but the story was still interesting and I couldn't help but smile at the resolution.Overall, the movie is enjoyable but it has a few major problems that keep it from being a truly great film. The pacing is all over the place but the actors do a decent enough job with their performances that it's not a complete waste of time. If you're a big fan of cooking shows and movies then I would recommend giving it a shot.",Burnt

Forward to 2015 - its just another movie about Michelin Guide-3-stars-wannabe. In other words, out-dated, predictable, safe, and unnecessary, but watchable as a plain no-brainer piece.Its neither that bad nor as good as reviewers here and elsewhere make it out to be. You could watch it as an ordinary rom-dramedy or as an ordinary give-me-a-second-chance-inspirational-celluloid, and you would get what you should ordinarily expect, nothing more nor less.The premise is straight-forward, the outcome predictable, the attempted 'edginess' crude and way overdone (though one may forgive this when its overdone by dour-blue-eyed Bradley Cooper, including a full-on lip kiss with another guy  no tongue).On the romantic and human interest side, characterizations are rushed and overly one-dimensional. One moment swinging at one another for no believable reason, and the next moment sappily supportive or laughably betraying, again for no believable reason.As for the food and the cooking -  very a-la-carte as with any other cuisine movies - close ups of usual steak and fillet with adornments being sprinkled, kitchen tantrums, food being chucked, plates being broken, pots and pans being stirred . in unnaturally clean and pristine kitchens, likewise the utensils and uniforms.I did especially like Sienna Miller's performance - nicely understated and believable. Daniel Brühl is also effective as the pained and spurned gay restaurant manager. While Bradley Cooper did help to make Burnt more watchable, the unfortunate side is that since it is meant to be a Bradley Cooper vehicle, your expectations are heightened - and that could only lead to disappointment in the case of Burnt . and Aloha :)As a simplified placement - Burnt is notches below The Chef, while Hundred Foot Journey is notches below Burnt.

I've never thought of Cooper a dramatic actor, but he handles himself well in this. It's not an Oscar performance, but the material doesn't demand one — rather, it asks for everyone to underplay to the point of appearing bland... and yet none of them are. The handling of the maitre d' subplot was quite lovely, by the way. Like so much in this movie, you didn't need everything plastered onto the screen in 10-foot-high letters.

His goal is to open a restaurant and get 3 Michelin stars but everybody in the cooking world hates him. Even in London he can't walk down the street without somebody chasing him.Surprisingly enough, he is able to round up some talented friends in a way that is reminiscent of Jake and Elwood.He knows that to meet his goal, he has to stay away from things he is addicted to so he insists on hiring Sienna Miller (who would be perfect for him except for his commitment to celibacy).A stellar supporting cast including Emma Thompson, adorable Daniel Brühl, Omar Sy, Matthew Rhys, Sarah Greene were fun, all on their own.Bradley Coopers costumes were mainly T-shirts but he changed them so frequently that it was like he was competing with one (or all) of the Helmsworth brothers - not that I'm objecting. His French accent wasn't bad either!Like most women, I find a man throwing a tantrum unpleasant so I don't watch those cooking shows. Even when Bradley Cooper does it, I congratulate myself on never having to deal with that again. Those are the only unpleasant parts of the film.The big questions - can Adam Jones learn how to make it through the day without throwing a tantrum like a teenage girl getting her period?

We get to know that he had it all - by clobbering so many of his peers to get there. Unfortunately I know a number of types who are such bloody-minded bullies that they do no care what lives they ruin - including their own. Calling someone an 'enfant terrible' does not make him any more acceptable. He was the baddie in the movie and we are forced to try and feel for him. Shouting, smashing places up and assaulting one's work mates for the littlest irritation, may enliven boring kitchen scenes, but should make any person to be thrown out (or killed with one of his knives). Anger management in his case is doomed to failure. Types like him, gives us men, a bad name. This is beyond compulsive perfectionism. He had no sympathy for Helene when she wanted to take a day off for her girl's birthday. When he made her a cake, he did it on order and grudgingly - and expected the little girl to tell him how heavenly it was. Her reply was worth the whole film.

Yuk.The movie is served as is - a gluing up of events and recounts of what they've been told goes on in a Michelin restaurant. Well, big whoop! They have all the elements but they assembled it as a child would when playing with Lego. This is not story telling. Gordon Ramsay may be a great chef but I wouldn't trust him to be a good scripter or actor (Just grab a vomit bag and watch ""Love's Kitchen (2011)""). So take the nuggets of information and work on it until you get something solid. Don't rush. People like foody TV-series and there ain't that many movies on food/restaurants.

In my opinion it is modern, yes, but it is worse than ""The Hundred-Foot Journey (2014)"" or even ""Love's Kitchen."" Utter rubbish. I found ""Burnt"" really predictable.

There seems to be no excitement in the kitchen, only drudgery. There seems to be no pride of accomplishment. There doesn't seem to be any satisfaction at the end of the day. The kitchen revolves around the compulsion of a master chef who we are supposed to believe is equally loved for his genius and hated for his ""bad boy"" behavior by his peers. Bradley Cooper's deadpan at the heart of the story is a disappointment. This master chef does not seem enthusiastic about creating food, or about anything else. There is a scene in which he prepares breakfast in an associate's kitchen, in which we might have glimpsed joy driving his compulsion, but, instead, he seems to experience no pleasure. Additionally, the script mainly depicts behavior from him that is perfectionistic, narcissistic, manipulative, and bad tempered. I found it hard to fathom the respect and affection granted him by others in the script.

The illustrations of what goes on in a big kitchen were very good:the intense rivalry between chefs,chucking plates of food at the walls,cussing,drinking,intense fear of the Michelin inspectors and the high adrenalin all very true and well depicted.However....... The food at the pass was obviously stone cold ; steam fogging up the camera lenses perhaps.Some of the meat looked as if it was very dry and had been cooling in the fridge.The kitchens were far too clean:halfway through a service you are knee deep in crap and there is steam and stink and oil fumes everywhere and the heat is horrendous.These guys looked as if they had just popped in from a country club.Where was the sweat? The current difference of opinion between food cooked ""sous vide"" and in a frying pan was well done. I didn't like Mr Cooper.Not cheffy and too good-looking.His Hollywood French was clearly not good enough calling for embarrassing dubbing.If I had been casting this film , having read the script, I would have been on my way to Quebec to find a bi-lingual actor - there must have been one such surely? The star of the show was the food;artistic and beautifully presented and appealing.Someone had gone to a great deal of trouble to make it look top drawer and that was greatly appreciated by moi-meme and I am sure by many others.A foot note from me and derived from this film but not strictly attributable to it.We all like our food and occasionally we like to do something special- an important anniversary ,kids 21st or something like that.However food is fuel to live and I have seen fat tourists in the Dordogne stuffing foie gras into their faces at giant tourist prices, in Paris where you could pay 100 dollars US for a starter and cruise ships where you could order a buffalo stuffed with swans for what it would cost an African family to live for a year.In the West you should be able to eat a perfect 3/4 course lunch or dinner, cooked perfectly and in perfect surroundings for a max of 100 dollars US and if you are paying more because of the name of the restaurant or the chef you are being hoodwinked and you should think again.Take one mouthful of a millionaire chef's ""Homard aux crevettes"" and think of how many that could feed in the starving world.Sorry for rant.",Burnt

Everyone he meets he seems to have alienated beyond redemption sometime in the past, yet impossibly they all want to help him reclaim his glory in a new London restaurant. Or do they? This is the premise of Burnt, the new film that reunites Bradley Cooper and Sienna Miller in the starring roles. While entertaining, it's a story that we've seen time and time again that only becomes interesting when it is used to highlight something new, to draw our attention to something we didn't see before. Unfortunately, screenwriter Steven Knight bases the story purely on hackneyed sensationalism, barely tying the threads together with something real, and director John Wells offers little in the way of something new and exciting.Seemingly based on the likes of celebrity chef and volatile bully Gordon Ramsey, Adam Jones (Bradley Cooper/American Sniper, Aloha) was a successful chef in Paris before he fell prey to the temptations of drugs, alcohol and women, alienating most of the people in his life and racking up massive...Read the full review on David 'n the Dark!https://davidnthedark.wordpress.com/2015/11/19/burntreview/",Burnt

You will love this also. Bradley Cooper has a Midas touch, even in this capacity. A must watch for food fans. A must watch for lovers of clever fast paced movies with flavour.

116,suzanne-sellers,Couldn't be bothered to give a damn,5,5 August 2017,"Its a well known plot device that we are presented with difficult and troubled characters who act like a-holes and we're supposed to infer they are actually deep and worthy of our sympathy. Of course, the two main jerks in this film are destined to fall in love and learn a life lesson in the process, voila! But in this case, the two main stars Sienna Miller and Bradley Cooper don't seem worth of much sympathy at all. Herein, the movie fails.Sienna Miller's character is raising a young daughter alone, but this doesn't seem like a good enough reason for her bitchiness. Bradley Cooper is a recovering drug addict who stabbed everybody in the back in the past and seeks a new start now that he is in recovery. Obviously, people are suspicious of him and cautious as he plays the diva chef to the hilt when Daniel Bruhl's character gives him a chance as head chef in a new restaurant in London. Its hard to describe the repulsiveness of Cooper's character and why anybody puts up with him. He and Sienna's character ""bond"" over trying out new recipes, but even that doesn't seem to give humility to Cooper. Didn't he learn anything from shucking 1 million oysters in a New Orleans dive bar as penance for his character flaws? Frankly, even his food looks puny and un-appetizing and we're supposed to believe its haute cuisine and the work of a master!Things happen that aren't very interesting and in the end Cooper wins a Michelin star (or two or three, I don't remember) and all is well and he has learned his lesson and everybody's happy! Forget that he tortured everybody with his tantrums during the whole process. Funny thing is, the audience was never rooting for Cooper in the first place. If you want to see a terrific chef movie, see ""Big Night"" with Tony Shaloub and Stanley Tucci. Burnt doesn't hold a candle to his terrific film about what being a chef and owning a restaurant is really like.",Burnt

And a side order of rampant egocentrism",6,29 July 2016,"Your enjoyment of this movie will depend on whether or not you buy into the 'chef as a rockstar' myth which is so popular these days. If you do, you will love this and find the tortured central character fascinating. If, like me, you don't feel the ability to make a decent steak and chips automatically entitles you to behave like an arsehole, well, you might struggle with the flimsy material.Bradley Cooper is decent enough, although his conversion from narcissistic control freak who treats everyone like crap to all round nice guy who proclaims, there's no I in team, is unconvincing. The best thing in this film is Sienna Miller who gives another great performance; in fact, her character is much more interesting than Cooper's. Which is a slight problem. Burnt is hugely uneven, then, although always interesting when Miller is on screen. When she's not and instead we get yet another scene in which Cooper acts like a complete jerk, I found myself daydreaming about being chased by a giant hamburger who wanted to eat me!",Burnt
118,Jazzy31133,"Visually appetizing, but bland taste",6,5 January 2016,"Movies like burnt are so frustrating to watch and in cases like this, the fault almost always lies with the director and / or meddling producers. I am not 100% sure, but I believe that this script was on the black list and even if it was not it probably was damn good to attract the acting talent to such a project. The acting was well done (no pun intended) and none of the actors mailed in their performance. So why does the sum equal less than the parts?In my reviews, I like to rate movies based on promise and delivery. The trailer is the promise and the viewing experience is the delivery. And I always try to give films the benefit of the doubt. Rating a movie a 1 or a 10, is not helpful to your fellow users.When you decide to spend your valuable time and money on burnt, you know you're not getting a big budget, special effects extravaganza or a gripping whodunit. You want the movie to show you the inner workings of a kitchen, the struggle and cut throat atmosphere of creating and maintaining a top rated restaurant and some relationship drama that feels possibe. Doesn't have to be good will hunting emotion, but enough to keep us invested. The story and character motivations should never be so illogical or vague as to distract the viewer.Burnt is not a complete misfire. I enjoyed the scenes in the restaurant kitchen, they were beautiful shots. And most of the scenes themselves were well acted, Bradley seemed invested in the role. The role actors also did an adequate job. The major problem was there was no real tension. The stakes never seemed remotely high.SMALL SPOILERS: Bradley's character had a vague back story about drug abuse and wanting redemption, but he never seemed to really struggle. He vanishes from the restaurant scene after burning out, and then, after some self penance, he is able to finagle his way into running a brand new restaurant and in no time at all wins a Michelin star? There is some tension with the debt he owes, but you never feel worried because he could always borrow the money from the super rich Maître d'. And in the end his gorgeous ex waltzes in and pays it off?You can tell as you watch the movie that there are some plot points that were probably compelling in the screenplay, but unfortunately just got lost in translation. I read that when the movie was edited, an actor's entire role was edited out. Maybe that was why the movie seemed kind of disjointed. Every genre of movie has fatal flaws. In niche genres like this, you never want your movie to feel ""like a day in the life"". It's a movie, give us some stakes. Burnt felt like I got a behind the scenes peek at running a top restaurant. If I wanted that I could watch a 30 minute Food Network show.Final verdict: Bradley Coopers fans would enjoy. Otherwise, wait till it comes out NetFlix and you're bored one rainy night.This question probably makes more sense in the forum section, but I find it an interesting parallel. Another food movie came out around the same time called Chef. It was marketed more as a family drama / feel good, subtle comedy. The main character also finds semi redemption by falling back in love with cooking, by going back to the basics after burning out. He also reconnects with his young son. I had the same after taste watching that movie. Cool scenes involving food, but no real stakes or unexpected turns. That movie, however, got stellar reviews. Sometimes I just do not understand professional movie critics at all.",Burnt

I walked out about 50 minutes in and asked Cineplex for a refund because my head was on the verge of exploding from boredom. To say this movie was insufferable would be an understatement. Every character in the movie spoke a very different dialect of English, making my brain hurt. Not to mention there were also 2 dialects of French and 1 dialect of Italian in there. The movie didn't make sense. For one, being high on crack/drunk 24/7 causes sexual impotence. He would go and see his doctor and she would sit there quoting random famous people. The conversations didn't make any sense..Anyway, I have only ever walked out of 2 other movies: Eat Pray Love and Magic Mike, and I got at least 1.5 hours into those two.It would take skill to make a movie worse than this one.

So a movie centered around the concept of food, the culinary world and the rise of a French chef aspiring for the final Michelin star should be Cinematic Gold right?Wrong. The movie attempts to achieve a lot within its scope but fails to deliver because it lacks a character that we, as the audience, can relate to. Adam Jones is the head chef of a 2 Michelin star restaurant who falls out of fame as his downward spiral into addiction leaves him with nothing. Jones is played by a somewhat charming Bradley Cooper, who is passionate about one thing above everything else, perfection. The movie literally centers around him and his struggle to rise to the top of the food chain.Continue reading the review on my blog below: https://microreels.wordpress.com/2015/11/02/251/",Burnt
122,mycoffeemug,boring and no chemistry,2,24 January 2016,I love any food related movie but this one is just so boring. Bradley Cooper is unconvincing as a chef!!!! And the romantic scenes are just super corny. This is a movie with zero substance and the 2 actors (Miller & Cooper) just have ZERO chemistry. You will find yourself wincing when they kiss. You just wish they don't really. I don't know what is wrong with them. It's not my first tie to watch Bradley Cooper. What a waste of 100 or so minutes of your life because you endure it in hope that it will something later. But save yourself from wasting 100 minutes of your life. Not start. Go watch the French Le Chef and the Chef but 100x better than this. I'm so mad for wasting my time. The 2 star is for the food display. That at least is okay.,Burnt

I mean, I love some really terrible movies (No Reservations, Simply Irresistible) and, yet, Burn left a sour taste-- no, that's not accurate. At least sour would have been tangible.It's well-acted. The shots with the food are out of this world beautiful. The characters are likable. The problem is that this movie is about nothing. Not the food. Not the characters. Not the restaurant. It's about nothing. Worse, it starts strong and with the promise of a story, and then it slowly deflates midway until by the third act, it's a lifeless pile of blah where it wallows until the end.",Burnt

Maybe I'm just not posh enough or stuck up my own backside enough but I really struggle to see why I'm meant to be invested in a shouty jerk's journey to feeding ultra expensive plates to the posh. There is far too much cringeworthy dialogue about needing to be arrogant to work in my kitchen and food that makes you want to stop eating and blah blah blah. The scene where Bradley Cooper destroys and verbally abuses the entire kitchen before assaulting Sienna Miller is deeply uncomfortable on many levels. I don't understand how it's meant to be acceptable just because he's driven but has demons or whatever the excuse of the day is for men's behaviour.
With all that is negative about the film it is beautifully shot. One of the stars is for that. The other is for Daniel Bruhl's Tony, the best performance and only really likeable character in the film.",Burnt
125,wiztwas,Inconsistencies all over. Unable to suspend my disbelief,2,14 February 2016,"I failed to suspend my disbelief, there were so many things that were plain wrong.Riding a motorcycle without a crash helmet... illegal in the UK.The French girl smoking at the restaurant launch in a public building... illegal in the UK.Chef smoking in a kitchen, wrong on so many levels. It is illegal in the UK to smoke in the workplace, no self respecting chef would destroy his taste buds with cigarettes, no self respecting chef would allow anyone to smoke in a kitchen even if it was not illegal.The spoken French was not as bad as it could have been, but the body language was terrible, no one even kissed a greeting.There were scenes that just lacked hissy fits are to be expected, but we need to understand why we need to be wanting to have the hissy fit ourselves, we need to feel chefs passion anger and want to punch something as well, not go oh yes, we expect chefs to be having fits so we better insert one here in the story.The buzz of the kitchen, the dialogue of shouting out orders and shouting instructions was rushed trying to get too much into a short short and it ended up having too much buzz, breaking the disbelief, reminding us this wasn't a chef, but an actor playing the part of a chef.I feel this film should have been about relationships, it should have been about emotions and passion of food. The kissing should never have happened, it should have been about people, relationships.As for stereotypes it re-enforced them all and failed to break any, why did he not have questions about his sexuality, why did the sous chef not come back and make up after the cayenne.Why were we not given more time to find out about the drug dealers from Paris (who have a UK registered Range Rover? Product placement?) and are demanding money from him? What they keep a spare car over here just to go and get money out of a three year old debt? It was not convincing, it felt and came over as being really lame.Knives, Knives, Knives, who ever did this knew about chefs and their relationship with knives, I guess a lot of us do. It is part of being a chef, but why incorporate this so many times? Product placement? The frying pan drawer is history, the new equipment to boil in the bag visible in so many shots (product placement?)I feel like I have been robbed of my time, the only stimulating aspect has been venting it all here.",Burnt

The narrative seems disjointed, the characters disconnected, and there's no real chemistry between anyone there should be ... etc.We don't believe these characters, we don't care about them ... and in a movie like this one, you need to. It's a shame really ... because with a little more thought, this could have been a truly GREAT movie about the kind of pressure and madness that comes with kitchen-life at the highest possible level.But for the reasons noted (and a few others, such as the lame psycho-analytical subplot) it ultimately fell flat ... and to be honest, I was a little sad about that.",Burnt

Whether it be Chef or even No Reservations, movies about food just make me happy. So when I heard about a cooking movie starring Bradley Cooper, I was so excited! But oh my gosh, I have never been so disappointed. The movie throws you into the middle of this chef's life, played by Cooper, and immediately expects you to feel love and compassion toward him even though you don't know him at all. It then goes on to show him trying to get a gang of old chef's together, some friends some enemies, to attempt to start up a new restaurant and get three Michelin stars. It gives very little background about these characters, but forces to know whether they are friends or vengeful. Throughout the entire film Cooper is a complete jerk.

Getting back to the script: you either don't have any idea what is going on or they spell,it out for you kindergarten style. sometimes, the backgrounds no music was either too loud or just too distracting. It would be nice to actually HEAR the dialog, but being the broken record I am, you really didn't need to know what was going on, as it was mostly predictable.

A few amusing parts, but not a comedy.I also believed it climaxed at the wrong part. The whole film builds up to this scene where Adam Jones will finally earn 3 stars for his restaurant. Michel ends up screwing him over for revenge and destroying everything Adam worked towards. This is all fine and a nice twist to the plot. But the movie should have build up again to the 2nd attempt (after finding out the 1st was a fake) at 3 stars. Instead, the chefs more act like ... ""meh"", we get 3 or we don't, who cares. At least that's the way the movie portrays it as it speeds right through a 3 minute scene that is suppose to be the major anticipated moment in this restaurant.But, apart from that, the movie is still very good and worth watching.",Burnt

Here Adam is a successfull chef who went over his limits in the past and he burnt. Movie is well told around. It has everything in it: achievement, love, cooperation but in my opinion it didnt really succeed. It wasnt impressive moreover it was just a little more than a common motivational movie. I guess it didnt have an edge.Still I enjoyed watching it because its light and refreshing. In my opinion a movie where you spent your time without a need to check when it ends is a good movie.

The film stars Bradley Cooper, Sienna Miller, Omar Sy, Daniel Brühl, Matthew Rhys, Alicia Vikander, Uma Thurman and Emma Thompson.Adam Jones is an up-and-coming chef whose drug use and erratic behaviour lead him to lose his restaurant. He attempts to rebuild his life and his career in London, in the hopes of returning to Paris to open a new restaurant that will gain three Michelin stars.Burnt is truly an excellent comedy-drama film.Rated R for language including some sexual references, and drug use.",Burnt
148,keithdonald,I Was Burnt,5,3 February 2016,"The problem I had with this film was it lacked substance. From the outset the main character, Adam played by Bradley Cooper, tells us how he raise to fame in Paris and how he fell from his pedestal through the use of drugs and alcohol. So the movie is set purely on his rise again back in London. If the movie had encompassed the 'rise, fall and rise again' parts it would have been a lot better for the viewer as they would share the roller coaster ride of his career. The viewer feels cheated that the meatier parts of the career, which would give a modicum of excitement, simply weren't there.Now for the positives - The acting throughout the cast was simply fantastic. I've been in Gordon Ramsey's kitchen at his flagship restaurant in London and almost felt I was back there. Even the slightest mannerisms and techniques were spot on.Foodie types will love it and it was certainly watchable, but if you are looking for any action or suspense, look elsewhere.",Burnt

150,hessa-almasoud,Worth watching,8,12 January 2016,"I watched this movie yesterday and I can say it's totally worth the watch. This is a story about a guy who hits rock bottom and attempts to claw himself back to the top, which in my opinion is inspiring. Adam Jones was a successful chef in Paris before he screwed himself and his friends over and lost the career he lived and breathed. I loved the way the food looked, how they prepared it and the realness of that process. I felt Adams' passion in the way he cooked, tasted and attempted to add his genius spin on the dishes!The story was deep, but I feel that the characters could have developed more. I was curious as to what happens between Helene and Adam Jones. There could have been a beautiful touch to that story. Though I loved the movie, I feel with a few tweaks here and there it could've been Oscar material.",Burnt
151,audiomixer8,"So MUCH Potential and really great acting in a badly messed up, frustrating movie made worse by cheap and lazy DVD producers!!!",3,18 June 2016,"I normally enjoy every movie Bradley Cooper is in a lot. And I wanted to like this one, but Burnt is one of the most frustrating movies I have ever seen! The acting is very good throughout, and the story is interesting, but the script in many parts is just confusing, while the bad editing and directing muddles things even more. The worse problems with this movie, though, happened during the mastering of the DVD...(Keep in mind that I have a very good surround system and OPPO blu-ray player, and I normally do not have to adjust anything for all the levels to be perfect during movies, BUT) ...1. I had to raise the level of the center channel speaker up from -1 to +3.5 just to be able to hear what the actors were saying, because the music was absolutely blaring from the front left and right speakers. That never happens. And even after turning the center channel WAY UP, the dialogue was muffled with really low treble, just muddy and muffled, while the music was bright, clear, deep, and loud as any music could be. 2. I have been watching TV shows and movies from England since I was in High School in the 1970s, starting with Monty Python's Flying Circus, up to Doc Martin most recently. Plus, I love accents from all over the world, and can talk to just about anybody, but I am not exaggerating when I say that there were many lines spoken in this movie, in English, that I could not understand at all, because some of the actors kept mumbling their lines!! 3. A great many lines in this movie were spoken in French, and INSTEAD OF English SUBTITLES translating from French to English, the LAZY producers of this DVD chose to merely type, ""SPEAKING FRENCH"" for the subtitles EVERY TIME someone stands there speaking French, no matter how LONG they stand there speaking French!!! That was the last straw. So my conclusion is that no matter how much you want to... It is IMPOSSIBLE to enjoy this movie!!",Burnt

It's a movie you'll probably forget rather soon (not that I'm going to forget Bradley Cooper, lol), but it's really fun during your stay in the cinema. The topic is well known story about the person who reaches the stars too young (enjoying drugs, alcohol, women) and than crashes with a burst (hint:french mafia) and then starts all over again trying not to repeat the mistakes made in the past.

153,smaxmo,Will sizzle and fire be replaced by boiled and painted?,5,2 November 2015,"Ironically, this movie is a classic case of great ingredients being ruined by a lack of stunning storytelling. As gorgeous as Bradley Cooper and Sienna Miller are, I found the movie anti-climatic in every way. This is in spite of the sensual descriptions of culinary copulation spilling from Cooper's lovely lips. Movies (foodie movies in particular) in my humble opinion are a perfect balance of show, tell and smell. They should satisfy a little part of you, yet leave you hungry and yearning for more. They should captivate the eye, the ear and the imagination, this movie did not. I did not crave the food, I did not long for the romance shared by the couple, and I did not feel excited about the down-played triumph. It was set in London and even London was underwhelming and distant in this jerk-about film. This movie experience was like being served an overcooked Turbot drowning in an undeveloped Brown Butter Sauce with way too many capers, and knowing that the chef had to be aware. All of the good stuff (relationship, location, motivation, fantasy, and creativity) must have found itself on the cutting room floor. Even the lovely and immensely talented Emma Thompson could not save this overly complicated dish from ruin. Sorry,I really wanted to love it. With all of that said, it may be that I am somewhat jaded by the idea of (spoiler alert) French cooking being asserted as passé. Perhaps my lack of connection with the movie is because like, silk lined wool trousers, Brooks Brothers Cashmere Cardigans, Beluga caviar and single malt scotch; As a late bloomer, I am only now in a place in life where I can understand, enjoy and yes,afford these classic pleasures. The minimalist artsy staging approach to gastronomy that may be the way of Now, is not appealing to me. Maybe for desert where less is more, but my plea to culinary prodigies is this, please do not mess with Haute Cuisine; it took a long time for me to get here, and I am still savoring my amuse buche.",Burnt

158,keltripp,"Very engaging, but editing errors noted",7,31 October 2015,"This movie kept me entertained throughout. A warning: The language is constantly abrasive and not for tender ears. Not being familiar with the plot, it kept me guessing at first. There is no explanation of Adam's situation, but then a few minutes in, after the fight with Michel, their conversation lays out most what he is about. The dialogue was odd and to me, didn't seem believable considering the situation, but it got the point across.Bradley Cooper plays an egotistical know-it-all very well. Just as with Silver Linings Playbook he convincingly plays a troubled soul, and he is gorgeous and so easy to watch in the process.The biggest issue for me in the film is the inconsistency in editing. In the scene at Burger King, Helene's (Sienna Miller) hair was tucked in her hat at least three different ways throughout the whole scene. The takes were close ups and it was hard to miss and glaringly obvious if you are watching intently. Also, in another scene after Adam had been beaten up and had blood on his face, the blood was magically gone from one minute to the next. With so many hundreds of thousands of dollars and more than one person watching the finished product before release, it boggles the mind that such sloppiness is accepted.Aside from the technical issues, overall the movie was enjoyable, somewhat believable, and it definitely made me wonder more about what goes on behind the scenes in restaurant kitchens. It convinced me that personalities (and egos) such as Gordon Ramsay are likely the norm in this industry.",Burnt

I also enjoyed the mysterious past of Adam(Bradley) which was chasing him for the hole movie.

The way they shot the film was different from other Hollywood movies, very refreshing and new to me. Elegant and smooth, with matching soundtrack to enjoy the crisp clear image. The presentation of every dish in the movie were perfectly executed. The story line itself is a little bit lacking. There's not much life lessons or anything significant to take from it. The ending was a bit abrupt. There are also parts missing where they could have taken some flash backs to the characters' past leading up to the movie, and made it longer. Personally, I think the casting is perfect.

Definitely a game changer for his career after being unimpressed with him in hangover or wedding crashes.If you have a passion for anything i think you'll like this film, it simply displays every aspect of what people go through when they're putting everything in their being into something, when it's all in, all or nothing, life and death.9/10.

But the truth is I felt it was far away from being scrumptious. Bradley Cooper's acting was not bad I should say, but it was just hard to love the character who was like an active volcano. Even at the end of the movie, I still feel he is gonna erupt anytime. The movie gave me the feeling that it wanted to touch on something but it never really reached there. There is always some distance between what it wants to tell and what it tells. Just like the part about Adam's history in Paris, I eagerly wanted to know how terrible it went all throughout the movie, but in the end I only got the impression it was pretty ugly. Some flashbacks might have helped. And what's the point of the language change? The intermittent use of French didn't add to the plot of the movie. It only gave a frail point that they used to live in Paris. And that's it.The only scene I liked is the birthday cake Adam made for Helene's daughter.

As a food film, the shots of food, cooking, and discussions about food are not at all honest or pleasurable. Pointless film, overall.

174,bazilio-75429,Not real chef,1,28 November 2020,"I have been working in the culinary area over 6 years in North America. I can say that maybe only 5% from the movie scenario can be true and can happen in the real kitchen.
To begin with, two very fake things are a behaviour of the chef and when cooks cleaning the kitchen after a shift. There is different type of employees like dishwashers, night cleaners who are doing this job. A real chef will NEVER EVER TOUCH anyone in the kitchen, especially female. It is a physical assault and he can be fired regardless his culinary reputation.
Also, it was funny when that young guy with a girl wake up and Cooper cooked Bouillabaisse and some meat for them :)
First of all, nobody cook food which served for dinner at the morning. And you need a lot of ingredients for a fish soup or Escargot, I don't think that you can find any of them in the home fridge. Also, chefs are tired of cooking and believe or not, don't cook at home. So it is stupid when you see a chef with Michelin stars meets with Bouillabaisse at the morning a young guy with his girlfriend.
Also, small things: You NEVER try how sharp is a chef's knife with your finger. If it is really sharp you can cut yourself right away. You NEVER use a metal fork to scramble eggs in the nonstick pan (it is suppose to be a wooden or plastic spatula). The chefs in real restaurants NEVER throw plates in the wall. Some of them can shout on you or ask to look at them (eye contact) just to bring something to your attention. ""Yes chef"" is real too.
Chefs NEVER make any food which is out of menu like desert cakes unless it is a daughter of president sitting in the dinning room. They don't cook it primarily because it is time consuming",Burnt

It's the same movie that every other actor has done at least once in their career. The lead is arrogant, chip on their shoulder, lacks social skills, loner by choice... There is sexual tension with opposite sex (usually) supporting character. This tension helps the lead start to let down their guard. Something happens that upsets the lead so bad they are worse than every before. Then the lead has a mental break down. The opposite sex character helps pick them up. Usually at that same time the sexual tension is broken. The lead makes peace with their demons from the past. Voila!! He/she is no longer an angry prick but a lovable person with great social skills.

This is not something that we humans typically do by choice, but something we do nonetheless because of factors that we do not control. Cooper finds a way to embody this concept very shortly after having staged an immense character recreation in American Sniper, a feat that is not to be underestimated.The supporting cast is also phenomenal and helps carry us quite realistically through a story that teaches about the rigors on the back stages of the great kitchens in the world. The end result for me was the truth that attempting a second path to greatness will almost certainly not follow the same route as the first. Many of us never get a second chance, but this film tells us why there is merit in the effort.For those that are younger or have yet to experience a fall from grace, this story may ring for you in a different way, or if nothing else, explain why the culinary arts are a vehicle for passage through both heaven and hell simultaneously. Enjoy it with a fine wine and open mind. Salut!",Burnt
189,jessemaas93,Must see for people who love cooking,8,4 January 2016,"Despite some pretty bad reviews I think it's a pretty strong movie. Especially for people who love to cook of like high-end dining, it's a great movie. Burnt gives an excellent look in the world of high- end dining and professional kitchens. Bradley Cooper puts on a good performance and makes the experience very real. The evolution his character makes may be a little predictable, but I think that's not a bad thing. You should not underestimate the acting skills of Bradley Cooper. The character is written for him in my opinion. Also the character that's played by Daniel Brühl, Tony, is an interesting one and I think that Daniel performs this role outstandingly. Tony is a very proper and tight man, but his character evolves during the movie into a very pleasant one. Brühl makes his character very real with the accent and a particular way he moves in. The plot of the movie may be a little predictable, but that's not a problem. I think all the roles are filled in nicely and all of the characters make the story into a real experience, not only about cooking but also about the difficult world of a Michelin-star restaurant. Summarized I can say this movie is a must-see for people who love cooking and things like that. It's not a mind-blowing story, but in combination with some great acting it makes the movie worth watching. An average of 6,7 is way to low for this movie in my opinion.",Burnt
190,ninad-naim,Could have been a master piece,3,28 July 2020,"I wouldn't wanna fine dine at a high class restaurant, where they don't wear hats, touches their face during cooking and dips their finder in the gravy and taste it then roughly wipes it on their apron and touches the food again with the same finger and tastes it and does that few more times. What to serving for 3 stars? Meat with Chef's saliva? So unrealistic.",Burnt
191,doug951,"Awful,awkward script",2,3 September 2016,"Let me get this out of the way: Food movie reviews with food metaphors are cliché. I know. But if any movie ever deserved to be served a cliché pie in the face it is this one.I'll keep it simple. The script for this film is a huge ball of corn drizzled with stewed, steaming, bullshit*t and too-clever, dried flowery language crumpled on top. Nobody...NOBODY...EVER...talks like the people in this film talk.The dialog used solely for exposition and character introduction is cookie-cutter cute.What were all these A-list actors eating when they read this goop to poison their judgement enough to get them to agree to climb onto this compost pile?",Burnt
192,viniciusdias,waste of time and money,1,21 September 2018,"A low budget copy of chefs table from netflix, with this cast we deserve a better quality movie... Looks like a corporative video or an ad for a chefs something tv show. Waste of time.",Burnt
193,greganicich,Extremely entertaining,8,6 December 2020,"People say this movie is a predictable cookie cutter movie, that may be partly true, but I still felt this was a great movie. Acting on point, very unique setting of the upscale restaurant scene. Plot twists and tension throughout",Burnt
194,idanron,Perfect !,10,23 October 2015,"The best Chef/Food/Culinary film of all time ! Perfectly made,very exciting,great photography and unusual game of the actor Bradley Cooper The film shows in the best way and precise the life of a chef. Its amazing to see how true this is. Everything is tasteful, stunning photography and images, the experience in the kitchen, the music, the colors, a lot of emotion conveyed through the cooking experience. Comedy brilliantly integrated into the film, both Exciting and funny together. It is highly recommended to all cooking lovers. the film has given me a great inspiration. With lots of interesting French cooking techniques. In my opinion, this is the best movie released for this year.I enjoyed every minute of it!",Burnt
195,jlvickers,Bradley Cooper is brilliantly convincing!,10,31 October 2015,"Definitely worth seeing if you enjoy fine dining, haute cuisine, or are simply a Bradley Cooper fan. Convincing performances by a great cast. Cooper is brilliant and continues to reveal the depth of his talent. Burnt offers a unique perspective and behind the scenes peek into professional kitchens, which I found fascinating and gave me a new appreciation for the demands, artistry, and creative genius of great chefs. The message on the need for professional counseling and support for someone whose life has self-destructed through substance abuse was in balance. Watching Cooper's character struggle to start anew while still afraid to face his demons is a story line relevant to many. Excellent movie!",Burnt
196,maggiemick-98711,Good movie for foodies,8,11 November 2015,"I went to see this movie with my boyfriend who is a sous chef. We both enjoyed it, however in my opinion it is definitely a movie for the foodies. It takes a true appreciation of the culinary arts to fully enjoy this movie, so I can see why some people may not like/appreciate it. I don't think Bradley Cooper was the best choice for the role but his performance was good. I'm glad movies about chefs are becoming popular. The great ones are so undervalued in our society and put in so much time and effort into their careers.Hats off to the writers, producers, and studios who aren't afraid to show the passion of great chefs on the big screen. Keep 'em comin!",Burnt
197,kbadert,Pleasantly surprised is an understatement,10,3 January 2016,"I'm confused why this movie had poor reviews but movies such as 'Chef,' which I also enjoyed, did so well. Great pace and enjoyable. Will definitely be telling my father (my movie confidant) to watch! Compared to some of the other recent films I've seen this was awesome :-)My husband and I enjoyed the film and it's one I wouldn't mind owning to watch again. I liked the plot and there were a few times I was really wondering what was going to happen next. I thought that when we took a break half way through that there must be something wrong with the ending but it did not disappoint. The only critique I could possibly have is that I'm terrible at understanding accents so I had to really focus on the dialogue. I actually created an IMDb account solely to write this review because I felt the film had been so poorly represented.",Burnt
198,philomenacrunk,Not sure why it's described as comedy,5,4 January 2016,"First of all- this film absolutely is NOT a comedy. Usually it's obvious where the 'laughs' are meant to be, despite whether or not you find it comical, but in this film we couldn't even figure out what was supposed to be funny. Apart from Bradley Cooper being cast as a Michelin-star chef of course; that in itself is hysterical. He's about as convincing as a giraffe wearing dark sunglasses trying to get into a polar bear's only golf club- it just doesn't work. He's referred to as'the best' in the business but it's Sienna Miller's character who tells him he needs to use some new-fangled equipment and he agrees even though he's only met her about twice and she's a sous chef so beneath him in the hierarchy of a kitchen. If he was such a genius surely he'd be using this equipment anyway! To be fair to Bradley he plays an arrogant moron very well and that aspect of him is convincing. His French friend is in love with him and when he tells him some good news he (Bradley Cooper) kisses him on the lips; knowing he is in love with him and then gives him some weird come-to-bed eyes to top it off! Just unnecessary you silly chef scoundrel, now he'll never get over you! It's watchable but NOT funny.",Burnt
199,jetungnnifer,Awesome,10,27 January 2016,"I saw a lot of bad reviews but after I saw it, I absolutely fell in love with this movie. Maybe it's because I've been quite interested in the culinary career as a whole but I thought the movie was quite emotional, realistic, and witty. I really suggest people to watch it for themselves. Also, there were comments on how the culinary part in the movie were not the focus. I actually think that it's intended so. The whole movie is about the abandonment of perfectionism and self-dependent to work and love in a group and family. The core message of this movie is NOT actually about cooking, it's about love, in every way. I love it.",Burnt
200,beatsofazul,Complacency as its best,4,22 April 2016,"This is not a bad movie. This is not good either.American people don't have to speak french every ten minutes, while they are in a London restaurant and they have absolutely no reason to do so. It deserves the movie.Music is the worst thing of this movie. I had to fast forward a few moments.The cinematographer did okay, maybe he's the most aware of what a movie should look like.They should have paid a trip in France instead of investing all their money in Bradley Cooper. He does well ; but the whole movie doesn't really deliver what it meant to. It lost itself into complacency, into contemplation of itself. The end is botched, the love story behind doesn't have any savior : but the beauty of all the cooking, and the attention paid to how the food has to look like, and to the restaurant routines, makes this film enjoyable.It won't really entertain you, but you will surely enjoy cooking aesthetics.",Burnt
201,cjv-03226,Brilliant! Cooper makes the movie very real!,10,31 December 2016,"Forget the negative reviews, this film is amazing! As a Chef, I can say that this movie brings the reality of the kitchen to the customers.It's important to know that Burnt is nothing like the movie Chef. Don't get me wrong, Chef is a great, funny movie, however it doesn't show the stress, the violence, the harmony that a real kitchen does. That's where this movie shines! Bradley Cooper plays a two Michelin star chef who out for redemption as he opens up a new restaurant. Well I can confidently say that the movie is quite accurate! A lot of Chefs are very easy to set off when they are mad, one of my instructors that I had in school was the same way, countless times he would start swearing and yelling, once he even took a saute pan outside and repeatedly slam it against the wall. Other times I've seen an executive chef hop on different stations to make sure everything was being done right. The scene where Cooper flings the plates down the pass and onto the floor? Yup I've seen things like that happen too! So this movie really covers all the bases. So if you're not a fan of coarse language (and I mean this film is dripping with expletives) or if you want a more family, fun-filled movie, you're better off sticking to Chef (not to be mean).The movie does have an interesting story too. While it doesn't focus too much on the chef's back story, we get the idea that the pressure got to him and he fell apart. Watching him return to his former glory is what really makes this film great.When it comes down to it, Burnt is not trying to be some big grand adventure, it's not trying to sugarcoat what the kitchen is like... It's giving you realism, the nitty gritty, and that's what makes it so great in my opinion. Bradley Cooper's role as the head chef is executed wonderfully. As a chef, it makes me happy to see that there's a movie that really shows what our job is like. I'd recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see how a kitchen really works. Whether you're a chef, really interested in cooking, or just want a new view on it then Burnt is definitely a movie you should watch! But in the end, it really comes down to personal taste!",Burnt
202,lindasrum,It will make you hungry!,8,5 June 2018,"The script and brilliant acting summarise Burnt. You just want to spend time with Emma Thompson, drink wine with Daniel Brühl and eat Bradley Coopers food. The storyline is not to heavy or to light, just perfect!",Burnt
203,sashaandelkovic,Great movie,10,4 November 2018,"Loved this movie, great character building and story line, as a good lover it told a great story about passion for cooking and how life isn't always so simply",Burnt
