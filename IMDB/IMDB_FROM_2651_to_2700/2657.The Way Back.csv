0,SnoopyStyle,strip down Affleck,6,26 November 2020,"Jack Cunningham (Ben Affleck) is an alcoholic construction worker separated from his wife Angela (Janina Gavankar) after a devastating tragedy. He is convinced to coach his alma mater Catholic high school Bishop Hayes basketball team. It's the site of his greatest glory where he threw away his potential and started a descent into addiction.As a sports underdog story, this is very standard and straight forward. The most non-standard aspect of that happens at the end when it stops short. It's also very stripped down. The kids would normally get more screen time. Only one kid gets a functional character progression. Mostly, this is compelling for Ben Affleck playing a struggling alcoholic and director Gavin O'Connor trying to strip him down to the studs. My only complaint about his part is that he needs to show his self-destructiveness more overtly in the beginning. He should start in a bad place and then recover over the movie until he starts backsliding. It doesn't need to be a mystery.",The Way Back
1,nogodnomasters,Can you hear me now?,5,28 April 2020,"Jack Cunnigham (Ben Affleck) works construction and loves canned drinks, perhaps too much. He was a basketball player who has been asked to come back to high school and coach. We watch him swear at the kids and drink. He has anger and sorrow over a lost son and now a separated wife seeing a rich guy. The characters were not that great and we wait for the moment he realizes he has an alcohol problem and turns his life around. The event happens with 12 minutes of film left and doesn't do the film justice.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",The Way Back
2,classicsoncall,"""I never stopped being angry.""",7,23 October 2020,"This film will not be taking any major awards, but I found myself being drawn in by it's simplicity. An alcoholic seeking redemption with basketball as a backdrop was also the subject of the 1986 film ""Hoosiers"", but it was there more as a sub-plot to the principal story. Ben Affleck was effective here in his role as Jack Cunningham, and it's not evident at first why he's as angry as he is, often ending his evenings being helped home from the local gin mill by a loyal friend who did the same for his father. The family dynamic of his childhood came into play, but even more so, the loss of a child leading to the breakup of his marriage was highly instrumental for his seeking solace in a bottle. The coaching job he was offered by the administrators of Bishop Hayes High School helped Jack discover a side of himself that proved beneficial for members of the team, although things reached a point with his drinking and cursing that eventually forced Father Edward (John Aylward) to take a disciplined stand. As much as one roots for Jack's success though, the film ends inconclusively with a number of threads left hanging, thereby thwarting closure for the viewer. Jack doesn't really win his battle with alcoholism, doesn't get rehired as coach, or reach any sort of understanding with his estranged wife, thus leaving the viewer to use one's own imagination as to where his life goes next. I would have preferred a more definitive ending, even if that meant setting aside a feel good resolution.",The Way Back
3,ferguson-6,Affleck in his element,7,5 March 2020,"Greetings again from the darkness. So much beer and booze. It would be easy to classify this latest from writer-director Gavin O'Connor as a sports movie. After all, he has given us two excellent ones in MIRACLE (2004) and WARRIOR (2011). However, as with those two films, there is much more going on here. This is about grief and addiction, and the difficulties in mending a life in tatters.Jack Cunningham likes his morning shower. It helps get him prepare for a day of construction work and get over a late night of drinking. What's unusual about his morning routine is that he drinks a beer while taking his morning shower, and then fills his Yeti with gin as he takes his post at the building site. Jack is played by Ben Affleck, who has returned to the screen with a serious acting gig after his fling as Batman. Of course, anyone who even casually keeps up with Hollywood gossip knows Mr. Affleck and his character here have in common a drinking problem. In fact, the actor filmed this immediately after his latest rehab stint. It's quite possible that the collision of real life and fiction explain why this is Affleck's best performance in many years (at least since HOLLYWOODLAND in 2006). He re-teams here O'Connor, who directed him in THE ACCOUNTANT (2016).Jack is a former high school basketball star whose life has turned out much differently than expected. His construction job is beating him down, alcohol abuse is slowly destroying him, and he recently split with his wife Angela (Janina Gavankar) after a tragedy. Has he hit rock bottom? It's likely he thinks so. As happens so often in life, an opportunity presents itself. The head Priest at his former catholic high school asks him to step in as basketball coach after the current coach has a heart attack. The team is terrible, and has been that way since Jack graduated 25 years ago. After a painful-to-watch evening of decision-making, Jack accepts the job.As you would expect, it's a team of misfits who have little concept of teamwork. Affleck excels as a coach who evaluates the talent he has and devises a strategy to not only improve individual player performance, but also inject the philosophies of teamwork and cohesion and commitment. He does this with the help of Algebra teacher slash Assistant Coach Dan (Al Madrigal, ""I'm Dying Up Here""), who appreciates what Jack brings to the position, but is also protective of the boys and the school mission.Jack manages to stay sober while coaching, but we see how fine that line is for an addict. Life suddenly rears up and plops an emotional situation that is simply too much form him to handle. It's here when we realize that while it appeared coaching the team gave Jack a glimmer of hope for a better life, it also allowed him to ignore the personal issues and relationships that had driven him to the bottle. The basketball scenes are the most fun to watch, but it's the realistic life elements that elevate the story. It's excruciating to watch Jack re-telling glory days stories to his 'buddies' at the local neighborhood bar, only to be helped home by the same old man who used to carry his father home from the same bar. The perpetuation of misery is a story that is all too relatable for many.Jack's good qualities are evident when he's prodding ultra-quiet point guard Brandon (Brandon Wilson) into taking on a leadership role and thinking of his future, but that's contrasted with his inconsiderate treatment of his sister Beth (Michaela Watkins) and Father Mark (Jeremy Radin), the team/school Chaplain. It's the two sides of Jack that so clearly resonate with those who have experienced addiction. This is a guy who botched his college/basketball opportunity, but managed to build a new life, only to have it snatched away in the cruelest way possible. It's imperative that he come to grips with all of that in some place other than the bottom of a beer mug.The outstanding screenplay comes from Brad Ingelsby (OUT OF THE FURNACE, 2013), and with director O'Connor and the cast, the film has a throwback to the 70's feel ... gritty and realistic. This is not the smirking, strutting stud we are accustomed to seeing with Affleck. He seems immersed in the role and brings an understanding to the struggles, the rehab, and the importance of a support system. Redemption played a huge part in the classic HOOSIERS (1986) and most every other rag-tag sports team in movies, and THE WAY BACK shows us there really is no going back ... instead, we must deal with life in order to move on.",The Way Back
4,bombersflyup,Should have been better.,4,28 March 2020,"The Way Back is disappointing, the basketball's poorly handled and cliched, but also put to the side for the sake of drama, that in itself dull and unrewarding.I have many problems with the basketball aspects of the film, even though that doesn't turn out to be the focal point. I like the initial bit of giving nothing easy and having pride in your performance, but mostly all you see in the game play's shot after shot being made, unless the coach just said to double team their star player, then it's miss miss miss. You can't turn around a team from being smashed every game to making the playoffs, by simply changing game style. They need talent to begin with, even the greatest coach won't have any success without the cattle, and you need specific types of players to do that, which requires cutting players and getting new ones to suit your system and even then it will take time. Plus you're still going to get smashed on the boards and interior without any size. Not to mention your best player's going to be so tired pressing the whole game and doing everything offensively for the team as well.",The Way Back
5,deloudelouvain,One of the better movies with Ben Affleck.,7,3 June 2020,"I've never been a huge fan of Ben Affleck, just think he's an okay actor but nothing mesmerizing that I can remember, but in The Way Back he did a good job, probably one of his better performances to date. The story in The Way Back is a bit cliché, you have the team that never wins anything ending up winning again and that due to their new coach, it's a bit of a déjà vu. The coach played by Ben Affleck has other issues he tries to deal with and that's the best part of this story. It's an entertaining movie, even for non basketball fans. I watch basketball every now and then but never think about the tactics and that kind of stuff. In this movie it gets a bit tactical at times, but it's not the major point of the story so it stays entertaining for everybody. You can't really go wrong with this movie, good performances and a well written story.",The Way Back
6,Edvis-1997,8,8,23 July 2020,"It was pretty likeable movie. Plot was not overcrowded,easy too fallow, not difficult structure. Main idea is quite nice also. Actors did amazing job. Film is not something magical or amazing but still giving good vibes. Perfect for lazy night, very recommend. One of the best 2020 movies so far.",The Way Back
7,ThomasDrufke,Affleck Has Never Been Better,9,10 March 2020,"Ben Affleck gives the best performance of his career in The Way Back, in what should be a surprise to no one, as I don't think Tom Hardy or Joel Edgerton have ever been better than they were in Warrior, also directed by Gavin O'Connor. The film is a uniquely heartfelt and heartbreaking take on a sports movie, but more specifically a broken man who needs help getting back to loving himself and the life he's living. You think the film is going one way but it takes enough twists and turns to keep the audience engaged without betraying what the story is calling for. Quite simply, this film is excellent.9.0/10",The Way Back
8,Cineanalyst,The Little Things,6,27 December 2020,"It's the most impressive performance I've seen from Ben Affleck. I was weary going into seeing ""The Way Back,"" though, as it seemed to be just another movie about a coach/teacher improving their and the children's lives through sport/school. And, it is that. The resonance of Affleck's real-life struggles with alcoholism, however, reflected in his alcoholic-basketball-coach character raises this above many of these types of movies. Inevitably, he's given a supposed reason for his drinking, and there's the hitting-bottom moment--quite literally--but those earlier scenes of just a drunkard withdrawn from the world enough to almost seem functional despite sipping on beer in the shower and consuming until he passes out at night rings true.In this respect, Affleck's role somewhat reminds me of Judy Garland's image and her performance adjacent the character of her alcoholic husband in ""A Star Is Born"" (1954), even though the rest of the pictures are considerably different, and ""The Way Back"" isn't that great, or as affective as, say, Ben's brother Casey Affleck's turn in ""Manchester by the Sea"" (2016). Still, he should at least get an Oscar nomination, as his part is by the far the most compelling aspect of ""The Way Back.""One of those ""little things,"" as Affleck's coach instructs of his players, that I do appreciate here is that there's actually solid basketball strategy in the picture. Not being overly violent (as, say, American football, boxing, hockey, rugby), good exercise not involving a lot of standing around (baseball/cricket/softball, golf) and involving the regular scoring of points (as opposed to what the rest of the world calls football), basketball has long been my favorite sport. Anyways, yeah, if your team is smaller, your best chance is to press on defense and out-run the other team. I've seen too many sports movies where there's no discernable coherent strategy to the game--just a lot of ""play better"" stuff (how?) and the coach breaking down and getting through to the star player (yeah, OK, that's in this one, too). It's a little thing, and for much of the picture basketball is peripheral, but it's the little things that give ""The Way Back"" an edge over a field of many such generic drug-problem and sports movies.",The Way Back
9,851222,A nice sports and character study movie,7,13 August 2020,"Greetings from Lithuania.""The Way Back"" (2020) is a nice little character study as well as sports drama. In this case its basketball, but really you could change this sport to any it still would work out for this movie, because its more about character. And at the end of the day after everything was revealed i liked what i was but i wasn't blown away - there are way to many movie like this and i saw many of them - this one does not surprise them but its not bad at all either. Also worth mentioning is a performance by Ben Affleck which was very good.Overall, as a one who saw many character study movies i liked this one but it was a bit to predictable. Also strong alcoholism is not a disease which you can cure that easily by saying few good sentences. Other then that its a pretty good movie.",The Way Back
10,UniqueParticle,Incredibly well done,9,6 March 2020,"Such a riveting performance from Ben Affleck!

11,Thanos_Alfie,Not just another basketball movie...,6,1 August 2020,"""The Way Back"" is a Drama - Sport movie in which we watch a former basketball player starting coaching his old team while he is trying to fight his addiction to alcohol.I liked this movie very much because it was not just another basketball movie but much more. I found very interesting the plot of the movie and the direction which was made by Gavin O'Connor was very good and he presented very well the problems of the main character, his relationships and friendships, and also his character. Regarding the interpretations of the cast, I have to admit that Ben Affleck who played as Jack Cunningham was simply amazing and I believe that his interpretation made this movie so good. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Al Madrigal's who played as Dan and Jeremy Radin's who played as Father Mark Whelan. Finally, I have to say that if you know some things about the real life of Ben Affleck you will easily understand that ""The Way Back"" is not just another movie for him but much more.",The Way Back
12,cruise01,Great performances led by Ben Affleck but so so sports drama.,7,21 May 2020,"The Way Back (3.5 out of 5 stars).The Way Back is a pretty fair sports drama film. About Jack (Ben Affleck) who blew his future in his high school basketball team. He suffered losses and is struggling with alcoholism. He tries to redeem himself by coaching his high school basketball team.Ben Affleck is great with his performance. Some powerful emotions with his character as he is struggling. The movie overall drama was decent. I felt like the film was trying to build an inspirational emotional buildup with Jack and his team. The script was undeveloped in building that connection. Its a slow, quiet moving drama. Focusing on Ben Afflecks redemption with the character which was good.",The Way Back
13,zkonedog,"Boilerplate Sports Cliches, But Still Works Well Enough",7,8 March 2020,"One of the problems with making inspirational sports movies these days is that all the cliches almost inherent in the genre have been used over and over again. Heck, the fact that ""Hoosiers"" simply exists is a strike against every basketball flick. So in a film like ""The Way Back"", it is drawing from an emotional well that has been plumbed numerous times before. With that being said, however, the performances and general clear-headed nature of the experience allow it to works well enough to be entertaining. While not a classic by any means, it isn't a bad film by any stretch either.For a very basic overview, ""The Way Back"" tells the story of Jack Cunningham (Ben Affleck), an alcoholic with no direction in life, both separated from wife Angela (Janina Gavankar) and mourning the tragic death of his young son. One day, Jack gets a call from his high school alma mater, which needs a fill-in basketball coach. Jack once starred for that team in his ""glory days"", so he decides to accept the position, only to be faced with a rather hapless squad while still trying to conquer those personal demons at the same time.Like I said, this entire experience is one sports cliche after another. Alcoholic finds purpose in life again through sports. Ragtag group of athletes improves after ""playing tougher"". Team captain exhibiting personal growth. They are all here. What Brad Ingelsby's screenplay does in a unique fashion, though, is let the viewer slowly puzzle out just why Jack is so far gone into the bottle when first met.For example, initially Jack tells someone he has ""no kids"" and is ""single"". Yet, we later learn he is technically separated (not even officially divorced) from Angela, and they indeed had a son who died young. So whereas Jack can initially be seen through a lens of disgust, the slow reveal of these facts skews more towards a certain kind of pity.""The Way Back"" makes its share of mistakes, too. While Jack's personal story ultimately concludes with a nice arc, his relationship with the players he coaches is so heavily boilerplate-material that it doesn't work as well. That's why a 7/10 ranking is about as high as I'd ever go for a film like this. But at the end of the day, it does enough things right (most notably Affleck's convincing portrayal) to warrant going no lower than that 7/10 either.",The Way Back
14,Floated2,Solid underdog sports drama we have seen before,7,16 December 2020,"Relatively a simple yet complex drama about an alcoholic whom becomes coach of his former high school basketball team. The story arc and how things play out are relatively predictable as in we know there will be a certain amount of drama which occurs and things will go sour, but overall the acting by Ben Affleck is really good and the journey of the character is worth the watch.Many have compared the Way Back to Coach Carter and while there are certain similarities, this film has a more focused energy on the lead character, while Coach Carter seems more ""MTV-esque"".As we know with these underdog sports films, first there are the downs then eventually the team gets better and coach gets more focused and happy. A happy ending was quite obvious, perhaps they could have went with a twist.",The Way Back
15,eddie_baggins,A career best performance from Affleck helps The Way Back achieve dramatic highs,8,14 April 2020,"Director Gavin O'Connor is on the record stating that his newest feature The Way Back is a drama with basketball in it, rather than a basketball film with some drama in it, so for those seeking a staple sporting flick, The Way Back may leave them disappointed in what it can offer them.What else The Way Back is, is arguably the finest showcase yet for its star Ben Affleck, who after much publicized battles with alcoholism confronts his demons head on in his role as depressed and volatile one time basketball prodigy turned divorced alcoholic Jack Cunningham, who takes up a job coaching his old high school's basketball team, in what could be a life changing opportunity.Affleck is as raw and believable as his ever been as Cunningham, a man whose history and circumstances slowly make themselves more apparent as the run-time of the film wears on in what culminates in a fully-rounded character that we can't help but feel empathy towards.The Way Back might not be as solid overall as O'Connor's previous sport centred masterpiece Warrior but much like that film and O'Connor's well liked hockey drama Miracle, The Way Back's in-tune dealings with moments of humanity, vulnerability and emotional dealings ensures this is top notch dramatic film-making.As his done in past times, O'Connor manages to handle clichés of the genres his dealing with in proficient and meaningful ways and this is evident across The Way Back's narrative as some of it falls completely in line with what you expect of a redemption story such as this but many elements are subverted also, as Cunningham's journey is anything but a clear cut and predictable one as his mental state of mind and addiction fuel the story forward into unexpected territories.Throughout all of this Affleck remains front and centre throughout the entirety of the film, at times some scenes are almost hard to watch when you consider the actors personal circumstances but through his first hand dealings with a potentially life threatening illness, Affleck has been able to bring a stunning realism and emotional connection to his role here, enhanced further by Brad Ingelsby's script and one of the year's best scores courtesy of Rob Simonsen.Final Say -Not the sporting film many might be expecting, The Way Back takes us into an emotionally charged study of one man's battle's to overcome his weaknesses that takes us to a memorable destination, that is at all times lead forward by an awards worthy performance from Ben Affleck.4 concerned chaplains out of 5",The Way Back
16,damianphelps,Honest Movie,8,13 November 2020,"This is one of Ben Affleck's greatest achievements in film. It is a high quality piece that provides sorrow, pain, love, loss, hope, fun and happiness and achieves this without feeling like you are showering in sentimentality.Whilst this is buried in a sports movie, the sports (whilst telling its on tale) is not the number one focus here and as the movie progresses you are slowly exposed to what is really going on.The pacing is great, never boring and allows time for a little contemplation.Another aspect I really enjoyed is that it is an honest movie it doesn't shy away from difficult emotions, yes it could have gone much deeper into the pain, but I think it finds a nice balance.Well done to all involved :)",The Way Back

That's the sports part of the movie.But there is a lot of (bleak) slowburning drama as well. Look at the poster. Ben Affleck looks depressed and he is. In this story Ben Affleck has lost his wife, his son has died and he has lost every dream or hope he has ever had. He only drinks himself into oblivion to numb his pain.

19,paul-allaer,Worthwhile checking out for Ben Affleck's performance,6,9 March 2020,"""The Way Back"" (2020 release; 108 min.) brings the story of Jack. As the movie opens, we see Jack at work at a construction site. On his way home after work, he starts drinking heavily, ending up at what seems to be his usual hangout neighborhood bar. The next day Jack spends Thanksgiving with his mom and his sister and her family. Then one day he gets a call out of the blue: his high school is looking for a replacement basketball head coach. The school hasn't made the playoffs since Jack played and starred in the mid-90s, and has been outright terrible as of late. Jack reluctantly accepts. At this point we are less than 15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this movie marks the reunion of director Gavin O'Connor and actor Ben Affleck, following their 2016 ""The Accountant"" collaboration. Here we get really two stories in one film: the (fictional) Bishop Hayes HS basketball team, and Jack's alcoholism. At times these two stories intersect but frankly not all that often. It's really two separate films joined together. Want to guess which of the two is the more interesting story? Of course it is Jack's alcoholism. Ben Affleck's own bouts with alcohol abuse are well documented, so for him to play this part is not only bold but also shrewd (no additional research needed for this role!). His performance is what makes this film worth checking out, period. But why is it that Jack is dealing with raging alcoholism and correlating anger management issues? I'm not going to tell you of course, as the movie is plot heavy. Please note that this movie is in no way connected or related to the 2013 film ""The Way, Way Back"".""The Way Back"" opened wide this weekend. The Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended so-so (about 10-12 people), but the picture-perfect warm weather may have had some impact on that. If you like a HS basketball movie a la ""Hoosiers"" or a study of alcoholism, or simply are a fan of Ben Affleck, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",The Way Back
20,subxerogravity,Basketball saves lives!,8,9 March 2020,"It's a good movie. I can always count on Ben Affleck to give his all in all he does and the Way Back is no different. He was channeling something that clearly came off on the screen.
With that said the movie as a whole is not as spectacular as I thought it was going to be. A nice showcase of what a good actor Affleck can be, but it thought it would be more of a sports movie. Not that The Way Back is not the victorious story of a man at his lowest finding...the way back, with a game he has not thought about in years.

21,jtindahouse,A solid story that could've been better with a few tweaks,7,27 March 2020,"It's strange that in a movie that will likely be remembered mostly as a ""basketball movie"" the basketball aspect was probably the part of the film I enjoyed the least. I've always struggled with sporting comeback stories in film. I've played in a lot of sports teams over the years and I know they just don't happen - at least not in the way that films most often portray it. In professional sport, sure. The Washington Nationals this year went from one of the worst teams in the league to winning it all come the World Series. Similar to 'Moneyball' that's a story I can get behind, because they are professionals who are the best in the world at their sport and have things like trades available to them. But in terms of amateur sports, where a team admits to not even having a centre, it just doesn't happen I'm sorry to say. This didn't ruin the film for me, I was just far more invested in the other aspects of the story.It was clear in watching 'The Way Back' that this was a deeply personal film for Ben Affleck. He has had well publicised problems with alcohol addiction in the past. I like it when an actor is dealing with material very close to their heart. It always brings out the best in them. The film is pretty hard hitting in places, but never tries to ram down your throat the level of grief these characters might be suffering. I actually wouldn't have minded seeing it go a step further and really try to throw the knock-out blow to the audience.A couple of the kids on the basketball team are given some small character arcs along the way, but nothing major. I would've actually liked to see more of this. It feels like the progress the team makes isn't explained to us enough, and we are just meant to accept that it happened organically. I enjoyed 'The Way Back' but feel that with the material it had to work with it could have been even better.",The Way Back
22,JoBloTheMovieCritic,The Way Back,6,21 November 2020,6/10 - worthwhile basketball drama has weird pacing and an abrupt end,The Way Back
23,stevendbeard,"Grief, Depression, Alcoholism & Basketball",6,8 March 2020,"I saw ""The Way Back"", starring Ben Affleck-Justice League, Daredevil; Janina Gavankar-Blindspotting, True Blood_tv; Michaela Watkins-The Unicorn_tv, How To Be a Latin Lover and Al Madrigal-Night School, Wizards of Waverly Place_tv.
This is a movie about grief, depression and alcoholism with a little basketball action thrown in for good measure. Ben plays a man that spends his time drinking a lot. At first, you have no idea why-but you do learn the reasons, eventually. Janina plays his wife, who lives apart from Ben because of his drinking and Michaela plays Ben's sister, who is also concerned for Ben. When Ben was in high school, he was a star basketball player with a great future in the sport. But then, he suddenly quit playing. He just stopped and never played again-you learn the reasons for that later, too. Flash forward to the present, he is offered a job of coaching kids to play basketball at his old Alma mater because of his past at the school. Al plays the assistant coach of the less than great team-they have not won any games since Ben went to school there. Can Ben turn his life around and quit drinking? Can Ben turn the team around and win some basketball games? Can you predict how this movie will turn out? Ben does a pretty good alcoholic-I guess he drew on some personal experience for that one.
It's rated ""R"" for language and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 48 minutes.
It's not one that I would buy on DVD but if you are in the mood to see an actor poor his soul into the role-maybe for an Oscar?-you might like it enough to rent it.",The Way Back

27,masonfisk,MAYBE TOO FAMILIAR A STORY...!,6,6 August 2020,"Ben Affleck's latest is a touch too familiar & given his recent brushes w/the tabloids (about his falling off the wagon) a little too close to home. Affleck plays a once popular & respected high school basketball phenom who finds himself now older & a steel worker w/a heavy drinking problem. A phone call from out of the blue gives him a chance to sort his life in order when a request to coach his alma mater's team falls into his lap. At first hesitant (aren't they always!), he falls in line & soon finds he has a penchant for the position even bonding w/his assistant coach (played by comedian Al Madrigal) & a troubled player who has more talent than he shows. The past soon encroaches upon his present when his ex, played by Janina Gavankar (who I remember from the last season of Sleepy Hollow), reenters his life & soon brings his past troubles into focus. Not really embracing a traditional sports movie or a drama about an addict getting clean, this film, although shot well (by director Gavin O'Connor who reteams w/Affleck after their collab on The Accountant) & acted finely, this film doesn't bring anything new to the table that a well programmed After School special would tackle any given day of the week.

long enough to hold practice.There are lots of similar sports movies like ""The Way Back"". Moralistic stories about how a trainer manages to bring a floundering team to unprecedented heights. Preferably, the team consists of a few foul-mouthed hotheads who want to impress the others by acting tough. Usually, they have a talent for the sport they practice, but lack of discipline makes them miss constancy. To the annoyance of the appointed coach at that moment. Of course, they are allergic to any type of authoritarian behavior. Until the new coach comes up. Preferably an old sports star who can look back on a successful sports career and who comes to the rescue by using clever pedagogical techniques. First of all, he gives each of the team members a figurative kick in the butt. Suspends the most rebellious pain in the ass (who of course comes back crawling to ask if he can be re-included in the team because the sport is vital for him). Then the grueling training sessions begin in such a way that this bunch of misfits finally starts winning games and slowly propel them to stardom. You saw it in ""Coach Carter"", ""Slap Shot"" and to a lesser extent in ""Major League"". ""The Way Back"" follows this same scenario. Only here the coach is also struggling with his personal demons.I'm not a real Ben Affleck fan. Not that I think he's a bad actor. Maybe the movie choices he made were a bit unfortunate. With ""Daredevil"" as the most terrible career choice, in my opinion. But here Affleck shows that he does have acting talent. Perhaps personal life experiences are the reason why he was able to empathize with the role of coach Jack easily. A tormented person who lost everything after a tragic event and sought refuge in drinking. Something Affleck has experience with since he has already admired the inside of a rehabilitation center several times. Probably because of this that the scenes during which he carelessly drinks, look so realistic. As well as the way he behaves when he's not in a bar. The manipulation, the sneaking around, and the search for excuses. Typical behavior of an addict trying to hide his weakness. ""The Way Back"" tries to portray this addiction meticulously. If you see the umpteenth beercan disappear from the fridge while a spare one is already put in the freezer to stay cold, you as a viewer know that Jack is not a social drinker but a problem drinker with a fixed routine.Like many other film productions, ""The Way Back"" has been disadvantaged by the Corona pandemic. Had the original release date not been shifted from late 2019 to March this year, the damage would have been limited. Hence Warner Bross's decision to release this movie directly on various platforms such as iTunes and Prime video among others. Now, I myself don't consider it a requirement to watch ""The way back"" in a cinema. Apart from the admirable acting of Affleck, this film is nothing more than an average film that doesn't impress in terms of originality. It seems as if a pre-printed checklist has been used for this type of film. A group of young people with a wrong attitude and who, as a basketball team, wallows in the role of the underdog. Check! Ex basketball player whose life is in a downward spiral. Check! Miraculous revival of the despised basketball team. Check! Family tragedy that ruined the coach's life. Check! Obviously a relapse happens. Check! Once again a miraculous resurgence leading to a happy ending. Check! It feels like a three-pointer every time a check is placed on this list.In short. The film won't win a prize in the category of originality. The already well-trodden paths of previously released sports dramas are followed too carefully. But what Ben Affleck demonstrates here (and I know I'm repeating myself) makes that this movie effortlessly exceeds the average. Only the way and period in which he defeated his demons, felt romanticized. And finally, you should not confuse this film with the 2010 film of the same name about a Polish prisoner who could escape from a Russian gulag with some fellow sufferers. The only similarity the Ben Affleck film has with the latter is that the road followed by the group of young people is also full of obstacles. And giving up is also not an option. So if you run into it anywhere on a VOD channel, give it a try. It's not really a waste of time.",The Way Back

33,jadepietro,A Sporting Life,8,21 September 2020,"GRADE: BTHIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A predictable but entertaining comeback story about a basketball coach made more effective by an excellent performance by Ben Affleck.JIM'S REVIEW: Oh, the comeback tale. That story of downfall and redemption...always a good formula to follow for successful results and director Gavin O'Connor and screenwriter Brad Ingelby follow that to a T, or should I say, to a B, as in basketball, in their sports drama, The Way Back.Ben Affleck plays Jack, an alcoholic construction worker who was once a golden boy in those glory days of high school sports. Jack's life has taken a bit of a tumble since graduation. His championship season has long past him, so when the opportunity arises to coach a boy's basketball team from his old Catholic school, Jack ponders the possibility for another golden trophy and his chance at regaining his self-respect. He, of course, must shake off his demons and provide guidance and support to the boys, including a talented player named Brandon, who just happens to be black and poor. The stereotypes do dribble at regular intervals.All that said, this predictable film is well-made and engaging entertainment. Mr. O'Connor shrewdly balances the human drama and the sports scenes. He paces his film well and builds the right degree of tension on the court. The screenplay plays up the sports angle effectively while invoking the Catholicism mindset and small town persona to its advantage. In fact, the filmmakers and Mr. Affleck know of what they speak. They provide the needed authenticity about the game and the addiction which elevates the film to a more convincing level of realism. They still don't sidestep the melodramatic excesses, but the film wholeheartedly embraces its players and their stories.The cast is strong although the supporting characters as written, are sketchy and in need of more development . Al Madrigal, Janina Gavankar as Jack's loyal but frustrated ex-wife, Angela, and Michaela Watkins as Jack's sister offer fine support. Brandon Wilson as the star player of the team gives us a character for whom we can care. But it is the central role played by Mr. Affleck that anchors the film and delivers the film's primary impact. It's a sad but known fact that Mr. Affleck himself has been in and out of rehab for drug dependency, plus his sex and gambling issues. The actor has lived those days of affliction and he delivers a harrowing realistic portrayal about a man whose continued bouts with addiction are a common occurrence.The Way Back. never loses its way. It follows its well-trodden path to success, even if we have seen this all-too-familiar story time and time again. Still, it's always nice to see the good guys overcome their obstacles and win out, isn't it?",The Way Back

The VERDICT:The Way Back proves you can make a movie portraying pertinent issues with sports practice and not have the Hollywood effects drown it out. You just have to make sure you are expecting it. This film succeeds in the realism of portraying one man struggling to find his way back from a terrible time in life, but through work, patience, and support can get better. It accomplishes the inspirational story in a calmer manner and using the central focus of Affleck, whose acting brings this role to life, you will be pleased with the story presented. Yet, if you go in here looking for another sports film integrated with life lessons... you may disappointed. So many disjointed side plots get the realistic treatment of being haphazardly integrated and not fully fleshed out. It leads to uneven pacing for me, alongside underutilized secondary characters and the relationships that could have formed with the central character. The realism also seems to take the entertainment magic away, especially when it comes to the sports moments that you might be coming to see. Don't expect drawn out games and those heroic moments that you've become accustomed to my friends, because they are not here. As such, the final thing is that the inspirational tale is here for this film, but the problem is other movies have done this better like Remember the Titans, Miracle, and Hoosiers. Given all this though, if you want realistic acting and a tale of succeeding, then this guy suggests a visit to the theater, but otherwise hold out for home viewing on this one.My Scores are:Drama/Sport: 7.0

35,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of The Way Back,8,7 March 2020,"Jack Cunningham (played by art imitating life suitor Ben Affleck) is a former high school star basketball player turned construction worker. Jack is also a weary alcoholic who eventually takes a job as the head b-ball coach at his former Alma mater. That's the initial rub of 2020's non-sobering and dark turned, The Way Back. It's my latest review.Yup, I am announcing The Way Back as one of this year's best films (so far). After seeing it earlier today, I realized that not every basketball movie is completely about basketball. As Lester Burnham's desk sign painfully says, ""Look Closer"".Affleck's performance as ""Way Back's"" lead role is probably in his top three of all time (behind O'Bannion from Dazed and Confused and Jim Young from Boiler Room). Ben's work here is raw and unflinching, a sort of flask exorcising of his own personal demons (the real-life Affleck has supposedly dealt with alcoholism for most of his adult life).Directed by the guy responsible for The Accountant (Gavin O'Connor), shot mainly in grainy close-ups, and featuring dreary, Southern California as anything but paradise, ""Way Back"" is the type of film you'd get if you threw Leaving Las Vegas, 2012's Flight, and The Bad News Bears into a cinematic blender.Gavin O'Connor fashions The Way Back as a revealing character study with just a little shred of James Naismith thrown in. His style as a filmmaker is clean and streamlined, with a twist here, a detour there, and an admission you don't quite see coming.Some sports flicks are predictable (Glory Road, The Fighter), some sports flicks are bland (Remember the Titans, Cinderella Man), and some sports flicks are just plain awful (The Replacements, The Waterboy). The Way Back is not in any of these categories and that's why I dug it. It's a secretive PSA for any middle aged man who can't seem to lay off the sauce. ""Way Back"" is also O'Connor's directorial, redemption story set to the shadowy and most dirtied-up boroughs of LA. Rating: 3 and a half stars.",The Way Back

38,krocheav,The Way Back - Gets a Little Lost,4,17 July 2021,"Looking like it might have offered a different take on an old theme this one just misses the mark. As a study of alcoholism, it comes near to saying something but a somewhat unnecessarily grotty script lets it down. Sordid jokes and a swear-fest approach did not help in this situation. Ben Affleck was suitably morose and must have felt like he might have been mirroring parts of his own life.One of the most outstanding attributes that helped lift this work to a higher level is a sensitive and different kind of music score. For this feature, Award nominated composer Rob Simonsen has created a thoughtful score that almost works against the normal flow (in the best possible way) His music highlights the sadness and angst being experienced by those involved. The imaginative arrangements also set this score apart to maximum effect. Maybe it's a score looking for a better film.The basketball sports theme is rather tired and clichéd and having the young players mouthing such platitudes like ""let's win this f...'in game for the coach"" took this script from the hoop to the waste- basket. While it might offer something to the sporty types or those looking for a so-called uplifter - any others may have to work harder at getting much out of it.

Since then, he's separated from his wife and learned how to drink a lot of beer. Things seem to be really going his way until he is tapped to be the coach for his old high school. Will coaching basketball ruin his career as a budding alcoholic? What do you think?If you are waiting for anything resembling originality or perhaps even the slightest detour from the most predictable scenario imaginable, you should bring a book along because the wait will be long than this film's one hour and forty-eight-minute runtime. There just wasn't time for anything but stapling together a bunch of tired clichés, things like marital separations, personal tragedy, drinking games, the healing power of competitive sports, and a lovable mentally-handicapped kid who keeps doing obscene things with the ball.All you need is a little bit of grit, hard work, and determination and you can do anything, right? Bring back the dead, even. Or maybe not. Think about it, as a kid he was a bigshot basketball player and now he's a complete piece of horse manure, a foul-mouthed drunk who does nothing but pour booze into his body and stumble home every night. It's not like sports did him any good. This whole mythology about the supposed transformative power of winning is a huge load of crap.What we should be teaching kids is that everyone has the right to participate, not just the lucky few who have the talent. No wonder America has an enormous problem with obesity. We teach our kids that only the top athletes get to play and everyone else has to worship them from the bleachers. In competition, almost everyone loses. Is that what we want to teach kids? How to be losers? Because they can't all win, but the good news is they don't have to win, they just have to play. The fat kids, the dorks, the talentless slobs just need to play, and play for they rest of their lives.I guarantee that I'm in better physical condition than probably 98% of the jocks in my old high school. Why? Because I play, I got out there every day and did something. I didn't compete with anyone but myself. Where is that movie?""I can't accept responsibility for allowing you being around the boys anymore...We have a zero-tolerance policy when it comes to alcohol."" This was said by a Catholic priest.

The combination would work if our protagonist, Ben Affleck, learned from the heroics his basketball players displayed on the court. I'll let the viewer decide if he does, but it may surprise you at the end results.What's eerie about this film is the storyline nearly parallels what Hollywood's superstar has gone through with his battle with the bottle--with the exception of the loss of a child. Affleck in fact went off the wagon after a year of sobriety just before filming began and had to beg for the project to resume with him in the lead. Acting the dunken part was great therapy for him, he claims, and you can see why. He's outstanding as a habitual imbiber who has to drop to rock bottom before he realizes his addiction is destroying him.The plot has too many loose ends that remain untied to satisfy this reviewer, however.

45,kjproulx,"A Great Movie, Even Though It Feels Familiar",8,25 March 2020,"When it comes to dramas about someone recovering from a personal event or issue, it really comes down to how well it's made. These days, everything has been done in terms of recovery stories, but that can be said about every genre I guess. The Way Back is the latest addiction drama to hit the big screen but is now immediately available for purchase at home. This film may hit too close to home for some, so I will recommend this movie with a large asterisk of caution, but here's why I think it's a great film nonetheless. The Way Back deserves to be seen in my opinion.After separating from his wife and turning to alcohol in a life-threatening way, Jack Cunningham is given a chance to prove himself and clean up his act when he's offered the opportunity to coach a high school basketball team. Having been a player himself, he knows the ins and outs of the game, which will, in turn, make him a great mentor, albeit strict. Of course, with movies like this, it's not all sunshine and rainbows and his past comes back to haunt him, which reveals much more about this character's past. It can be slightly melodramatic at times, but those aspects are still very well-done and may even be a little much for someone if they are able to relate.A movie like this truly needs a powerful central performance or it simply won't work. Ben Affleck, who went through a divorce and had alcohol issues in real-life, portrays Jack, and I believe it's one of his best performances, maybe ever. Much like Lady Gaga in A Star is Born, your best performances come from something you can relate to. If the Oscars were being held today, I wouldn't have any hesitation giving the best actor award to Affleck. His sincerity and pain on his face throughout the entire duration of the film hit me really hard. The best performances come from the heart, and this film absolutely showcased that.Now, I didn't think The Way Back was perfect, because by the time it reaches its second and third acts, you kind of know what to expect, but there are elements of how everything plays out that kept it from being too predictable. If for nothing else, it's incredibly effective in terms of emotion. What I did feel could've used a little more depth was within the team itself. There was one great character on the team, but the rest felt like stereotypical teenagers that were there so that the focus wouldn't be taken off Ben Affleck. That's fine because the point of the movie definitely isn't the team, but for the amount of screentime they get, there could've been a little more detail to their characters.Overall, The Way Back is one of the better movies that I've seen so far in 2020, even though there isn't much to watch at the moment. As I said, it may hit too close to home for some, but I would ruin a few moments in the movie if I got into them. I'll just say, even though there are elements of happiness and hope, this is a very sad film about someone trying to find themselves after being lost for so long. Even though the movie felt familiar as a whole which will keep me from giving it a perfect score, I thought it was very well-directed by Gavin O'Connor and Ben Affleck sucked me in from start to finish. Even though it probably won't be an easy watch for some, I absolutely recommend it.",The Way Back

My Rating 6.5
Ben Affleck is a fine Actor and very impressive in the role of Jack Cunningham a former champion Basketball player who is now clearly an alcoholic wanting to block out his young sons death and his broken marriage . Jack received an offer to return and coach his old school basketball team and for a short time pulls himself together and inspires the team to improve their game.It's a film that Ben Affleck obviously is passionate about and has said himself it reignited his passion and love of acting after his very public battle with his own alcoholism.
From an article in The New York Times
Up until this movie he has not talked much about his alcoholism since completing a third stint in rehab in 2018. (The first two were in 2001 and 2017.) But the arrival of ""The Way Back"" has made the subject impossible to avoid. Affleck has also accepted that the second word in Alcoholics Anonymous does not apply to him - certainly not after he (briefly) relapsed in the fall, turning up smashed on TMZ a few months after making it known that he had achieved one year of continuous sobriety.Why did he choose to make a movie about an alcoholic? ""The benefits, to me, far outweighed the risks. I found it very therapeutic.""I found this movie difficult and a little confronting to watch in parts perhaps because I knew where the characters alcoholism was heading .
A man takes a drink , the drink takes a drink. then the drink takes the man.I thought the script would be more interesting with less basketball and more about ""The Way Back "" as the way back wasn't finding baseball again it was surely how Jack Cunningham finds sobriety which takes up less than ten minutes at the end of the movie
But it's a good film and I think it will be well received and worth seeing for a fine performance from Ben Affleck I hope it's a success and anew start for his career.
if I was a Basketball fan it would have kept my interest going.
There is a lot of Basketball featured in The Way Back .
I wax very impressed with Janina Gavankar as Angela Jacks very supportive ex wife who is also bereaved but trying to move on with her life.
The strongest message I think of this film is that it effectively shows that alcohol-related harm afflicts others than the drinker. The negative effects from drinking puts children and families at particular risk as well as contributing to the current epidemic of domestic violence.",The Way Back
47,msbreviews,Ben Affleck delivers one of his career-best performances!,7,31 March 2020,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)I'm not the greatest fan of inspirational sports dramas, but I also never disliked one. They all follow this storytelling formula that everyone recognizes, but it's always successful. The protagonist is a miserable human being due to some tragic past. He gets another shot at life, usually an underdog situation, and he ultimately overcomes whatever challenge is thrown at him, including his addictions if he has any. Everyone lives ""happily ever after"", and the viewer leaves the theater with a smile because that's how it makes us feel.It's incredibly easy to root for an underdog trying to raise its level and to reach something it never believed in. In The Way Back, the basketball team is awful, but Jack teaches them not only how to play better, but how to be a better *team*. Then, it's just like the synopsis: a win here and there gets everyone back on track, and it's very entertaining to watch these young kids ""grow up"" in every possible way. As a sportsman myself, several little details help me enjoy this type of movies even more.However, it's a straightforward variation of the same cliche, predictable story... until one point. There's one genuinely surprising development I didn't see coming. I don't know if it was due to my ""defenses being down"" or if Gavin O'Connor and Brad Ingelsby really did a great job at hiding it until the right moment, but it definitely worked.The lack of character-building regarding the secondary ones is probably my biggest issue aside from the formulaic screenplay. There's one young kid that still has some sort of an arc, but it never gets the deserved consideration. It's a very protagonist-centered film, and there's nothing truly wrong with that, especially when Ben Affleck delivers one of his career-best performances. I left him for last because I do believe the whole movie succeeds due to his impressively captivating display.A lot of people talk about how Affleck's own life and his past struggles with addiction make this a personal interpretation in the sense that he's just portraying himself. Some people even diminished his performance by saying that ""it's easier to represent ourselves than a fictional character"", which I couldn't disagree more. It's an arduous task interpreting a version of our personality, let alone a very somber, sad part of it. It's not only an enormous acting challenge but also a terrifying personal test.I digress. Honestly, I couldn't care less about Affleck's personal life, or anyone's for that matter. People should stop trying to bring external themes to reviews, it's one of the first principles film critics learn (but have unfortunately forgotten with time). I don't know if his experience with addiction helped him with his performance or not, but he looks incredibly committed to his role. He elevates his character, and he carries the whole movie on his shoulders. Brilliant, emotional, and very realistic interpretation of someone dealing with depression, frustration, anger, and an addiction issue.All in all, The Way Back is an inspirational sports drama that follows the genre's stereotypes and formulaic storytelling, but it's still very successful in its execution. The secondary characters lack development, but there's nothing wrong with a protagonist-centered story as long as the main actor delivers an exceptional display. Something Ben Affleck does in an emotionally powerful manner, delivering a genuine portrayal of someone with a tragic past and lots of personal issues. I believe it's one of his career-best performances. Jack might follow every storyline that ever existed in this genre, but Ben Affleck is reason enough to give Gavin O'Connor's flick a go.Rating: B",The Way Back

51,trinaboice,Excellent and honest performance by Ben Affleck but painful to watch,7,6 March 2020,"IN A NUTSHELL:
Warner Brothers presents a compelling story of overcoming one's worst self on the road to redemption. It's painful to watch since ¾ of the movie display a man's self-destructive behaviors over and over and over again. That man is portrayed in an outstanding, melancholy performance by Ben Affleck who reflects his own personal struggle with alcoholism in real life. It's one of Affleck's best and most honest performances to date. He's extremely believable as a blue-collar worker and Everyday Man. What's especially poignant is that he has recently admitted that his last trip to rehab was just a couple of years ago and that every day is still a battle. The movie is not the typical underdog story, but offers a more mature, realistic look at life. If you hate watching people implode by their terrible choices, this movie is going to be frustrating for you to watch. I wouldn't call it entertaining. I would call it insightful and poignant.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
Lots of profanity. In fact, profanity is a running joke in the movie. Ben Affleck's character has a serious potty-mouth, which is a big problem for a guy coaching basketball at a religious school. He promises he'll work on it, but the F-bombs and other crude language continue to fly from the beginning to end of the movie.
Lots of bad behavior, such as dishonesty and self-indulgence.
LOTS of destructive behavior such as alcohol drinking, drunk driving, infidelity, and pill-popping.
You see sick kids in a hospital with discussions of death.
A man goes to rehab.THEMES:

Addiction
Choices, consequences, and accountability
In the team practice after each basketball game, Coach Jack would ask the players, ""What did we learn about ourselves last night?"" What a great question and exercise.
""We can't change the past, Jack. What we can do is choose how we move forward."" - TherapistTHINGS I LIKED:
The entire cast is solid and believable.
Lots of humor to balance out the many dramatic scenes.
There is something about the way the story is told that evokes verbal engagement from the audience. That's a nice way of saying that there were a ton of people in the audience where I watched the press screening who kept talking to Ben Affleck during the movie. My husband was annoyed, but my friend and I were extremely entertained listening to comments like, ""No! Don't do it!"", ""Try harder!"", ""Stop!"" ha ha
Act 1 is slow and painful to watch as we go to the bar with Ben Affleck's character night after night. Act 2 offers more of the exhausting same. Then, in Act 3, we finally get to see the cliched sports movie give us the triumphant scenes we want to see. But wait, there is an Act 4 that catches us off guard. That's where the heft of the movie takes an unexpected turn and provides meaty insights.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
There is a lot of basketball talk, as you can imagine, so if you're not into basketball, you might get a little tired of all that. It's a sports movie, so you can still understand the ups and downs of team drama.
I'm assuming Cutter's beer paid dearly for the product endorsement, since you see a LOT of scenes with Ben Affleck guzzling it.
There's an exposition scene where one of the characters has to explain how high the stakes are so we care.
I started to get the feels, but I never actually broke down and cried. I felt like the emotional pull could have squeezed even harder.
A few times the camera moved around so fast that I actually got dizzy and had to look away from the screen.
While it's somewhat cliched and predictable for a feel-good sports movie, it's missing the obligatory training sequence in a musical montage. ha ha
The movie really focuses on Ben Affleck's character, so we don't get to learn a lot about the players on the basketball. A few of them have identifiable characteristics but the movie just doesn't dive deep into them.
The friend of mine who watched the movie with me said he would have walked out during the first Act because he just can't stand watching people drink themselves to death on screen. He was glad he stayed until the end but he said the powerful message at the end wasn't worth having to sit through all of the tragic self-destruction in the majority of the film.You can read the rest of my movie review on Movie Review Mom (dot) com or on my Movie Review Mom YouTube channel.",The Way Back

Today, I saw this in the DVD store and went 'Ooh Ben Affleck and sports..this should be good'. How was I to know it was about an alcoholic (from a Catholic background)? (I didn't really read the back!) You see, I'm London-Irish, a borderline alcoholic, and I had ALSO bought a 3 litre bottle of cider to watch the DVDs (after 7 nights on the mash). Well, slap me in the face :) lol. This is about an alcoholic basketball coach finding redemption in his youth. However, it's not all plain sailing / tick box Hollywood.

If you are expecting 'Hoosiers', you will be disappointed, but we've already seen 'Hoosiers.'

57,akcenat,A character study in the structure of a sport's movie,8,5 April 2020,"On the surface, ""The Way Back"" might seem like the stereotypical inspirational sports film, but it is unflinching portrayal of alcoholism and the emotional toll exacted by addiction, not just on main character himself, but on everyone around him. On the other side, film does not work as well especially at the start because of its pacing. But despite its flaws, movie is good character study while Ben Affleck delivers one of his best career performances. At the end, ""The Way Back"" will not going to blow your mind, but it definitely tugs at the heart strings, especially for those that have dealt with alcoholism either first-hand or second.Rating: 7+/8-",The Way Back
58,DLochner,A terrific real Ben Affleck,7,29 October 2021,"Ben Affleck shines with one of his best achievements - obviously inspired by his own experiences.This film is definitely not a classic sport, but a drama about a man who fights against alcohol addiction, maybe even surrendered. He drinks before, during and after work on the construction site or later in the sports hall. A beer can or liquor bottle accompanies him to bed or under the shower. Ben Affleck seems completely authentic. Just like someone who has already experienced something like this.The result is his best performance in years (maybe his best ever).

60,SnobReviews,Great acting but basic storyline.,6,16 March 2020,"""The Way Back"" sees the return of Ben Affleck in fine acting form but it's formulaic sports tale is what gets in the way of a great redemption story.
.
In this sports drama, an alcoholic construction worker is recruited to become head coach of the basketball team at the high school he used to attend.

""The Way Back"" will most probably be the final film I'll see in movie theatres for a while. It's a good film but not a great one, and it struggles between being a sports drama and a human one. It deals with a lot of issues Affleck has been dealing with the last few years (the big one here is alcoholism), but the sports part of the film is so basic that it becomes stale. I enjoyed Affleck's performance here, you can tell he really dove in deep for this one and it is hard to see the downward spiral throughout the ""The Way Back"". I honestly think those who don't like Affleck's work will be turned around for this performance; it's a personal and dark one and I think probably one of his best. Aside from that aspect, it's a sports drama we've all seen before but with good acting.

62,gavinp9,"Not overly original, but good emotional journey",7,7 March 2020,"'The Way Back' (not to be confused with Peter Weir's film of the same name from 2010) is a return to form for Ben Affleck, a former high school basketball prodigy who has fallen no hard times. Jack (Affleck) is a mostly-functioning alcoholic - which really hits home how it's depicted - who is separated from wife Angela (Gavankar) and claiming all's fine in his life.Rather than show Jack as a young basketball star, the film starts with him at his lowest and slowly reveals what's happened in his life over the past 5 years to change him. It gets quite touching. Jack finds a lifeline in coaching his old high school's basketball team, with assistant coach Dan (Madrigal). They're not quite a ragtag bunch of no-hopers, but they're not far off - except for Brendon (Wilson). He has a nice little story arc.After exploring why he didn't go to college basketball/NBA, and not just focusing on the predictable winning montage, the film explores the effects of Jack's actions on his wife, his coaching career and his friends. It's certainly not a typical 'Replacements'/'Mighty Ducks'-style ""sporting miracle"" story, and it doesn't necessarily have a happy or sad ending. Does well to contrast the Californian sun with the reality of some people's lives. Worth it for Affleck's well-balanced & semi-tortured acting.",The Way Back
63,thebricks,"Well made, but very unrealistic movie about alcoholics",6,27 March 2020,"I would honestly have to say that the most realistic movies about alcoholism and drug abuse that I've ever seen usually involve Jared Leto and Nick Cage, from Lord of War, Requiem for a Dream and Leaving Las Vegas. Maybe these actors just get what it's really like. Trainspotting was also very good, no hokey message or triumphant speech about how drugs were bad and they're going to change their ways, they were drug addicts and it destroyed their lives, end of story.I've dealt with too many mentally ill people in my life and alcohol addicts. You can't reason with these people like you can in the movies. A lot of these people are naturally self-destructive in terms of personality. Addressing their issues can often end really, really badly. I'm not talking about personal issues like getting a better job, improving your life, stuff you may be powerless to do, it's about stuff like not drinking so much alcohol and then driving. I've had really intelligent friends who think they have all the answers, talk down to me, then you see them start drinking until the point that they've just lost all control, start insulting you, start causing trouble and then you realize there's a problem. When you try to say something about it, they lose their mind. I've dealt with a lot of people like this over my life. I wish more of them were the alcoholics in the movies, lovable guys with an open mind and the sense to understand when they've done wrong.You cannot help someone whose goal in life is to destroy it. Some of us want to save money, have no debt, live without chaos in our lives. Mentally ill people don't want that. My dad wasn't an alcoholic, he had a brother who was though and some other brothers who had issues. My dad always talked about retiring from his great job, yet whenever I tried to do the numbers and tell him it was impossible, he'd never listen. It was insane. He'd never set a plan. He'd quit a few years, be forced back to work by threat of foreclosure, quit again, repeat. He made great money but for some reason, could never keep any of it, pay anything off, plan anything. Once again, he wasn't an alcoholic, but he had a lot in common with the ones that I knew.I think my point is, to make a better movie about alcoholism, it needs to be more like Leaving Las Vegas. The alcoholic has to be self-destructive and unlikable. They're not likable guys. They want to destroy more than they want to build anything up and be positive. There's a reason people like this get divorced and destroy their lives.I thought this movie was going to be different. Sadly, it was more of the same. It's not worth wasting your time on. Good effort by the director though but it's not groundbreaking enough for me to write a positive review.",The Way Back
64,Rendanlovell,This ain't it,4,17 May 2020,"Boy this is forced. The main character is a self destructive alcoholic who literally drinks like 30 cans in a night. The first 4 scenes of this are all showing him drinking. He drinks in a bar, at his house, and at work every single day. The set up of this character is painfully generic and on the nose. After this boring set up the film nose dives into one cliche after the next. Quiet kid on the team needs to be the leader, check. Quiet kid has a distant hard headed dad, check. Main character and wife are split up, check. Main character is constantly recognized for his past accomplishments, check. It's all so minimal and surface level. The only stuff that elevates this blandness is the occasional touches of family or backstory with a few of the characters. Aside from this bare bones characterization no one is anything but stereotypes. Worse yet, is that these characters don't grow at all. Ben Affleck is a self destructive, loud mouth, alcoholic from the beginning all the way up to the 3rd act low point where he is still a self destructive, loud mouth, alcoholic. The movie hits the beats it should in terms of structure but there is so little motivating the story. The reason the 3rd act low point happens is because a child we met once dies. Then Ben gets fired because he had a beer can in his office in the 1st act. There's so little of interest motivating this turn it comes off laughable. Add in the fact that Ben Affleck's character virtually hasn't changed and this low point feels underwhelming. The whole film is like this. Characters come and go with little relevance to the story, characters barely go through changes, and the story is incredibly generic. There's also a bizarre false climax right before the 3rd act low point that feels like an ending 30 minutes before the actual ending. It's a messy, undercooked script with an unfinished vibe to it. I was calling out every plot point before it happened and got more upset every time I was right. To sum it up in a word, frustrating.",The Way Back
65,Brooklynsmagicmike,Its serviceable but I diddn't think it was anything special,6,20 May 2020,I'm usually into these style of movies but this one I was so-so on. In my opinion its not bad but it definitely isn't great and should't win any awards anytime soon.First the movie is very slow in the beginning. Virtually nothing happens within the first 30 minutes and by the time it does start to pickup you're already worn out from the start. Second this movie needed to show more scenes of the games I understand in movies like these you'll never see full game but 80% scenes of the games are like 2 minutes long which I thought should been much longer.Other then that story is touching and emotional as well as the acting is very well done by all actors.

66,Darkjak007,Good but not a classic,7,12 March 2021,"Dirrected by Gavin O'Connor The Way Back stars Ben Affleck in your typical story of a man who for personal reasons has Succumb to alcoholism. Ben Affleck as jack gives a compelling performance and is the overall highlight of the movie. His scene on the court yelling and losing cool are funny, Although it comes off as kinda generic with his failed marriage and his a reason for his drinking. In real life it's one thing but in a movie the reason they give is the same in other things. The Music itself is pretty good and emotional. There are scenes that do feel like they could've been cut or added. The film fails the most with the team he's coaching.

67,srdjan_veljkovic,A solid drama about suffering and addiction,6,8 August 2021,"While it's quite obvious that Ben Affleck did not listen to Yoda (""Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering...""), it's well known that very few people do.This is a story of a man who's afraid to confront the tragic loss of his son. Yoda's famous path leads him to suffering, losing his wife and developing an alcohol addiction.His road to redemption is bumpy and intentionally not on a ""happily ever after"" note at the end. Yes, it's a positive note, but, there's obviously no guarantee that there won't be another bump down the road.But, the main thing is that he confronts his fear, and manages to admit his failures to his soon to be ex wife. Sure, it's too late for them by then, but, this is the hopeful turning point to go back down the Yoda's path, back to the light side.So, the movie is OK, but, it's not very good.Foremost, this is one man's drama. Other people are there to frame the picture, but, it's his picture. And that man is played by Ben Affleck. While this is easily his best performance, it's, unfortunately, not very good. It's not bad either, though, and that's why the movie works. It just doesn't work very well.He kind of ""did his brother"", that is, he played in a way similar to the way the Casey has made his career on. But, he has much to learn on this from his kid brother.The story, while not being too ""rosy"", is not great, either. We do see a little too much of Ben suffering and we don't really see how/why he started to care about his coaching and turned the team around. It's OK that the coaching was kept low, since not everybody is into sports, but, it misses some important moments/events that would have explained our protagonist better. It's as if the authors were _afraid_ that putting that in the movie would put off too many people. They should have listened to Yoda.All things considered, it's worth a watch, if not for anything else, then to see Ben Affleck deliver a decent performance for once.",The Way Back

It's still about alcoholism and the way Jack handles everything. Once he agrees to coach and the team gets on a winning streak all seems to be okay with Jack and his drinking, but the death of his son sends him to escape to the bottle. Same thing with a friend's son whose prognosis isn't good.Notables: Michaela Watkins as Beth, Jack's sister; Al Madrigal as Dan, Jack's Assistant coach; Dan Luria as Gerry Norris, but is just seen on a bar stool and has no dialogue to speak of (his scenes may have been cut); Glynn Turman as Doc, who ends up almost carrying a drunk Jack to his home nightly from the bar; Melvin Gregg as Marcus Jack's point guard; Brandon Wilson as Brandon who is the best player on the team and becomes Captain.There is a way back, but the road is not an easy one.

73,carlos37andre,This may be Affleck's best performance ever,8,21 July 2020,"I'm gonna try keep this one short. I really like the movie. I agree to disagree with a lot of people I saw saying the movie was predictable, hear me out. Sure, the structure is out there, we've seen it before, and in a way, it follows almost every bit. However, tho, it doesn't actually.I'm not saying this is necessarily an all positive thing, but the movie is clearly more about Affleck's character, than the basketball team itself, and in a way, I love that, I love that we get to know, and explore his struggles, and demons a lot, and that the movie is in a way, kind of a reflection on Affleck's life too, and that's probably why you barely see him acting here, you are instantly grabbed by his performance from the jump, he's great. And I also love the ending, which is probably the farthest they could go when regards to ""been a sports film"", they don't even show the result of the team in the playoffs, cause we don't need to know, the team grew as a team, and Jack is learning how to grow as a person as well. It's beautiful.However, I sure agree that the team aspect could have been explored more, we see some of the characters have a bit of a backstory, mostly Brandon that is, we see that he has evolved throughout the film, he's the captain now, he talks with the team, he dad comes to see their playoff game, but in the third act mostly, the fact that the movie is really about the character of Jack, and not about the team as a whole, we don't actually see much more from those characters, which I would have loved to see. So, the team aspect of it all, how he truly changed those boys' lives is not explored as it could have been, and it would have made the ending even more powerful. Still tho, I think is a good movie, great filmmaking, and incredible performance by Affleck.To sum up, The Way Back is a great movie, probably Ben Affleck's best performance, it deals with a lot of issues, and it isn't afraid of focusing on what alcoholism can really do to somebody's life, I love that the third act doesn't follow the ""regular formula"" of sports films, and has him leaving the basketball team, but not before leading them where they needed to be, while still getting he's stuff together. They could have developed his relationship with the team, and the positive impact he had on them better, in order to achieve its full potential, but still, a great movie.",The Way Back
74,Lewis_Heather787,More than just a sports movie !!!,7,21 March 2020,"I was pleasantly surprised with how much I genuinely enjoyed this film. A few reasons why I was not that overly keen on the film.........One , I am not a basketball fan at all......I'm a sports fan but no basketball is not for me.......Two , Ben Affleck has had an up and down career to say the least. Don't get me wrong I think the guy is a top tier actor and director but he does have his its and misses.However I am still surprised that I ended up really enjoying this film a lot, for a few key reasons.One, Gavin O'Connor is a great director , I've loved some of his work in the past and knows how to shoot a film. Once again he has produced a film that is all round really good, it doesn't really have any negative to it.......its a very well shot film.The second reason is Ben Affleck , man can that guy carry a film or what! Don't get me wrong this isn't exactly stretching the limits of his acting chops but it didn't need to be. A very complex character with many flaws , one unfortunately made easier with Affleck's very publicly known dependancy on alcohol...........you can see so much pain in his eyes and that he cant help the drinking. Although there is a glimmer of hope, when coaching the team and they start winning.....you see the real guy underneath the beer come through and shine. Understated but nether the less a very powerful performance that holds the film up very well.Thirdly and finally........there is much more to this film than just basketball. That is what is great about sports films, there have been so many great ones over the years because of one reason.......they transcend the sport to a more human and person level, this film does just that. It makes the story and the film all the more rich for it, all the side avenues the film hints at throughout, all build up to the climax of the film.Talking about ending of the film, I love the fact that it wasn't an overall happy ending if you know what I mean. Affleck's character got fired as the head coach , but the team did go to the playoffs and win............I just had this worry that after he got fired , he would have some therapy and miraculously make it to the game and coach them to victory........I'm so glad it didn't go that way !! Thank you Gavin O'Connor because it wouldn't have suited the narrative of the film.Overall its a solid all round entertaining sports movie with a lot more depth and heart than you are expecting. Affleck is great , O'Connor's directing is great........and a good story at heart. 70% of 100 , I'd give it a watch........don't get me wrong this isn't groundbreaking or gonna change the world but its a solid enjoyable film!",The Way Back

77,TuesdayThe17th,The back way home,9,11 December 2020,"Ben Affleck and his big bellied body type deliver a stellar performance in this emotional drama. This movie has its roots set deep into a story that is mainly about addiction and the ""the way back"" to a healthy and sober life one once knew. Jack Cunningham had a happy life at one time. A happy marriage and a healthy son...and then he lost them both. No one is able to see loss like this coming im their life until it hits them in the face like running full speed into a stop sign. It is when you lose everything that matter that you realize what you had. Maybe feeling like a victim and undeserving of ths tragedy that beheld him, Jack finds solace in the bottle. And another bottle. And another, until he has completely lost himself in a person he doesn't even recognize. Working a mundane job and spending every night at the same bar in the same seat is the right mixture for a life of loneliness and regret. Jack gets a wake up call, though, after being recruited to coach the high school basketball team for his old high school where Jack himself was an all star basketball player that everyone in town knew. His skills dazzled the small town and never went unrecognized. Upon his return, as a coach this time though, Jack very slowly lets his guard down and becomes enveloped in what he once knew and loved so well. We all have demons and skeletons in the closet, but are Jack's so heavy and so extreme that they will prevail? Or will Jack finally find his way to happiness. Happiness he thought he would never find again. This movie is a bit cliche but its the emotional realism and the acting by Affleck that set this movie apart. I would love to see Richard Gere in a role like this.",The Way Back

From there the movie has about 15-20 min left in the movie to throw in how he really misses up showing him get drunk, drinking and driving yadda yadda, and then rehab.

Upon watching, I discovered that The Way Back is not a purely basketball film but a story of a man stumbling through life and using the sport as a branch to prevent him from hitting the ground.Ben Affleck puts a on compelling performance of a man battling his demons and despite basketball managing to bring some happiness into his life, he can never trully heal his scars. Considering how difficult it is to get creative with sports movies, through its narrative, this film manages to put its own touch which will make basketball fans enjoy the grit, realism and attitude towards the game.

87,magnuslhad,Confident and rewarding sports genre film,7,23 March 2021,"The Way Back is an underdog sports movie and redemption tale. Jack is a former basketball prodigy and functioning alcoholic who starts drinking while on his construction job during the day. He spends every night in the bar, and gets carried home. He struggles to have normal relationships with his sister and ex-wife. He seems to have no friends. He is given a chance to find meaning in life when his former high school recruit him to coach the poorly performing basketball team.There is a lot to like about The Way Back. Affleck is very convincing as a man coping with grief and addiction. Emotionally, he is note perfect whether hungover, resentful, regretful, or simply overwhelmed. You know the sports storyline before you watch it, the damaged coach helping young minds to believe in themselves, but the film takes each genre element seriously, such as the confrontation with the cocky star, or persuading the timid kid to be confident, or the reveal that the ex-wife is seeing someone else. It all clicks together satisfyingly, if unsurprisingly. There are shades of Manchester By The Sea, both Afflecks playing men trying to cope with unbearable loss. The Way Back lacks the punch of Manchester, but it is a solid contender in its genre and worth seeing.",The Way Back

89,theredsky,The Way Back Review,7,12 March 2020,"I'm not a big fan of sports movies because they are all the same. The first half of The Way Back is like your standard sports movie. You got the bad team that fights with others and each other and is trained by a coach looking for redemption. They start to get better and win more games. They go to the big game and win. That all happens in the movie in the first half, but the second half is truly special because it's realistic and human. It takes a different turn for a sports drama and I loved it. It made sense for Ben Affleck's character and the choices he made. It was emotionally powerful and uplifting. This was kind of a personal performance for Ben Affleck. He has struggled with alcohol for a long time and recently went to rehab for it. It doesn't feel like Affleck is acting, in a good way. His performance is fantastic and is, so far, my favorite performance of the year. He was able to convey so much emotion and harness it from his personal experiences that it was impressive. The rest of the cast does a decent job but they weren't as developed as Ben Affleck was. They each have a character trait that defines them and that was about it. The screenplay was pretty good. It isn't best of the year level but it was a lot better than the other films I have seen this year. I didn't take a lot of issue with some of the other technical aspects but I did have an issue with the cinematography. The camera was always shaking. I don't remember a single steady shot. It made sense for the basketball game sequences but not for any normal scenes. It also felt amateurish at points. There is a scene that takes place at lunch and the camera zooms in on Ben Affleck but it shifts position halfway through as if the cinematographer forgot to set the shot in frame. The editing was perfectly fine and the score by Rob Simonsen was good and helped add some emotion to different sequences and scenes. Overall, The Way Back may have a cliched first half with some below average cinematography but the second halves dive away from sport movie cliches along with Ben Affleck's fantastic performance makes this movie worth watching.",The Way Back

It's a well told story of the darkest moments and the struggle to find healing among family, friends realizing it requires a calling from within to live up to being our best selves - - which he achieves. His emotional portrayal is honest, intense and appears to come from deep inside. Writing, direction, cinematography, editing, settings and musical score are wonderfully synchronized - simple - direct - and personal taking the viewer close-in and a part of the story. It has documentary-like realness - rare for Hollywood. It is cinema magic! The rest of the cast are ""perfectly selected"" and also as real as imaginable.Ben's had a lot of controversy in his life recently, I couldn't help but imagine that this was very personal and soul exposing for him.

96,cappiethadog,Users,7,15 June 2020,"Maybe Norman Dale(Gene Hackman) was wrong. ""You know, most people would kill to be treated like a god, just for a few moments,"" the basketball coach tells Myra Fleener(Barbara Hershey), a teacher, who prioritizes academics over athletics, in David Anspaugh's ""Hoosiers"". Nothing is more pathetic to the educator than grown men ""talking about the glory days when they were seventeen."" She takes it upon herself to be the wedge that prevents Jimmy Chitwood(Maris Valainis), Hickory's star player, from returning to the fold. Jack Cunningham(Ben Affleck), in ""The Way Back"", directed by Gavin O'Connor"", is one of those guys that Myra described; a has-been, an alcoholic construction worker whose best days are from a bygone century, immortalized in a trophy case at his alma mater. While Jack drinks himself to death at his favorite watering hole, the other barflies refer to this former Bishop Hayes standout as ""the legend"" and regale him with ghost stories of high-scorer nights past. But before his drinking buddies show up, Jack steals glances at the college basketball game playing on ESPN. To give the television his undivided attention is a little too painful. An opportunity to suit up for the Kansas Jayhawks fell by the wayside as a revenge tactic against a father, from his vantage point, who loved Jack's game more than Jack himself. Whereas Jimmy Chitwood was booksmart, therefore options, putting the ball through a hoop was the only thing that Jack Cunningham excelled at. Every day at work, from his concrete perch, Jack sees cars speeding along the freeway, people going places, while he remains inert, standing still in one place, working on the newest onramp. And every night, Doc(Glynn Turnell) helps Jack, recently separated, up the stairs to the house he grew up in. As this elderly African-American man steadies his deceased friend's son, step by step, we see the blackout drunk's shadow against the side of his childhood home. ""Your father had no moves,"" Doc tells him. ""I used to carry him up these same stairs,"" he adds. Jack didn't understand his dad. That's the tragedy of ""The Way Back"". Like Scooter(Dennis Hopper), whose son Everett(David Neidorf) is Hickory's starting center in ""Hoosiers"", basketball gave Jack's father something to live for. He, too, was an alcoholic.Jack inherits an undersized Bishop Hayes team that is 1-9. Cut from the same cloth as Norman Dale(Gene Hackman), the small Catholic school's new coach is old school; not four passes old school, but the 1995 alumnus rejects the ""European style"" of play that has taken over the college and professional game. Whenever a new coach is installed, especially in midseason, the team, inevitably, will go through some growing pains. Rade(Steve Hollar) in ""Hoosiers"", can't wrap his head around Coach Dale's ball control system and puts up quick shots instead of making the defense work. Rade is yanked from the game for insubordination. Every team has a prima donna who thinks he knows more than the coach. Marcus Parrish(Melvin Gregg), the team's cocksure starting center, is that guy, a Dirk Nowitzki-wanna-be. Despite being 6'3"", Jack believes that a big man should play with his back to the basket, not out on the parameter launching ill-advised treys. Marcus struggles in his new role, being the stud who stays in the paint boxing out, grabbing rebounds, initiating contact, and not getting as much touches. To no one's surprise, he finds himself riding the bench when he doesn't handle criticism during a timeout. Jack doesn't suffer insurrectionists gladly, especially when the player is mediocre, at best. When Marcus nonchalantly shows up to the next game four minutes late, Coach Cunningham kicks him off the team. Bobby Freeze(Ben Irving), the ""White Shadow"", gets the start. Jack, by no means, is racist, but a bias exists, in regard to how he treats his players. Without any repercussions, sharpshooters and ladies man Kenny Dawes(Will Ropp) needs constant wrangling from his fawning groupies before boarding the bus for road games, late. ""Chubb"" Hendricks(Charles Lott Jr.), on the other hand, receives a sharp reprimand for his dancing, a pregame ritual that pumps up the team. Ronald acquiesces. Marcus begs. He asks his coach twice, the second time in tears, before the young man is reinstated. As aforementioned, Jack Cunningham is a pretty good guy, a broken man still grieving for Michael, his dead son, and marriage to Angela(Janina Gavankar), which couldn't survive the tragedy, made worse by some heavy-duty drinking. Jack doesn't see the irony of asking his players to be perfect, holding Marcus to a higher standard even though he's far from infallible. He flexes his privilege without realizing it. After all, Jack got the job despite having no prior coaching experience. There will always be a good old boys club. Still, Bishop Hayes's politics in the 21st century is a far cry from the insular achromatism that rues Hickory, the town's namesake, in the early-fifties.Hickory downs Linton in the regional finals when Ollie(Wally Schneck), the team manager, pressed into service after Merle(Kent Poole) fouls out, hits two improbable free-throws that catapults the Huskers to the state finals in Indianapolis against South Central. Understated but pointed, if you're paying attention, the Butler Fieldhouse host who greets the Hickory squad as they step off the bus, tells Coach Dale that ""we're all behind you...tear 'em up."" South Central is an integrated team. The dignitary in no uncertain terms, on behalf of his cronies, desperately wants Hickory to beat those... Consider the correlation, the real timeline as context for the social and cultural mores that ""Hoosiers"" obliquely hints at. Four years earlier, the state university broke a gentlemen's agreement with their conference affiliates by recruiting the first African-American player, not coincidentally, an undersized 6'3"" center, just like Marcus. According to the historical record, this trailblazer who played in the burgeoning NBA, not only was booed on the road, but at home, as well, despite being selected to the All-American team. Some cities and towns were progressive. Hickory, as depicted in ""Hoosiers"", is not one of them. Norman Dale had coached at Ithaca. That makes him an outsider, a Yankee. The men who congregate at the barber shop for a meet-and-greet with Norman, intuits that in New York, he coached black players, which makes him guilty by association, an integrationist. Even Myra, who returned home after college and a year of graduate school, sounds like a reactionary. She tells Norman: ""I missed knowing that nothing ever changes. People never change,"" as if this sort of provincial groupthink was a quality worthy of admiration. By returning to Hickory, Jimmy's academic counselor stopped growing as a person and becomes the thing she hates, one of ""the sad ones"", because they feel ""solid"" only when they're among their own kind. ""Glory days"" has a connotation that runs deeper than reliving one's past athletic accomplishments, it can also reflect a nostalgic yearning for an era when people of color went to separate schools, anywhere on the map, not just Hickory. Although Myra comes to Coach Dale's defense when the town votes on a referendum for his immediate removal, she makes no apologies about being of the same mind as the townsfolk in that barber shop. In the school parking lot, Myra had defended their way of life in ""this hick town"". Love broadens her horizons. Alas, Jimmy sinks the winning basket and Hickory emerges victorious, but the real winner, in defeat, is South Central, a pre-Civil Rights Movement era team who assimilated black children with white children because it was the right thing to do, not because the rule of law ordered them to.Jack Cunningham knows a D1 player when he sees one. Brandon Durrell(Brandon Wilson), the starting point guard, is soft-spoken and lacks self-confidence, so Jack mentors him, especially since his father never attends any of Bishop Hayes' games. He takes it upon himself to be Brandon's ""white savior"", intervene and make a real difference in this young man's life, not dissimilar to Ryan Gosling, who plays Dan Dunne, a middle school teacher/girls basketball coach addicted to freebased cocaine in Ryan Fleck's ""Half Nelson"", whereas Jack's poison is alcohol. Drey(Shareeka Epps), a player on his team, also deals. The incensed teacher confronts Frank(Anthony Mackie), a small-time drug kingpin, who points out the hypocrisy of an addict calling out a pusher. Similarly, when Jack visits the dock where Brandon's father(T.K. Carter) works as a fish scale operator for a heart-to-heart talk about his son's prospects, Russ Durrett(like Myra) rails against basketball. He doesn't want Brandon to put his faith into a game; the game will let you down, he says, in so many words. ""You should know better than anyone,"" the elder Durrett points out, rightfully. An opposing coach, during pregame warmups, refers to his players as ""thoroughbreds"". Brandon's father used to be one of those thoroughbreds. But when a thoroughbred outlives its usefulness, they're put out to pasture.Bishop Hayes wins the big game. They're headed to postseason play. But unlike ""Hoosiers"", life is the real game in ""The Way Back"". After a tragedy involving his friend's son, Jack relapses. He's fired. The school got what they wanted. No second chances.When Jack picks up the basketball in the final scene, he plays for himself.",The Way Back

This is not some formulaic sports film where everything is all nice and tidy at the end. The film is about redemption but also accepting what has come before and finding a new way forward no matter how difficult.What really made the film stand out aside from the performances were the relatable stories as they were ones that were easy to relate to. Many town have stories of star athletes who never achieved their stardom for whatever reason and whose lives have become ordinary to mundane as opposed to the stardom and riches envisioned for them.In many ways ""The Way Back"" flew under the radar this year but is one of the best films of the year and one not to miss.4 stars out of 5",The Way Back
99,btoews,"Good Premise, Lousy Movie",3,9 October 2020,The basic premise was OK but the movie was just poorly done-it seemed like there were a hundred scenes of Ben Affleck drinking beer or whiskey-we get it-he is a drunk. Everything about the movie seemed cliched and fake like a TV commercial or Political Ad. Really only for huge fans of basketball.,The Way Back
100,drawlife,Affleck owns the role.,8,10 March 2020,"Anyone who is a fan of Ben Affleck and his work knows his long history of struggling with alcohol. I'm sure in many ways this project was very cathartic for him.Affleck plays Jack Cunningham who was once a promising basketball star in high school, but due to some major setbacks and tragedy of losing his son, he becomes an alcoholic to drown himself away from the pain and personal anguish. He's offered a chance to coach his former high school basketball team while dealing with his alcoholism. For most of us, it's safe to say you can see all the sports movie tropes coming from a mile away, and they are quite present, but the filmmakers do try to wiggle out of the those familiar tropes by being as authentic as they can with the dialog. Especially during the games. A real coach does spit out profanity at times and can be very demanding of their players and director Gavin O'Conner captures it very well. He also doesn't oversimplify the game of basketball, but does show how the game works. The way Affleck's character strategizes, takes notes, watches film, etc. and again those scenes are set up in a way where the huddle/coaching of a high school basketball game is genuine.That being said you can see the similar story beats from other sports films coming throughout the entire film. But that's really just a layer of the movie, the real heartbeat is of course Ben's performance. You can tell as you watch him on screen that this film is deeply personal and connected to film. It is a very honest representation of a man struggling to deal with alcoholism and using the sport as a branch to prevent him from hitting total rock bottom. You root for him and it hurts to see him crumble. There is a moment in the film where he makes the right decision, but only momentarily. Normally most can predict this, but it's because of Affleck's endearing performance, you kinda hope he stays on track. I did mention that you can almost predict most of the important notes, but what I appreciated was that when he is caught with alcohol and fired, he does not get his job back, and he ends up in rehab. It is not a typical ""Hollywood"" ending, but a real one. Something I really appreciate.Supporting cast is fine, I particularly liked some of the young actors doing what they can to contribute. Al Madrigal also has a nice supporting role as well. There's no overly dramatic moments or preachy motivation speeches. It's all done with subtly which makes it ever more engaging.To sum it up, it's a tad cliche but Ben Affleck's performance outweighs the tropes. He owns the role and the movie.

Find a project. Sounds familiar? It sure does.It's a movie you'll watch and forget pretty fast. Maybe it's me there is something wrong with, but I got bored and lost interest.

Because the movie is realistic and raw, designed to show the struggles with alcoholism opposed to a man finding his calling as a coach, I do understand why the movie didn't tie up all the story lines with a happy ending. However, I would have liked to see some resolve. Did his wife go through with the divorce? Does the team know how much they meant to the coach? Did they win?

Jack (Ben Affleck) is struggling through a divorce and alcoholism when the Pastor from his old school asks him to become the coach of the basketball team. He takes the responsibility hoping to get his life together.REVIEW:
I'm going to get a lot of hate for this as it seems that this film seems to be widely enjoyed by audiences. I just felt this film had trouble being different from any other film. I appreciate the non-Hollywood esc ""everything will be alright"" take. Showing that just because good things may come, doesn't mean you can't lose it. Ben Affleck was very good and this film completely rides on his shoulders. There's no other character that plays a very important part. All of the supporting cast is there for a purpose, I'm not saying they weren't necessary, but the film just went a route of showing everything in his life that's going wrong. It didn't focus up on anything specific except for the team. Which it did give a good real life twist where you shake you're head and makes you say ""you had one great thing."" Other than that I felt the movie was little messy. You can pawn it off as a representation of how Jack's life is, but I don't think it was done in the best way. There were good and bad parts, the acting was all good, but it was really hard for me to come up with how I felt about the film, because again, it didn't leave me feeling anything. I like how it focused more on him versus making this more about basketball (we already have Coach Carter for that), but in the end I felt this film was quite average. 5.8/10.",The Way Back

I being one who is a recovering addict and understands the life , can respect this film.So many don't understand or care to understand.

106,lucifer_over_tinseltown,More Boozer than Hoosier,1,12 April 2020,"Remember Hoosiers with Gene Hackman? Pretty solid film with a phenomenal performance, as usual, by Hackman. Well, what if a director with an attention disorder (shaky camera angles, ridiculous zooms, etc.) and a lead actor who isn't stretching all that much by playing a dissolute dipsomaniac attempted to remake it? Would it work? Nope. We now know it would not. It was hard to get through approximately 10 minutes of this naive, all fluff no guts, remake(?), let alone 110 minutes. Ben's acting was better as the carnal violence-threatening cad in Mallrats...in his wheelhouse...these days he's perfectly content to ride the asymptote of good enough. So another workman-like performance is delivered. More low fruit is lazily plucked. A massive paycheck cashed...not unlike many NBA stars. A troubling double dribble of a film with a misguided message and a pathological lack of imagination.

The script, which was written by the writer of Out of the Furnace, which arguably is a million times better than this film, feels like it was written by an actual basketball coach who doesn't know how to write a script that is actually engaging and interesting and the director?

I know Ben Affleck is also a fan of basketball himself, so what happened in this movie? They did everything right, good casting. Al Madrigal is great as the supporting character of Dani, they took actors that actually know basketball and the result? Good movie with some clichés, not much of a story and no good feeling walking out of the theater.Felt like a really big missed opportunity, they could have catered more to basketball fans by showing some better plays or behind-the-scenes talks or catered more to the teen-age crowd by giving it a better hero story. Did they really just rated this movie 'R' because of the drinking? I think teenagers need to learn about the risks of alcoholism rather then hide it from them, something for Hollywood to think about, oh and sometime Hollywood ending is exactly what a movie like 'the way back' needs.Exact score: 68 / 100",The Way Back
112,warthogjump,Affleck PULLS IT OFF,10,8 March 2020,"Such a film this was! Perfect in every way. Masterful direction and editing, and absolute flawless acting from Affleck!! It is a hell of an emotional rollercoaster and it is as if Affleck was destined to play Jack Cunningham.Freshly out of detox in real life, Affleck could not have been any more believable as the recovering alcoholic seeking redemption. The basketball scenes were phenomenal and it was definitely made easy to get interested in a sport which although may have not been the main focus of the film, it was the main medium by which Affleck sought his redemption. In fact, the results of the basketball was almost directly paralleled with Affleck's state of mind and for this reason, as the viewer we are even more interested to see the team succeed.The amount of back story and emotion held back by the trailer is also refreshing. I mean, it is obvious the film is about alcohol addiction and redemption from the outset, but there is so much more depth to Affleck's character by the end of the film. You can feel the journey with him.This film is both a beautifully written fictional story with drop dead cinematography, and it is equally a story of one man and his journey to recovery from a dark place of addiction. In the film, basketball is for Cunningham whereas acting is for Affleck. It is a poignant tale so rarely with the opportunity to be told, and it is told with such realism and attention to detail. I would highly recommend this latest drama from Affleck!!",The Way Back

It's a well told story of the darkest moments and the struggle to find healing among family, friends realizing it requires a calling from within to live up to being our best selves - - which he achieves. His emotional portrayal is honest, intense and appears to come from deep inside. Writing, direction, cinematography, editing, settings and musical score are wonderfully synchronized - simple - direct - and very personal taking the viewer close-in and a part of the story...it has documentary-like realness - rare for Hollywood...it is cinema magic!!! The rest of the cast are ""perfectly selected"" and also as real as imaginable...Ben's had a lot of controversy in his life recently, I couldn't help but imagine that this was very personal and soul exposing for him.

These are elements we've seen before: the underdog sports story, the redemption of someone whose unfairly been through the ringer, hard-nosed kids finding purpose.

I know you probably know Matt Goldberg from collider and his the biggest and giant pain in the ass but sometimes i try to make reasonable and constructive criticism, so i hope you will understand..
SPOILERS !
1) team Jack inherited is described as the weakest, dumbest and cluelest of all.. And from MY coaching experience (not basketball, other major sport) i know that those radical changes and path to success (in this case playoffs) takes MORE than few weeks ! I know, the movie is only 2 hrs so, but i think script here is bad bc they shoukd write it like entire first season was disappoiting, Jack is getting more drunk and only second season is like redemption, It would be more realistic..First season should have been portrayed more quickly in just results and paper headlines flashbacks.2) I missed deeper Jacks character in terms of dealing and struggling. I mean, im sorry but the movie is about lost and alcoholism i get it but every human being is responsible for own actions and i got feeling that we should feel sorry for Jacks problems.. It was cliché..3) What i missed most was sporting side of the story.. Deeper connection between Jack and players.. Only we got was cliché after another (arrogant player going late - apology - coming back to team, young captain who has sad life and makes the most important scoring in entire season , fatso and clown... Theres nothing new , nothing what we alredy havent seen ..In summary , still i liked the movie . Im not part of the snowflake or woke movement - i didint feel for Jack , i enjoyed sporting side of the story as much as i could. Drinking, getting sober is cliche and is wrong if we as society make excuses for people who drink, crashing cars, being dangerous for other people.. So the ""lost , drinking and depression side"" of the story i would appreciate better touch, new dimension, better storytelling. It was kinda lazy for me..Still good movie to watch.",The Way Back

122,ian-39125,Tear jerker more than back slapper,7,15 March 2020,"This movie is a slow burner. Angst- ridden, it has less to do with basketball than life challenges. I guess the story puts basketball into perspective. It's a real look at grief and troubled relationships. The hooping is a side show but it's portrayal felt real and will resonate with anyone who's ever coached or played serious basketball. It's not a Coach Carter or Hoosiers kind of movie as similar as they may seem. The trailer really dodges the core of the story in my view. It's a tear jerker more than a back slapper and I wish I'd been prepared for that before I hunkered down for what didn't turn out to be 90 minutes of escapism.

124,michaeldoud,First Hit: This is a very well done film about redemption.,9,8 March 2020,"First Hit: This is a very well done film about redemption.There are lots of films made about someone redeeming themselves after having a difficult time. Not all of them do it well; this one does.Here we have a well-crafted storyline that evolves as the character evolves. By slowly revealing the depth of Jack Cunningham's (Ben Affleck) angst, the audience is interested and wants to know more with each passing frame.In an early opening scene, we find him in a liquor store buying a box full of beer and hard liquor. It is a holiday, and he's heading over to his sister's home. The stop at the store is telling because the store proprietor seems to know him, and the amount he's purchased is unquestioned.Cunningham is an alcoholic. He works in construction. After work, he stops by a dive bar where he is well known and makes idle bar talk and jokes with other patrons. On those nights, he's help home by a fellow customer.While showering the next morning, he's got a can of beer in the soap holder, and while the water washes over him, he pounds down another beer before he's even out of the shower. We see this scene multiple times; it is his habit. We also see him on the job with his ever-present metal coffee mug, which isn't filled with coffee, but vodka. He drinks on the job.Jack doesn't care about much except Angela (Janina Gavankar), his ex-wife, which we discover because he calls and leaves a message on her phone. He also shows enthusiasm when he visits his sister Beth (Michaela Watkins) because he enjoys and appears to love, and care about, her two children.Outside of these two things, he lives a day to day existence of going to work, going to the bar, and being led home to fall asleep in his clothes. He begins each day with a shower and a beer.He gets offered a part-time job coaching the local high school team because he was their best player some twenty years prior. Back then, he was so good he was offered a full scholarship to Kansas University but didn't take it. We learn why, in an intimate conversation with one of his basketball players.Watching Jack decide to try this coaching job was another great scene. He downs at least two six-packs of beer while holding his phone next to his ear, practicing his speeches as to why he can't take the coaching job. Outstanding scene.It's little scenes like this that make this film work well. Another such scene is Jack's lunch with Angelea and their subsequent joint attendance to a friend's son's birthday party. Powerful scenes that open the door to the story a little bit farther.The basketball scenes are some of the best I've seen shot for a film because they were very realistic to high school basketball. The movie gets it right with the noise of the gym, the anxious players, and the boys' willingness to buy into someone that knows basketball. Jack knows how to motivate them, as he motivates himself into caring about something more than his loss.Affleck is amazing. His performance, by far, is the best acting by a man this year. Because of his very own public battle with alcohol, he makes this character real. He shows us that we know that he knows what it is like to carry the demons of addiction around. Gavankar is terrific as his former wife, who wants to move on with her life. She shows equanimity in both loving her former husband and reviling his behavior as an alcoholic. Watkins is superb as Cunningham's sister. Her wistful ways of sharing her wish for her brother to seek help, are spot-on. The boys on the basketball team were outstanding. Brad Ingelsby wrote a dynamic screenplay that takes us on a road of discovery. Gavin O'Connor showed great and deft skills by giving the audience the right amount of information in each new scene to let the audience engage in this story as it unfolds.Overall: This film shows how a film can be crafted by someone who cares about the story they want to tell.",The Way Back
125,blazesuncaster,Dad movie of the year,9,8 March 2020,"Ben Affleck gives his best performance of his career in this film. Honestly if I were to watch a sport movie. It would be this one. The feelings this movie give off are outstanding. At one point it's sad and then at another point it's funny and happy, and then back to sad. This movie really plays with your emotions, but this movie isn't about the basketball team at all, it's about the thrive and healing of a depressed alcoholic. It's about regaining hope in life and finding something better than himself. Which is basketball. One of the funny things about this movie is that it's a Christian school and the players and coach use the worst language possible and sexual innuendos, I found that really funny. I don't really have any problems with the movie. The one problem I might have with it and it's a big might. But it would probably be the pacing, it just seems to really skip over important scenes too quick. But that may just be me trying to find something wrong with this movie. It says 9/10 but I give it a 9.5. Go see this movie, you will feel better about yourself after you see it. I know I did. Loved it. Will watch it again.",The Way Back
126,Ryan_9,Would've gotten more credit had theaters not closed,8,19 December 2020,"I liked ""The Way Back."" I thought it did a great job of showcasing personal struggles and addiction. Ben Affleck (Jack Cunningham) put on a terrific performance considering how he is someone who's had a history of alcoholism and struggled with it. Affleck does an excellent job in making himself seem like a real basketball coach with his behavior, dialogue, and strategizing skills. I'll admit I laughed a few times at the cursing. Jack realizes that he has a chance to redeem himself and can lead the team to success by turning them around, which the high school hasn't seen since he last played.Personal struggles are what the film mainly focuses on, so for those looking at watching a pure sports movie, this likely isn't for you. The addition of Jack losing his son years prior makes it more emotional. Basketball takes more of a backseat in this but was still important to the plot. I noticed some people were disappointed with that. It balances out nicely, though.I was disappointed that Jack got fired as coach towards the end, especially right as the team made the playoffs. However, he made such an impact on the boys that they believed in themselves and knew how to play as a team, despite him not being there. It was a relief that he checked into rehab and finally got the help he needed.Overall, I'll give ""The Way Back"" an 8/10. Good film that would've gotten more credit had theaters not closed a week after its release.",The Way Back
127,Critic_For_Life,Great movie and terrific performance by Affleck,10,30 August 2020,This is more than just a basketball story - it's also about dealing with grief and moving on.

Great to finally see Affleck do well - I've always enjoyed his performances. Awesome job Ben Affleck!,The Way Back
128,LBarlane24,SIGH,2,9 March 2020,"Directed by Gavin O'Connor, The Way Back stars Ben Affleck as an alcoholic former athlete who is given the job to coach a basketball team; how original. My mom forced me into seeing it with her (technically speaking), so I went in completely blind. After having done so, all I can really say is that I have no idea what critics and audiences saw in this one. To be perfectly honest, this is not a good film in the slightest.First off, saying that the acting is below average would be an understatement. I can't say very much about the supporting cast as not one performance from either of them was worthy enough to remember. The one person I can talk about is the main star himself, Ben Affleck, as he (aside from that one old black guy, whom I recognized from Cooley High) was the only recognizable actor in the entire thing. I will admit that the man definitely stood out in this, but not in a good way. I've read a lot of reviews praising Affleck in this film, but I honestly cannot see how that's possible. From how I saw it, he acted as if he was half asleep for most of the time. But then once in a while, he starts shouting and screaming.With that said, I did not give a damn on what this character went through or what was yet to happen to him. And since the supporting characters (and yes, that includes the basketball team players) were not important enough to remember, I could not care less about any of them either.And last, but not least, the direction, which itself was no better. Some of the shots seem out of frame, while most of the time, they look downright out of focus. All in all, this is, not only the most overrated movie of the year, but quite possibly the worst one that I have seen this year. It is an Oscarbait film, plain and simple, and I'm giving it 1.9/10.",The Way Back

132,JoshuaMLosapio,"A Heartfelt, Moving Drama",8,9 March 2020,"I have to say that I was surprised by how much I liked ""The Way Back."" It's true that sometimes the movie follows formula and is a bit predictable here and here. But those minor problems are outweighed by the engaging story, rich characters, and fantastic central performance from Ben Affleck. I have to confess that I once disliked Affleck as an actor. To me, he lacked the charisma that made his regular co-star and real life friend Matt Damon so magnetic. But ""The Town,"" ""Argo,"" and ""Gone Girl"" convinced me that Affleck is indeed a talented performer when given the right script. ""The Way Back"" shows that not only is Affleck capable, but he can give a truly Oscar-worthy performance. This is probably because ""The Way Back"" seems to be based on Affleck's own recent life experiences with divorce, alcoholism, and career letdowns. As washed up basketball player Jack Cunningham, Affleck gives the most riveting performance I've seen all year. From beginning to end, Affleck's raw vulnerability carries the movie and made me heavily invested in his sometimes painful life story. I won't give anything away, but ""The Way Back"" left me deeply moved. The movie deals honestly with real world issues like addiction and trauma in a manner that few movies do. The supporting cast, mostly made up of non-white teenagers, also does a fantastic job of portraying an ethnically diverse basketball team struggling to overcome their losing streak despite overwhelming odds. I found the characters so relatable and compelling that the the movie's ending, which I won't give away, left me wanting more - and in a good way. I highly recommend ""The Way Back."" 8/10.",The Way Back

134,daniel-kyle,Affleck is amazing here.,10,17 January 2021,"I am not a huge Ben Affleck fan.
He did alright acting in The Accountant with the same director, and as a director himself he is very good (especially The Town and Argo).
However, from the moment this movie starts I knew that I was in for a special experience. A lot of that is owed to director Gavin O'Connor, as well as the music, cinematography, and the writing - the story contains much more than just the usual, expected sports team coming together to win tale. There are very good performances all around from everyone involved.
But in the end, everything hangs on Affleck and he delivers superbly. I read that he drew upon his own personal experience to inhabit this character, and if that is so, then I applaud his vulnerability. I have no idea why some people want to become actors, but if it is for this reason, and this is the result, then as a viewer I enjoyed it tremendously.

This feels personal, and knowing that his been through alcoholism himself. I feel like he sadly knows what it's like to be in Jack Cunningham's shoes, which excels the performance to a new height.It gives the movie its own identity, and even though the movie is about basketball, you will quickly come to realize that this is just the back drop for the movie. That this could have been about almost anything else.This is more about finding the spark in life again, after being knocked down time and time again. Not giving up and realizing even though life may be rough and you may be hurting, that there is hope.
That you can bring people together and that every single one of us has potentiel. That we gotta stop hurting ourself or try to be someone that we're not, just to hurt or please one other than you - Which I think we all need to hear and understand. I definitely needed to.8/10",The Way Back

140,kaneeddy,Very fun but quite cliched as well,7,5 March 2020,"The Way Back is a movie that is quite enjoyable especially if you are a fan of sports movies and love basketball. Ben Affleck gives a strong performance which feels very personal to him. This element heightens the film even more, it has a lot of things that you would find in the sports genre such as: Motivational scenes which make you feel good and make you want to support the characters. It doesn't oversimplify the game of basketball as well, the way they use strategies and plays feel like something you would actually see in a huddle of a high school basketball game and as a former assistant coach for a school basketball team I found that to be a really cool element. The way it handles the drama aspects outside of basketball and the real reason as to why the character is an alcoholic I found to be quite compelling and it felt quite emotional at times.The film has a couple of drawbacks with the main one being that this is a little too cliched at times, a lot of tropes that you would see in sports films happen in this one, and I noticed that a lot of elements on the coaches interactions with the players were a little too similar to coach carter, which was a film that handled those elements better. Also the acting apart from Affleck for the most part was sub par, especially in the first act. The run time felt a little too long as well due to the fact that there were a lot of sub plots, I think it could have been better if they would cut some of them out to create a more tighter storyline.Overall, I had a good time with the way back, i think if you're not a fan of the genre you wont find anything new here. However if you love sports, basketball and typical films in this genre you will have a good time like I did, and the awesome Ben Affleck performance is a bonus.",The Way Back

This movie has basketball as an element in it to but the movie is mainly a film about someone finding the way back by reaching out to others and no matter how bad things get he still manages to find the way back.

The way back calls itself a basketball film but it hardly shows anything about its players and their coneections. simply put it is just a bunch of guys playing basketball, we know they they are the protagonists so thats why we go for them but other than that we dont feel for them or care for them thus making them a group of very bland one sided characters. half the movie shows ben drinking with consequences only later shown. The movie is slow, boring and uncharsimatic.this is not to say the movie was bad, if the film was just without the useless basketball and mainly focused on a mans deepward spiral into addiction (which by the way also hardly shows then this would have been a decent movie.

However, you can see how it will be solved in the ending. This problem is especially noticed in the 2nd act and at the beginning of the 3rd one. In my point of view, predictability is the biggest issue in every sport movie especially when it is directed by Gavin O'Conner, but we will get to this point later.Regarding the theme, It is the point that makes this movie a must-watch, such a great relationship between our main character and his players that touches every single student and every single young man who experience what our characters experienced.Now let's talk about the acting, Ben Affleck is great, as always, but the movie lacks the affect of supporting roles, which is the problem in this aspect. Al Madrigal shows a lot of potential, unfortunately it get wasted with the lack of improvement for the character itself.Directing wise, Gavin gives us a decent sport movie, but when you watched Warrior and how it changes this genre, you won't say so much about this movie other than ""Decent"". As I mentioned, predictability hurts sports movies, and that what Gavin tries to avoid in the ending, but not through out the picture.At the end of the day, the movie is somewhat unique when you consider the theme of it and re-watchable if you are in the same age of these young characters.",The Way Back

Ben Affleck is back ladies and gentlemen and as a matter of fact, he's out here giving the performance of his career buoyed by his own personal descent into alcoholism and ultimately finding his way back to sobriety. I could honestly write an entire paragraph about his performance, it was magnetic. Speaking of magnetism, The Way Back's strongest points are found when the games are at their most intense and Affleck is directing his players and teaching them ways to improve their games. However, aside from these two incredible strengths, the first two acts of the film still feel like the typical formulaic sports drama with supporting characters not given too much thought. The third act however divulged into the humanity of recovery which I enjoyed very thoroughly and while the sports aspect of the film could be done with or without outside of the intense moments, the drama aspect ultimately holds it together. Overall though, I enjoyed the experience a lot especially at it's heightened peaks of various emotions and I'm very much excited to see where Ben Affleck takes his return to film from here.",The Way Back

The movie claims to be about a man who lost his family values. But, in the movie he tells one of his players he never had it.If they fire him for being a drunk then why did they hire him in the first place. You have these coaches from other teams that know he's drunk but somehow his school doesn't know that and then they fire him for being one. After he gets fired from the basketball team the sports notion of this movie only becomes a side note.In the movie they assume he never had any faith in the religion for the school he coach for and former alma mater. So, was the faith elements in this movie lazy writing.

Trust me I'm not spoiling anything.)This movie is an emotional ride. I cared a lot for the main character because of the reasons why he is an alcoholic in the first place. I cared a lot for the basketball team. This is not because of their back stories but because the worked hard as a team. In fact their back stories were weak but it more a story about the coaches life.Its great that story is mostly told through the visuals with just enough dialogue to fill in the gaps. Thats why it feels like an emotional and not clunky.
The filmmakers tried so hard to not make it cliche in the directing and writing. Primarily because not everything ends in a happy way. Thats what makes the movie feel real. Also the whole third act has more to do with the main characters character struggles than the basketball team. Also There are a lot of scenes done in a unique way. But it still ended up hitting some of the cliche story beats of an underdog sports story.There are a couple of times when they say some profound things but mostly its the same cliche themes that you expect. That doesn't mean those themes aren't important or relatable.Overall It's a very slick directed movie and you will feel some happy but mostly sad emotions.",The Way Back

The movie is realistic in showing how most things do not go your way, there are ups and downs, these led Jack back into alcoholism. Ben Affleck is always good, especially in these types of movies. I loved how he portrayed the character and his constant battle. The movie directed itself to show how basketball helped Jack find his way back into normal life. As the movie goes on, even towards the end, you learn more and more about his character and what he's been through. I loved watching that character growth and learning more about the character. I feel that there were a couple places where the film could've improved on, such as smaller shots or lines that could have made scenes more impactful.

Some mentally beckon the viewer to get closer to the tracks. Others create an urgency to rush toward the train tracks in order to see. Seldom, if any, coerce us to seek higher ground.

Disclaimer: as a former ballet dancer, now disabled, basketball has become my spirit animal ... you don't see a lot of ballet on TV, so basketball has become my new love.What it takes to achieve greatness in any discipline is a personal journey. Affleck chose basketball to portray this path. Watching these journeys lifts us all up.The editing was fantastic. The pace and cadence of the movie was just right. The cinematography was stunning & the film knew exactly the story it wanted to tell. That's no easy task for such an emotional movie... as ""going there"" can sink into the insipid. This movie didn't come close to that.Ben, you've won the heart of this disabled, old Grandma. My wish is that your film gets a boatload of awards.",The Way Back
200,AnthonyTurnerReviews,Affleck Finds His Way Back,7,3 April 2020,"The Way Back is a return to form for Ben Affleck. Like most sports films there is a similar formula to them, but The Way Back takes that formula and adds an intense focus on it's characters. Affleck's character in particular brings so much realism to the film that it sets it apart from other films in the genre. Al the characters are so intriguing that I wish they focus more on them. Overall The way Back is a great film and one that show not be overlooked even if your not into ""sports"" films",The Way Back
201,MOVIE-REVIEW-POOPSHOOTs,You probably won't understand it if you aren't an alcoholic...,9,28 March 2020,"Ben Affleck and I have one thing in common - we're both alcoholics. But his movies have always been fantastic, despite knowing that we have an odd and unfortunate connection. He is just a great writer, director and actor. But this is by far the most personal film he has ever created or been cast in, and he really did not hold back in depicting his personal struggles with alcoholism.You need to understand that this is NOT a basketball movie. Neither is Hoosiers, really, and although The Way Back may not engulf you in its emotional ride like Hoosiers did, Affleck certainly makes you care about the characters. And although Hoosiers clearly influenced how this movie was filmed, there is much more emphasis on the main character's struggles and everybody trying to help him, rather than in Hoosiers where Gene Hackman may have had a tainted past, but he was always the one helping others.So know a few things prior to watching this movie, especially if you are not an alcoholic. If you are, like myself, then you will not question the authenticity of the things he does while drinking/to drink, because you probably have done something similar (I know I sure have). Drinking in the shower, before work, during work, before family gatherings, etc. are never out of the question when you are dealing with alcoholism. The most frightening part as well is how functional alcoholics can be most of the time, but it always finds a way to catch up with them.But how and when will it catch up with Coach Cunningham? I promise you won't see it coming, and that it makes for a fantastic comeback story.",The Way Back

In all great sports films, the protagonist may be flawed, or even vile, but the beauty is in the redemption and connection to the players he or she is guiding. This movie features none of the good qualities we are looking for. In fact, the characters of the home team leave you cheering for the other team, because the character played by Ben Affleck never comes off as someone you can empathize with or have sympathy for. In short, he's a bad person and a terrible coach. As for the players, the script has no room for them to be explored, relying rather on contrived, emotional music set to slow motion moments from the games that only inspires you to start thinking about what you need to buy the next time you go to Home Depot. No one in their right mind would let this coach near kids for more than thirty seconds. But we are supposed to believe the players want to win the big game for him? Ridiculous If I was on that team I would have walked five minutes into the first practice and files multiple complaints for anyone involved in hiring and supporting this profane drunk Truly an epic failure on every level.

210,OblanskHiggs,Great Movie!,9,17 March 2020,"The Way Back is a sports drama starring Ben Affleck, who's giving a phenomenal performance in this movie, this movie is a tragic story about a character who played basketball in high school and when he grew older, he quit, he got married and had a child till he died in the age of 9, the death of jack's son destroyed the marriage between jack and his wife and they divorced. After the divorce jack becomes an alcoholic, and throughout the movie we see jack as an alcoholic, and in the middle of his life he gets a job as the head couch of the basketball team of his old high school, he accepts the job and takes the team to the playoffs, throughout the games in the movie, you can really see the development of jack and the other team players from the beginning of the film, to the middle of the film, till the end when jack is getting drunk, doing some stupid stuff and then goes to therapy like he should have done right after his marriage... the story is really sad and you may drop a few tears throughout the movie, I like this movie but I think there is room for improvement, so that's why I give this movie a B rating. In conclusion, I think this movie is good, there is a great cast, great character, amazing plot, and Ben Affleck gives a performance of a life time in this movie that I just love seeing on the screen.",The Way Back
211,tymon_tm,"another ""TV movie of the week"" from Affleck",5,25 March 2020,"I get Ben has never been too picky about his films, and this is his yet another entirely forgettable role. apart from the fact we've seen this a bunch of times already - a team of underdogs/losers unexpectedly reaching for greatness - this one not only doesn't offer anything new, but actually gives a lot less than most of flicks of it's genre. main character is so shallow/predictable, and those who could make this movie interesting - like the kids for instance - are completely ignored apart from some minor cliches. the plot is useless too - just like that, out of nowhere, the team starts to shape up (because they've been yelled and cursed at? lol), and right before the 'climax' , the main character is being pulled out from the action, and the movie ends - just like that.I never expect much from them 'netflix' flicks, but they are getting more and more sloppy. character build up, some sort of tension, tasty plot twists - nah, let's just tell it like it is, fit in 90 minutes and move on to the next. it's a perfect movie for a weekday dinner - you don't really need to bother with paying too much attention, and the movie arrives where it's supposed to.",The Way Back

It's inspirational, exciting, can be funny, and of course emotional.
One particular tone of this film was the familiarity, I felt every withdrawal from Ben's performance, as I too am a recovering alcoholic. However you don't have to be to feel the emotions his character is going through.
He has lines in this movie that's are so powerful it hit me on another level. The one where he talks about his father is just one of them.

221,dcastellani,A tour de force from Affleck,8,30 August 2020,"A once great and renowned basketball player, Jack Cunningham played by Ben Affleck struggles with demons from his past, but when a coaching opportunity comes forward he seeks redemption. This film is a great character piece about a man who's haunted by his past and try's to suppress it with alcohol. This film would not be the same if Affleck was not the star. He brought the grit and emotion needed for this character absolutely perfectly. In my honest opinion this is probably the best performance of Affleck's career. To be frank this film reminds me a lot of Manchester by the sea which starred Bens brother Casey Affleck. They are both men haunted by their past that see no purpose in life but find it through something that was present all along, for Manchester it would be the nephew and in this film it would be Cunningham's return to basketball. All in all this film is more than a sports movie, in my opinion it is not a sports movie, but a character piece of a troubled man who finds something that offers him peace, and a way back.",The Way Back

This movie was very good, no arty farty niceness with the kids, a single man living in a rundown house Just tell it as it should be. The acting was good, I mean real good.

Five of these stars are just for the fact that Afflleck took this role after his own fight with alcholism, and I felt like he poured his troubles into this powerful film which is why it was such a strong performance by him.
On a sports level this movie was also fantastic because it was not just another coach Carter. This movie showed the reality of how to succeed in basketball which made it so much better than any other sports movie I have seen. Defense wins championships, play to your strength, hard work and dedication is just as important as talent, etc. I strongly suggest watching this movie if you have a love for the game or if you just want to see very powerful acting.

230,stefankljajic,A review coming from a basketball player,10,26 March 2020,"Don't listen to the negative reviews. This movie was awesome. There are always gonna be people who like to hate on the movie. ""We've seen this before"" My question is - WHERE? I have watched every single basketball movie and can't name one that was similar to this one. Someone said it's like ""white Coach Carter"" which is so ridiculous because those 2 movies have nothing similar to each other except the fact that both of the main characters are coaches.Ben Affleck is and always was a brilliant actor, there's no debating of that. But his performance in this movie, where he's going through the same stuff as he did recently in real life, is magnificent. But, as I said, we always knew this.But, I want to talk about the players. Everyone who has played high school ball knows that there are teams like Ben's who are not good and some teams, like in this movie, that are stacked with stars and are amazing. But you have to have great acting skills and decent basketball skills to act basketball, because you have to make it look natural and you're not going to be doing that by, for example, just letting the player you're guarding blow right past you. No, you have to make it look like he really blew past you in game - make it look real.Next thing, I am so glad this was not a cliched, seen before type of movie. For everyone that says it is, which basketball movie shows just the beginning of the playoffs, not the finals win or loss? This is the first one of this kind. The focus wasn't on basketball. The focus was on real life problems and understanding how and why people deal with them in different ways. It's about pain, hope, will, courage. Character development throughout the movie was some of the best I've seen in a sports-drama movie. Storyline was new, refreshing and acting was real and basketball part did not look fake at all. And that's why I gave it a 10/10.",The Way Back

The ending felt somewhat lackluster, what did the coach even do to turn this team around like that? From 1-9 to a playoff game all in the same season? They get blown out one game, and start hitting game winners/win games just like that? They definitely could've expanded into the basketball aspect of the film a bit more. Another criticism I have is what happens towards the end. He just now starts getting help towards the end? What if it was sooner in the movie and we could've seen a better redemption arc. Not sure if it could even be a redemption arc, seeing as he still drinks and stops for like what? Two games? We never see an improvement.",The Way Back

Ben Affleck's acting here alone is enough to save most movies. This movie didn't need saving, though.The story-line was solid enough.

Alcoholic environment wise, it was very enlightening. Overall, great movie.",The Way Back
238,rplatini,An honest journey,8,10 May 2020,"Gavin O'Connor is a director who builds his films on a personal dramatic basis, in Guerreiro we saw the confrontation of the Conlon brothers, played by Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton ; in O Contador , we follow the professional and personal developments of Ben Affleck 's character. They are stories that tell a verisimilitude very close to the eyes of the viewer and generally the result is positive, and it may, of course, please or not everyone, after all, when we talk about people, we talk about choice and choices are not always right or wrong, they are only choices that will come with future consequences. In this respect, O'Connor has been doing well, the director is experienced with series and playwrights and this is a positive point, when choosing to talk about people in the theater, the feeling is almost mandatory and you develop it with experience or based on much study and development.In The Way Back, the director revisits this trajectory with a depth that overlaps the canvas. When presenting your new work, it is clear that the main proposal is not to entertain, it is to make you reflect. In his new feature we follow the trajectory of an ex-athlete who was considered a phenomenon in high school and who, when he became an adult, left the sport and stopped in the construction industry with serious problems of alcoholism, however at some point in the plot he is invited to direct the same team that was featured, assuming the position of coach. It is a narrative that seems pre-designed and very common, but what differentiates one work from another is the choices. Some clichés are present, a film that involves sports has its logical structures embedded in the package, most of the time. The comeback, the losing team's challenge to become victorious,Aligning his proposal with a musical score without many variations, with piano and guitar stretching the notes until he ""lacks air"", the narrative develops to the tired eyes of its protagonist, with a camera that often varies between the closed plane and the close-up to show such tiredness. With the sound of the notes extending in the background we enter Jack's life ( Affleck), which at some point hooks the viewer by feeling. There are several who are building this character, making the experience very intimate. Alcoholism is just one of the problems that started as an outlet, Jack is lonely, bitter, spiteful, funeral and the elements mentioned above evidence this, from there you wonder: ""I can meet a Jack"" or worse "" I can be a Jack "", are questions that arise out of necessity through the director's choices, talking about people is always more important than talking about anything else. The impression we have is that the script was decoupled throughout the production, according to the tone, because in all the layers presented, not only by the protagonist, but by all the other characters that make up that nucleus. Each of them has its importance inside and outside the production, after all, who does not seek recognition, a victory, erase a bad memory or distance themselves from what the others wanted you to be, but deep down that was not what you wanted? It is a very intimate footprint in this regard and it has several weapons to hook your audience.
Adding everything that has been said so far, an element that made this film special was the choice of its protagonist, over the years Ben Affleck has come across some things mentioned here, in particular, his problem with alcohol. The honesty of the actor in coming across that character that in the first minutes only makes him drink all kinds of drinks that have some alcohol content, and the director makes a point of showing this tirelessly, so that it is registered that that problem is ""solid"", it is impressive. You see the destructive feelings that addiction causes, with all ownership and sincerity of those who have already lost in personal and professional life, Affleckunderstands the terrain you tread well. This is one of the goals of art, to pass that needs to be said, but in a way that is felt, they are choices, they are paths and here the choice to bring the protagonism, a real life protagonist of that problem and use the cinematographic language to convey it those who assist and cause the reflections it proposes, is gratifying.The Way Back is a film that surprises by the subtlety in the tools of the script, which plays when using clichés without that artificial tone and involves the viewer by breaking narrative expectations when presenting a film that involves sport. It is honest, it is integral, it is reflective and it is a dramatist that can lead its protagonist to be among the awards this year that will certainly be lacking in many competitions. Point for the director, point for Ben Affleck , who certainly did a good therapy for his personal struggle. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, Warner migrated the release of the film to the digital platforms ""Looke and Google Play Filmes"", it is to enjoy a good film in a ""parca"" time.",The Way Back

No spoilers, but the last film I saw that was this much of a stick-your-head-in-the-oven downer was ""Leaving Las Vegas"" (1995). Seriously. Even the ""high"" points of the movie are weighted down by relentless ""I hate life"" anger, over-the-top profanity, bitterness and heart-wrenching sorrow... and waiting for the other shoe to drop is excruciating. And for a movie ostensibly about a high school sports team, we don't really get much more than superficial insight into who these kids really are; in fact, most of the players are introduced once, then forgotten. The handful of adults in supporting roles are walking cliches, and their performances are utterly forgettable. And Affleck's estranged wife (as portrayed by Janina Gavankar)? She could have been played by a cardboard cut-out; in fact, that might have been more compelling. Gavankar's performance could not have been any flatter or more tedious.

267,ruizjon,Horrible - Not a Sports Movie,1,29 March 2020,"This was not a sports movie. It is a story about alcoholism and emotional dysfunction. There is nothing inspirational about it. Usually in a great sports movie the leading character is an example of good character. This guy was a profane drinker who couldn't process his son's death and turns to alcohol to cope. And it was clear he came from a family history of alcoholism which was never really dealt with in the movie.He loses his wife and eventually his coaching job. The emotional energy of the movie is a downward spiral ending in him going to rehab. It would have been better if that happened 1/2 way through the movie and focused the second half on his way back to the man he wanted to be when he got married. Perhaps develop 2nd season of him coaching and being that man he always wanted to be.I was also highly disappointed with the Catholic priests in the movie. They were hypocrites. They said they were about faith and raising men of character but they tolerated Cunningham's out of control profanity which was a red flag that he was no where near ready to be a moral example. Had they pastored him about that perhaps they could have discovered the alcoholism struggle more in a pastoral setting. Then when he comes to practice drunk they enforce their code of conduct on alcohol use, while right to do so, they provide no pastoral care for Jack. No empathy driven desire to ask him what is really going on with him as the root cause of his behavior, no spiritual guidance, or bringing him back to right relationship with Jesus.And then they cut to the final game scene when the team is praying only to break to a ""player only"" huddle where the hype is once again profanity filled, one of things modeled by Coach Cunningham as if it was a good thing.This was not feel good at all .... it was more or less depressing, emotional dribble with no inspirational redemption.

(I guess one exception is that there is a basketball player who offers a bit of predictable comic relief due to his flirting with the girls-but this is a high school basketball team after all). The Way Back presents an agonizing story line and those close to Ben Affleck's character, such as family and co-workers, could have reacted predictably. Instead, there was a sense of subtlety, not because they were ignorant or passive (they were not), but because they were keeping an open eye without overreacting. I really appreciated the acting of each of the major characters from the assistant coach, the wife, the chaplain, the sister, and the players. Frankly, Ben Affleck's character is hard to love, and Affleck pulls that off very well. Even the ending is subtle.

But I went in expecting nothing but a mild smirk at the end of the movie.But that isn't what I got, what I received was an emotional love for the sport, and the feelings that it brings to us. How it keeps us together, United, and brings love in our lives. How it teaches us things, that in normal life we would never learn. It transcends a feeling that we, in our lifetime would never feel, if it wasn't for sports.This movie embodies the struggles of life, and how we just forget our troubles when the clock starts, and players start to do their thing. The rush of emotions that it provides, how unmatchable and undeniably amazing that is.Ben defines the struggles, that loss brings onto a human being after losing a loved one. How it isolates you with agony, and how you just simply forget to do things. How the simplest of joy seems so out of reach for us.Like anythig, loss, is an emotion too. How profoundly, and efficiently we deal with it, it's totally upto us. But this movie shows that, what we love can bring meaning into our lives, how it can make us feel alive again.So if you don't have anything to do, which majorly seems to be the case right now, get a load of this one, it makes you feel, and it makes you understand the importance of emotions and sports.",The Way Back

This movie is emotional. It is also however, more realistic in it's emotion. No one screams and yells to make their point. It slowly and surely stays it's course and allows the subject to carry the day. It's a movie that deals with a coach trying to fix an inner city basketball team while slowly but surely drinking himself to death. With very little exception it steers clear of the stereotypical ""inner city basketball teenager"" traps that even the most applauded movies of this type fell into. Affleck's character is a broken man who is asked to fix a broken team. Yes there are parallels to other movies like this but I felt this movie separated itself very well. It travels a different path. It doesn't try to beat you over the head with ideas about inner city youth. It deals with a few small issues and then lets it be and I feel that adds to the quality of the film. Affleck is dealing with demons. Very large demons. And here's a spoiler, he doesn't get the girl in the end and not everything ends in typical pie on the sky fashion. I loved Affleck in this. At no time did I feel he overplayed or underplayed this. In a nutshell this movie could have fallen back on the tried and true tropes usually used with this type of movie.

Nothing beats art that mimics life.The movie is simple but simplistic. The music score is wonderful and puts emphasis on emotion at the right times. What I enjoyed about the movie was the fact that addiction wasn't down played and Affleck's character never received a pass for his behavior; not from anyone. He had to face his failures and admit how his actions affected others; these are the ups and downs of addiction. I appreciated the fact that the writers didn't go that easy on the character development.The supporting cast was excellent, too.

But what I'd like to most about this movie itself is the ending is not exactly what you expect. All too often we'd like to ignore the hope that comes from these type of movies but I feel that humanity would always be better off if we praised these kind of movies more. Even if the basic storyline has been played before it's never a bad thing to watch.That being said getting into the acting that Ben does I think is phenomenal. He really does show the character in a painful way that I think only he could have done. At times you feel that he had stopped away all of the bad and you are just left with sorrow. The root of his pain is not obvious but hinting and how it is shown is great.I would highly recommend this movie if nothing else because hope is something we should always want, and redemption is something we always need.",The Way Back

There were a lot of build-ups in the plot with little explanation. The ending in particular left viewers wondering what happened - did the team win?

It was not.The internal conflict of the team was missing, the conflict that helped bring the team closer and develop characters was absent. With that being said, I'm not sure the movie needed it. This was not a story of teamwork but instead a coaches tale. The focal point of the story was not the team itself but rather the coach and his own personal journey as the season went on.The movie missed a chance to develop characters like Bobby Freeze, a football player that started solely for his defensive and hustling abilities. Freeze has one of the more memorable impacts of the players but never really shows any personality or development.Coach Cunningham (Affleck) solely interacts with one player, Brandon Wilson. Wilson is the one exception in which he actually does grow and develop as the movie progresses. The conflict with his father could use more detail but it gets the point across.After the first hour of the movie I was somewhat confused as I was still unsure of whether I was getting a classic team development movie like Remember the Titans or Coach Carter. It feels as though the real conflicts and importance of the storyline starts around that hour mark.Affleck's character is a drunk that ends every night at the bar and ends up getting carried home. One of the more disappointing parts of the film is that they fail to go into the story of Glynn Turman, the man who walks him into his apartment every night after he's had way too many drinks. At one point he mentions that he did the same for his father, but other than that it doesn't go into his story at all.I thought the movie offered a different perspective on the classic sports movie. As a fan of the classics previously mentioned, although predictable, I had still hoped this movie ended in a title victory or inspiring performance. Instead the story offers a raw depiction of the man who decided he would coach a team, rather than the coach and the team. Overall, an enjoyable watch and great performance from Affleck, but lacked a conveying storyline and character development.66/100",The Way Back
308,kaycarl-65320,Outline and analysis,8,27 May 2020,"This movie is hard to watch at certain times, but tells a remarkable story. I watched this movie on amazon prime video and its genre is drama/sport. Gavin O'Connor was the director and the main character was Ben Affleck. Ben, known as Jack Cunningham in the movie, struggles after losing his son at a young age. He and his wife became divorced after this and he struggles with alcoholism. Cunningham was an outstanding high school basketball player at Bishop Hayes. He gets a call from the father asking him to coach the basketball team because the coach had suffered a heart attack. At this time he struggled with extreme depression and an addiction to alcohol. He ends up taking the on the opportunity, which ultimately helps combat his addiction to alcohol. Later in the movie, another tragedy strikes and he then begins suffering the same problems as he did before.I really liked this movie because it makes you realize that you cannot get up in problems or dwell on things for too long. Life is too short for these things to happen. There are many aspects to this movie that stand out but I think that the main aspect is when Cunningham goes to therapy and opens up to his ex-wife about their son.The film can be intended for any audience but could also be directed towards people struggling to cope with a tragedy.",The Way Back

310,ccafferty-67311,Outstanding performance by Ben Affleck,10,22 March 2021,"I am not a huge Ben Affleck fan but I was blown away by his performance in this movie. Every second he was on the screen he gave everything he had into the character Jack Cunningham. It was incredibly moving and watching the movie I felt like I was watching a character that was not what I wanted him to be but who he truly was. The ending made me cry because Cunningham is remembered for who is at his very best and these days I think there is too much focus on who we are at our very worst. A great movie and Affleck poured everything he had into this character, this is a movie you do not want to miss.",The Way Back
311,dwvannoy,"Wanted To, But Nothing to Cheer About",5,26 April 2020,"I love movies about flawed people and Ben Affleck does a great job. He is flawed and does a superb job battling his demons. I agree it is one of his better roles. But. I just didn't care. Didn't care about him or his team. Didn't care if they won or lost But, I wanted to care. Rather, I found myself drawn to the characters of his assistant coach and ex-wife more than Affleck or his players. I keep watching and watching. Looking for something to cheer about, root for the underdog, and connect with the characters, but it never happened for me. You keep hoping for something and it just doesn't happen - even up to the last few minutes of the movie, and then it's over.",The Way Back
312,robertjohnson337733,And I thought I Liked Shower Beers...,8,11 March 2020,"I will start by saying that Ben Affleck drinks a lot of alcohol in this movie--mostly beers (a lot of them in the shower) and sometimes a little vodka in his coffee cup.Now, let's get to the review. I went into this movie thinking it would be another solid sports movie, maybe with the feel of a Coach Carter or a Glory Road, but my oh oh my was I wrong. Yes, basketball is the backdrop of this film, but the story of loss, alcoholism and recovery are at the forefront of ' The Way Back.'The movie is not based on a true story, but it pulls largely from the real life story of Ben Affleck who has struggled with alcohol for years and found himself in a rehab facility just before this movie started filming. A functioning alcoholic that tries to make it through each day without completely losing it, he eventually gets the head coaching gig at his old school,where he was the start player, and slowly starts to turn his life around but not without a few hiccups along the way.This film showcases some of Affleck's best acting in his storied carried, right up there with the likes of Argo and the Town, and it was easy to see that he put everything into this role...unlike Justice League.The Way Back has something for everyone even if you're not a sports fan. But if you're not careful tears will sneak up on you when you least expect them.It was great to see Affleck back and hopefully this is the beginning of another solid run of films for him.Special shout out to Glenn Gulia (Matthew Glave) who played the trivial head coach.",The Way Back

317,klangley32,Lacked Climatic Scene,4,11 June 2020,"The movie had a lot of potential, and there were several opportunities where there could have been that ""feel good"" moment, but it did not deliver. The movie was more about a mans drunken life, rather than a sports movie, but the previews set this up to seem like a sports-based movie. There was no climatic scene, it just seemed to be kind of neutral throughout the whole movie. I have loved Affleck movies and was looking forward to this, but sadly it missed in several areas. Okay movie if you're looking to kill time, or are having a hard time finding something to watch.",The Way Back

The acting from Ben Affleck is okay I guess. I have never considered Ben to be a great actor but he has had his moments and this movie is not among them. Normally I would've given a movie like this 5 but the lack originality made me give 4. Another cliched sports film, they just rinsed and repeated it. Don't waste your time. I only watched this because of Coronvirus lock-down and am writing this review as well because I'm free in the lock-down. Not even worth watching during the lock-down.",The Way Back

320,ishanagrawal-19795,"SIMPLE, HONEST AND TOUCHING with perhaps one of the most soulful background score ever!",7,25 July 2020,"So here comes the best movie of 2020 by a long way, not just on the motivational front which isn't where it focuses upon but majorly on the emotional aspect where it actually wins the heart of everyone.Starring my favourite Ben Affleck who comes up with perhaps his most impactful performance, the movie touches the strings and synchronises with the chords of masses perfectly.The story starts with Jack Cunningham (Ben Affleck) a construction worker who is a real drunkard and use to be a basketball champ in his formar years of high school at Bishop Hayes. We also get glimpses of a suffering figure in him may be due to some personal loss or something tragic (that one comes to know later in the movie). He soon gets a call from his school to coach the basketball team which is in tatters since he left. Fighting with his inside demons, he reluctantly agrees and turns up the next day in his alma mater to find the team's lack of discipline and unorganised play. He gradually builds the team up and begins gaining the respect of all. On the personal front, he starts drinking less and his life is back on track.(Spoiler Alert)Sooner do we realise that he use to have a son Michael who succumbed to cancer. He had a torrid time with his wife Angela (Janina Gavankar) and so she left him too (Though they are still married and in talking terms, in occasional meet ups). He soon learns that his wife is seeing someone else which breaks him down further. Also the kin of his friend is struggling with cancer which makes Jack recall his own son and he resumes his excessive drinking habit which leads to him being sacked as the coach of the team. Seeing his life fallen apart again, on the suggestions of his sister Beth, he starts having therapy session and starts opening up about his son's demise. He apologies to Angela for all the wrongful actions and they apparently reconciled. In the last scene, we get to see the team in the finals and vowing to win it for their coach Jack and in the backdrop we hear voices of commentators lauding Jack for this amazing turnaround of the team.The movie is truly a delight to watch. As a man who is constantly suffering, Ben has pulled up an exceptional performance. The movie also bears an uncanny similarity to his real life which kinds of following the same trajectory unfortunately and off lately, it has been a torrid time for him. With an outstanding soothing and undoubtedly the best background score of Rob's career, the movie becomes a real tearjerker at times and the outpour of sentiments is well complemented by performance of other actors as well. The best part about the movie is that nowhere it goes overly dramatic and doesn't make an undue attempt to make viewers feel the agony and pain of Jack. Also, contrary to how most would have expected the movie to be a hunky dory ride with perhaps Jack regaining the post of his coach and may be a reenactment of marriage with Angela, what the movie does is, it brings up a moral victory for Jack and gives a befitting calm composed climax which might not be that satisfying to an overly sentimental being but certainly a realistic peaceful end to what was an innately fulfilling pleasurable watch.Must watch for the Affleck fans!",The Way Back

The dramatic twists and turns kept me engaged in the film until the end. I highly recommend.",The Way Back
