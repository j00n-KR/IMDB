0,Leofwine_draca,An exemplary action thriller,8,16 December 2017,"As a film, THE FOREIGNER couldn't be any more different from director Martin Campbell's last movie, the ludicrous and ludicrously overblown Hollywood blockbustere THE GREEN LANTERN. It's very similar to his film before that - the exemplary EDGE OF DARKNESS remake with Mel Gibson. And it just so happens to be Jackie Chan's best movie of the last ten years, a thankfully serious political thriller about IRA terrorists bringing chaos to Britain's capital once more.Jackie, who still kicks ass at the age of 62 and who seemingly still does his own stunts - even if wires do help him out these days - plays a grieving gather who goes gunning for the goons responsible for his daughter's death in a bomb blast. Pierce Brosnan plays a thinly-disguised Gerry Adams, proclaiming his innocence but somehow involved in the terror attacks. There are only three fight scenes here, but the non-action is every bit as engaging as the on-screen physicality, a mix of high-level politics, treachery, betrayal, and zealots willing to die and kill for the cause. Jackie's vengeance-fuelled scenes are hugely satisfying, while Brosnan reminds you of what a fine actor he is outside of the Bond franchise.",The Foreigner
1,SnoopyStyle,a very particular set of skills,7,22 October 2017,"In London, Quan Ngoc Minh (Jackie Chan) takes his daughter dress shopping and she's killed in a terrorist bombing claimed by the Irish UDI. Northern Ireland government deputy minister Liam Hennessy (Pierce Brosnan) is a former UDI leader who knows nothing about the bombing. He fears upcoming pardons being endangered and an unraveling of the political peace accord. Mr. Quan confronts Hennessy in his own way demanding names.Jackie leaves behind his comedic skills. He replaces his fun style of kung fu fighting to deliver some darker fights and a more dramatic performance. I'm more convinced than ever that he should be doing a seriously dark Death Wish reboot. He's ready for this acting turn. This is good for his career and hopefully, somebody has a good franchise for the man. Brosnan is a great foil playing a two-faced character. This is a thriller with action. It's a throwback to the 90s including the IRA replacements. They should have simply done a period piece which would be even better.",The Foreigner
2,boblipton,Betrayal,8,15 October 2017,"This movie is based on Stephen Leather's novel THE CHINAMAN. That's how the other characters see Jackie Chan's character: as an old Chinaman whose daughter had been killed by an explosion in a dress store, from a bomb planted by a wing of the IRA, breaking 19 years of peace. Jackie's search for the people who killed his daughter lead him to Pierce Brosnan, an old IRA hand, now the British Minister in charge of keeping the peace in Northern Ireland. He tries to comfort Jackie, but can't help him, when Jackie demands names... so Jackie blows up his wash room.Jackie is not whom he appears to be, but neither is Brosnan, nor, in the end, are any of the main players, kindly, platitudinous politicians. It's a world of lies, corruption, violence and betrayal under a facade of peace and smiles that Jackie's single-minded pursuit of answers reveals: he's almost an anti-MacGuffin, appearing to matter very little to any of the people in the movie, who causes all the fuss.Pierce Brosnan offers a fine performance as what can only be described as the Minister for IRA Relations in Northern Ireland. Chan's performance is far from his usual work, but he has always been a physical actor, more than one who works with words or facial expressions, and he lived up to my hopes as a long-time fan.",The Foreigner
3,Prismark10,Taking revenge,6,17 January 2018,"Although The Good Friday agreement was signed in 1998, almost 20 years ago. I have still lived the majority of my life from the time I was born in the background of 'The Troubles' where indiscriminate bombing affected people in mainland Britain. It is not always been in the background for me. A traffic jam and a wrong turn meant I avoided being in an area where an IRA bomb went off some years ago.In The Foreigner, directed by Martin Campbell (Goldeneye) Jackie Chan holds back the comedy playing Quan Ngoc Minh whose daughter dies in a bombing campaign started by an IRA spin off group. A distraught Minh wants to find the people responsible and he does not take no for an answer. He targets Liam Hennessy (Pierce Brosnan) a former IRA commander now a deputy leader of the Assembly. When Minh gets short shrift from Hennessy, he takes a violent path. Hennessy finds out that he is not the only person to have had a violent past as Minh was in the special-ops.Brosnan plays a thinly disguised version of Gerry Adams with the beard, glasses and the Ulster accent. He plays a duplicitous politician with former comrades thinking he has gone soft.Jackie Chan now visibly older brings his trademark martial arts action but it does take some getting used to without the comedic elements.The film has a strong enough story, Martin Campbell has a history with political thrillers and it shows here.",The Foreigner
4,nogodnomasters,I have no family,8,22 October 2017,"In London, the UDI blows up a British Bank which kills the last family member of Quan (Jackie Chan). Quan suspects the First Minister of Ireland (Pierce Bronson) knows the identity of the bombers. He will not stop until he gets them.We get some background information on Quan at about an hour into the film as well as confirmation of the clues scattered about. This was a serious role for Jackie Chan playing a 61 year old Rambo. While the plot was fairly simple, the story kept me engaged, even knowing where it going.Guide: F-word. Implied sex. No nudity.",The Foreigner
5,kosmasp,Best of both worlds,8,25 December 2020,"Jackie Chan had a perception problem, maybe still has. He is such a good (and fun) martial artist, that many did not recoginze his acting ability or talent therefor. Comedies are not considered a standard for acting ... action movies even less so. So why not do a Drama - but with a lot of action. And stunts that will showcase the age of our main character.Jackie Chan was always good utilizing and embracing certain things. Be it the enviroment (check) or in this case the aging process. Still this is a taking justice in ones own hands that may feel a bit over the top for some. But it works, especially with someone like Pierce Brosnan being his ""opponent""/ally. Yeah I know with friends like these, right? Who do I mean? Well that is not too much of a secret, but still good intentions are not always translated into something ... let's call it ""good"".The movie works on a few levels and you totally understand the motivation Jackie Chans character has - some might even wish they could act like him ... not that most countries laws would allow that ... just saying. Enjoy this and maybe discover that Mr. Chan indeed can act too",The Foreigner
6,ma-cortes,Complex and dark vengeance movie with great role by Jackie Chan while seeking justice and retribution,7,31 March 2019,"Better than expected vendetta movie with an unusual role for Jackie Chan as a humble restaurant owner with a buried past, who eventually becomes a merciless avenger . It deals with a businessman, Jackie Chan, runs a restaurant, when Quan carries to his daughter Fan : Katie Long, to a dressing store she is suddenly killed at an act of terrorism. The bombing is claimed by a terrorist organization called ""Authentic IRA"". Quan erupts in vendetta-fueled action and focusing on the Northern Ireland deputy Prime Minister, Henessy: Pierce Brosnan, married to Mary and with a lover, Charlie Murphy. Henessy holds a dark past and knows about identity of previous Ira terrorists, at the same time condemning the massacre perpretors . As Quan heads for Belfast to meet Henessy who allegedly has clues to the identities of the elusive murderers. While , Quan sets off a homemade bomb in his office. As he carries out threats unless he gets the bombers' names, though the government official Henessy claims to have not knowledge of the bombings . Quan blows away enemies who have killed those who were dear to him.At the beginning the plot is plain and simple, a relentless revenge, but along the way the script becomes more and more complex and twisted, including a dangerous cat and mouse game among the main protagonists. As the tale contains noisy action, intrigue, violent fights, thrills, chills, suspense and a lot of twists and turns. Here our protagonist Quan acts Charles Bronson/Death Wish-alike, as he exacts as a vigilante, taking law on his own hands when his daughter is victimized ,
doing Judge, Jury and executioner. Very good acting all around. Jackie Chan gives the best performance of his long career as a good elderly father who seeks revenge when his only person who holds his existence is murdered in a clothing store bombing. Pierce Brosnan is fine, he plays the suspect State Official, Gerry Adams-alike whose past may hold fundamental tracks in the case. His jealous spouse is well played by Orla Brady, his intriguing lover performed by Charlie Murphy and his assistant Kavanaugh acted by Michael McElhatton of Game of thrones.It contains an atmospheric and adequate cinematography by David Tattersall, showing efficiently London metropolis where sets the action. Thrilling and suspenseful musical score by Cliff Martinez. The motion picture was well directed by Martin Campbell. He is a good craftsman and expert on thrillers and action movies such as : No escape, Criminal law, Lovecraft, The mask of Zorro, The legend of Zorro, Three for all, GoldenEye, Casino Royale, Vertical limit, Reckless, Last resort, Edge of darkness, Green Lantern, among others. Rating 7/1o. Well worth seeing. Better than average. Essential and indispensable watching for Jackie Chan fans.",The Foreigner
7,paul_haakonsen,Not your average Jackie Chan movie...,6,12 June 2018,"This is a more mature movie from the Jackie Chan vault, and it is nice to see him branch out like this and move away from the usual slapstick comedy, although that is very lovely as well.""The Foreigner"" has a good story that follows a good script, although it was somewhat generic and linear.The characters in the movie were quite nicely fleshed out. Although I didn't really grasp the accent that Pierce Brosnan was using throughout the movie as it sounded a bit too forced, but then again I am not sure if some Irish people actually speak that way.While this is not your average Jackie Chan movie then there were enough action in it to make it entertaining.All in all, ""The Foreigner"" was an entertaining movie.",The Foreigner
8,Quinoa1984,"In brief: come for Jackie Chan, stay for Pierce Brosnan being friggin awesome.",7,18 October 2017,"The Foreigner is one of the movies that is good to spend a car ride once it's done considering certain things, like, for example, why Jackie Chan is even in the movie. One could argue that if you took him out you would still have a sturdy plot involving (so-called?) IRA people, with Brosnan as the government man who was an A-Okay IRA guy once and the intrigue involving these bombings and prisoners possibly being released in exchange and shady dealings and etc etc etc. But then it hit me: in any significant bombing, particularly in the past several years (which in Europe, England especially, not IRA, but it's not something that seems completely impossible), there are those who get killed, perhaps ""collateral damage"" one might try to say, and so little attention gets paid to them. So Chan may have sort of special super-movie-secret-forces powers, but one could say he's fighting for everyone who is left to wait while the greater political powers shuffle boards around and wait for one side to crack.In other words, it's a bit of those older IRA thrillers from the 90's (didn't Boorman do one, The General I think, and of course In the Name of the Father, but that's a whole other dramatic beast) with a touch of Taken, but it's also Chan showing us that he can act in such an extremely subtle way that it's easy to miss how nakedly emotional his performance is. He's going to be remembered in his celebrity eulogies for his comedies and how his martial arts skills were closer to ballet and dance than anything else (I'm sure 100 other critics have noted but, yeah, the Buster Keaton of Kung-Fu), but he is not to be underestimated for his dramatic chops, and to go head to head here with Pierce Brosnan, who is especially bringing his A-game, is impressive. He's not just doing a Liam Neeson or Bronson shtick; he's created a character full of complete pain that is bottomless, and though nothing can fill it, his Quan will take all the people down that have to go (in a rather polite way of doing it too). I haven't seen Chan in a movie, at a cineplex at least, since 2009's Shinjuku Incident. He also was full-on dramatic there; here, he goes deeper.A moment for Brosnan: I haven't seen him this good since The Matador, which may have been ten years ago (sheesh, him, Campbell since Green Lantern, this is a quasi-comeback movie, isn't it?) I admired how skillfully Brosnan navigates this man's growing desperation, which kicks off in the first scene we see him in as his nice, calm time with his mistress is broken by the news of this bombing. From there each scene brings him further and further into the s***, and while Brosnan gets to flip out and use the string of expletives that an Irishman slugging down whiskeys here and there (in moderation, of course, but perhaps not enough all things considered), a lot of his performance is there in the face, in the eyes, as he tries to control his voice and keep it all about the growing desperation that he can't show to too many at all around him. If the prospect of yet another Jackie Chan beats people up movie sounds not enticing, Brosnan should be.Does this mean the movie is a must-see? For the acting it is - the supporting players all around them are totally solid too, I imagine most more local players in Ireland and the UK - but the story is only OKAY. I feel like this scenario has a lot of procedural beats that should be air-tight, and in the moment they work, but there are also holes that could be punched through (don't ask me to point them out now, I'm sure CinemaSins will get to them eventually, but some of them involve some scenes in the woods and that's all I'll say). The very end also seemed like a cheat; it may not be a big deal, but it leaves a potential moment of tragedy that isn't realized, all because a character makes a decision that doesn't sound logical at all after everything that's gone on (more tragic for us to experience, not for Quan exactly). The best thing about the technical aspects are that Campbell knows what he wants and can get it all filmed, his action scenes are shot competently but with a few too many cuts (not like Greengrass-level many, but more than I care to see with Chan, who can still do most of his own stunts and fights I wager). And the score is Daft Punk lite, which is cool.This is better in some ways and more involving than it had any right to be, and the writing doesn't lag much in its 112 minute run time which makes it never dull (at least for me). I'm not sure how well I'll remember it a year from now (aside from the two leads), but it gets the job done it sets out to do, and Chan shows he's finding interesting things to do as he goes into his later years - to put it another way, if he has to play a guy that doesn't fight at all, he can still turn in work better than a hundred or a thousand others. 7.5/10",The Foreigner
9,tavm,The Foreigner is highly recommended for fans of Jackie Chan and Pierce Brosnon if they wanted to see them in something different,9,18 October 2017,"Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend and his nephew. It begins when Jackie Chan takes his daughter to a dress shop to get something for her prom. Pierce Brosnon also figures into the story in a role much different from many of his other ones especially his most famous one as James Bond. I'll stop there and just say there's much compelling drama and a few good action scenes for Chan fans. So on that note, we three highly recommend The Foreigner!",The Foreigner
10,Scarecrow-88,The Foreigner,9,16 March 2019,"Jackie Chan loses the smile and laughs for a far more austere and gritty revenge action thriller as the owner of a Chinese restaurant in London who loses his daughter in a horrible terrorist bombing thanks to an IRA rogue unit adopted by a desperate Irish Deputy Minister (Pierce Brosnan), looking to secure a stronger political presence as his reputation has weakened. He wants to continue to ease relations ""with the Brits"" (through Katherine Davies (Lia Williams), specifically), never intending for his long-term IRA associate, McGrath (Dermot Crowley), to lose control of the situation...women and children coming to harm wasn't part of the plan. Chan's Quan aims to find out who the bombers are, refusing to allow Brosnan's Liam Hennessy to relax until he gets their names. Interestingly Quan only injures but never actually kills anyone Hennessy sends after him...vengeance is for only the five that were responsible for the bombings, one of which killed his final daughter (his family was killed in Vietnam, replayed in memory to a tormented, haunted Quan). The film often gets bogged down (well, maybe, convoluted is preferred) in the IRA terrorist plot which has Hennessy seemingly working both sides, hoping to get former IRA criminals he was once aligned freed while still remaining in office by loosely (well, he hopes to never get caught but McGrath isn't as concerned with political alliances with the British as he is with returning to his old form) orchestrating the bomb (meant to only scare not kill) attack. Quan becomes the resilient force that reminds Hennessy of his error and an obstacle...no matter how many men Hennessy sends Quan's way, he bests and outsmarts. Whether Chan is in cramped quarters of a two-story guest house in Belfast or on the outskirts of Brosnan's safehouse in the wilderness, he finds creative methods to outlast and vanquish those sent his direction. I think you can tell that Chan had to use stunt replacements in certain scenes...but for the most part Martin Campbell's choreography and editing masks this. Chan still has enough fight scenes and close-ups, entanglements and such, that his fans shouldn't be displeased. I think we have to accept that eventually even the greats come to that point where they require help and can't take the same bumps they once did. The plot gets thicker when Hennessy's wife becomes an actual rival, fueling McGrath to go bigger than her husband wanted; his wife even seduces his nephew and hopes he'll replace her husband in political power! There is even an affair between Hennessy and a young terrorist who helps deliver bombs...she gets off the double-decker bus that explodes. This love affair, a kiss, is how Quan assures Hennessy he'll not get away with his role in the terrorism. Many will come to the film looking for a Chan fight flick...they will get him at work, but this is also really about Irish/Brit relations and the IRA, how terrorism isn't the answer and only harms more than helps. Brosnan grimaces and kvetches, remains profane and embattled...he made an enemy he couldn't swat away. Chan's weary face, the loss that sketches his countenance, and the way his woe and mourning calculates every step reveals a marvel of a performance...quite a nice latter-career gift to those who might have doubted he had that in him.",The Foreigner
11,zardoz-13,Jackie Chan's Comeback Thriller with Pierce Brosnan,8,23 October 2017,"Jack Chan usually makes lightweight comedies, but British director Martin Campbell's ""The Foreigner,"" co-starring Pierce Brosnan, is a change of pace for the Asian action superstar. Typically, Chan orchestrates lots of nimble, gravity-defying fights in his films where he defeats his colorful adversaries without killing them. Although the bouts in ""The Foreign"" aren't elaborately operatic, all the pugnacious, close-quarter, combat encounters here are staged with an intense, bone-crunching ferocity as our Hong Kong native gives as good as he gets from the villains. Of course, at age 63, Chan cannot cavort the same acrobatic abandon that he mustered in his heyday in over-the-top epics like ""Amour of the Gods"" (1986) and ""Project A"" (1987). Nevertheless, the ""Foreigner"" fights bristle with a brutal, slam-bang quality that owe much more to improvised spontaneity as well as gritty realism than anything Chan has done in his Kung Fu features. Anybody who has seen Chan's recent, lackluster straight-to-video releases, primarily ""The Railway Tigers"" and ""Kung Fu Yoga,"" knows that he hasn't attempted to top any of his earlier feats of dynamic derring-do. Ultimately, one of the biggest differences that Chan's fans will spot in ""The Foreigner"" is his tight-lipped solemnity. He doesn't play his usual happy-go-lucky guy, and he rarely smiles in this morally complex, 114-minute, rated R opus. Furthermore, as a hero driven by revenge, Chan channels Sylvester Stallone's rugged, survivalist Rambo hero, even to the point of dressing his own wounds as he lone wolfs it against the opposition in their own backyard. At the same time, none of this would seem half as gripping were Pierce Brosnan's suave but ruthless, IRA-villain not as treacherous as he is in his post-James Bond career. Happily, ""The Foreigner"" leaves both individuals intact at fade-out, but the world they are left to confront has been altered irrevocably for the worst.Basically, ""The Foreigner"" is a tenacious revenge thriller in the tradition of ""First Blood,"" ""Death Wish,"" and ""Taken,"" that casts Chan as a highly-decorated U.S. Special Forces soldier who fought in the Vietnam War and has suffered his share of heartache. Quan Ngoc Minh (Jackie Chan of ""Drunken Master"") lives in London, England, where he runs an Asian restaurant. He lost his wife to pirates long ago in the Orient, and his twentysomething daughter (Katie Leung of ""T2 Trainspotting"") is last surviving relative. As the story unfolds, she wants to buy a dress for a date, and Quan chauffeurs her to a dress shop. She hasn't even introduced her boyfriend to her father, but he wants the best for her. No sooner has Quan's daughter entered the dress shop than a bomb explodes, shattering an otherwise ordinary day, and kills her. Grief-stricken, Quan learns that his daughter's death amounts to collateral damage from an IRA terrorist act. Quan approaches a diplomat, Deputy Minister Liam Hennessy (Pierce Brosnan of ""Die Another Day""), who has old ties with the IRA, and pleads for him to give him the names of those who detonated the bomb. The grizzled, bespectacled Hennessy claims that he knows nothing about the bombers and argues that his IRA days are long behind him. Indeed, he is intent on preserving the peace between Ireland and England, and he doesn't need Quan sticking his nose into what may be something bigger than he imagines. Quan doesn't believe Hennessy, and he embarks on his own bombing campaign to force Hennessy to cough up the names. Ironically, Hennessy discovers that a rogue bunch of IRA terrorists calling themselves 'the authentic IRA' are responsible for the bombing. Interestingly, what he doesn't know is that some of his own people may be at odds with him in their aims. Although he is a 60-year old man, Quan hasn't forgotten how to wage war. He menaces Hennessy with one bomb attack after another. No matter where Hennessy goes to evade Quan, the Asian interloper shows up and reminds him that danger isn't far from his doorstep. Hennessy discovers that taking care of this formidable, 60-year old guy is no picnic.Martin Campbell, who directed the James Bond movies ""GoldenEye"" (1995) and ""Casino Royale"" (2006) as well as the two Antonio Banderas westerns ""The Mask of Zorro"" (1998) and ""The Legend of Zorro"" (2005) has experienced his share of highs and lows during his 44-year career. Recently, he helmed the disastrous DC Comics superhero saga ""Green Lantern"" (2011) with Ryan Reynolds that barely recouped its $200-million budget. Since the debacle of ""The Green Lantern,"" Campbell has languished for the last six years helming episodic television shows as well as made-for-television movies. Despite his James Bond and Zorro movies, Campbell has a less than spectacular record of accomplishment. Occasionally, he has made a movie such as ""Vertical Limit"" (2000) with Chris O'Donnell that turned a profit. More often than not, his films have either barely recouped their budgets, such as the uneven Mel Gibson thriller ""Edge of Darkness"" (2010) or tanked outright, like the Angela Jolie drama ""Broken Borders"" (2003). Despite this hit and miss record, Campbell is a good, solid, efficient director with a sense of cinematic flair that overshadows his less than successful films. Campbell's Jackie Chan actioneer ""The Foreigner"" faces an uphill struggle because the Hong Kong superstar hasn't starred in a notable film since 2010's ""The Karate Kid"" where he played second banana to Jaden Smith. Aside from his high grossing animated epics, Chan's movies cannot compare with his best films made well over twenty years ago. Produced for $90 million, ""Rush Hour 2"" ranks as Chan's highest grossing movie at $347-million. Meantime, Chan's fans have something to look forward to with ""The Foreigner."" This white-knuckled, no-nonsense thriller goes where most thrillers fear to tread. Not only do some characters die tragically, but also the survivors face the consequences of their actions. Campbell and ""Enemy of the State"" scenarist David Marconi don't sugarcoat the action. You'll leave ""The Foreigner"" with its unsavory ending feeling entertained, but sobered by its stark realism.",The Foreigner

Chan excels in providing some gravitas and solemnity as a former special ops soldier whose last remaining living daughter is killed in a terrorist bombing who finds himself seeking justice but instead bargains for vengeance when he is constantly stonewalled by an Irish government agent with IRA ties from his own past (Brosnan equally gritty and glowering).

This causes problems for Irish politician Liam Henessy, trying to balance a role as statesman, trying to negotiate the release of Republican prisoners, an affair, a bitter wife who holds him responsible for not avenging a family death, and assorted continuing links with the organisation with which he was so heavily involved before he went ""respectable."" Added to his problems is the revenge-bent father of one of the victims who regards Henessy as the only viable source of information about his daughter's killers. Given that this Sino-Vietnames gentleman has some black ops experience...Pierce Brosnan plays Henessy and you don't have to look to deep to see Gerry Adams in there somewhere. Quan Ngoc Minh is played by Jack8e Chan in a performance which is worlds away from the character we have become used to. Yes, there are a couple of fight sequences, but they are brutal: no fun abou them. More to the point is that Quan, in his 60s, was grieving long gefore the bomb took his daughter.

Unfortunately, this jeopardizes the ability of those in law enforcement and certain government agencies to do their jobs with the Irish Deputy Minister ""Liam Hennessy"" (Pierce Brosnan) being placed in an especially awkward position. And what none of them realize is that Quan isn't just a mild-mannered owner of a Chinese restaurant but has acquired a unique set of skills and experience earned while serving in the special forces of the U.S. Army--and he fully intends on using them to satisfy his need for vengeance. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an excellent film which greatly benefited from the pairing of both Jackie Chan and Pierce Brosnan.

It's also one of the best Pierce Brosnan movies in years. The complex plot involving Northern Irish terrorists is understandable and comes together well and yet is easy to grasp by the viewer.The bombs in London are quite scary considering what has been going on recently.The pace is good and the exciting story never feels formula. Jackie plays a father with a set of skills but unlike Liam Neeson in Taken he clearly does his own stunts and the fight scenes are remarkable for someone his age. Pierce Brosnan gets one of his best and most complex roles for a while playing a politician who is a a not quite totally evil villain.A good combination of a Chinese produced movie, directed by New Zealander Martin Campbell of Golden Eye and Mask of Zorro, and based on a story written by a British novelist.

But I thought it was a good political action thriller. Certainly one of the better movies with Jackie Chan. Not too much Kung Fu scenes, just enough. He might getting older but he still got the moves. Pierce Brosnan as the retired IRA politician is also enjoyable to watch. There are enough action scenes to keep you interested and they're certainly not over the top like you sometimes see in those kind of movies. The plot is actually not boring at all, it's all well written and well thought of. It's more than just the Chinese lonely guy getting revenge. It's way better than I expected it was going to be.",The Foreigner
17,siderite,"If you can't beat them, join them",7,2 February 2018,"After his semi political Chinese movies in which the bad guys were always European or American doing bad things to Chinese people, Jackie Chan finally realized that he can't beat them, so he stars in a Hollywood film. This time, the bad guys are IRA, the Brits are kind of murky and the good guy is Chinese, but most of the innocents are Londoners. And it's funny to see a movie basically about a sympathetic terrorist in this day and age. OK, he just beats people up and makes sure he doesn't kill anyone that doesn't deserve it, so it's like law enforcement, right? Strange how murky these waters get.Frankly, I like Jackie Chan, and I wanted to like this movie. Unfortunately, his character was as unsympathetic as he was magical. A Chinese man trained by the US Special Forces (at Hogwarts) vows revenge for the death of his daughter by the hands of IRA bombers. In the first third of the movie he acts like an annoying pensioner, just phoning people to no end and asking them for names, the other third he terrorizes a Northern Ireland politician and just in the end he actually does something resembling revenge, but interfering with the people who were already doing their job to catch the culprits. There is only one ""Jackie Chan scene"" where he jumps over stuff, kicks ass and falls repeatedly (the man is made of self repairing steel, even at his age), some regular ass kicking, but he spends a huge amount of time just saying ""nehms!"". The way he always gets around the UK (and highly guarded objectives), finds the necessary ingredients and even a machine gun and evades all CCTV cameras that otherwise seem to work fine for everybody else is what turned me off.Let me tell you what this movie could have been: a tension filled movie where Jackie Chan and Pierce Brosnan play off each other, in a cat and mouse kind of scenario where both are as twisted and dark as possible. Instead we get an annoying elderly Chinese man doing all kind of stuff that is bad, but to the bad guys, so it's OK, and a parallel political plot with Pierce Brosnan doing his best, but not getting much to work with. Their actual interactions are tiny and unsatisfactory and the artificial efforts to make Chan appear god-like and positive grate the nerves. Cherry on the cake, if his character would have stayed at home doing nothing, the story would have unfolded pretty much the same way. That's just lame.Bottom line: typical Hollywood action, in which neither Chan nor Brosnan get to really shine.",The Foreigner
18,Hellmant,Really enjoyed seeing Jackie Chan as a serious (aging) badass action hero!,8,18 October 2017,"'THE FOREIGNER': Four Stars (Out of Five)An action thriller starring Jackie Chan in a surprisingly dramatic role. Chan plays a retired Navy Seal, who's now a small business owner, that goes on an obsessive revenge fueled mission after his teenage daughter is killed in a terrorist attack. The movie costars Pierce Brosnan, Michael McElhatton, Charlie Murphy and Orla Brady. It was directed by Martin Campbell, who's also helmed two James Bond movies; 'CASINO ROYALE' and 'GOLDENEYE' (also starring Brosnan). The film was scripted by David Marconi, and it's based on the 1992 novel 'The Chinaman', by Stephen Leather. It's received mostly positive reviews from critics, and it's also a modest hit at the Box Office as well. I really enjoyed seeing Jackie Chan as a serious (aging) badass action hero! Ngoc Minh Quan (Chan) is a retired British Chinese Navy Seal (in his 60s), who now owns a small business. Having already lost family to tragedy, Quan is completely heartbroken when his remaining teenage daughter (Katie Leung) is killed in a politically motivated terrorist attack. He becomes obsessed with getting revenge, and he believes that a British government official, named Liam Hennessy (Brosnan), knows the identities of the killers. When Hennessy tells him he has no idea who the terrorists are, Quan won't take no for an answer. He begins terrorizing Hennessy, and his men, to get the information. Having grew up on Jackie Chan movies, I used to be a huge fan of his. Now that he doesn't do nearly as many cool films anymore (nearly as frequently), and I've lost a lot of respect for him as a person (due to his political views on drug enforcement, and other things), I'm not such a big fan of his anymore. Still it's awesome to see him in a serious action movie, which he rarely ever does, and as such an old badass too. He's like Rambo (in the original 'FIRST BLOOD') in this movie, and he's like 63-years-old! It's also cool that he's such a sympathetic antihero, who does a lot of bad things in this film. Plus Brosnan is good too, and Campbell is a very effective director for this. It's definitely worth seeing, especially if you're a fan of Jackie Chan (or used to be).Watch an episode of our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/eoAny_TuUM4",The Foreigner

20,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Pleasingly different for Chan, but not in any other way",7,9 January 2018,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningQuan Ngoc Minh (Jackie Chan) picks his daughter up from school, and drives her to the high street to get some things, when a massive explosion suddenly goes off, in which she is killed. Learning that the explosion was linked to a new faction of the IRA that has sprung up, he tracks down Liam Hennessey (Pierce Brosnan), a Gerry Adams style reformist of the group that has laid down its arms, as well as Met commander Bromley (Ray Fearon), but when he gets no answers, he sets off on his own deadly mission of revenge in which his deadly past comes roaring back to the surface.Jackie Chan does away with the slapstick, tongue in cheek action comedies he was known for in the '90s, with this much darker and more brutal tale, which caused a bit of a furore in London while it was being filmed when a scene in which a bus explodes on London Bridge was mistaken for a real terrorist attack, causing commotion in nearby Hyde Park and being splashed all over the front of the Daily Mirror in shock horror. Of all the major action stars (living or dead), I'd have to say he's the one I was least in to during the glory years of the action stars, not for any personal reason, just didn't get in to his films, so I'd imagine (since I never saw it!) this is closer to Police Story in terms of its no hold barred brutality.Director Martin Campbell employs his usual dark, humourless presentation over this work, and it serves the story well. Despite being 60 plus now, Chan still delivers in the fight scenes, although he's obviously slowing down as in all there's only about two in the movie (which does include a tasty little end showdown, to be fair) and the first one's not till at least half an hour into the movie, but it's only towards the end of the movie that it suddenly creeps up on you what limited screen time he's actually had, despite being billed as the main star.The main problem here is that fundamentally, it is all little more than a simple, standard revenge tale, that has nothing to really say about the nature of terrorism or its effects, and is about twenty/thirty minutes longer than it really needed to be. It cops out, as well, refusing to get its hands dirty by resurrecting the old IRA threat, rather than being more relevant and timely by making the terrorists Islamic fanatics. That said, it's still a pleasingly intricate and thrilling story, dark, brutal and brooding, that gives Chan a chance to show another side to his repertoire at this late stage of his career. ***",The Foreigner
21,ThomasDrufke,The Chinaman,7,14 October 2017,"Pretty much every late 50's to late 60's male actor is looking for their own ""Taken"". Ever since Liam Neeson brilliantly played the revenge-father in Taken, it sure seems like their been an uprising in older actor-action films. Jackie Chan gets his chance with that in The Foreigner, based on Stephen Leather's novel, The Chinaman. In many ways, this feels like an original action film, and we just don't get many of those anymore. Chan plays a father who loses his daughter in a bombing by Irish terrorists, and risks everything to exact revenge upon the perpetrators. Pierce Brosnan (in a reunion with Bond director Martin Campbell) plays a government official, who may or may not have intel regarding the ""Authentic IRA"" bombers. Both men are playing against-type characters and are easily the best part of The Foreigner.I think the main problem that plagues the film is the lack of focus. I was under the impression that this was mostly a revenge story starring Chan. However, the film is actually probably more so about English and Irish intelligence and their inner political drama with each other. There are good chunks of them where Chan seems to disappear to make room for drama between those intelligence agencies dramatic plot points.Not that all of that isn't interesting on it's own, but I think the balance doesn't seem to be there. I would have much preferred the film to be focused solely on Chan's quest for revenge. With that said, there are plenty of inventive action sequences and hand-to-hand combat that feels like only something Jackie Chan can pull off to its fullest potential. And the against type performances are worth the price of admission alone.7.0/10",The Foreigner

28,tabuno,A Distasteful but at the same Time Good Movie,8,9 January 2019,"15 October 2017. This is one of those rather morally distasteful movies that is well let it be said is good in quality. From depicting rugged vengeance to cold-blooded torture, from the compromising of a relatively good politician to the creation of a political conspiracy, this both character-driven and action oriented mystery thriller offers up a bitter tasting, but well scripted, convoluted plot on the par with John Le Carre's Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy (1979) and the more ambiguous The Russia House (1990). While the primary focus of this movie is likely to be Jackie Chan's grim trail of vengeance filled with threats and violence, this movie is also a character-driven movie with Pierce Brosnan's much more layered and complicated character who suffers mightily at the hands of Chan's efforts to discover who killed his daughter in a bombing at the beginning of the movie. Jackie's meticulous use of special operation weapons and strategy is a welcome, if not, repugnant change in taking out people.The fighting scenes with Jackie Chan are particularly memorable for their more rough and raw hand to hand combat rather than the more lyrically choreographed almost fantasy style of martial arts that Jackie Chan is usually associated with. With the graphic bombings comes that immediate association with the actual mayhem that appears to be happening both here in the United States and Europe. The surprising movie focus on the Irish Republican Army is a politically sensitive one, one which will hopefully not heighten emotions in the more relatively quiet setting of Ireland today. The script and the direction of this movie is one of severe seriousness and no-nonsense efforts at sinister manipulation with deadly intent. This is a hard-hitting movie that except for a nobody apparently locks their cars or sheds anymore and the British army unable to keep from making a bad situation worse (probably more for dramatic impact than anything), this movie reveals deep betrayal and exacting revenge in a less than enlightened way. But no matter how one might feel about the moral ambiguity and distaste of this movie, it is well, well directed, performed movie, worth of seeing. Jackie Chan's performance here is among his best work.Other more straight forward revenge movies would be Keanu Reeve's John Wick (2014) and Nicholas Cage's Rage (2014).",The Foreigner
29,cruise01,Jackie Chan is back in his serious action role but the film was boring and disappointing.,6,12 January 2018,"Jackie Chan making it back on the big screen as an action star in The Foreigner is a good come back and a bit of a different serious role. The Foreigner is a decent action thriller, if it was not for the actors, this film would feel like a straight to tv movie with its undeveloped script, the plot was forgettable, and the action was a bit dull. The plot follows Ngoc (Jackie Chan) after losing his daughter in a terrorist bombing attack. He plans to find whoever is responsible and to kill all involved. Minister Liam (Pierce Brosnan) oversees these attacks and tries to find out who was responsible.What I liked about The Foreigner is Jackie Chan playing a serious action role. I seen his other roles from comical action movies like Rush Hour, Shanghai Noon, and others fun films. But him playing a role that is more of a vengeance story of a father taking revenge on the terrorist that killed his daughter was different. Chan did well playing an ex military, setting up traps for the bad guys, and fighting them by predicting there every move. The film does have some decent action sequences when Jackie Chan is playing cat and mouse with the Minister Liam about the people that were responsible for the bombing. What I did not like about the film is the plot was forgettable. Yes, it is about corruption with the minister that is hiding information about the bombers. Chan is tracking the terrorist down. There is twists but nothing surprising when it was pretty predictable. The script was also undeveloped. You learn a little about Chan's characters past and how loss with family has shaped to how he is now. But it was brief with his backstory. And also Pierce Brosnan's character has his political agenda may seem shady with his secretive lifestyle from the affair to his wife and hiding the terrorist track. Overall, The Foreigner is a fair film. It has its decent action to keep you entertained. Jackie Chan and Pierce Brosnan did okay with what they have on the script. The plot is boring and predictable and the script with the characters were all over the place. I rate the film 3 out of 5 stars.

As the movie opens, Quan picks up his 16 yr. Old daughter from high school to take her shopping for a dress. He drops her off at a boutique, and while he parks the car, a bomb explodes, killing his daughter and 11 others. The ""Authentic IRA"", a previously unknown IRA splinter group from Northern Ireland, claims responsibility. Northern Ireland's Deputy Prime Minister Hennessy fears this may end the 19 year old peace, and calls in all political leaders. Meanwhile, Quan decides to do to Belfast himself to track down the killers... At this point we are 15 min. Into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from British director Martin Campbell, best known for directing the James Bond films ""Goldeneye"" and ""Casino Royale"". It also marks the reunion of Campbell and Pierce Brosnan (who plays Hennessy). I know little about the movie going in, and was surprised (in the best possible way) that this turned out to be a complex and serious political action drama. This is MILES away from the silly (if entertaining) ""Rush Hour"" movies. In fact Jackie Chan (playing the role of Quan) disappears from the big screen for significant stretches of time (I'm talking more than 15 min., and more than once). The biggest surprise for me is the outstanding work from Pierce Brosnan, in his best role in YEARS, and in that sense Brosnan ends up stealing the movie. The photography of London and Belfast is eye-candy. Last but certainly not least, there is a wonderful electronic score for this movie, courtesy of composer Cliff Martinez.""The Foreigner"" was already a big hit in China by the time it was released in the US last weekend. I finally got a chance to see it this weekend. The Saturday early evening where I saw this at was attended okay but not great.

32,subxerogravity,The Foreigner? Who doesn't know Jackie Chan (Still got it)?,7,14 October 2017,"So, I'm not surprised that Jackie Chan has a dramatic side. I've seen shades of it in the latest installments of his hit Chinese franchise, Police Story. He also did a war movie in China, called Railroad Tigers that showed this off, but the Foreigner puts him on a new level. I don't think I've see Chan seek vengeance for a wrong doing like I've seen here.Chan plays an old man. It's funny watching Jackie Chan have to slow it down knowing that even at 63 he is far more impressive than what he's doing in this film, but Chan is still bedazzling at half the pace. A group of terrorist kill his daughter and the old man is on the loose trying to find the names of the men who did it, of which his focus is mostly on the man he thinks has the names, the head of the IRA played by Pierce Brosnan, who's working once again with director Martin Campbell who directed him in Golden Eye. With Brosnan on broad, you can feel a little pressure coming off of Jackie's overall performance in his first dramatic leading role in a western movie. Brosnan is the focus of a subplot about a once terrorist trying to keep his now good name. His support picks up all the slack in the film, and allows Jackie to say very little and let his actions speak louder, making him very entertainingIt's enough of the Jackie we know so it does not isolate us and enough of a different side of Chan we don't see, and he pulls it off.http://cinemagardens.com/",The Foreigner

37,kirbylee70-599-526179,Taken Further,8,30 January 2018,"Jackie Chan has been making movies far longer than most movie fans realize. His first major role in a movie here in the states came in 1980 in a film called THE BIG BRAWL/BATTLE CREEK BRAWL and the following year he was in CANNONBALL RUN. His big break through came in 1995 with RUMBLE IN THE BRONX. But Chan had been a huge star in his native China as far back as the 70s. Leave it to those of us here to fail to notice him until 20 odd years after his first successes. That all changed and now we have Chan acting in his most serious role to date in a US film.THE FOREIGNER features Chan as Quan Ngoc Minh, the owner of a small restaurant in London who takes his daughter shopping for a dress one day after school. Before she exits the store a bomb planted in a car out front explodes, killing her and several others. Despondent over the death of his daughter, Quan approaches the local police to find out who was responsible for her death but they have no clue.Then Quan sees Liam Hennessey (Pierce Brosnan), a former IRA members and now Irish politician claiming the Irish had nothing to do with the bombing. Quan approaches Liam to with a simple request. Tell him the name of the bomber in return for all the money he has. Hennessey continues to deny knowing who is responsible but Quan is persistent.The story follows two paths as it winds down to an action filled ending. One is that of Quan, who he is and his desire to see nothing more than justice for the death of his daughter. The other is the political climate between Ireland and Britain, peaceful at present but with long lasting feelings of resentment on both sides that foment into violence.As Hennessey tries to find out who is behind it all Quan continues to be a thorn in his side. Knowing full well that Hennessey is a man not to be trusted, Quan pursues Hennessey and his men to his country estate. Biding his time he waits for the answer he has posed time and time again to Hennessey, who is responsible. It isn't until late in the film that we finally find out for certain who was behind it all.The movie felt a lot like the TAKEN films starring Liam Neeson. A daughter affected by the actions of bad men being tracked down by a father with the skills necessary to do them bodily harm. What makes this different, aside from the fact his daughter dies in the opening moments of the film, is the performance provided by Chan here.For years his persona has revolved around the smiling Chinaman caricature, the bumbling yet acrobatic martial artists who gets by on charm and humor. This time around that humor is non-existent. It's replaced by a man whose pain at the loss of his daughter palpable. It shows in his eyes, in his body movements and his behavior. This is a Chan that we're not used to and he does an amazing job here. Sadly enough while it's a dynamic game changing performance on his part, most will ignore it and focus only on the stunt/action sequences he's involved in instead.Director Martin Campbell is no inexperienced director when it comes to action films. With movies like THE MASK OF ZORRO, GOLDENEYE, CASINO ROYALE and EDGE OF DARKNESS in his resume he uses all his skills to make the story here work on all levels. The frustration of a man seeking answers, the duplicity of politicians and the revenge fueled violence that finalizes the film are all deftly handled to make this a movie that touches the heart while satisfying the action fan at the same time.One can only hope Chan makes more movies like this. He's said before that he's always dreamt of an Oscar on his shelf. That may not happen with this film but he shows he has the potential to be a solid actor and not just another martial arts star only. Looking at the films being released by both Jean Claude Van Damme and Steven Seagal, Chan shows his acting chops are far and above others in this category. Now if only someone would show the courage to provide him with a role up to his abilities.",The Foreigner
38,kluseba,"Pierce Brosnan, Martin Campbell and Jackie Chan are back in the game",10,20 November 2017,"Jackie Chan is an incredibly skilled actor but he has often chosen rather uninteresting roles that limit him to slapstick comedy and a few fight scenes in exchangeable family movies like Kung Fu Yoga and Chinese Zodiac. His last entirely interesting movie was the historical drama 1911 six years ago but even that movie was flawed due to its propagandistic vibe. And suddenly, Jackie Chan is back with a bang in The Foreigner. Almost nobody saw that coming. And instead of focusing on gags and choreography, this film respects Jackie Chan as a serious actor. He plays a former special forces operator, refugee and family father who loses his single daughter in a terrorist attack and wants to track down the criminals behind this unspeakable act by any means necessary. Jackie Chan manages to find a perfect balance between playing a broken old man, a clever and strategic fighter with an intact moral compass and a pitiless avenger. As a viewer, you sympathize with this authentic and diversified character with authentic flaws and strengths. The Foreigner might actually be the best acting performance in Jackie Chan's incredibly long career.In addition to an outstanding Jackie Chan, this movie features other great actors such as the charismatic Pierce Brosnan. His performance as Jackie Chan's determined, influential and manipulative antagonist might be his best since his departure from the James Bond franchise one and a half decades ago. The different supporting characters of mostly Chinese or Irish origin are also quite convincing.As if that weren't enough, the story of the movie is so addicting because it's quite authentic. The topic of the Irish Republican Army has been used many times before but only very few films show the corruption, ideology and struggle behind it like this film does. The movie is based upon Stephen Leather's novel The Chinaman and the detailed movie shows that it's quite faithful to the source material.The film convinces with a balanced mixture of action, crime and drama elements and equally focuses on developing the main characters, offering diversified action sequences from exploding buildings over hand-to-hand combats to home invasions and perpetually raising the tension of the film until a stunning showdown. Exposition, rising action, climax, falling action and resolution are all cleverly developed.The skilled directing by an experienced Martin Campbell who had already collaborated with Pierce Brosnan in the past is the cherry on the cake of a flawless film. The locations are simple but efficient, the lighting techniques add to the respective moods of the scenes and the well-integrated soundtrack always blends in.In the end, The Foreigner deserves the attention and praise it already gets and would even deserve more.

A cat and mouse story played out in jolting layers. Expertly investing the viewer increasingly as it unfolds. Jackie Chan gives a superior dramatic performance. Chan's character Quan rises above the action which only serves his role as a grieving father on a mission. Pierce Brosnan nails the cold double- dealing of a politician who supposedly turned from violence only to still harbor hate, now with materialistic greed added, cloaked on the surface by a veneer of respectability. This movie has a edgy feel almost from the start. That tension never lets up as Chan's character Quan who has lost everything uses all of his skills to go around two governments for the justice he must personally deliver.

Anyway - when Jackie is on screen the film is phenomenal. Not just the action but his bada## training and p#ssed off emotional stuff; in fact the film could have used more of it. So regrettably this film does not live up to what we were expecting.",The Foreigner
43,masonsaul,Great political thriller,8,29 August 2021,"Despite its title character feeling sidelined occasionally, The Foreigner is a great political thriller that's extremely tense, gripping and emotional with a mostly strong balance between action and political intrigue. Jackie Chan and Pierce Brosnan both give great performances. Martin Campbell's direction is fantastic, it's extremely well filmed with solid action sequences. It's well paced and the music by Cliff Martinez is excellent.",The Foreigner
44,davidmvining,Top notch action and solid storytelling,7,21 April 2020,"Martin Campbell may not be an auteur, but he is certainly a competent craftsman with an eye for well executed physical action. Not everything he makes hits the mark (The Legend of Zorro is a misfire more attributable to the poorly written script than anything on Campbell's part), but he's managed to direct two of the best Bond pictures. Pairing him with Jackie Chan, well known for his own brand of physical action, was a smart move. The script has some issues, but the pair do manage to bring it all together in the end.My problems with the film really extend to just its first half or so. The tale it's trying to tell is overly complicated in a way that I don't think is all that necessary, and its ties to real world politics starts out feeling wrong somehow before clearing it up through personal character connections later in the film. I think the title is a bit misleading as well. I don't hold titles against movies ever, and I'm not starting now, but Jackie Chan's Quan is more of an elemental force that shows up at times and helps drive the actual main character, Pierce Brosnan's Liam Hennessy, to action at a faster clip than he would otherwise want.So, an IRA offshoot cell detonates a bomb in a London dress shop where Quan's only remaining daughter has run in ahead of him to get a dress for a school function. Quan is racked with guilt after having lost his first two daughters in his escape from Vietnam decades earlier already, and the loss of his third daughter seems to drain him of any emotion. He seems to stop being a human being and becomes a weapon in a 60-year-old restaurateur's body. He gives up his shop to his loyal employee and heads out into the world to find his daughter's killer.At the same time, Liam Hennessy, the deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland, receives the news of the explosion and the connection to the IRA with a mixture of disbelief and anger. As a former member of the IRA and current political leader of Sinn Fein, he lives and works as a bridge between the English crown and the Irish who have agreed to an unsteady truce after decades of violence. He has to make both sides happy by finding the bombers for the crown while not pushing the Irish men who could easily take up arms again against the crown. It's this part, which takes up a large chunk of the first half of the film, where I think the movie fails. It's a bit confusingly presented, perhaps expecting a level of knowledge of the Irish/English situation that I simply did not have (like what the First Minister of Northern Ireland actually was), and it seems to get a bit lost in the details. Ultimately, it pays off, but I do wish that this part had been streamlined a bit more.Anyway, the two characters converge as Quan politely asks his way up the chain of command for the names of the bombers, convinced that someone in the government at some level knows and simply won't tell him. He ends up focusing on Hennessy exclusively, becoming a terrorist in his own way to pressure Hennessy into revealing what Quan thinks he knows. How this first really manifests feels weird to me (Quan sees Hennessy at his office, gets rebuffed, blows up a small bomb in the bathroom hurting no one, and Hennessy refuses to give up Quan to the police). I don't see why Hennessy wouldn't give Quan up immediately instead of trying to alternatively protect Quan and then take him out himself even with the information the movie reveals later.Once past that, though, the movie begins to hum along at a much smoother clip. With the first half establishing the terrorist cell, it's offshoot status, Quan's quest, and Hennessy's need to find the bombers (both from the crown and from Quan's threats), the movie actually becomes a thriller against the clock as Hennessy tries to smoke out the Irish leader that the cell is reporting to, it goes wrong, and Quan becomes more dangerous.Brosnan, I think, is the real heart of the film. He plays a slippery man, but he's more naïve than bad. He's simply gotten in way over his head, hoping to not hurting anyone but finding himself to be the impetus that ignited a series of events that lead to deaths. His increasing panic as he tries to keep his head above water is what drives the film, especially the latter half. Chan, on the other hand, isn't asked to do much in the acting department. With the death of his daughter, as I said earlier, Quan becomes elemental, almost stonelike in his quest for vengeance and justice. He keeps a rather muted and sad expression for the bulks of the film when he's not doing action stunts. It's an effective play for Chan, but Quan, once he decides to use his American special ops training, is more a living weapon than a character.So, it's a bit messy at times, especially in its first half, but I think that its second half really does pull the whole package together rather well. The action is top notch and Brosnan provides a strong emotional basis on which to build the tension.",The Foreigner
45,rgkarim,Not Foreign To Plot Or Edge,8,13 October 2017,"Jackie Chan a legend in the cinematic world for many famous roles many will remember for years to come. With epic Marshal Arts sequences, a sense of comedic delivery and great chemistry with a variety of actors, it is no wonder the man has been involved in so many projects. And after a hiatus, the legend seems to be making a comeback lending his voice to Lego Ninjago and now returning in a live action film the Foreigner. Does the man still have the magic, or was he better left sitting on the sidelines? Robbie K here to review another movie and as always let's get started. LIKES:Edgy: The trailers promised Chan would be returning with some sharper, and darker, edges and sure enough they delivered. Mr. Quan is certainly one of the darker roles I've seen him play, as he seeks out his own brand of justice in a manner only a vigilante could. No punches are thrown in this role, and this more intense role is a nice touch to Chan's normal lighter roles. Saying few words, Chan has the look down with sullen wise eyes filled with a hateful, hopeless stare, and scowl that seems permanently fixated in a faithless fury. This darker role was fascinating to watch, primarily to see how far he would go to crush the opposition. Fairly fast pacing: No surprise here, but the Foreigner moves at a fairly brisk pace, starting out with a literal bang and diving into the search to come. Information is provided in a fairly linear manner so that you get all the answers you need, all the while maximizing the ""action"" at the same time. Complete story: Despite the quickened pace, this movie does manage to close all the convoluted loops established in this film. The Foreigner has a lot of dramatic elements integrated into the action that include affairs, conspiracies, and betrayals that feels much like soap opera plot lines. Rather than taking episodes to finish these tales, the writers provided all the answers one needs to be satisfied with the closure. Not saying it's the best closure mind you, but at least it finishes the tale quite well. Chan's moves: While certainly not the freshest or more convoluted stunts he's ever done, it is satisfying to see Chan still have some of his magic. The Foreigner does a nice job of giving our star chances to show off his acrobatic skills. After leaping around like an old squirrel, Chan next dazzles with his close combat choreographer, still executing his close style fist fights in a smooth dance. And with the new edge, Chan's darker combat is unleashed, losing the feeling of being planned to the adrenaline rush we love to see. DISLIKES:Pierce Brosnan's accent: A minor dislike at best, I couldn't get on board with Brosnan's attempt at sounding Irish. While certainly better than me, the former Bond star has a little more refining to do in order to sell the angry Irish man to me. It was comical at times and took away from the threat he was trying to bring to the table, well that and the fact that he didn't seem to have many skills himself. Sorry Pierce, you've got debonair down, but not the fury of the fiery reds. Editing: While dramas are sometimes a bit overbearing to me, I could handle most of the character antics in this film. However, the storyboard team dropped the ball a few times for me in how much they crammed into this film. Some of the relationships were not needed, merely extra branches to take up space in attempt to fill up time. While the tangents expand a little on our two lead characters, they could have been left out, or kept in small bits of dialogues instead of full out sequences, especially when it came to the wife scenes. Drama lovers will certainly enjoy this element, but the rest get ready to yawn. Speaking of whichNot as action packed: I thought the Foreigner was going to have more bite with Chan finally emerging from his retirement. Instead of the energy that Rush Hour and Shanghai Noon brought, the Foreigner slowed the pace down a bit. Those extensive bouts of fist punching are brought to a minimum in terms of time, reduced to some covert moves that would make Rambo proud in their pyrotechnic awe. The few bouts we do have maximize the new tone and provide some satisfying stunt work, but for me it paled to the classics I grew up with. Still not a bad display for the aged master, I just would have liked more of that and less drama. The VERDICT:The Foreigner is a great restart to Chan's career giving him a new edge I haven't seen before. It's a film that does its part as an action drama, trying to craft more of a story with the action to support it in the long run. And while the tale is decent, and complete, it's still a bit too slow and drawn out when there could have been more fighting. The result is still entertaining, but with enough drab parts to outweigh the extent of action we got. Chan may still have some moves up his sleeve, but I'll take revisiting the classics any day. Nevertheless, there is enough kick to warrant a theater visit for this one, primarily in regards to those satisfying, climactic fights that occur. My scores are:Action/Thriller: 8.0 Movie Overall: 7.0",The Foreigner
46,yoggwork,we can see how bad Jackie Chan really is,5,23 February 2019,"If there is no level of film, it is considered by many as Jackie Chan's best work in 10 years, we can see how bad Jackie Chan really is. The whole plot is as fragmented as the Chu River and the Han Dynasty, a line of lonely heroes and a line of politicians. Except for a few rival plays, there is absolutely no point of convergence between the two sides. Looking at Pierce, I think Jackie Chan is redundant. Looking at Jackie Chan, I think it is very cumbersome to give Northern Ireland so many shots. The whole logic is less than 10 years old (hold up two chestnuts, find someone who doesn't check the license plate, search the mountain without putting a dog)",The Foreigner
47,bkrauser-81-311064,A Terrorist Terrorizes a Terrorist to find Tangentially Related Terrorists,6,17 October 2017,"If you plan on watching The Foreigner you need to know two things right off the bat. One: Jackie Chan doesn't actually star in the film. Oh, he's in it, don't get it twisted, but the way the film is written and directed, the international film icon and famed martial artist is actually on the screen for about 40% of the time. Most of the film we're actually following former IRA member, current PM and owner of a hellavalot of dirty laundry Liam Hennessey (Brosnan). He ends up playing Counselor Bowden to Jackie Chan's Max Cady a dynamic that first proves interesting at first but gets muddied before too long.Let me back up a bit. The Foreigner tells the tale of Quan Ngoc Minh (Chan) a humble Londoner whose sole remaining daughter (Leung) becomes the victim of a bombing perpetrated by a group calling themselves the ""New IRA"". Utilizing his ""particular set of skills,"" Quan goes on a one-man search of his daughters killers, setting his sights on Hennessey who may hold the key to their whereabouts.The kicker is (and spoilers abound by this point), Hennessey doesn't actually know who the bombers are. He certainly knows more than he's letting on and objectively knows more that Quan about the matter but he's not exactly the bad guy Quan is looking for. That of course doesn't stop him from camping out behind Hennessey's farm and going Rambo on a bunch of black clad lackeys unwilling to give him names. And because Hennessey and his brood are compelled to handle things the North Irish way, the 63-year-old Jackie Chan has more than enough henchmen to keep him busy.The irony of course is Hennessey already has enough pressure to find the bombers without Jackie Chan breathing down his neck. Everyone from the antsy Minister Davies (Williams) to British Intelligence, headed by Commander Bromley (Fearon) is looking for their pound of flesh. The mounting pressure is occasionally palpable but never really gels with the narrative's murky morality and cleverer-than-thou ambitions. And because the eventual plan to uncover the bombers comes with an agreed-to time-stamp, when the inevitable gun is aimed at Brosnan's head instead of the audience thinking ""give him a reason to you evil p***k,"" I for one was thinking ""just pack your s**t and go home already!"" Which brings me to the second thing you should know: Jackie Chan's character is not only unnecessary to the plot but if not for pure luck, could have made things worse. The end of Quan's terrorism campaign (I call it as I see it) goes more-or-less how you'd expect beat-wise, but because there's an added plot complication, Jackie's final battle is bogged down from being a true action-genre climax. In a weird way we're almost rooting against him going Old Testament on these goons because then there'd be no one left for the final reveal. Thank goodness amid Quan's years of being trained as a killing machine they never taught him to notice when someone is playing possum.On the other hand, if the movie ended any other way it could have been imbued with some kind of lazily construed point. As the movie stands, the only point that really hits home is Jackie Chan is still pretty damn awesome. For action junkies, that's probably enough, but for those looking for more The Foreigner is simultaneously too convoluted and too dim for its own good.",The Foreigner

This is easily Jackie's best performance and one of Brosnan's best, as he was very much against type. Both were in a bit of genius. Campbell did an awesome job in the directing chair.

53,maurice_yacowar,Chinese father avenges terrorist killing of his daughter,7,14 November 2017,"Jackie Chan's Quan is the ""foreigner"" not just because he's ""the chinaman"" (as it happens: the politically incorrect title of the source novel) but because he is the only main character of principle and honour. All the other figures — whether in politics or in terrorism —eagerly betray each other. Ethics and loyalty are foreign to them all. In the initial contrast, Quan dedicates himself to avenging the bomb killing of his last daughter (his other two having been killed by Thai pirates). Meanwhile, the ex-IRA Hennessy, now the Deputy Minister for Ireland, betrays his wife and marriage with an affair. His mistress betrays him on behalf of the new Irish terrorists. As tit for tat, Hennessy's wife betrays him both maritally and politically. When she seduces Hennessy's nephew, blood runs thinner than betrayal. Unfaithful in love, Hennessy is unsurprisingly exposed as a political turncoat as well. On all sides. The film presents modern civilization as a snake pit. For Quan, the one person of integrity, ""Politicians and terrorists, they are just two ends of the same snake."" Hennessy's difference: ""One end bites and the other doesn't."" As Hennessy ultimately learns, the politicians can be as destructive and dishonourable as the terrorists.Here's the interesting point. At a time when the West is hung up on radical Islamic terrorism, abandoning their principles in fear of coloured attackers, this film establishes an Asian as its hero and moral centre, while resurrecting the all-white terrorism the Irish inflicted upon the British. This film refutes with history and drama the hypocrisy of white supremacy.This excellent thriller smartly addresses our times.",The Foreigner

55,rockman182,The Foreigner (2017),6,16 October 2017,"I haven't seen Jackie Chan in forever, so I guess this film could be touted as his comeback film. The film trailer or hype surrounding it didn't do much to build excitement for me, but hey Moviepass means I'm there to watch anything. At the very least I was expecting an all out frenetic action film. After watching this film is quite unspectacular and leaves a lot to be desired. Its nice to see Chan back in Hollywood but the films is rather unremarkable.Jackie Chan plays a hardened father with a dangerous past who loses his daughter in a terrorist bombing by the IRA. He goes to a powerful man and former leader of the IRA, played by Pierce Brosnan, and demands the names of those responsible for killing his daughter. Trouble ensues and Chan threatens Brosnans character for the names and singlehandedly tries to bring justice.Chan is good in this film no doubt. He has done a lot of comedy in recent years but he puts in a fine tuned serious role. When he does do fight scenes it's good but it seems very sparse. The film spends too much time focusing on the different pieces of the IRA and how they planning their next moves. A large part of this is just uninteresting. It trudges along and its hard to care less for the political points.The action scenes are nice but not worth it to sit through a mostly dull action thriller. Fans of Jackie Chan will be happy to see him return but it could have been way better than what we were given.

59,jon.h.ochiai,Jackie Chan at his best,8,15 October 2017,"This is a different Jackie Chan in Director Martin Campbell's ""The Foreigner"", and that's a great thing. Chan plays 60 year-old Chinese restaurant owner Quan Ngoc Minh, who lives in London. His life unravels when his teenage daughter Fan, played by bright Katie Leung, is murdered in the rogue IRA terrorist bombing. In the heart wrenching scene First Responders discover bloodied Quan holding Fan in his arms amidst the ruble. After recovering from his wounds with the care of his dear friend Lam, compassionate pretty Tao Liu, Quan seeks vengeance upon his daughter's murderers. Chan is compelling in sadness and controlled fury, so different than his usual whimsical persona. Martin Campbell, who directed Bond's ""Casino Royale"", smartly orchestrates the action after a slow start. Campbell takes a little too much time at the beginning. The screenplay by David Marconi, based on Stephen Leather's novel ""The Chinaman"" at times in overly convoluted with multiple layers of embedded betrayal. The methodical set up dilutes the powerful impact of the terrorist attack and the impact upon Chan's Quan. The rogue IRA attack surprises Liam Hennessy, played by very good Pierce Brosnan, who is the Irish Minister reporting to the British Prime Minister. Liam was a leader in the IRA 19 years ago. He is a complicated man to say the least. He has a wife Mary, suffering Orla Brady, who never forgave him for the death of her brother. Liam is having an affair with young Maggie, played by strong Charlie Murphy.Quan wants the names of the men responsible for Fan's murder, and determines that Liam is the man. Suddenly, Quan goes all MacGyver building explosives and the like. And for the mild mannered grieving restaurant owner Quan stuns Liam's henchmen in disposing them with kung fu mastery. Liam is not facing just some middle aged Chinese man. He calls upon his nephew Sean, stalwart Rory Fleck Byrne, to track down rival Quan. Campbell wisely lets the action play out as he reveals Quan's secret past. Jackie Chan is the amazing physical presence. At 65 years old he did most of, if not all of his action sequences. He is the true master of his art. What is refreshing is that his fighting has gravity to it like his performance. Chan and Campbell capture the urgency and profound sorrow of their Hero. He fights not so much out of revenge, rather out of love and justice. Chan is phenomenal taking on villains in the forest. The climactic fight of the narrative arc is cathartic. Chan gives his best and most compassionate performance. ""The Foreigner"" may get bogged down in the beginning due to the complicated exposition. Once it catches its breath and unleashes Chan, it soars. It would be nice to see further adventures for Chan's Quan. We shall see.",The Foreigner
60,Holt344,The Foreigner is a memorable thriller with Jackie Chan and Pierce Brosnan playing their parts brilliantly,8,23 October 2021,"The Foreigner surprised me as a great thriller and well Jackie Chan surprised me the most with a role that breaks him from being type cast as the usual action hero, Jackie Chan plays the role of Quan brilliantly thus showing off the acting skills. It's such an amazing and relatable character. The other lead actor in the film is Pierce Brosnan as Liam Hennessy, who also does a brilliant performance. Brosnan is of course the better actor between the two, but Jackie Chan stands out the most as I have only seen him in action roles. The story follows Quan, whose long-buried past erupts in a revenge-fueled vendetta when the only person left for him to love - his teenage daughter - is taken from him in a senseless act of politically-motivated terrorism. In his relentless search for the identity of the terrorists, Quan is forced into a cat- and-mouse conflict with a Irish government official Liam Hennessy, whose own past may hold clues to the identities of the elusive killers.The film is directed by Martin Campbell and written by David Marconi, based on the 1992 novel The Chinaman by Stephen Leather. I didn't expect this film to be this well written, nor this well shot. David Tattersall served as the cinematographer and deserves praise for the work he did. Superb camera work and just the look of the film is perfect for a thriller. But what I knew would be perfect is the direction, Martin Campbell is a fantastic director with films like GoldenEye, Casino Royale and The Mask of Zorro under his belt. This is also a reunion of the actor Pierce Brosnan and director Martin Campbell who worked on GoldenEye. I got nothing but praise for Campbell's direction and vision for this project.This isn't just a thriller, with Jackie Chan in a film you can bet there are action, though not a lot but the action sequences we do get is choreographed brilliantly by Chan and well shot by Martin Campbell who is used to action sequences from the Bond franchise. But The Foreigner is a great thriller that offers something new to the genre, whilst keeping a sense of realism to the story. Though I liked most of it, I felt the second half could have been longer for more character development and going deeper into the terrorist group. But it's clear that the film is about the characters that Jackie Chan and Pierce Brosnan plays, their character arcs was interesting but could have been improved with a slightly longer run time.",The Foreigner
61,RforFilm,"The Foreigner delivers on some Jackie Chan action, but be aware that this is a political thriller first",6,18 October 2017,"I'll admit that I was excited to see The Foreigner. Not for the story or the action, but for the fact that we're getting a new Jackie Chan movie in America. Though a lot of kids today don't remember him, but from the mid nineties through the early 2000s, Jackie Chan was a Chinese martial artist who unexpectedly rose up to the action hero ranks of Stallone and Schwarzenegger. But unlike the big stature of Schwarzenegger, Chan had some of the fastest reflexes and spectacular fighting skills that we haven't seen since Bruce Lee. His playful personality made him popular worldwide, especially with children. So what happened?Where Jackie Chan went wrong was picking film roles that were either too fantastical (which doesn't work well with martial artists) or simply not funny. After the travesty of The Spy Next Door, Chan seemed to go back to China do films over there. His presence in the US was limited and seemed to fade out. Even with his age, Chan has proved that he still has the skills to pull off action scenes. So with The Foreigner, Jackie Chan not only has a chance to show that he can still carry an action film, but he can even play against his type. A retired special forced Vietnam veteran Quan (played by Jackie Chan) immigrated to the UK years ago and now runs a Chinese restaurant. A car bomb goes off, killing his teenage daughter. With no family left, the only thing on his mind is justice. He first goes to Scotland Yard to try and get then names, but finds no information. He then turns of Irish deputy minister Liam Hennessy (played by Pierce Brosnan) who was outspoken of his past a part of the Irish Republican Army. Phone calls don't seem to be working, so Quan travels to Ireland to confront Hennessy.I honestly don't want to give the rest away as anymore would spoil certain parts of the story. The Foreigner is a political thriller in a disguised action movie. Does it pay off. I think it does as long as your willing to sit through a lot of political talk and corruption. It's stuff that we've seen before, but I found it intriguing enough to want to see through the end. It's helped by the fact that both Jackie Chan and Pierce Brosnan are phenomenal in their parts. What's unfortunate is that both of the leads are just as good as they were when they were popular, and yet we don't see them as much as we used to. Though it's hard to place blame, I think it's definitely an age discrimination issue. The studios assume that audiences are only going to want to see younger stars take on the world, and leave their older actors out in the rain. It's bad for film and doesn't paint ourselves in a positive light. Going back to the stars, Jackie Chan is just as much of an action hero as he was before. What he does different in The Foreigner is that he's forced to give himself a more vulnerable look. On the surface, he looks like a quiet older Asian whose nonthreatening. He accomplishes what Liam Neeson couldn't do in Taken; He appears that no one would ever suspect him. This could have not been easy for him (especially later on when we see how fit Chan really is), but this shows how well of a dramatic actor Chan is as well of an action star. Speaking of which, you definitely get the action you'd expect. It's not as much Kung Fu, but simple defense. I'll give this six Irish Republican Army propaganda posters out of ten. This movie doesn't offer much new in terms of revenge stories, but it was at least entertaining. Those that want simple Jackie Chan action will get it, but they have to be willing to sit through a political thriller to get it.

62,bankofmarquis,A good comeback for Jackie Chan,8,16 October 2017,"Jackie Chan is back, ladies and gentlemen!  And the political/action/revenge thriller he has chosen as his comeback is a wise choice - action packed, exciting but very, very serious.Jackie stars as Quan Ngoc Minh (he's called Quan throughout the film) a father of a teenager who is overly protective of her.  When his daughter is killed by an IRA terrorist bomb (this is not a spoiler, it was shown in the trailers and happens in the first 5 minutes of the film), Quan turns out to have a ""certain set of skills"" that will help him identify and hunt down those responsible.Part TAKEN, part PATRIOT GAMES and part RAMBO, Quan gets caught up in a much larger game of political intrigue and terrorism as he seeks to bring to justice those that harmed his daughter.Chan is a welcome sight back on the big screen.  But be aware - this is a dour, serious Chan - I don't think he breaks a smile throughout the course of this film.  His character has a minimal amount of lines and - as we expect from a Jackie Chan film - he is a man of action and not words.And the action is terrific. Chan, now 63 years old, seems to be doing most of his own stunts and age hasn't slowed him much at all.  It was great fun to see him jumping around, beating up the bad guys and flying down drainpipes and over vehicles.  Jackie still has it.Since Chan is silent and dour, the lion's share of the emotion, plotting and energy of this film falls to the chief antagonist - Pierce Brosnan's Liam Hennessy - who just might know more than he is letting on about the bombing.  Brosnan has aged gracefully, post-James Bond, and he continues to surprise me with the depth of his performances.  He makes a good adversary to Chan.Also making a comeback, of sorts, is Director Martin Campbell - who Directed Daniel Craig as James Bond in CASINO ROYALE and Brosnan himself  as Bond in GOLDENEYE.  Campbell hasn't directed a Major Motion Picture since the 2011 flop, THE GREEN LANTERN.  It is good to see the practiced eye and steady hand of a veteran Director at the helm.Be warned - this film is not all action - Campbell spends much of his time on the political maneuvering of Brosnan with Chan jumping in (literally) to spoil plans time and again, so be ready for that type of film, not a RUSH HOUR fun romp.  If you do, you'll be rewarded, indeed.Letter Grade A-8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)",The Foreigner

65,Vivekmaru45,Not even worth as a timepass film. I have seen better Jackie Chan/Pierce Brosnan movies.,3,22 January 2018,"The Foreigner is a 2017 action thriller film directed by Martin Campbell and written by David Marconi, based on the 1992 novel The Chinaman by Stephen Leather. Jackie Chan and Pierce Brosnan play the main characters in the film.The film is more or less an aftermath-revenge drama. It also shows the aspects of hidden agenda's and dirty politics present in the world today.
I would not call this film an action thriller in the same light as better films of this genre Commando(1985), Die Hard(1988) and Rambo 3(1988) are good examples.Jackie Chan's movies are known for his death-defying stunt scenes. However in this film he is lackluster. Pierce Brosnan acting talent is superb as always however the script of this film does not enhance his role.Verdict: for me the film lacked in entertainment/rewatchability value so I would not recommend this one.",The Foreigner

A new Chapter of Chan!Rating 10 out of 10",The Foreigner
67,abisio,Best political thriller and best Jackie movie in many years,10,15 October 2017,"Let's clarify a few things. If you are looking for a cerebral and complex movie; with unexpected turns, almost perfect dialog and outstanding acting; do not hesitate one minute and get to see The Foreigner. If you are looking for a popcorn flick full of non-sense action this might not be the movie for you; but see it anyway because you are going to love it!!!!. The story starts like many others; the daughter of a businessman is killing during a terrorist attack; and her father is looking for the terrorists who did it. Well the father is Jackie Chang; so you can not expect things to be quiet.The attack occurred in London and caused by IRA. Enters the picture the Irish deputy minister; a very astute politician and former IRA member (played by Pierce Brosnan) who while trying to resolve who caused the attack has to deal with the parent ""hard to ignore"" insistence and methods; which basically consist in bombing and attacking the Deputies minister office and home until obtaining the names of the responsible.The movie takes two different roads; trying to find the terrorists; a pure political matter that is better not disclose here and stop Jackie's violent attempts to find the truth.While the end is predictable; the trip is the really important part; and believe is a hell of a trip.The acting is perfect; Jackie plays a 61 years old simple minded guy but with a very dark past. When despair and frustration control him; things get very ugly. Jackie physical acting is impressive. When he is offering his saving to a police chief in exchange for the terrorist names; his eyes are full of tears and one feel the needs to hug him and cry. He is an old guy but not the kind you can ignore.Brosnan however is the BIG revelation here. He has always been a good actor; but as an Irish politician with obvious skeletons in the closet; he is able to play with your mind going for very worried person to an abusive and cheating husband. He is mesmerizing in every scene.In terms of action and violence; well this not a comedy so the action is violent, many people die and everything is kept as realist as possible.Martin Campbell is an experienced director; and knows how to get the most of the complex script. Nothing is that simple; betrayals are everywhere.In brief; it is an excellent movie and a serious one. Worth your time",The Foreigner
68,mikayakatnt,"A darker, serious action flick with political undertones",7,23 March 2020,"The Foreigner is a darker, somber action flick starring Jackie Chan & Pierce Brosnan.The conflict revolves around a personal vendetta that Quan ( Jackie Chan ) has after a rogue IRA attack kills his daughter. He plays the serious, depressed father who will stop at nothing to get his revenge... and it somehow works for this film. Pierce Brosnan plays Minister Hennessy who's IRA past he can't seem to escape from.Though Martin Campbell did an excellent job in casting these A-list stars, I felt as if he could have fleshed out. Particularly for Brosnan's role. Brosnan is a reactive character for most of the movie that gets bullied by the other characters. He doesn't have real say in his actions till later in this film. A shame since I know Brosnan is capable of much more.Action and set design are top-notch. David Tattersall in cinematography does a superb job of paying homage to the fragile peace of Northern Ireland. Jackie Chan does what he does best in doing all his own stunts. All gun-fights, knife-fights, and fisticuffs feel real and authentic.The pacing of the film is rather systematic and calculated, parallelling Quan's character in the film. Though some suspense of reality is broken by Quan's near invincibility. But these types of films is never meant to be too deep.3.5/5. Great watch on a rainy day.",The Foreigner
69,Carycomic,"""Politicans and terrorists are just two different ends of the same snake.""",10,6 November 2017,"First off, I'm probably one of the few people who read the original Stephen Leather novel when it was first published under its now politically incorrect title. But, I liked it then; and I still do now. I'm just surprised it took somebody so long to turn it into a movie!That's one of the reasons why there are a few crucial differences between the book and the final draft of the movie. In the twenty- five years since the publication of the former, the majority of the British army of occupation has left Northern Ireland. There is now a somewhat tense ceasefire similar to that between North and South Korea. Ergo; the first bombing in the opening moments of the film is ""justified"" (to the London newspapers) as a campaign against economic exploitation of Northern Ireland by British banks.Another change is in the title character. In the novel, he was an ex-Kit Carson (American nickname for VietCong defectors who scouted for the Green Berets during the Vietnam War). In the film, he's apparently a Nung/Zhuang (Chinese sub-culture who also fought on the anti-Communist side during the war) from Guangxi Province in mainland China.What hasn't changed is the title character's motivation. The death of his only remaining daughter as ""collateral damage"" from the first bombing.Jackie Chan departs from his usually lighter-hearted roles in playing Mr. Quon; a sixty-year-old warrior-turned-grieving father. He even simulates the limitations that come with that age! Allowing Quon's pursuers to get in some very painful licks. Although, he still manages to kick their butts, of course.Pierce Brosnan is similarly almost _too_ convincing as a former IRA unit commander-turned-aging politician whose rivals think he's gotten too soft. Only to learn, too late, how badly they misjudged him. In fact, I think this character of Brosnan's is more ruthless than Taffin (his first post-REMINGTON STEEL role) and The November Man, put together!All in all, I was most pleased with the final product I saw on screen. And fans of edge-of-the-seat political thrillers will not be disappointed.",The Foreigner

It was interesting to see him play against type as a solemn, vengeful father. I also enjoyed seeing Pierce Brosnan reunite with his director for GoldenEye and he gets plenty of moments to chew the scenery. The action is solid and has some inspired choreography. The Foreigner is a slight cut above most generic action films.",The Foreigner
72,CANpatbuck3664,Expertly Made Political Thriller With Some Really Good Performances,9,28 January 2018,"If you saw the trailer for The Foreigner ahead of time, it honestly looked like a knock-off of Taken starring Jackie Chan. It wasn't until I started reading reviews that I learned that this was a political/espionage thriller with some action sprinkled in. This was a pleasant surprise because we don't need another Taken type franchise and seeing Jackie Chan in this type of movie made me that much more intrigued. Starting with the plot, I thought this was a sterling example of writing a relatively realistic story of political corruption and terrorism. They interweave subplots and characters in and out of the narrative with artistry and the movie never lost that feeling of tension for me. The story was never boring, and I was with it right up until the end. They honestly could have made this without the action scenes and I still think I would have enjoyed it (even though it was good they did, who doesn't enjoy watching Jackie Chan do his thing?). The drama in it is also effective, they really drive home not only how terrorism costs lives but the impact it has in shifting perception towards a cause. The plot by the IRA has a specific target and a specific goal but the damage they do has a horrific result as shown through Quan and the loss of his daughter. This is also presented in realistic light with all the hard emotion at the forefront. There are similar movies out there to the Foreigner so while it didn't reinvent the wheel, they accomplished what they set out to do and they did it better than most.There are a lot of actors in this movie, but it boils down to 2 of them. Despite what the trailers suggest, this is actually Brosnan's movie and I thought he was great. This is a very tough character, Liam's motivations are convoluted and even though he's doing numerous backdoor deals for his own gain, through Brosnan you can still identify with Hennessy. He's understated enough to avoid chewing the scenery but energetic enough to get the material across. This was also a unique role for Jackie Chan. We all love Jackie, he's the best at what he does, and I can recall so many moments as a kid laughing or smiling watching him do his thing in the Rush Hour franchise or Shanghai Noon. This movie hinges on his acting ability and he pulls it off. There's a lot of subtlety to his work and I applaud him for it. The rest of the cast is good, Michael McElhatton, Ray Fearon and Rory Fleck-Byrne deserve credit in each of their respective supporting roles.The last thing I want to talk about regarding the Foreigner was I liked how the movie had a willingness to play with morality and complex characters. The movie lacks an uncompromising hero and a mustache-twirling villain. Everyone does good and bad things, Liam and Quan both have complicated pasts and are trying to find a path to redemption in their own way. You understand both sides of the equation, Quan wants justice on his terms and no one will stop him from making sure he gets it. Liam has his own endgame but he's trying to maintain peace and he's getting it from all sides when the initial bombing happens. I like movies where the answers aren't easy to solve, and morality isn't black or white. You wouldn't be able to spend 3 hours with these characters but they more than carried the movie over its almost 2 hour running time. The only problem I had with this movie (and I think its understandable) is that the action was a little choppy. This had to be because of Jackie Chan getting older and not being able to fly around like he used to. I don't think it will bother everyone, but I was able to catch it. He did it well enough to keep the movie entertaining, but the action wasn't as tight because of it.This movie was a pleasant surprise. I tend to like movies in this genre, but this was still better than I expected it to be. I credit director Martin Campbell and his team for shooting and editing it down to be a lean and tense movie. I also tip my hat to the screenwriter David Marconi and the author of the novel Stephen Leather for putting together an interesting plot that had some unique characters bouncing off each other. But I also want to congratulate Jackie Chan and Pierce Brosnan for turning in some of the best work in their careers, helping mold these complex characters was some excellent work. The movie might be a little slow for some people expecting an action movie, but The Foreigner deserves praise for what it is instead of what it isn't. If you like your political capers on the mature side, I don't think you can go wrong with this. I'd give this an 8.5/10 rounded up to a 9/10.",The Foreigner

This movie does not disappoint, yet both these great actors are acting out of their usual stereotypes. Brosnan makes a great villain and Jackie plays with more emotion that we are used to. Yes he still fights, but not as a super hero but as a distraught father who happens to be ex-special forces.

75,Beejerman,JUST OKAY - (6 stars out of 10),6,9 April 2019,"The stage curtains open ...""The Foreigner"" catches up to Jackie Chan (now in his 60's) playing a very different role - a dramatic one, in this political thriller directed by Martin Campbell, one of my favorite directors in the business today.The story begins with a bang (literally) when a clothing store is bombed, killing the daughter of Ngoc Minh Quan (Chan). Having already lost everyone else in his family, she was all he had left and now she is dead. Putting his former skills to use from when he used to be a Special Ops Forces soldier in Vietnam, he begins his quest for revenge and justice. He goes after Liam Hennessy (Pierce Brosnan), a former member of the IRA, for names ... convinced that he knows who is responsible. There is plenty of intrigue, action and hidden agendas to be found as he follows through on his self-appointed mission.Having enjoyed some rather good Martin Campbell directed films in the past, such as the two James Bond vehicles, ""GoldenEye"" and ""Casino Royale"", as well as some others like ""Defenseless"", ""No Escape"", and the two Antonio Banderas Zorro films, I found this outing to be a bit disappointing. It just didn't seem to have his usual flair this time around. The story is very well constructed and told with solid acting by everyone involved, but ultimately, this one is kind of a yawner.""The Foreigner"" is not really a recommend. It moves fairly slow and does require you to pay attention to the details, or you could become easily lost as the story unfolds.

79,trinaboice,Very dramatic Jackie Chan,8,21 October 2017,"Grade: B+Rating: R, 1 hour 54 minutesIn a Nutshell: Americans love movies. And Jackie Chan. We love watching him perform incredible stunts and fight sequences, mixed with humor and fun. This isn't that kind of movie.I was surprised at how much of a political thriller this movie was and how good of a dramatic actor Jackie Chan is. It's impressive how he can create such a relatable ""every man"" character while still having almost superhuman fighting skills.The movie is based on The Foreigner: previously published as The Chinaman Uplifting theme: Revenge. Family. ""Never push a good man too far.""Things I liked: If you loved the first Rambo movie Rambo: First Blood where he hides and kills people in sneaky ways, you'll get a kick out of some of the things Jackie Chan's character does in this flick. It also has a Liam Neeson Taken movie feel to it, as Jackie Chan's character is completely driven by the love he has for his daughter. Pierce Brosnan does an excellent job playing a complex character. His Irish accent sounds pretty authentic too.Things I didn't like: I expected more humor, since it's a Jackie Chan movie, but this movie was very much a drama. The mixture of Jackie Chan action and political thriller created an uneven film. Surprisingly, he's not in as much of the movie as you would think he would be. This has nothing to do with the 2003 Steven Seagal movie called The Foreigner. It seems like they should have selected a different name for the movie.Tips for parents: Bloody car bomb and lots of explosions. LOTS of bombs. Lots of death and dead bodies. Lots of violence.

82,PyroSikTh,More Political than Action. More Brosnan than Chan,7,20 January 2019,"The first thing to note about The Foreigner is, yes, Jackie Chan is placed front and centre in all the marketing, and the movie does indeed open with him and set up his rampage of revenge, but in retrospect this is not his movie. If you're a Jackie Chan fan, don't go and see this movie just for him, because you'll be disappointed. After the first half an hour or so, he drifts from protagonist to a supporting shadow forever looming in the background. This is no light story either, and Chan's character remains grief-stricken throughout, never once breaking into a smile. And lastly while the action sequences are spot on and full of Chan doing exactly what he does best, they are few and far between.In truth, The Foreigner is not an action movie, but a political thriller. It's about the struggles of Deputy Minister of Northern Ireland Liam Hennessy, after a bombing in London claimed to have been enacted by a new breed of the IRA. Hennessy, with his IRA background, is immediately dragged in partly as a suspect and partly as an informant. One of his major roles in the government is uniting previous IRA leaders together under the banner of peace, and maintaining that peace is proved difficult. Of course it comes to light that Hennessy is, at the very least, tangentially connected to the bombings, and so that puts a target on his head, from Chan's character as well as the British government. The film is mostly told from his perspective as he attempts to find out who under his charge has gone rogue, while also trying to keep everyone in line, and avoid Quan's antagonism.Yes, Hennessy is the real protagonist of this story, despite his somewhat questionable motives, while Quan is far more of an antagonist, but I'll admit the lines are absolutely blurred, and it's told in such a way that you can empathise with both of their perspectives. Quan wants revenge for the death of his daughter, the only family he has left, but he seeks it in the wrong places. Hennessy genuinely doesn't know the answers Quan seeks from him, casting Quan in a bit of a negative light. And yet Hennessy himself is put more in the position of Thanos from Infinity War; the antagonist presented as protagonist. Really he's just a guy stuck in the middle of the whole mess.Unfortunately this has the side effect that Quan becomes a completely pointless entity in the story. Everything would have turned out the exact same way without his involvement. I almost think it would've been a better idea to cut him out entirely, and double down on the political thriller rather than shoe-horning in (admittedly fantastic) action scenes. But then again it wouldn't have been as exciting, wouldn't have appealed to the Chinese market at all, and would've lost a lot of it's draw without someone of Chan's pedigree. In the very least, at least it adds something to the movie rather than detracts from what's going on. It's a hard one to judge.Talking of the action scenes, they're as great as you'd expect. It would've been nice to have had a few more, or at least have them last a bit longer, but Chan never leans back on his martial arts background as a crutch. Quan is a more conniving and sneaky fighter, using traps and bombs, and never out to hurt more than he needs to. His martial arts only come out defensively, when he's being hunted and attacked by Hennessy's men, but it's all the sweeter for it. We still get him leaping through small spaces, sliding down poles, and taking hits like a guy in his 20s. Every fight scene is filled with energy, but without the bombast that would ruin the tone and pacing of the movie. It's still gritty and realistic, and fairly subdued.Chan flexes very different acting muscles here, probably more befitting of his age and what his body can physically take. He takes on the role of a bereaved father and nails it. His cheeky smile is gone and replaced with the expression of a broken, yet determined man. But as I mentioned this is Hennessy's story, and Pierce Brosnan does an equally great job. He has aged like a fine wine, and his Hennessy is a conflicted, complex character. Brosnan nails every expression and every inflection, tapping into Hennessy's ruthlessness, proving to be the hard place to Chan's rock every step of the way.I feel like to enjoy The Foreigner, you needed to go in with the right mindset. This is not an action caper with Jackie Chan flying around beating up bad guys every five minutes with a quip accompanying every punch. The Foreigner is a much more sombre, serious affair, that chooses story over action. As I've already said in this review, it's a political thriller, and like many political thrillers, it takes a fair bit of concentration and can get a little complicated at times. Motivations and revelations are revealed mostly through dialogue, and if you miss anything, or don't understand what's being meant, then you'll get lost. I only say this because I'm still a little fuzzy on how Hennessy really connected to everything in the end. I give The Foreigner a good 7/10, edging on an 8.",The Foreigner

Liam Hennessy (Pierce Brosnan) works for government he request money for people names for people who set bomb, but Agency did not accept his money so Quan went on his own way but their were moments were the another characters were showing it but then the scenes justthem talking just slow's action down sadly. because you have Pierce Brosnan in movie just hiding talking just talking in movie now his character is OK but not best in movie for his role but he is their to take a paycheck. just don't think of it's full on action like john wick all that. but their were action like Jackie Chan Set traps deadly traps and painful even if you see it, it would bee so much pain Jackie made a hole at woods at ground small hole 1 guy steps on trap it has nails imagine stepping into that trap painful. but yeah their is fight scenes in movie made it fun in movie very interesting action scenes very fun i enjoy it i thought his character was very good he gets very series in this movie i like it that way but i want to see more movies like this it shows how Jackie Chan Really Act in strong performance it's not silly Jackie Chan movie like what you think it is but in this kinda movie for him he acts series i like good choices of Jackie Chan and Pierce Bronson together in movie is good but they don't do much in movie. it's just them 2 on their own but Jackie Chan is more in movie then anybody witch is great because it's Jackie Chan movie you have another good fight scenes where he fights with guy on woods with his weapon that was cool but rest of it turned out to be drama flick but the movie needs to be more of action movie i wish it could of done better movie with less drama more of action and thrilling like John Wick and many another movies it goes for 1h 54min it's good but end of day you make a choice if you love or like movie but theirs noting to hate about this movie that's my opinion if you want to see it at theater OK your choice if your die hard fan of Jackie Chan yeah but this is his series strong performance in movie i thought it was good but needs to be better more action full on it's not drama movie like Siege people say why does this movie needs to be full on action it's because the trailer and actor they got is action movie ??? right it's not drama or terrorist thrilling movie. the trailer had full on action just full on action but then movie turns out to be little slow bit of too much talking in movie is turning out to be drama. if you going to make a action movie more of action more of action not because he is too old come on Sylvester Stallone, Schwarzenegger, Van Damme, Lundgren KICKS ASS STILL and every another action stars come on. movie in my opinion 6.10 it's good To Have Jackie Chan in series movie but the movie needs more of Effort a lot more they put a lot more Effort on Jackie Chan and his acting is series like you don't want to mess with this Old Asian Guy but Action needs more Effort.",The Foreigner
86,stevenrotherforth,Time to get all Jackie chan on your a***!,8,23 December 2017,"The Foreigner I remember going to the cinema many moons ago to watch my first Jackie Chan movie on the big screen. It was Rumble in the Bronx. Sure I'd seen him on TV and knew all about his legendary skills but to see him up there on the big screen was a thing of awesomeness.
Then came the Rush hour movies and watching Chans ability to pull off such amazing stunts and fight choreography with a dash of comedy was a real treat.
Fast forward more than twenty years and my Kung fu hero is now an old man in his sixties.
Time then to get serious?The Foreigner is a serious affair. A movie that was totally unexpected regarding its tone and subject matter.
This is Chan as we've never seen him before.
A grieving man who has lost all his family to terrorism.
He gives a superb performance as a father who is broken by his loss. The evidence is right there on his aged face. His features sag, his movement is slow and timid. Gone is the spring in his step.
Gone until he is given no answers of who killed his daughter. Then we get flashes of the Chan we used to know.
Of course there's no comedy Kung fu here. Jackie means business as he plagues the life of Government official Liam Hennessy played excellently by Pierce Brosnan.
I really do think this is the best we've seen Brosnan in a long time.
His character has supposedly distant links to the IRA who are to be blamed for the attack that took the life of Chans daughter.
Quan who is the character played by our Kung fu hero relentlessly pursues Henessey (Brosnan) as he believes he his covering up the event.
A cat and mouse thriller ensues.Surprisingly this isn't a Jackie Chan movie at all. More of a political thriller that happens to feature the famous action star.
He for the most part is support to the events unfolding and it is Brosnan who leads the movie.Director Martin Campbell does a fine job of balancing and intertwining two separate movies into one here.
In one hand we have a revenge thriller and in the other a suspenseful political thriller.
Action set pieces are handled well, as you would expect from the man that gave us Casino Royale and Goldeneye to name but a few.
Chan at Sixty-three still manages to look convincing even if it is plain to see that some of his stunts where performed by a double.
This is my only criticism with Campbell's direction. Surely he could have used different angles or shots from a greater distance to hide the fact that our beloved Kung fu hero is after all only human and even he needs a stunt double in his advancing years.
Putting this small gripe aside I think that this is one of Campbell's better movies and more than makes up for the sack of excrement that was Green Lantern. No wonder that this is the directors first theatrical release in six years since that misfire.
Not only does The Foreigner redeem Campbell's career it also reminds us just how good Pierce Brosnan is and what a great actor Jackie Chan can be when given a role such as this.",The Foreigner

Taciturn, with sagging shoulders and a sad, bitter expression, he shuffles through the film, only to explode for a moment. A phenomenal Jackie Chan.

90,DeBBss,Jackie Chan Still Has It...,6,23 January 2018,"Jackie Chan is best known for his kung fu movies, but from 'The Foreigner' you get kung fu and guns. I was surprised to see the brutality this movie has. When ever I think of Jackie Chan movies, I think of martial arts and no killing, but I think this brutality is a first for Jackie on the big screen. I hope Jackie continues in this type of genre, because he's really good at it and he could revive his career in Hollywood.Story: 6/10In my opinion, I think the story is a bit lame. The story is very slow, and you're going to get bored of it quickly. The movie bothers me with all the political IRA, but there's not enough Jackie. I only watched 'The Foreigner' because of Jackie. The biggest problem in the story is it's too political, and yes it is a political movie, but all the political subplots overruled the action and Jackie's character. If there was a balance between the action and the political subplots, then the story would be much more entertaining. I do think the revenge plot is a bit weak, halfway through the film you forget that he's doing this because of his daughter. The plot revolves more around why the criminals did it, rather then Jackie wanting justice. If Jackie focused on killing them one by one, then I think the revenge plot would've been reminded more. I think the story is decent, but these's a lot of issues that effect the story, like a weak revenge plot and too much political elements. The story is also very complex and confusing. There are a bunch of other characters that helped cause the bomb, and the way they explained how each one was apart of the explosion was confusing.Characters: 7/10I think Jackie Chan's character (Quan Ngoc Minh) was weak. There's no sorrow when his daughter died, there was no relationship that the audience would care about. The explosion and death of his daughter happened to quick in the movie. If the explosion happened a little more later in the movie, then I believe the relationship in the movie would be stronger, also the revenge plot wouldn't take so long to progress if they kept it under two hours. Also the villains are actually well done. I would say there are two villains, Liam Hennessy (Pierce Brosnan) and the bombers. In my opinion Liam Hennessy is a half villain, if that makes sense. Liam Hennessy was the reason why there was a bomb in the first place, but he didn't want anyone to get hurt. The bombers didn't have a lot of screen time too, so I really wouldn't care if Jackie got his justice. One thing I do want to point out is how great Jackie did, he doesn't do a lot of dramatic roles, and surprisingly he acted well.Action: 8/10I would say that the action was the strongest part in the movie, except for the acting. I love that mix with kung fu and guns. The kung fu was still like the old fashion Jackie Chan kung fu, using his environment, like T.V.s and chairs to his advantage. One thing that bothered me was the lack of actual action, there's more talking and mystery, it gets so boring at times. One good thing about the action was the realism, it wasn't like they fought for ten minutes and walked away, it showed them worned out and exhausted, the realism made the movie have a down to earth vibe. 'The Foreigner' is a great drama and thriller, but there was too much irrelevant subplots that blinded the whole premise of the story. The best part about 'The Foreigner' was the action. The action had a realistic feel to it that made it entertaining. Overall I think 'The Foreigner' is a decent movie, and it shows potential for Jackie Chan's career in the future.",The Foreigner

93,themadmovieman,An entertaining action thriller with good drama early on,7,30 September 2017,"This really isn't the film you expect it to be. Jackie Chan and Pierce Brosnan in the lead roles points towards an action-packed revenge thriller, but for the first half of the film, it's actually a well- balanced, dark and often dramatically intense film. Then once you're settled into that, it switches back to the Taken-esque action thriller you were expecting in the first place, providing some good entertainment, but getting a little stuck in developing a genuinely enthralling story.Let's start with the first, more dramatic half of the story. The film starts off quite literally with a bang thanks to an impressive and memorable terrorist attack sequence, and one that perfectly sets up the story of Jackie Chan's character for the rest of the movie.What's great about the first half of The Foreigner is that it knows you're expecting action, so still satisfies that with a couple of big bursts of action, but it most impresses when it comes to the slower, quieter sequences in which Chan begins his quest for justice after his daughter is killed, and he is left feeling utterly battered and alone.Jackie Chan himself is one of the real stand-outs of the whole movie, proving that he's actually got the dramatic chops when it comes down to it, and impresses with a genuinely nuanced performance early on, bringing home the tragic nature of his character's situation, easily letting you sympathise with him.So, throughout the film's first half, we see Chan becoming more and more engrossed in the search for the terrorists who killed his daughter, to the point where he travels from London to Belfast in Northern Ireland with the hope of gaining information from an influential politician.At first, the film continues the character's tragic story, and continues to impress in that degree, even showing some hugely unexpected lengths to which a man will go in search of justice.However, the second half of the film is where things start to change, and unfortunately disappoint. Despite the first act's dramatic intrigue, the story runs out of genuinely interesting development, not managing to bring anything further to the plot than watching Chan get more and more impatient in his quest for answers, something that really does get repetitive eventually.From then on, the movie turns back into the big action thriller you were expecting when you first went in. Despite his character's age, Jackie Chan abruptly bursts into his trademark martial arts action, and although it's a plot point that is eventually explained, it's not something that feels all that organic in the middle of the story, instead feeling like the dramatic story ran out of ideas, to the extent that it could only resort to Jackie Chan's trademark stuntwork.A lot of the action is actually pretty good, and Martin Campbell directs a lot of the fighting sequences with an impressively brutal and striking style, meaning that the film remains an entertaining watch throughout, even if it doesn't manage to keep up the impressive drama it had managed to establish earlier on.",The Foreigner
94,kaptenvideo-89875,Jackie Chan is back conquering the West,6,28 December 2017,"A humble businessman (Jackie Chan) seeks justice when his daughter is killed in an act of terrorism. A conflict ensues with a government official (Pierce Brosnan) whose past may hold clues to the killers' identities.What would you like to see less: yet another spy / government / secret ops action or yet another action movie which has a geriatric leading man because they don't want to retire just because of the old age.Well, in this case, you get both. But ""The Foreigner"" has a secret weapon - Jackie Chan. Yes, he's 63 now but Asians age well and he can still kick it, seemingly effortlessly.It's not mostly just clever editing, body doubles and special effects too, Chan's proud to be able to do the physical stuff himself, just like he has always done.The amount of ass-kicking has dried out a bit - the first fight only occurs about 45 minutes into the near two hour movie - but you're still gonna have fun watching Chan doing the brawl.For variety's sake, there's also a hefty amount of explosions, shooting, and political intrigue, because you can't have shady government thriller without it.Ex-Bond Pierce Brosnan as the nemesis is not bad either although he sounds like a lecturing schoolteacher most of the time, which makes the result feel cheesier than it has to.But this is still a Jackie Chan movie, so some cheese factor is expected, starting with the fact that most of the events wander somewhere in the nowhereland between believable and ridonculous.Then again, the dialogue and the motivation of characters stay on the serious side, which compensates for some of leap of faith the viewer has to take to enjoy all this. This is a not often seen kind of action movie where the dialogue sounds actually pretty good too.Much is happening, too, even considering the 114 minute length which honestly seems too long for this kind of entertainment.There are political and personal intrigues, a bunch of secondary characters doing something or other, surprises and even a bizarre but cool Rambo style section in the woods.Oh, and the rumors about Chan showing his acting skills here are true. Despite the importance of kicking ass, this is a rather complex role dealing with irreparable loss, regrets and getting old.I recall that Arnold Schwarzenegger's latest screen role could be summarized with the very same words, but his performance isn't half this moving, and the movie (""Aftermath"", 2017) kind turned out to be a stinker as well. Sorry, Ahnuld!Ultimately, I rather enjoyed my time with Jackie Chan who does not try to conquer the West anymore and thus rarely appears in our cinemas.""The Foreigner"" will not leave a burning and lasting impression but there's lot to like about it, even if it would benefit from being 20 minutes shorter. There's so much going on that some of it will feel a big half-baked retrospectively. Or maybe there's just too little of Jackie Chan for a Jackie Chan movie.By the way, the director Martin Campbell was the first to offer us Pierce Brosnan as James Bond in 1995 (""Goldeneye""), plus ""Casino Royale"" which is my favorite 007 movie of all time.He did the two Zorros with Antonio Banderas as well - not to mention 2010's ""Edge of Darkness"" which didn't turn out to be much of a comeback for Mel Gibson after all. And then there's ""Green Lantern"", of which the less said the better...",The Foreigner
95,dasa108,"Good protagonists, bad plot.",4,2 October 2021,"Jackie Chan and Pierce Brosnan appear as mature leads in a film whose flaws are plot and length. A competent director like Martin Campbell decides to work for Chinese capitals showing a Jackie Chan in his sixties as the father of a girl forty years younger. As often happens in his recent movies, if he has a daughter, it's for trouble. His daughter literally detonates the story. Without giving details, we would say that Chan is a man qualified for special tasks. However, he decides to behave as if he had no ability and exhausts the film with a series of situations that make him unpleasant. As the story progresses we see that the character arc proves to be unprofessional and to depend on a single character to sustain the story. And that's Brosnan, who speaking in his maternal accent can be the cheated husband, the cheater husband, the former terrorist leader and in turn the politician who works for the government while in turn being harassed by old Chan. In truth Brosnan is a much better actor than this character allows him to do but I suppose the check was worth it. Chan has improved on his dramatic role.

98,austin0731,Not quite what was advertised,7,15 October 2017,"The Foreigner stars Pierce Brosnan and Jackie Chan in an action, revenge story with a large bit of political drama mixed in there. Indeed, Jackie Chan's newest film is rather unlike how it was advertised, but the isn't entirely a bad thing. While Pierce Brosnan's half of the film on the delicate political struggles between Ireland and the United Kingdom/England was not highlighted in the promotional material such as the trailer it was certainly intriguing.However, this does create an imbalance between the two story lines that did not run that smoothly together. While both story were intriguing and interesting the political drama story made Jackie Chan's revenge tale seem like an afterthought. In Spite of this both Pierce Brosnan and Jackie Chan deliver a very good performance. Particularly Jackie Chan for his age, audiences got a chance to get back at the Jackie Chan ass-kicking years but at the same time long time fans of Chan also get a chance to see Chan's aging and struggle. Indeed, unlike most of Chan's roles I can't remember another time that we have seen Chan so vulnerable and frail yet this aspect makes his fight scenes all the more impressive and well respected. Overall, the story was at times too convoluted because of this political (sub?)plot which often takes the center stage and forgets about Jackie Chan. Whereas Jackie Chan's story was advertised to be front and center, this is likely to turn away fans. While I am not against this subplot there really was an issue of balancing these two stories and it would be a lot better to make a film about Jackie Chan's story or this political drama, not one that tries to encompass both.",The Foreigner
99,Hallelujah289,"Utterly infuriating, but provocative",5,31 May 2020,"When I watch a Jackie Chan movie I expect an amount of good humor, or some kind of wisdom, or cool stunts and fight scened. I knew going in from the film's cover picture on Netflix, colorless and gritty as it was, that this could be a darker take on what I could expect. But I wasn't prepared to be totally taken aback and disgusted by the actions of Jackie Chan, as sympathetic his motivation was supposed to be. Jackie Chan plays a mostly quiet, machine like man, who gradually becomes like those he's hunting in his quest for violence, so much so that I lost sympathy for his cause early on.Despite being infuriated, I kept watching to see where the film would go. I think, looking back on the film, there are some really interesting characters, especially Pierce Brosnan's former IRA politician character, his disinterested wife, and their assassin nephew. Also, as a whole, the film does make some thought provoking criticisms about revenge and violence, especially the eye for an eye and death for a death sort. In fact I suppose the very frustration of the film inflicts an anti-terrorist sentiment, which I guess might have been the point.The problem really is that Jackie Chan is playing the part of the hero in this film, but is really another side of the villain, and I don't really think the film gives Jackie Chan the same kind of punishment for his methods that it gives nearly everyone else. And the film gives such punishment, that it's really odd that it has this blind spot.The one thing I think makes this film respectable is Pierce Brosnan's journey as a politician back to being like his old militant self. I think it's an achievement for Brosnan and I wasn't mad at his actions, harsh as they were.This film took the Jackie Chan icon as we know it, made him unsympathetic, made him incredibly myopic, and took the enjoyment out of his action scenes because he was harming people more than they needed to be harmed, so it was brutal. Jackie Chan should play against type, but I was upset with his role because it lacked reasoning and justice, and he wasn't the one I wanted to root for.Nevertheless, for Pierce Brosnan, do watch.",The Foreigner

101,monkeysgalore,"Jackie Chan's ""Taken""",10,10 June 2019,"The Foreigner was without a doubt one of the coolest and most surprising films of 2017, as well as one of the most entertaining action thriller films I've seen. The film is a lot of fun, but even if it's not touching any new action movie territory, this film is highlighted for being Jackie Chan's first actual foray into doing a straight action film. There's no comedy, the acrobatics and use of environment as a weapon are definitely toned down, and the fight scenes have a brutal and realistic feel to them, and the action sequences in this film wouldn't look out of place in a Liam Neeson or Denzel Washington film. This is a completely different and new Jackie Chan.The story follows Ngoc Minh Quan (Jackie Chan), a businessman and restaurant owner with a (no surprise here) mysterious past, who leaps into action when his daughter is killed in a ruthless terrorist bombing, dishing out all manner of brutal vigilante justice. His quest for vengeance brings him into conflict with Liam Hennessy (Pierce Brosnan), the Deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland, who Quan believes is protecting the people responsible for his daughter's death.As I said earlier, the story, though complicated at times, is quite interesting, though some may find it a little dull, which is fair, honestly, although the heavy political aspects of the plot never take away from the true intent of the story, which is Quan's revenge on the villains. That is one thing that I will say for the story: even if it is the same old revenge story once its layers are peeled back, this film takes a lot of time, some might even say too much, to develop its characters. For an action film, this movie really takes its time, which was quite refreshing, and though it does take a while for it to really get into gear, once it does, it delivers. The story doesn't make exceptions for the action. Both are here equally, and while some may not get as much as they're expecting, there's still a lot. But the story doesn't dumb itself down to let the action do the talking. Backstory is there, you have to pay attention, and even the supporting cast is on screen a lot to keep the story going. The story is based on the 1992 novel ""The Chinaman"", which I read, and the film mostly stays faithful to its source material. David Marconi (Live Free or Die Hard (2010) writer) has crafted an excellent, intelligent screenplay here, and it flows very well, racing along at a breakneck pace, while still managing to stop and develop its characters. And come on, what's better than an engaging, quickly-moving story centered around characters you're invested in?Supporting players are onscreen often, and Jackie Chan isn't actually on screen the entire time (though he is quite often). That's not to say Chan's barely in the film, as he and Brosnan are the two main players, and they dominate the screen when they're on it, and had me eagerly anticipating their next scenes when they weren't. Both delivered smashing performances, and though this is the first film I've seen with Brosnan, I've been interested in him, and I will definitely check out his other stuff. As for Jackie Chan, he owns this movie. I've been a longtime fan of him, and is was incredibly entertaining to see him do such a dramatic, gritty role. I suppose his role in Bleeding Steel was close to this, but it wasn't done with the same amount of energy, and his character here is so much more interesting and developed by the 20 minute mark in this film then his character in Bleeding Steel in the first half hour. This role was definitely against type, and it worked so well. Jackie Chan hasn't done a lot of sequels (Police Story films, Rush Hour films, and The Drunken Master films), but his character here practically demands one.The action in this film is brutal and hard-hitting, and it chose to go the route of having a few lengthy action sequences instead of action all throughout, which works quite well. The action scenes, when they come, are brutal and relentless, particularly the final fight in the apartment. The action and plot here are definitely reminiscent of other revenge/vigilante action thrillers, specifically, Man on Fire (2004), Taken (2008), and The Equalizer (2014), which were all very good films. It's almost as if Jackie Chan watched Taken and decided to give it a shot himself, and the result here is not a cheap knockoff, but rather a hugely entertaining homage. Some memorable action scenes include the apartment fight scene, the forest fight scene, and the final fight scene. And while that may not sound like much, the aforementioned scenes really deliver, and are worth the journey there. I also mentioned before that the action here is not that of a usual Chan flick, and it isn't. You feel every hit, there are no exaggerated strikes or impact sounds, no jumping or flipping around, and no slapstick moments really of any kind here. Again, it's basically the Taken action sequences, but with Jackie Chan there instead.Director Martin Campbell, known for the great Mask of Zorro (1998), GoldenEye (1995), and the phenomenal Casino Royale (2006), once again proves his proficiency in directing action and drama scenarios, and this is one of his better, more memorable films for sure, as he deftly brings to life Marconi's masterful script, utilizing both Chan's and Brosnan's acting abilities to their fullest.If you're a fan of either Jackie Chan or Pierce Brosnan, or just want to watch a gratifying, highly entertaining action thriller, I can't recommend this film enough. Especially if you're in the first category and are a fan of one or both of the main actors, as it's so interesting to see different roles for each. 10/10, go watch this movie now.",The Foreigner

104,hrkepler,Jackie Chan vs. IRA,7,30 May 2018,"'The Foreigner' is quite formulaic action revenge thriller that doesn't offer much new or fresh, but still somehow manages to stay away from the path of dull clichés. Dedicated and masterful performances by its two leads, Jackie Chan and Pierce Brosnan, who both are little bit in a different water than most of us are used to see them. For me (I think I'm not the only one), the two actors were the only reason I watched that film, and I felt not a second of time wasted. It was nice breath of fresh air to see Jackie Chan's darker, and more serious side. Also, it seemed that writer had put some effort into plotting the 'cloak and dagger' situation between government officials with hazing the clear borders between good and evil.Above average recent action piece that is enlivened by great performances.",The Foreigner

I'd watch him in any film he might appear in now, even without action. It's not just Jackie Chan's film, though. *Everybody* was really great, of course kudos to Pierce Brosnan - one of his best roles, I think. It's not a black and white role he's playing - he really made me care what happens to his character. The film is fast-paced, direction is tight - just a really great film. It's not just an action film, it has a great story, great character development on all fronts, makes the political bends actually quite easy to follow, even though, as I said, it's not black and white.

107,RogerBorg,"A surprising, eclectic film",7,16 December 2020,"Based on the cast and the synopsis, I really wasn't sure what to expect from this.It turns out that there are two narratives at play. The first is a political drama tackling the thorny issue that the Irish Republican ""Army"" were never freedom fighters, but cowardly civilian-murdering vermin. Pierce Brosnan plays - let's be honest here - Gerry Adams, the cowardly murderous vermin-in-chief who slaughtered so many innocents that he became a statesman. Brosnan turns in his usual workmanlike performance as King Rat trying to keep the young rats in check, even if his accent is Third Best Oirish.Then there's Jackie Chan turning in an astonishingly affecting performance as a small, sad, grieving, hangdog father looking for his daughter's murderers.And Chan absolutely nails the acting in the first act. Humble, quiet, careful, emotional, reluctant, polite, and yet absolutely, compellingly, calmly relentless. Completely unexpected, but such a treat to watch.Then there are some action sequences in which Chan does what he's most famous for. However, some of the the effects and editing are sloppy, and his stunt doubles don't look much like him, which is a pity as Chan retains the core of his athleticism. The score for these scenes is also unnecessarily overblown, trying to over-sell what's on screen.As it turns out, what Chan's most famous for isn't what he's best at. I genuinely enjoyed his acting more than his action here. He brings a dignity to the role that I didn't expect, and when the film devolves into a typical revenge plot, I was rather disappointed - I wanted to see more of the still, nuanced Chan rather than Mini Rambo.Overall though, it's competent enough, and worth a watch to see what he's capable of given the chance.",The Foreigner

112,autisticreviewers,Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.,7,19 October 2017,From the director of Casino Royale comes the movie starring Jackie Chan and Pierce Brosnan The Foreigner! Humble businessman with a buried past seeks Justice when his daughter is killed in an act of terrorism. His name is Quan Ngoc Minh (Jackie Chan). He will stop at nothing until everyone that was responsible is killed or brought down!Jackie Chan real life is now 63 years old and for someone who is 63 years old he is still doing his own stunts and is able to carry the entire movie without any need of pointless CGI or stunt people. I know a lot of people will be disappointed due to the fact that the film relies heavily on it being a thriller and drama rather than an action film. There are still very many fight scenes in there the Jackie Chan fans will love but the whole point of the movie was Jackie Chan's loss of his daughter. Pierce Brosnan also gets a lot of screen time and his scenes are quite powerful. Not everyone will love it but it definitely just goes to prove the Jackie Chan still has enough juice left in him to do his own stunts! 3/5 stars,The Foreigner

Will the filthy Irish end up double-crossing and slaughtering each other in an orgy of violence and mistrust? Yep, because that's what they always do! Meanwhile, the authorities have absolutely no idea how to handle this case.Can a humble chef from the local Asian takeaway reach the truth of this mystery before the police send an innocent man to prison? Will Sean Morrison enjoy incestuous sex with his aunt for a second time before the credits roll? Who blew up the toilets in the deputy First Minister's office?

A bit more time here would have created
more understanding and audience buy in regarding his personal loss, and his background in acquiring ""a particular set of skills"".100% worth watching if you're looking for an easy viewing action movie with a few political plot twists and turns.",The Foreigner

This is how you make an implausible action movie without going all stupid before it's over, so all of the ""Taken""s can take their rightful seat in the second row.
Typically, as in almost never, I can't get through a Chan movie because of the 'stunts for stunts sake' angle and, though fans may disagree, and whether it was due to age or choice, I found a somewhat constrained Chan much more enjoyable.

116,bravesfanc,Could've been better,6,21 October 2017,"Jackie Chan hasn't really done an American movie in some time. He did ""Skiptrace"" which wasn't released in theaters, and quite frankly was pretty bad. When I saw the trailer for this movie I was excited, however like a lot of movies nowadays,the trailer makes the movie better than it actually is.Chan plays ""Quan"" who loses his daughter in a terrorist bombing. He is of course heartbroken and the only thing he now wants is to know who and why this bombing took place. This is where we meet Pierce Brosnan's character ""Liam"" who is the head of some type of British government official but is from Ireland.Quan starts to play around with Liam and his men because Quan believes Liam knows exactly who is responsible for the bombing. These scenes are the best part of the movie because even at 60 years old, Chan is still a bad**** on screen. The fight scenes are few and far between and they aren't your typical Jackie Chan fights. They are short and brutal which makes sense for his character but disappointing because I wanted more.The ""surprise"" ending isn't that hard to figure out and it left me wanting a little more. Chan is obviously the best part of this movie and I wish the focus was more on him and his character than Brosnan's Liam.

118,pal05052003,A former Chinese soldier out for vengeance for his daughter changes the equation in a political intrigue involving the Irish Scottish Deputy Minister,8,4 October 2017,"This is a dark, and gritty political action thriller featuring Jackie Chan. Chan is surprisingly good as a grizzled father out for vengeance, and you could completely overlook the fact that he used to play comical action heroes. Chan's demeanor portrays the vulnerability, heartbreak, and repressed anger of a parent. His character can be compared to a combination of Jackie Chan because of his acrobatic stunts, Liam Neeson's Bryan Mills for his dogged determination and questionable tactics, and Jason Bourne for his ability to outfox his opponents. Pierce Brosnan, the former James Bond actor, is a perfect antagonist to Chan. He plays a politician who has to resolve the problem or he will receive consequences from all sides. In fact, his character was as likable as Chan, but in the scenes where he is with Jackie Chan, Chan dominates every take. Acting-wise, this is a great surprising coming from actors not known for dramatic roles, yet both leads (especially Jackie Chan) manages to keep a gripping performance that makes the audience rooting and feeling sympathetic for them till the very end. The action scenes are reminiscent of the Bourne series. They are brutal, and grounded. There are scenes of Chan's trademark acrobatic and improvisional fighting style, but they look brutal and deadly. The filming of the fight scenes is also similar to Paul Greengrass's work, but is more effective and less nauseating than in the Bourne Supremacy. Another interesting aspect of the movie is that the theme is very dark, and grim for a Jackie Chan movie. It is a very smooth transition for Chan from comical action hero to straight action heroes. I look forward to more interesting works like this from Jackie Chan.",The Foreigner
119,emryse,Different from Jackie Chan's Usual Style,7,20 August 2021,"Jackie Chan has become famous, and deservedly so, for his crazy over the top stunt work, in the Foreigner however all of the usual crazy, cartoony violence is stripped away and we're left with a more realistic and darker look at what somebody with Jackie Chan's fighting style and some Special Ops Military training could do if left in the real world. The film is pretty serious with the plot revolving around terrorists who actually commit mass acts of terror, don't just say they will, and a political story line that slowly gets unravelled. Pierce Brosnan and Jackie Chan both put their all into their performances and manage to capture the desperation that both characters are feeling pretty well. The supporting cast is decent as well but I wouldn't say any of them really stood out. The cinematography is good enough and gets the job done, the editing is fine but in the end this film is taking a Liam Neeson plot and adding in Jackie Chan, the violence does sometimes get gory but on the whole is okay. The film manages to have a satisfying ending if somewhat unrealistic and is on the whole a fun viewing experience.

121,tmpsvita,An Ok entertaining movie but a failed social/political denunciation,6,1 February 2018,"At the time of the creation of ""The Foreigner"", the writer and the director had to choose to take two paths: do a thriller intended just for entertainment or make a political thriller with a social complaint at the base, but unfortunately have chosen to undertake both roads with the result of an entertaining film that takes itself too seriously so, doing that, the film fails to be a particularly engaging and entertaining film of entertainment, therefore not very effective, nor a fairly incisive and credible complaint. 
This is mainly due to a plot, taken from a novel, which has far-fetched and implausible elements, as well as trivial elements that seem to be very serious and important, also seen the current period in which it came out where terrorism, and its attacks, is one of the most relevant phenomena that are happening.
To save the film are the various action scenes very well directed, and the two protagonists played by Jackie Chan and Pierce Brosnan who, despite not having performed somehow memorable performances, still manage with their presence to engage the viewer.
In addition, the last half hour has particularly enjoyed me especially thanks to the rhythm that increases in intensity and this allows the film to be at the end of the vision a pleasant thriller but does not add anything original to its genre and that loses the opportunity to denouncing a social / political aspect, in addition to terrorism in general and more closely linked to the British archipelago, which has rarely been treated in a satisfactory way.",The Foreigner
122,he88,A Serious Jackie Chan,8,21 February 2019,"Jackie Chan movies are often a hit or miss as a result of bad script or too much corn. Usually we aren't watching for the script anyway because we want all the martial arts fighting. Which often is where movies controlled by Jackie Chan break into some corn so the movie isn't just another movie about violent martial arts fighting.As Chan has gotten older it's understandable that he can't do all the moves with all the grace...Aches and pains come with age. So he has taken on more serious roles where his skills are used at a minimum because either he isn't the primary focus or as in this film the focus is far grander than kicking butt with hands and feet.Jackie really looks much older here than he does regularly, but he sells it perfectly. He is far more serious here too. You really buy that he is a broken man after losing his daughter in an IRA bombing. In fact his character is considered as just a heart broken old nuisance that's not really anything to worry about. Nothing could be further from the truth.This is a good movie, but you can't over think it. He has special skills, but after not using them for a couple decades he managed pretty damn good. There's also the unanswered question about how this line operator manages to get such good intell about how to find people and places. Something that seems impossible without a network behind him.If you over look those hole in the logic and just take the movie as is for the entertainment....Then you'll probably really like it the way I did.",The Foreigner

127,HanShotFirstGR,Could've been a great action thriller but they screenwriters settles for less! Still good..,7,19 March 2021,"Plot:A humble businessman with a buried past seeks justice when his daughter is killed in an act of terrorism. A cat-and-mouse conflict ensues with a government official, whose past may hold clues to the killers' identities.Analysis:The Foreigner is a Netflix production that stars Jackie Chan and Pierce Brosnan in an amazing revenge story-thriller that keeps you at the end of your seat for its whole runtime. Martin Campbell, the director of Casino Royale and The Mask Of Zorro was in charge of this movie, so the expectations escpecially for the action scenes were pretty high and for the most part he did a very good job.The most important factor of this movie's success is obviously the amazing duo of protagonists with Jackie Chan proving that he is an amazing actor, not just a martial artist and Pierce Brosnan being once more on point. It wasn't just the chemistry between them, but also how perfectly they embodied those characters they were given, you can feel Chan's pain in his expressions, his body language, everything he does adds to the character and makes this experience more amazing. Brosnan being a filthy example of corrupt politicians has to be unpleasant from the very first scene and he does exactly that, his ego is visible in his face, his selfish personallity drives every little decision he makes and the actor's talent makes it feel so real that you get real feelings of despise.The plot is beyond the average action movie expectations, it has a clear plan that despite the way it is delivered it's a great idea on paper. Revenge stories are mostly about emotion and fighting, The Foreigner delivers both of them at a pretty good level. The way the movie develops is a little too over the top and not believable, it's a pitty to put so much effort in a good idea and then produce scenes with some extremely messy choices. There are things in this movie that definetely shouldn't be there, they are not artistic choices I personally disagree, they are objectively wrong and make this movie a more mindless product. Every single thing that is needed to keep the plot going must be justified even in a very typical way, the screenwriter shouldn't expect from the audience to accept everything just because it's a small detail, especially when you skip a pretty big answer that without it there wouldn't be a movie in the first place. Mystery is good only when it's something you will unravel later and it will be important, everything else is just a convenience to not put more effort in your screenplay. Despite this problem, there are other things that will probably take your mind off of that and fix the overall result to an okay story.But despite the problem in the plot, visually there are some very cool stuff that make this movie so entertaining that I am willing to leave the story problems behind and focus on the great action scenes and the beautiful shots that Campbell uses to draw the viewers' attention. The fighting is brutal and realistic, the cold colours, the well-designed special effects, the great choreographies, everything was done so well that you just want more and more. He should definetely do more movies like this one and there is a huge possibility he can give us another masterpiece like Casino Royale, he's a great director and a visionary artist.Conclusion:It may not be a well-written story, but it is definetely entertaining thanks to great direction, badass fighting, clever idea and top level acting. It's a big step forward for Netflix in the action genre, usually their attempts fail at being interesting, but this one doesn't, it captures your attention and gives you a good-enough experience that will probably leave you satisfied with what you got.Rating: 7/10",The Foreigner

The Foreigner stars Jackie Chan and Pierce Brosnan and one day a bomb goes off in London that kills Jackie Chan's daughter so he must find the people responsible. Jackie Chan surprised me because this isn't like your typical Jackie Chan movies. I grew up watching Jackie Chan from the Rush Hour movies or Shanghai Noon and watching this was another side of Jackie Chan I had never seen before. And its weird hearing Pierce Brosnan having an Irish accent because I know him from the James Bond movies and he spoke with an English accent that I forgot I was watching a different movie that wasn't James Bond. I'm not going to lie Jackie Chan scared me. After his daughter dies he becomes this Punisher, Rambo, and Liam Neeson rolled into one as he makes bombs out of homemade groceries or spies on Pierce Brosnan. And like the direction they were going that in some weird way it reminded me if Law Abiding Citizen. The first hour I was rooting for Jackie Chan as he takes matter in his own hands and tries to find the people responsible and the next hour confused me. This plays out as a political movie and a revenge movie, but its like it cant decide what to do cause the first hour you have Jackie Chan and the next you have Pierce Brosnan. And the last hour of the movie focuses on Pierce Brosnan also finding who's responsible even you can clearly tell he's dirty. Pierce Brosnan is on screen more than Jackie Chan is and when you look at the poster the poster does say The Foreigner with Jackie Chan's name up top, but he's barely in the movie. And when he does pop out I completely forget that he was in this. I'm not hating on the movie cause I had fun watching this and I admire that Jackie Chan did something different other than Rush Hour and Shanghai Noon.

He is the father of a teenager but he looked more like a grandfather, but boy o boy was he beautiful (Even more handsome than the elegantly dressed Pierce Brosnan. I think Jackie Chan has some kind of internal strength and kindness that seeps out at you and gives you energy).Story is about his daughter being killed by IRA 'renegade' terrorists, so even the IRA does not know who actually did this. Chan contacts the IRA party head (Brosnan will a surprising accent) and slowly starts increasing pressure on him (guerilla and terrorist tactics using his army training), to make him tell him who are the people responsible. So film is actually a thriller.The reason this has a low rating (7.2) is because this theme has been done before and is not unique, but when we are watching the movie it completely draws you in and you don't realize how fast the 2hrs went. So don't let the rating stop you from seeing it. It has some action (the kind that works because he is 'Jackie Chan'), fights that are realistic and intense but no gore (thankfully, because gore has been so abused for cinematic effect that its no longer fun).Film also has an good ending (I was really afraid that they will botch up everything till now).I had more fun watching this than the super hero movies of this year (maybe the film I liked the most in 2017 and the only one for which I even felt like giving a review.)So, go watch it, I feel there is very high chance that you will enjoy it.",The Foreigner

The Foreigner plays a major role in driving the catch-the-bombers plot forward, but he is a total wild card, and he's a total outsider, which in an of itself is very relevant to the politics of the situation unfolding.There was also a little bit of political intrigue that was quite fascinating.This was a little bit of an unusual role for Jackie Chan.

When she is killed in a brutal bombing by a rogue IRA faction, Quan goes on a quest for answers first from the Police and then from former IRA turned politician, Liam Hennessy (Pierce Brosnan). Neither man is exactly what he seems and both Quan and Hennessy are led down a maze of betrayal, revenge and violence as Quan seeks to avenge his daughter and Hennessy seeks to maintain control of his own political future and the rising current of Irish dissidence.

He proves that he is not just a comedic actor, but one that is capable of turning a revenge plot with sheer realism.

Astonishingly, that's not the most confusing moment in the picture.The plot of ""The Foreigner"" concerns a Chinese-born London restaurant owner whose beloved college-aged daughter is killed in a terrorist act claimed by a new renegade branch of the Irish Republican Army. The man attempts to obtain the identity of the murderers from an Irish diplomat with ties to the IRA. But when the diplomat at first dismisses and then unfortunately ignores the grieving man, he begins to use his past training in the US special forces to obtain the information he needs and enact justice for his daughter's killers.What promises to be an action revenge fantasy in the tradition of ""Death Wish"" quickly becomes a dreary slog through the intricacies of Irish politics. And in the process ""The Foreigner"" somehow reduces the top- billed Jackie Chan to a supporting role in his own movie.The picture eventually arrives where the audience expects it to go, but takes much, much too long to get there. The final twenty minutes deliver the goods, but you might want to consider taking a nap until then. And twenty minutes after the movie ends you'll likely forget the whole thing ever happened.Premiering in Beijing on September 24 and throughout China on September 30, ""The Foreigner"" during its Chinese release earned gross receipts of over $88 million against its $35 million budget, giving the filmmakers and studio a profit even prior to the picture's October 13 opening in 2515 theaters across the United States. In the US, ""The Foreigner"" earned a little less than $13 million during its first weekend, placing the film in third place in box office receipts, behind ""Happy Death Day,"" which opened simultaneously, and ""Blade Runner 2049,"" which premiered the week before.Translation—""The Foreigner"" is already a big success.

150,ChristianLeFeuvre,Excellent gripping thriller,10,22 March 2019,"'The Foreigner' is a terrific thriller directed by Martin Campbell and stars Jackie Chan and Pierce Brosnan.
The opening scenes see Jackie Chan's character taking his daughter to buy a dress for her school prom night, and whilst he is parking his car and she has already run into the shop to have a look, the shop is destroyed by an IRA terrorist bomb and his daughter is killed. Once he learns it was down to an IRA attack and the police investigation is seemingly going no-where, he goes to confront Northern Ireland's First Minister Liam Hennessy, played by Pierce Brosnan, who was a former IRA leader to get the names of the bombers so he can hunt them down personally.
This is a revenge thriller movie but it is far more realistic than most, especially 'Taken 2', Martin Campbell has done a far more gritty movie and it explores both the political consequences following a terrorist attack as well as the personal ones.
It's a storyline we have seen before but the way that Campbell's clever direction style takes us through it in a fresh way, is what made this film so intriguing for me.
We don't know much about Chan's character and his past at first, but that's what I loved about this film, it doesn't lay it all out in the first scenes and let you sit back and watch how it unfolds, it takes you along for the ride and slowly builds up the thrills and understanding of the characters, and the more we learn about his back-story, the clearer things become.
There are some brilliant action scenes, and most Jackie Chan fans will obviously expect the fight scenes which he is known for, unfortunately if that's what you are expecting from him you will be disappointed. Yes there are some fight scenes of course, and Jackie Chan is excellent, but this is a different type of movie altogether. In this film he's an older man, consumed by pain and grief, and he gives an excellent dramatic performance. So please don't expect just a Jackie Chan action film, as actually the trailers lead us to believe, it's a tense political thriller.
Pierce Brosnan gives one of the best performances in his career as far as I'm concerned. He is terrific in this movie. He has a lot of incredible scenes, some really powerful dialogue and some intense moments too. I did love Jackie Chan in this film but for me, Pierce Brosnan steals it.
This is a thriller, it is far more 'wordy' than just a 'revenge action movie'.
Martin Campbell has done an excellent job with 'The Foreigner'. Jackie Chan has the ability to give us an amazing dramatic performance while still giving his fans a few action fight scenes which he is known for.
Even though, as I mentioned, this is a 'wordy' film, it is never boring, although those just watching for Jackie Chan might find it so.

Pierce Brosnan plays ex-IRA leader who bears a striking resemblance to Gerry Adams. Brosnan is really good in the film stealing every scene he's in complete with a thick Irish accent. Jackie Chan gives a grounded emotional performance and of course handles the action scenes very well. Even for a man in his 60s he's more than capable of performing risky stunts making the film look believable. Directed by Martin Campbell (Casino Royale, Golden Eye) he gets great performances out of all of his actors and makes the film look great even with such a small budget. It has its feet firmly stuck in reality dealing with such a timely subject matter. There is lot of intrigue to it and not everything is what it seems. It's less of an action thriller and more of a drama/mystery thriller with some impressive action sequences that don't look overly fantastic. There is no slow motion and no perfect choreography. They look realistic and nobody walks away unscathed as there is a lot of bruises and wounds. It does suffer from some pacing issues and the tone is often inconsistent.

153,anthonymichaelbangert,"Can't Hate It, But Was Disappointed",7,23 October 2017,"The Foreigner is a Political Thriller/Drama starring Jackie Chan and Pierce Brosnan. It was directed by Martin Campbell, known for his direction of Casino Royale, Goldeneye, and The Mask of Zorro. Jackie Chan plays Quan, an immigrant and restaurant owner from China in the UK. A bombing attack by a group calling themselves the ""Authentic IRA"" leaves Quan injured and his young daughter dead. Stricken with grief, he goes to Brosnan's character Liam Hennessy to try to find out the names of the terrorists. Hennessy is a politician in the UK who used to be in the IRA. He too wants to learn the names of the attackers, even as he and everyone around him is attacked by Quan. This movie is a decent thriller, but it is nowhere near what I expected, and it did have a few problems. First, this movie has been advertised from the start as an action film starring an aging Jackie Chan. While there are action scenes, this is not an action film. It is actually closer to a drama/thriller with political intrigue that happens to include some action. Second, the plot gets very convoluted at times. It is unnecessarily complicated in a way it did not earn. Next, I was upset that the film seemed to not be able to blend the action scenes well into the rest of the film. In a way, the action was almost a completely separate being. It felt tacked on. There were also moments where Chan would be off screen for so long that I'd forgotten he was even in it. Essentially, don't go into this film expecting a Jackie Chan action film. You will be disappointed. However, there are positives. Chan's performance in this movie was emotional and well done. The acting he portrayed here was beautiful. He was able to show a side of himself so seldom seen. Same goes for Pierce Brosnan who gave a powerful performance as well. The action itself was well shot. With the director of Casino Royale and one of the greatest martial arts actors in Hollywood ever, I would expect nothing less. The Foreigner kept my attention and delivered an okay story, but in the end, it won't really be memorable, which is a shame given the talent level involved. 72/100",The Foreigner
154,iamianiman,A heavy-drama that significantly designs with numerous plot twists,6,29 September 2017,"Entering the hall that I have no idea what this movie is basically about others than the given synopsis. Malaysia is the first country to show this movie starting on the 28th September 2017. So, I was one of the first people who got to experience it.Here are some aspects on the grounds that I would like to consider:Plot: A unique story line is being portrayed in the film. The distinctive features of the elements are being told rather slowly than then Hollywood typical style we always see nowadays. It kicks off by showing the abstract of the whole story. A few while later, the title is shown and we get to see how the story shreds into layers nicely without hesitant and it definitely knows what to do to maintain the story and its efficacy as well as the twist at some scenes to unravel the mystery. Despite all the positive side of it, that slow telling of a story would be a little boring as it can get a bit tedious at times. There also should be some very interesting scenes to enlighten the mood but what it delivers is otherwise which sometimes it's giving too much information that we'd think you're channelling onto a law programme. Action scene: Lack of action scenes throughout the duration but there are a few parts that can get one's attention eagerly as it contains full of energetic fighting scenes although not as great as Taken 3 or any Jason Statham movies. However, it shows how realistic this movie can be, how the impact of the scenes coming together with the realistic story line sums up to be just and good. Cinematography: Decent camera-moving and doesn't give any new artistic effects but what the environment gives is the gloomy effect and the ominous surroundings. It shows very cloudy ambiance that would put audience into thinking this would make the movie even more realistic.Production design: Not that great I would say. It shows a very few locations and the designs do not interest any of my attention personally. Acting: The legendary Jackie Chan who happens to be 63 years old as of 2017 still holds the potential to be badass as always. Not as great back 20-30 years ago, but for his current age, to perform such huge and very complex stunts are just mind-blowing. His expression is decent enough. Whereas we also get to see the ex-James Bond Pierce Brosnan this time with his Irish accent that can get a bit irritating as he fails to utter words and phrases clearly that will dangerously make the audience bewildered with the process of putting the story into a complete piece. Other than that, he's all good.Soundtrack: The ones that get my attention the most are during the fighting scenes. You know when the fighting scenes are going to pop up on the screen as the music indicates the flow of 'em. It's not that super delicious feisty kind of soundtrack like Kingsman 2 or Suicide Squad but the ones that put a whole lot of bass and give you the direction towards where the action is going.Overall, the film has a unique storytelling but lacks on the potential to give the audience that factor on giving the audience some unexpected things other than the twists. It gives you insights about the current world nowadays with people with cruel intentions do have bad agendas and realistically shows that corruption is a breathing organism. I'm a tough critic so my final mark would be 59/100.",The Foreigner

157,aldebaran68,Intriguing but flawed...,6,11 June 2018,"Let's say one thing straight away. I'm 60+ so I grew up in England with the Troubles in Ulster. From around 1969 when the first British troops went into Ulster (that was shocking in itself, to see British troops on active service on UK territory...) to 1990s and the Good Friday agreement. 30 years of The Troubles. 30 years of IRA (Provo) bombs on the mainland. If you think Islamic terror is bad here in the UK, the IRA outdid them easily. And in those days Counter-Terrorism was nowhere near as sophisticated as today. No Internet. No mobile phones. No IT of any sort. It was Another World. And it was Nightmarish. 
So I'm coming at this film from that era. I've had good friends from Ulster and from the Republic. I have some understanding of The Troubles. 
This film is intriguing in that Pierce Brosnan does IMHO a very good job of impersonating 'a version' of Gerry Adams. Gerry Adams, head of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, was omnipresent on TV during the Troubles. Every night, on TV, there seemed to be some IRA event gong on/off in Ulster, or here on the mainland. And every night he'd be commenting. I have a lot of sympathy for the Irish and the Republican cause but not, abs. not for the violence. So this movie took me back to those days. 
Not sure I wanted to go there but I was intrigued. I'm a Pierce Brosnan fan, love his style, his movies. I was very impressed by his 'Ulster Light' accent and his variation on Gerry Adams. I could almost see Gerry Adams in Brosnan. It was quite astonishing really. The whole IRA side of the movie struck me as very authentic...except...that when faced with Jackie Chan's character the IRA were made to look like dunces. Now as I said I abhorred the violence of those 30 years, but, it's a fact that the IRA ran rings around the British Army and the British administration in Ulster for that time. They kept the British Army at bay for 30 years, then went into power anyhow in Ulster in the '90s. So, to portray the IRA as dunces was... 'inaccurate'. Even though the film is set in the present, the inferences/references are all to The Troubles. The IRA is still considered a potential threat. No dunces there. 
Now the bit I found to be flawed was the Jackie Chan aspect. I love JC, his films in his earlier years, his comedies are wonderful and wonderfully entertaining. His martial arts are acrobatic and balletic. But, at 60+, he should give it a rest now. He is a very good actor. But to have him 'win' any of his physical encounters with young men half or 2/3 his age was beyond belief. Not good. Even with his 'training', he is as old as I am. Not believable. His part of the film is terribly flawed. It's a shame. 
I'd watch this again for PB any day, but Chan's part leaves me cold. Sorry Jackie...not your fault. It just doesn't work for me. So 6 out of 10 seems fair.",The Foreigner
158,ActionFan-Reviews,No More Mr. Nice Guy !,7,14 October 2017,"I've been a fan of Jackie Chan since I was a kid. I grew up watching movies like Rumble In The Bronx, Rush Hour, First Strike. So I was excited to see him back and he proves he is one of the best action stars ever. The Foreigner provides on plenty of action, suspense, thrills and a surprisingly fair amount of drama. You may be used to his movies of the past that are light hearted and fun. This was not your typical Jackie Film, as it is quite serious with little to no humor and more like his films ""Crime Story"" & ""New Police Story"" which also differ from Jackie's usual style of action films. Both Jackie & Pierce were both solid in their roles and the acting was quite good with the characters being allowed to develop along with the story. It may seem like a typical revenge, Taken style action movie, but as the film progressed it turns more into a story involving political intrigue and conspiracy which I thought at times slowed the movie, but still was entertained and thrilled throughout.Overall, if your an old school Jackie Chan fan and love his films like I do, I'm sure you'll enjoy it.

160,TheJediWay9,A Fun And Entertaining Thriller. Better Than Expected,7,11 October 2017,"""The Foreigner"" stars Jackie Chan as a Chinaman living in London whose daughter is killed in act of terrorism. His desperate search to find the terrorists who killed his daughter lead him to Hennessy (Pierce Brosnan), a politician with a shady past.This is a very different movie from Jackie Chan and I applaud that. I was intrigued by the trailer because it looked like Jackie Chan unhinged, and it practically is. He does a really good job here in a dark, gritty, realistic thriller and it's a thriller that doesn't really venture all that far into the action territoy. He doesn't really get to show off his kung-fu prowess, but more of him getting his ass kicked and fighting in a way that's more realistic than kung-fu. I give him very high praise for that as I thought he did an excellent job portraying a more complex character than we've seen from, one who had more of a tortured past and really just lost his last remaining remnant of his life. Pierce Brosnan gives a solid performance as well. This might actually be his best post-Bond role and you could tell he was having fun portraying a more villainous type character, someone who you liked then was unlikeable, someone who is untrustworthy and shadowy, but at times understand his viewpoint. He was a bright spot that worked really well. Martin Campbell directs this movie, who also directed Brosnan in ""GoldenEye,"" Brosnan's first outing as James Bond, and the underrated Mel Gibson thriller ""Edge of Darkness."" This movie has a lot of similarities to ""Edge of Darkness"" and those types of movies like ""Taken,"" and ""Death Sentence."" Campbell does a really great job of staging the action and tension, and proves that he has a real knack for providing realistic thrills when he directs movies not named ""Green Lantern."" I like watching his work. I think he has a great camera crew, stunt team, effects teams, all of that stuff that goes into the behind the scenes making of a movie, and he shines once again here.As unoriginal as the movie may sound, it is a bit of a fresh take on the genre. However, with that being said, the first five minutes of this movie were the exact same thing as the first 10 minutes of ""Edge of Darkness."" To be honest this is basically the same movie as ""Edge of Darkness."" Both protagonists have their daughters killed, they go searching for answers, their search leads them to to conspiracy theories and political realms. It's basically the same movie unfortunately, and while the first half of this movie sets up a really good story within that familiarity that looks like it'll set this movie apart from the pack, the second half jumps into action movie cliché territory, not always, but quite a bit, and becomes bogged down into how convoluted the plot gets. Basically these terrorists are linked to this guy who's linked to this guy who may or may not know this guy who works for this guy.... it got to be too much towards the end and the movie lost me in some parts with it's political dialogue. The action scenes though, when they go down, they go down. They are raw, they are dirty, they are realistic. This movie is a bit more violent then I thought it would be, but I still enjoyed watching the movie and I had a fun time with it. I think it's definitely worth another watch.I am going to give ""The Foreigner"" a B-.Check out my video review of ""The Foreigner"" here on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUVN59I3WXo",The Foreigner

163,iamjacksmoviechannel,Even a little bit of Chan is better than no Chan at all,7,13 October 2017,"""The Foreigner""- it's Jackie Chan guys, and not just him doing a lot of slapstick like he's been doing for the past more than a decade. This is a real dramatic thriller. Which may be bothersome to some because we were probably all expecting another martial arts flick here, but this movie still proves that an older Jackie is better than none at all. He plays Quan, a man who loses his daughter during a sudden bombing in London. And we see him, he looks haggard and lost, a man whose rough history can be seen right on his face. This is probably the best acting we've seen from him ever, conveying great sadness with very few words. The bombing was perpetrated by a group calling itself the authentic IRA, a group that may or may not be affiliated with the old IRA which has been dormant for 19 years due to a peace treaty. Pierce Brosnan plays Liam Hennessy, the Irish Deputy Minister in London. Before this post he also had ties to the IRA, ties which he is now trying to correct. Quan believes that Hennessy knows the identity of the bombers and so be begins a full-on assault in order to get the names. What's surprising about ""The Foreigner"" is just how much political intrigue the movie has. It unfolds with the twists and turns of a solid novel, which I guess shouldn't be a surprise considering how it is based on a 1992 novel. Nearly every character has a rough or tragic past, even though there is a 19 year peace treaty, that doesn't necessarily mean there aren't still huge grudges, and the connections between people only get more complicated as it goes along.But I say it's surprising because you just don't consider this much plotting when concerning a Jackie Chan movie. In fact for long stretches, it almost feels more like a Pierce Brosnan political thriller more than a revenge flick.And if you were to name the film's biggest problem, it's that it sometimes feels like it's at odds with itself. Brosnan couldn't be better here though and when Jackie is on screen, the performance is not only good but even though older, he's still spry and that is definitely something to admire in a 63 year old man.

This is just a cheap trick one note pony raking over old ground and potentially romanticising and radicalising individuals to a region that has fought hard on all sides to keep the peace for over 20 years. The actors involved should all be ashamed and Brosnan's accent (for an Irishman) is laughable. But then again this is the age where people vote to punch themselves in the face by electing Trump and voting for brexit",The Foreigner
165,Bangorboy,Unexpectedly excellent,8,4 January 2020,"Had this on my Netflix watchlist for a while without any particular enthusiasm, but it had an ok IMDb rating. Knew virtually nothing about the film beforehand. A lot of it is based on/draws on Northern Ireland which is my background. In the first 20 mins there were a few unbelievable elements from a Northern Irish perspective which nearly made me turn off (non locals wouldn't recognise). However glad I didn't. Excellent and interesting film and great use of Jackie chan, Brosnan and good supporting cast. I know Brosnan was born in Ireland but his accent is all over the place and unlike any Irish accent I've ever heard, nevertheless he is still a great actor with considerable presence. Would recommend.",The Foreigner
166,Fargomoviecritic,Great acting and a story of revenge that makes you cheer,10,15 March 2020,Jackie Chan does more than martial arts in this movie. Pierce does a great job too! There is blood when people punch/fight and is more realistic than almost every movie now a days. Movie show great special effects of the bombs going off and the casualties that are created. One of the best movie I have seen in terms of not falling asleep or getting  off watching great actors acting bad  in a movie.,The Foreigner

168,jpcjcpd,Surprisingly Good,8,30 May 2021,"I didn't know what to expect. My familiarity with Jackie Chan is mostly comedic martial arts films.He does a great job playing a dramatic role and easily carries the movie when Pierce Brosnan is not on screen. The action is realistic, not over the top and gratifying.The history documents are a little confusing. They put Chans character as both Vietcong affiliated and US trained later (but then I don't think this was filmed with a DVR in mind). The IRA characters vaguely reference real people from ""the troubles"" through the accords. How accurate they are I can not say. I only remember what I saw on the news as a kid and the news was not impartial.Altogether a good flick - what movies are supposed to be. Good story, acting and well placed action. Worth a watch.",The Foreigner

170,michaelmouse1,An outstanding thriller,10,13 April 2019,"Everything you could want in a thriller and more. ""The Foreigner"" delivers in spades...an excellent screenplay that provides a tense, edge of the seat storyline with enough twists and turns to keep the viewer hooked right up to the very end. It also is a poignant and moving story of the darkness of men's hearts and the utter shallowness and evil of terrorism. Top acting by all and precise direction and editing results in a pretty much flawless movie. Highly recommended.",The Foreigner
171,beastiex,Ultimately Disappointing,5,2 September 2020,What a strange mismatch of a film.The first thirty minutes had me hooked but then descended into farce with the action scenes.This movie was good when concentrating on the political story line shame it could not make its mind up whether it wanted to be a serious drama or an action adventure.Shame really because it had promise,The Foreigner
172,Sumpmonster,Pierce Brosnan Shines,8,24 May 2020,"This a predictable Brit-flick about Northern Irish terrorists basically ripping up the Belfast Agreement to return to their lives of causing mayhem in mainland Britain. Great performance from Brosnan giving his best Gerry Adams impersonation. Chan is his usual understated here - kind of Hong Kong Phooey without the Scatman Crothers treatment. And poor little Katie Leung, well up the cast list, but little screen time. Is it predictable, yes absolutely - who can beat Jackie Chan in a fight? Maybe Jet Li, but he's not on the payroll.
Some good old beatdown on bad guys and you can help but cheer when Mr Quan unleashes his retribution. Maybe not in line for many awards, but it's a good watch and a lot better than some of the garbage lurking around streaming services.",The Foreigner
173,ChocOrange_,Very Entertaining,7,6 December 2017,"No doubt many will be drawn to the movie by Jackie Chan. It's not a Jackie Chan movie in the traditional sense and he's not the main player in this.What we have is a political drama, and a decent one at that. Some old hands in the directors chair and the acting roles make for an entertaining romp, albeit a serious one.Don't expect comedy from Jackie, this is played straight and his role is more on the outskirts of the main drama, although it's certainly integral to the film.Well worth watching, but don't expect Jackie Chan style fights all the time, although he has his moments. It really makes a change to see him working with a decent director for a change. More please.",The Foreigner

As the movie starts with a simple londonian buisenessman, accelerates with the death of his beloved daughter,rides with the truth revealing actions full of terrorism, buried past and a British government official. The movie gently will be blended with u...will generate a storm in ur brain....will particularly play with ur thoughts and at the end will toy ur perceptions.The movie moves on dynamically towards a thrilling climax...touchy one as well..acting is u know will be always excellent with jackie chan...but others also have done well including pierce brosnan.... Good to see him in a very good form after a time i can say...the actions are also eye soothing....u can not ignore those when jackie is around ...can u ??????such movie should not be missed.....never say no to this one....never.......",The Foreigner

177,Marthian80,"Decent political thriller, but don't expect a Jackie Chan beat 'm up flick",6,18 December 2018,"This movie is about an old Chinese man, named Quan Ngoc Minh (Jackie Chan), with a troubled past who is emotionally shattered after losing his daughter to terrorist bombings in London. Meanwhile, Irish Deputy Minister Liam Hennessy (Pierce Brosnan) founds out that the bombing was claimed by a group who calls themselves the Authentic IRA. Liam immediately goes to angrily confronts his subordinates over the bombing, demanding who was responsible for killing civilians.
Quan, desperate to seek revenge, sees Liam on an interview on TV and decides to confront him. He goes to Belfast and manages to get a talk with Liam, demanding the names of the bombers. Liam says he doesn't know who they are and Quan is kicked out but not after he leaves a small bomb in the place... After this attack, Quan starts threatening Liam more and more to give him the names of the bombers. But Quan is not Liam's only problem because his hands are getting dirty with the recent bombings and his IRA past...The best this movie has to offer are the two main stars. Jackie Chan is excellent as an older man with a troubled past. And he still can kick some butt to, even in his 60's! His switch from silent old man to guerrilla fighter was a bit sudden but well done. Pierce Brosman is also great as an ex-IRA member who's slowly drowning in the political problems and the new IRA that start to get out of control. The action scenes are few but when the action get's going it is great. There is also a lot of political thriller elements that are also well done, but now we also get in the problems I have with the movie.My main issue is that it struggles with what it wants to be. On the one hand you have Jackie Chan's character seeking revenge and turning into a 'Rambo' character, including setting traps and fighting in the woods. And on the other hand you have Pierce Brosman's character up to his neck in a political swamp with lot's of backstabbing and shady business going on. The two stories and scenes (action vs. tense political drama) are so different that it feels like two different movies that clash with each other constantly. Add to that the weak supporting cast and the not so interesting story of Chan (we all have seen 'father-takes-revenge' stories, right?) and you have a movie that is a bit 'meh' at times. The constant switch from cool Jackie Chan action to intense political drama is a bit abrupt for me, making it difficult to follow at times.It's not a bad movie and I recommend it if you like political thrillers, but don't go in expecting to see a 'standard' Jackie Chan beat 'm up flick.",The Foreigner
178,kriskaiser420,Seriously underrated,9,6 May 2019,One of Jackie Chan's finest. Pierce Brosnan wasn't so bad either... I won't go into the story but will say it was quite cohesively written with excellent acting on all parts. No glaring issues in plot. No shark jumping. Cinematography was beautiful and you could follow the action shot since they were not done too close in as some are. Over all a very well done move.,The Foreigner

I started watching this movie today not knowing that it was based on Leather's book. It was hilarious because I knew what was going to happen next but couldn't for the life of me figure out how until I saw the ending credits!
Anyways the book is definitely much much better. Much more detailed and exciting. A lot more gripping.
But nevertheless the movie is worth watching as well but there are quite a bit of changes to the book that lets it down.",The Foreigner
180,Ffolkes-3,A solid revenge story,9,7 March 2018,"Watching ""The Foreigner"" proves why Martin Campbell was Eon's choice to reboot Bond franchise twice. He's probably one of the most skilful directors of action films that aren't only about action sequences.The movie has a solid story of revenge. Yes, we've seen it all before and the premise of a naturalized Londoner of Chinese origins who gets to fight IRA may put a smile on your face but hey, that's why we love movies, don't we? And you know what? It really works.The story is very well executed and never goes too far. Jackie Chan gives a solid dramatic performance and Pierce Brosnan is at the top of his game as a former IRA soldier turned British goverment's advisor whose past casts shadow over his current position. The growing tension between the two is very strongly discernible and that's what makes the film a really entertaining experience. Action sequences are also more than what you might expect - well choreographed, not overblown, actually pretty real, and even funny (Chan's escape from boarding house is really great). ""The Foreigner"" is Brosnan's second joint venture with Martin Campbell. No wonder they decided to join forces again, but this time in an adaptation of Ernest Hemingway's ""Across the River and Into the Trees"". I'm really looking forward to their next project.",The Foreigner
181,rajitecture,"Mostly good , but one main problem.",7,23 June 2019,"Movie really keeps my attention, but I found a big flaw in this movie I can't get over and that is the sudden change from tired old man to full of energy taking down teams of people coming after him. It's a bit unbelievable, even though they finally explained his history as having some military experience.",The Foreigner
182,eclarkdog,Really quite good..surprisingly so,8,20 February 2020,"I've never seen a Jackie Chan movie. I guess I've just always been neutral toward him..his movies never interested me. This popped up on Netflix though with Brosnan, and I'm like WTF, so I first checked the reviews here which were glowing.Exceptionally well acted, tight - even at 2 hours, and engaging drama/thriller. Chan does not say much, but when he does it matters, but his acting was quite good with some emotional scenes. Brosnan really stand out here though. I haven't seen him in anything in years and forget how really good an actor he is. He needs to be in more quality stuff and is reaching a certain mature age and look where he can fit so many roles. Several other excellent Brit actors here that many folks may not recognize, but stalwarts of Brit TV.I gather this is not a typical Chan movie. If you like spy-type thrillers and revenge flicks, this one will fill the bill.",The Foreigner
183,zentist-563-976986,Solid Movie,7,4 December 2017,"The basic theme of this movie has been done 100 times. a bereaved father with special forces background looking for revenge on the killers of his daughter. The added factor that makes this movie stand out is a second story line related to the rather delicate political situation in Northern Ireland and the permanent risk that the Troubles will come back. Jackie Chan and Pierce Brosnan are convincing as the two protagonists and there is enough action to keep Chan fans interested but not so much that there is not space for the underlying story - which is a little more complicated than ""kill all the bad guys"". A good movie and a very different and dark role for Chan. I did not read the book the movie is based on but would be interested to know if the movie toned down the violence for Chan. He roughs up a lot of Brosnans tough guy lackeys but does not kill them.",The Foreigner

It is terrific and needs a much higher IMDb rating than the 7.2 it now has. It is by far the best movie Chan has made and a truly clever thriller. The script is smart, the editing spot on and the directing just superb. Pierce Brosnan does a great acting job, probably his best role ever. I was riveted by the story-line, especially as I'm Irish born and lived in London for many years. Youngsters will not understand the movie because it is too smart for them.

I've only seen JC in a serious role in a couple of films and yet, his ability to portray his character - action role (believe his stunts always hits the mark) aside, was, for me, I think, truly impressive.Whoever chose the actors for the parts they played did a great job in their selection and, as always, it's a big thanks from to all involved in this industry in whatever capacity, creating, producing and releasing, an action thriller film; that affords ordinary folk like me to switch off from the outside world and for a short time become enmeshed in onscreen entertainment like this during their allotted downtime, is very much appreciated.IMO.....Well worth watching.",The Foreigner

However I really cannot stand Jackie Chan who just badmouths the United States and our capitalistic system after he's made millions of dollars from us. He is a giant hypocrite so usually I don't watch things with him but I had to balance my love of Pierce with my dislike for Jackie. Really your name is Jackie and you hate America?
At any rate, it is worth watching just to see Pierce Brosnan and listen to his wonderful Irish brogue",The Foreigner
191,Ross_A_Hall,"Excellent ""against-the-grain"" turn from Chan",9,18 December 2017,"So we're all used to watching Jackie Chan playing his roles with a touch of ""tongue in cheek"" style. There's always a bit of humour and a certain lightness about his roles. This one goes completely against that carefully developed persona.The plot is incredibly simple: Chan's daughter is murdered in a London bombing carried out by a new splinter of the IRA, setting him off on a path for revenge. Only this isn't some ""charge around London beating people up"". It builds slowly and deliberately. Less the youthful rushing around of youthful exuberance, more the steady pace of maturity.Then there's Pierce Brosnan. Doing an impression that's mostly Gerry Adams with a hint of Martin McGuinness, he keeps the intrigue swirling around as Chan intimidates him. He also plays his role to perfection.There are some contrivances in the plot, there's a pivotal scene that could've done with some better lighting and Chan's stuntman needs a better wig. Otherwise, an excellent slow burning action-thriller.",The Foreigner

193,peterquennell,So many reasons to watch this unusual thriller,10,28 January 2019,"Kudos to all the reviews here in the 7-10 star range. Here are seven more pluses which I think complement them.1. Gets you into ""the situation"". Right now Ireland shows new signs of a violence phase, possibly inevitable if Brexit becomes a reality and a hard border between Irish & Irish goes back up again - tragically, after years of the northen Catholics really prospering. It helps to read the whole torrid history, of Ireland being incessantly overrun, over 2200 years, and of during the potato famine the almost deliberate extermination.2. Gets you into one key dimension of the immense worldwide British-empire betrayals after WW1 (I've UK nationality so humor me) we ALL still live through. which led worldwide to nightmares: India's bloodbath of a partition, no Jewish homeland and instead a holocaust and today's Palestinian situation, the theocratic House of Saud, Saddam Hussein and the Baathists, Egypt's Moslem Brotherhood, the Maumau in Kenya, and the Ibo genocide in Nigeria. And those are just a fraction.3. Superb main character who had me rooting for Jackie Chan on a whole new level. Serious, drive, competent, implacable, no humor though a few laugh-out-loud things do happen.4. Superb Pierce Brosnan playing a complexed good guy/bad guy Ulster leader, one of his best roles ever, and not dissimilar to his ex British PM in ""The Ghost Writer"". Loved his accent.5. Superb Charlotte Murphy as Maggie. She starts off easy to overlook as two love interests; but wow is that misleading. Her sheer ferocity and her chilling expressions (those eyes, that mouth) and dialogue as she triggers ALL the major violence late in the film are worth watching several times - she seems to me to have twice the charisma of Alicia Vikander.6. Superb Ray Fearon as the top cop, super-smart and highly managerial, and his last words (the last in the movie) really took my breath away. I could really watch him as the lead in a series.7. Fits amazingly well with a stark British play now on fire on Broadway ""The Ferryman"" where a very large extended Catholic family in southern Ulster reveals all manner of different mindsets from fanatically pro violence to fanatically pro the opposite; one of the 10 best plays I've seen, out of some hundreds.",The Foreigner
194,markphilo,Standard revenge plot played out nicely,7,16 February 2021,"This is actually a very watchable movie. The plot progresses well and the action isn't stupidly over the top. It's gritty and you have compassion for the characters (one of my bugbears in movies these days where actors seem to think their presence in enough for you to identify with them).
Jackie Chan is a professional and takes anything he does uber-seriously. He has a great fighting style and although it is more gritty in this film, fans of his will detect some of his JC moves where is is obvious he has been involved in the fight choreography.Great job JC - a great depart from your normal comedic characters.",The Foreigner

Likely would have been better without Jackie at all. It was fairly distracting.I am not even certain why he was so angry at the minister at the end, though the minister did do bad things but not what Jackie was mad about.It seemed as if they had a good idea for a movie and somebody came along with some money and said ""This is for you but we need a part for Jackie"".I don't really have a problem with watching a 5 star movie but this could have been better.",The Foreigner

198,CIDMoosa,Chan is Back !,7,7 June 2018,"A colossal digression from his stereotype roles - The Foreigner is the ideal comeback for the legendary Jackie Chan, a part-action part-political thriller based on the IRA bombings. Miles away from the silly and entertaining Rush-Hour, Shanghai Noon type flicks, Chan does one hell of a job emoting pretty seriously as a vulnerable and repressed parent seeking out redemption. Jackie Chan plays Quan, a small, unassuming Asian man whose daughter happens to be a casualty in a politically motivated London bombing. His search for the elusive killers leads him to a British / Irish government official (Pierce Brosnan), whose own murky past with the Irish Republican Army holds clues to the killers and their motives. With all the possibilities of being a standard action movie with a weak plot, the surprise factor in The Foreigner is the screenplay which switches between the IRA conspiracy part and the Chan vendetta quite cleverly, progressing parallel in extreme pace and converging enough at different points. Added to the plot twists is the dour and serious Jackie Chan who doesn't break into a smile at all through the major runtime. Fans expecting hardcore or overdone martial arts scenes or Kung Fu bloopers are in for a surprise, for this part Rambo-part Taken-part Patriot Games thriller carries off a quite dark vigilante version of Chan without excessive CGI laden action scenes of his last few movies. While Jackie Chan surprises with some fine dramatic performance and his usual agile stunt works, Pierce Brosnan has gracefully aged from his bond franchise in to the Former IRA-turned cunning and conspiring politician role. A fine political thriller + action movie !",The Foreigner

I'm a 80's/90's kid so I have the biggest guilty pleasure for bad and cheesy action flicks. This was not one of those movies. Chan gives his performance of a lifetime as the solemn, vengeful, mourning father. I felt his pain when the camera would capture it. Not exactly an original idea or plot but Chan and Brosnon make this film feel like it is.",The Foreigner
200,powderuk,"Great film, not predictable",8,30 November 2019,"Firstly, I never thought I would see Jackie Chan take on this type of character, or film. He was brilliant.

202,madpigmadpig,"Taken meets Deathwish, but better than either one",7,4 November 2017,"This combines the father avenging a daughter and ""particular set of skills"" aspects of Taken and Deathwish (the original, not the new one which I haven't seen yet) with the considerably better fighting and acting ability of Jackie Chan - and unfortunately some pretty weak writing (which is still better than that of the two aforementioned films it's most like). The action in this movie doesn't disappoint, and Chan is excellent as usual as an actor and physical performer - despite a distinct lack of comedy and poor cinematography that's almost entirely close-ups, making it near impossible to tell exactly what's happening during those great fight scenes. The overall storyline is passable and makes sense, but the narrative progression, the actual storytelling, is very poorly written. The way Chan's character decides to latch onto Brosnan's is full of holes at best, and makes him seem like a destructive loose canon until about 2/3 of the way through the movie. I almost quit watching part way through act 2 except I had faith that Chan wouldn't play a villain. They also should have revealed his background much earlier in the film because that's pretty confusing until almost the end too. Brosnan seems to be phoning it in the whole time, which is kind of unusual for him. Maybe he's not used to playing villains and wasn't sure what to do so he turned wooden. My biggest gripe is basically how bumblingly Chan's character proceeds despite his background and some level of flickering cunning though. Most especially the final showdown wherein he walks into a closed space that might as well be a trap and wins only after taking quite an unnecessary beating himself. Granted, that fight scene is very entertaining, but it does make me question the intelligence of the protagonist to get himself stuck like that.",The Foreigner
203,sleeping_tiger,Jackie Chan is Chinese Rambo,9,2 January 2018,"The film was awesome. It kept me entertained and intrigued. It's a thriller, with action and some drama peppered throughout it. Jackie Chan does a great job of a man wanting revenge. The bulk of the movie initially made me think of Jackie Chan as a Chinese Jason Bourne, but quickly it was revealed he is more like a Chinese Rambo. He has PTSD, he suffers, but he also has motivation and will. There are a few fights scenes with Jackie Chan doing what he does best. I really liked the use of Northern Ireland as the setting. It was a beautiful backdrop to the film. What I found interesting is the film is based off a book called ""The Chinaman"".",The Foreigner
204,poewilson,Average at best,6,4 October 2017,"The P.H. Metric 61/100 The Foreigner rings out in the same way a nostalgia flick does, let us take something that was more cutesy and lovable and make it gritty, then get applauded for the dark tones of something that is almost the same as the cutesy original version.Directing: 5/10Now the marketing is going to sell you on this is the director that made that gritty reboot to the Bond series (pattern?), but this is also a director that has averaged borderline OK to pure trash for almost every film he has made for the last 18 years, so if they are going to tout the good, remember the bad as well. The Foreigner is plain, nothing special, nothing amazing, average work from an increasingly average director. The camera work reeks of status quo and scenes as well as their shots play like the project was being rushed and not given any true forethought.Acting: 5/10Brosnan and Chan acting powerhouses, they are not, but Chan is cast in a similar light as Jet Li in Danny the Dog, do not let him say much and get him to look brooding, but in terms of acting there is very little to display. Brosnan has to carry 90% of the acting in the film and while he makes a go of it, his talent is not quite there to be able to pull it off. Aside from these two, a series of increasingly wooden people try to make their arguments heard, but are nearly pointless in the cause.Cinematography: 7/10Tattersall's cinematography is above average but not his best work to date and the fight scenes were shot in a such away that it felt like you could see Chan get dragged by the invisible rope every time he did a double drop kick.Editing 7/10Catanzaro finally gets to step from out of the world of television and edit her first real film, (Smoking Aces 2 does not count) it was not a horrible first outing and with a couple steps into tightening up the pace of certain shots and phasing out some action that causes the quality of the film to go down, she could see her star rise higher.Score: 7/10The sound crew did not let the film down and those pulsing tones, are felt hard and they are felt fast. One or two miscues drops the score a bit but overall decent job.Visual Effects: 6/10I feel mean giving the visual department such a low score, I know they can only provide what is scripted and asked of them and in this case I am sure they could have provided more if they were pushed, but the effects felting underwhelming.Writing: 3/10""OK did we make our protagonist sympathetic?""""Not really.""""But it is Jackie Chan, did we at least make it seem like the system was screwing him over?""""Not really, we gave him a stalkerish vibe and showed no ineptness by the police or the Counter terrorism people.""""Great, did we at least make it cohesive with plot-holes.""""Well we turned all 500 plot-holes into one big plot-hole.""""Perfect, sounds like we can knock off early.""Production Design: 7/10Production design was probably the highest ranking factor in the film and good on them, but that generally should never be the case.Costume Design 7/10Very limited, for a good portion of the film every one is dressed in black and there happens to be a couple of issues with Jackie's outfit.Make-up/Hairstyle 7/10Limited, though the work on Jackie was well-done, though the question of what is natural and what is not does pop up, but still decent job.",The Foreigner

206,jackson-regurge,Jackie Chan at his finest!,8,5 January 2018,"The Foreigner is well-acted and directed. It is without doubt one of the best films you will watch on Netflix. The narrative is poignant for modern times and I was on the edge of my seat throughout the entire film. The acting from Jackie Chan is superb. Chan channels his character's bereavement into a stealthy determination which is compelling viewing. It is obvious from the start of the film that this is Chan as we have never seen him before. Jackie Chan's stunts are fast paced and magnificent. The stunts move the narrative forward which are also exciting for the audience. Chan uses his physical prowess and acting skills to produce a memorable and powerful performance, and one of his best in recent years. Meanwhile, Pierce Brosnan delivers a convincing performance which packs a powerful punch and gives the film real gravitas. Martin Campbell's direction is excellent; he orchestrates a brilliant and thought-provoking piece that keeps you interested throughout. Another outstanding feature of the film is the sound design and music. The soundtrack is fitting and suspenseful and steers clear from musical clichés typically used in action films. Overall, I would highly recommend the film to anyone interested in a heart-pounding action film that will leave you very satisfied and with some thought-provoking questions. I would give The Foreigner 8.5 out of 10.",The Foreigner

What I didn't expect was such a gripping film.Chan is famous for his action and comedy roles, but here, at the start, you feel the pain through him of a father losing everything in his life. Direction is so real that you're not just observing, you're too are feeling the texture of that pain. I've never seen Chan in a better role.Brosnan too. I've watched his Bonds, I've watched other films by him, but this one, in the role he's playing, was sublime. Absolutely believable because he wasn't playing a version of Brosnan, but the role in its absolute.With the recent diet of vacuous Marvel films, anybody wanting some meat in their storytelling is going to enjoy how this film plays out. Yes, there's a plot. Yes, there's revenge. But there's also humanity. And a sprinkling of double crossing. It draws you in, and holds you.Only at the end did I discovered it's a Martin Campbell film. His work on Bond set the tones for both the Brosnan and Craig eras; an under appreciated talent.

To be honest Jackie Chans character isn't really the focus of the story, in fact it really focuses on Piers Brosnan's character and the IRA side, which I actually quite enjoyed. The action, acting, directing etc wasn't revolutionary or really noteworthy, it was just solid in that department all round. It's on par and better than some similar films that are even released in theatres and was actually pleasantly surprised by this for a Netflix original. I don't know much about the director, Martin Campbell, aside from the fact that he directed Casino Royale, which is my favourite bond movie as well as one of my favourite action movies of all time.

209,Grumphy,Jackie Chan puts 'reign' in The Foreigner,9,14 October 2017,"Hardly anyone expects an action thriller to be as moving as The Foreigner. There are tons to choose from that begin with the exact same inciting incident – protagonist's loved ones get killed. Often they even waste unnecessary time so that the audience can grow attached to the soon-to-be-deceased and relate more strongly to the main character. However. Jackie Chan will break your heart from the get go. Maybe it's his own personal lovable demeanour which we're more often than not used to see happily smiling, that helps in the matter, but Jackie's acting skills are nothing to sneer at either. He does a wonderful job.The film is it's definitely darker and more realistically portrayed than quite a few Jackie's latest works. Jackie's age shows, but in his favour and definitely does not hinder his abilities as one of the world's top action stars. Every punch, kick and fall his character receives reverberates in the viewer, making you believe that this time the protagonist is not invincible. Though the trailer perhaps might be somewhat misleading in the sense of the full on action ratio in the film, the story unfolding with the Brosnan's character holds its own. It's solid and believable and Brosnan is top notch. Funnily enough, one of the previous reviewers disliked Brosnan's ""attempt at sounding Irish"", completely ignoring the fact that Brosnan is Irish. Born in Drogheda, town about 30 miles south of Northern Ireland's border.Story is compelling and thought provoking. Fits in the current political climate but viewed from another angle than the already overused Islamic terrorist tropes. Not to say it doesn't have it's issues. Occasionally there's too much reliance on the exposition, which may be necessary to some who are unfamiliar with IRA and such, but there's definitely a better way to do it than to use a beginner's solution of giving relevant exposition through a phone call for example. Few worn out clichés but nothing that would diminish the suspension of disbelief a great deal. It's a standout film for both, Chan and Brosnan, in their already impressive résumé. Definitely my favourite by director Martin Campbell. Go and watch it! If you like Jackie Chan, you'll like him even more. Even if you don't like Jackie (then I don't know what's wrong with you but) you'll enjoy his performance in The Foreigner.",The Foreigner
210,grglmn,Good balance,8,14 January 2018,"This movie strikes a good balance of story and action. So many movies these days either try to be talky and intellectual and are ploddingly boring, or have no character development but lots of shots fired and things blown up. This one has good performances from both Chan and Brosnan, a little nuance to the bad guy, and some politics and intigue mixed in with the right dose of action. Worth a watch.",The Foreigner
211,umashankarpati1997,A simple cliche story with thrilling action and suspense.,8,29 December 2017,"Been a fan of Jackie Chan, his actions, his deliverance to a movie is mind blowing.
Here is my take on The Foreigner.
Adapted from Stephen Leather's 1992 novel The Chinaman, the film takes place in modern-day London and Belfast, where a new group of terrorists known as the ""Authentic IRA"" claim responsibility for a London bombing that kills over a dozen civilians and leaves many more injured. Among the casualties is the daughter of Quan Ngoc Minh (Chan), a Chinese restaurant owner with a history serving in the Vietnam-era special forces. Left without any other family members to comfort him, Quan makes it his mission to find those responsible for the bombing and bring them to justice.
The film ""The Foreigner"" is a truly brilliant thriller that holds your breath from the first minute to the last minute. You never know what will happen and have to stare on the screen all the time. The makeup, sound mixing, action choreography, and acting performances are all top-notch. Jackie Chan perhaps gives his career-best performances, both physically and emotionally. Mr. Chan is in his early 60s, and he doesn't deliver the action pizazz here that he used to. Nor, frankly, does he summon enough gravitas to be persuasive in the role of a grief-maddened father. For what it's worth, Mr. Brosnan, as Quon's nemesis, sells the angry-all-the-time requirement for his character
It doesn't hurt that director Martin Campbell has placed two capable acting veterans at the forefront of the film, in Pierce Brosnan and Jackie Chan. Both actors are tasked with inhabiting roles that are antithetical to the on screen personas they're most well-known for. Brosnan, for his part, trades in his suave, Bond-like heroic swagger to play a corrupt politician who often closely resembles a mob boss, while Chan turns in a grim and quiet performance, directly contrary to the comedic roles most American audiences associate him with.Mr. Chan is in his early 60s, and he doesn't deliver the action pizazz here that he used to. Nor, frankly, does he summon enough gravitas to be persuasive in the role of a grief-maddened father. For what it's worth, Mr. Brosnan, as Quon's nemesis, sells the angry-all-the-time requirement for his characterThe Foreigner uses the talents of both Jackie Chan and Pierce Brosnan quite well, turning the well-worn personas of both actors on their heads. And thanks to a handful of propulsive and violent action sequences, The Foreigner mostly succeeds at what it sets out to do, even if that also means you'll likely have already forgotten about it by the time you get home from seeing it. 
This movie is a must watch.",The Foreigner
212,nikhilrampal,Don't be misled by the trailer... This is not taken 4,5,28 December 2017,"Whether the reader will enjoy this film or not depends on the expectations of what genre this movie truly belongs to. Before watching The foreigner I expected an action with a hint of drama and having now seen the movie it is quite the contrary. It should be noted that Jackie Chan is far from the main character of this movie and there are very few action scenes. And although these action scenes were entertaining, they were abrupt and already exposed by the trailer. As a result it is hard not to be disappointed by this movie even though the drama was watchable.Despite this films interesting take on modern terrorism and the occasional scenes of jackie chan kicking ass, I would not recommend this film without expressing the issues I have raised.",The Foreigner

218,Netjer-y-khet,A spectacular performance,9,30 November 2017,"This has to be Jackie Chan's best ever performance. The emotion is not just incredible, the back story reveals why the protagonist (Chan as Quan) behaves as he does; this is the 'buried past' referred to in the story line above. This is quite a rare thing in the movies I've seen recently and it works well here. The acting performances of all the players will have you holding your breath from start to finish, never knowing quite what will happen next, yet nothing is lost.The makeup is also excellent. For example, throughout the film I wasn't even aware that Pierce Brosnan was in the role of Hennessy. It must've been the beard, spectacles and Irish brogue that put me off the trail.Political intrigue and revenge are the two closely intertwined threads that turn this film into a complex multi-level story. It's well worth watching more than once however Jacky Chan action fans may be disappointed a little because the film isn't like anything I've seen Chan do before. I'd give this film three thumbs up, but I only have two.Ten out of ten, and it's on my ""watch this film again"" list.",The Foreigner
219,hollywoodhernandez-70868,Jackie Chan still has that Kung Fu Fighting magic,7,13 October 2017,"The Foreigner is Jackie Chan's first serious drama. He plays the father of a high school aged girl who is killed in a terrorist attack in London. After the attack we find out that Quan (Chan) is a former elite special forces soldier who fought in the Vietnam war. He gives up everything he owns to seek revenge on his daughter's killers. After seeing a former IRA member on the news (Pierce Brosnan), who's now working as a liaison between the British and the IRA, he decides to camp on Liam Hennessy's doorstep in search of any information that can lead him to his daughter's killers.We soon learn that Hennessy is not exactly squeaky clean in his dealings with the IRA and a trail of deceit and a serious espionage story begins to develop. This is where the story went a little off the ranch for me. I was enjoying the character development of Chan's character. We see Chan and his tortured past and we see why the killing of his daughter is the overload that sends him out seeking only to harm and kill the perpetrators of the crime. At the age of 63 Chan still has that Kung Fu fighting magic and this is a rare occasion where I felt like more violence could have been included. The violence isn't gratuitous, it's a necessary part of the story. But unfortunately there are long periods without Chan's character in the movie. Instead the director chose to make the movie more about Brosnan's character and the often hard to follow story of political corruption.There is enough of Chan's creative fight scenes to make the movie enjoyable, but I would have liked to have seen a little more. The movie is rated ""R"" for violence and some sexuality and it runs just under 2 hours. On my ""Hollywood Popcorn Scale"" The Foreigner rates a LARGE. Hollywood Hernandez",The Foreigner

226,LauraLeeWasHere,From a Christian Perspective,8,26 November 2020,"Jackie Chan takes on Pierce Brosnan and the IRA.
This is a cleverly written, well constructed cat and mouse game with several plot threads that come together at the end with a toned down Jackie Chan who uses a lot more brains than kicks. Although he still has many of the creative moves he's famous for, seeing fewer of them makes more sense for a man the age and background he is portraying. He gives a solid, subtle performance and Pierce Brosnan is also wise enough to use some acting restraint in what could have been a stereotypical, over the top role. They make their characters believable as does the large supporting cast. Even the ones who have very little screen time and dialogue.
I liked this movie. There was a lot of bombings, fight scenes and guns fired that made it intense, but it makes sense for the time and place they depict.
The sex scenes were throughout and included several brief moments of groaning and grunts but no actual nudity.
What is the hardest to take is all the uses of Jesus' name as a cuss peppered throughout the dialogue of the Irish people, although near the end as things get pretty intense and when the ""chickens come home to roost"" they were depicted as not in vain at all, but very sincerely felt. Again, it's how people in that place and situation talk and in reality they use MUCH worse language and more of it. But I admit it grates on me and after two hours of it I was ready for it to be over.
But I did enjoy this movie, found it clever, and even informative. I have a way of gaging just how bad I think it is on a ""Christian scale"". I imagine Jesus sitting next to me watching it with me, because I literally believe He is, yet I didn't feel like I was doing something I had to sneak or hide from Him. But that's me. And honestly, again, there are other good movies to spend our valuable time and money on. I didn't pay for this movie but watched it free through my public library and I would not have have paid to see it because we vote with our money and it sends a message to the movie makers and this film could have been made without all the bad language and a lower intensity of violence and still would have been realistic.
But that's me and my ""measure of faith"". I will just pass on the facts and my opinion and leave you to your own faith, conscience and consequences on Judgement Day.
I hope this review helps.

227,dermobreen,Brosnan channels Gerry Adams,6,15 October 2017,"Martin Campbell is no stranger to action films having brought us two Bond re-boots; Casino Royale with Daniel Craig from 2006 and Pierce Brosnan's first 007 outing, Goldeneye in 1995. The Foreigner is his latest action film and once again he is teamed up with Pierce Brosnan who is channelling his full Gerry Adams impersonation.Jackie Chan plays an immigrant in London who owns his own restaurant. His wife and one of his two daughters were killed many years ago during the evacuation of Saigon. He lives with his only daughter who is tragically killed by an IRA bomb in London. He goes straight to the top of the IRA food-chain and intimidates Pierce Brosnan to give up the names of the bombers. What ensues is an explosive cat and mouse thriller between the two main protagonists played out against the back-drop of further IRA bomb violence in London from a rogue IRA cell.This is where we need to say a word or two about the film's context and target audience. I watched this in a packed theatre in Silicon Valley, California. I dare say most if not all of the subtleties of the plot were lost on the audience. Indeed specific references to the Omagh bombing may not resonate with a global audience. The second problem is Jackie Chan. Audiences have come to know him as a lovable clown in most of his roles. There is nothing funny about his role in The Foreigner. It is played straight, yet the audience in my screening were laughing and giggling at what I believed were serious plot points and/or action sequences.Campbell delivers a taught thriller full of Republican intrigue, back-stabbing and dare I say it ""normal"" Irish politics. The British government do not come out of this cleanly either. Their Machiavellian plotting and use of Brosnan's character is cold and devious. Jackie Chan brings us a subdued performance, befitting the grief he is experiencing. Brosnan brings us a fully-fledged Garry Adams which may be lost on some not familiar with the conflict or the politics of Northern Ireland. There is a strong Irish support cast including Orla Brady. Is it the best of Campbell's work, sadly no. It is not as tight or as tense as his earlier work, such as Casino Royale. It is, however a notch above some of the current offerings in the cinema. Pierce Brosnan's channeling of Gerry Adams is almost worth the price of admission alone.3 out of 5.",The Foreigner

230,stevenclayalcander,Best action movie with deep emotion and complex politics !,9,1 October 2017,"When i saw this movie release in theater, i cant wait to watch this movie and i'm not disappointed at all. The movie starts with good background story, i can see the bonding between father and daughter, loving each other who are living in London, England. Then the tragic bombing happened, unfortunately Chan daughter was nearby and killed by that tragedy. Someone claim that was their deeds, and it is a terrorist attack. I feel really sad and sorry with Chan, i can see he is really suffered because of his loss. I'm so impressed with Chan acting in this movie, it seems he really does his role so deep and emotional. I can see Chan character who is broken, suffering, mysterious, have a dark past and loss his patience with the investigation which take a long time, because it involve some political issues with Ireland, who is in peace agreement with England. I think this is one of the best Chan acting performa in his entire career. And one more who is really take this movie to be one of the best in 2017 is Pierce Brosnan. He acts as Liam Hennesy, someone who is an official government. The story then become more complex and slowly reveal the connection between Hennesy and the terrorist. At one point, i really love this movie because it not only pure action movie, but it gives you many political issues and problems. When it involve politics, everything becomes complicated. At another point, this movie has a good story with deep emotional background story, and you can feel symphatic easily with those two main characters. They have their own reason for what they are doing, and it feels realistic and deep. The action is amazing too ! I think everyone already know with Chan success in acting movies. We can see Chan who is really skilled and dangerous, but already old and can out of stamina easily. At last, i think all aspect in this movie is remarkable. The action movie with deep emotional story and complex political issues makes this movie really amazing.

There are a lot of revenge flicks that follow the same ole same ole but even though the principle was the same the story telling was a great. My only complaint was that as a 61 year old, and he looked all of it, he was pulling off some really implausible physical action and stealth scenes. I thought he played the vengeful father very well.

Chan's character seeks revenge when his teenage daughter is killed in a terrorist bombing of a clothing shop. Even the plot involving antagonist, Pierce Brosnan's character as the head of the IRA, isn't entirely complex, but the awesome John Wick's plot is (spoiler) his dog is murdered and he massacres an entire crime organization. Chan similarly makes it his intent to take down as many people are in his path to avenge the loss of his daughter. Similarly to John Wick, Chan's character, Ngoc Minh Quan, a special forces operator during the Vietnam War, can be brutal behind his seemingly reserved persona.You can feel Chan's loss and in every scene, and also marvel at the choreography of him taking out a gang of brutes in the forest in amazing action sequences. Sans the fun and nostalgia of the Rush Hour/Shanghai movies, The Foreigner may be Jackie Chan's greatest effort to date.",The Foreigner

The characters that fight and engage in a river of bullets and large explosions that open the mouth of hell itself should be for a good reason and give the viewer a chance to feel something for the character to why they're doing it. The Foreigner (2017) is a good example of a movie that does this perfectly. Political corruption, moral atrocities, and innocent lives lost to unfair circumstances can be fought and changed by one man. The character of Ngoc Minh Quan portrayed by Jackie Chan is done extraordinarily well. One thing we all should keep in mind, a man that seeks revenge and has nothing left to lose is true terror.

Basic action government story line...Government tries to figure out who did it, another random character trying to do the same thing and of course terrorists trying to do evil tasks again and again. The movies tries to show you different story lines. Pierce Brosnan who was a IRA member in the past with dark secrets. The foreigner who is Jackie Chan suffering from his daughter's death. I wont explain anymore story lines or characters. It would just take forever...Thus this is why I gave the movie a 7. There too many characters and just made everything too complicated.

252,pramsalim,So...is it an action movie? or a political thriller?,6,12 October 2017,"A Taken-esque movie for Jackie Chan. Depicting him as a beaten old man that secretly has a 'particular set of skills'. What's more, one of the most successful James Bond director, Martin Campbell, came aboard to work with Jackie. Seriously, this movie was meant for greatness. However, I was left disappointed with the final product.Let's just dive straight into the problems. I felt lied to by this movie. It was advertised as a revenge thriller with Jackie Chan being the new Liam Neeson. Instead, it came out to be some sort of political thriller that throws in Jackie Chan just for the sake of it. He felt really out of place in this movie. His actions are just irrelevant to the whole plot of this movie. The director tries to make his presence known in this movie, but the dull attempts just makes me irritated in the end. The movie felt like two separate films mushed into one feature film. Confusing itself on where to concentrate, the Jackie Chan revenge movie or the Irish political thriller starring Pierce Brosnan. Leaving both equally under developedHonestly, I think if they decided to just divide the movie into the two films I recently mentioned, it would be great. An actual Jackie Chan revenge movie that could paint him alongside Liam Neeson's Brian Mills and Keanu Reeves's John Wick would attract people everywhere. And a terrorism political thriller led by a solid performance by Pierce Brosnan could be really good. Which shows the more disappointment I had for this movie. Both Jackie Chan and Pierce Brosnan were really good. And so was the action scenes that sometimes pops into the movie. I had no doubt that Martin Campbell is a good director. It's just the way the movie turns out to be was really different from how it advertises itself. And it confuses both the audiences and, perhaps, the movie itself.I really wish the movie was better than it was. Just because of the potential that it has and the obvious glimpse of merits inside this mess of a movie. However, I feel that if you came into this with no expectations whatsoever, you could find yourself being entertained by this movie.",The Foreigner

256,aadamhgafar-68237,"The Foreigner - review, 5/10",5,4 April 2018,"I went into this movie expecting classic Jackie Chan action, unfortunately this is not what I got. Instead I was given a much more drab and cynical political thriller in which an aging Jackie played a broken father seeking revenge for the death of his daughter, stopping at nothing to achieve his goal. A role that Jackie isn't known for playing, and it shows.The pacing of the movie crawls by at a snail's pace, with the first half being painfully slow and while a decent attempt is made at a coherent plot and some backstory in the second half, there's no getting around the tired political ramblings we've seen before in every other political thriller. Despite this movie being advertised as a Jackie Chan film, he's side-lined for huge swathes of time in favour of these cheesy, cookie-cutter scenes of the struggle between the IRA and the British. When you are finally rewarded with some action don't expect to see the Jackie you're used to. The character has been made deliberately slower and his age has been emphasised, an odd move with a talent like Jackie Chan at your disposal. As such, the spontaneous, comedic action of young Jackie Chan has been swapped out for unsatisfying Vietcong-style traps and bomb-making, which seems like such a disappointing waste of Jackie Chan's ability. The entire cast was serviceable with Pierce Brosnan (as angry antagonist) and Jackie Chan (as angry protagonist) standing out more than the rest in their roles. The issue was not the acting, however, rather the poor realisation of the main characters left the actors with unrelatable, callous personalities to work with that only made the slog between the rare moments of action feel longer. You are made to sit through two hours scummy characters take turns showing you how scummy they are and yes, that is about as uncompelling as it sounds... even Jackie couldn't save this one.",The Foreigner

I've made all my friends and family watch it, and I've seen it myself no less than a dozen times. It is precisely my cup of tea. Why? Well, I'm not too great at explaining myself or critical thinking on film, but I'll give it a shot.The pacing. Starts out with a bang, dials it way back, then turns up gradually. We don't so much see a mystery unfold as we do go through a process somewhat behind the eyes of Jackie Chan's character. He takes his time, not that he bides it.The fallible hero. Jackie Chan is old. You didn't know? Well he is. And it shows. They don't try to go the Stallone route where he somehow hasn't lost a step and can fight a tank even though he's in his 70's. When he gets hit, it hurts. No more 30 minute long fights with ladders and folding chairs.The villain. Pierce Brosnan is one of my faves, and he turned up a good performance, in my opinion. An ex-extremist gone soft, playing politics. His presence enough would've been enough to satisfy, but he played the part well. Thankfully.The score/soundtrack. Carpenter-esque, and it really sets the tone. Keeps it tense. People who aren't familiar with Carpenter might liken it to the score used in Stranger Things.

270,jncressman,"Torture, extra judicial killings, vigilantism - all by the good guys?",1,15 December 2017,"Morally the worst movie every made.
This movie advocates torture, vigilantism, extra judicial killings and threatening and beating up innocent people. You knew this was going to be a movie about revenge but Quan (Jackie Chan) directs his vengeance against Liam Hennessy(Pierce Bronsnan) a man with a checkered past but also a man we have no idea has any involvement in the death of his daughter. Near the end of the movie there is a scene that links Liam to the bombers, which might have been added to justify Quan's actions, but makes no sense. If Liam new anything about the bombers then the rest of his actions in movie are pointless. The movie also seems a little confused, as Quan's actions actually don't contribute in anyway to the main plot of figuring out who the bombers are. He actually just gets in the way. He does jump in and attack the bombers just before the British police go in and he kills 3 out of 4 them. Also he luckily escapes before killing the last bomber, the only one who knows where the last bomb is, so that the British police can torture her into revealing the leaves the one bomber alive.
I would like to believe the makers of the movie's only motivation was to show Jackie Chan's character being a bad ass. The alternative is that it was funded by people who are trying to swing public opinion in favour of the actions depicted in the movie.",The Foreigner

279,thefilmnotebook,Lacks dynamic tension between the leads,5,29 October 2017,"The Foreigner is a film that rushes to its ends without putting effort into the process. This happens, and that happens, but you don't really understand why. I was curiously excited to see Jackie Chan playing a serious role, and although there is the usual martial arts involved, there is a certain energy missing. Chan plays Quan Ngoc Minh, a common immigrant living in London, and when his daughter is tragically killed in a terrorist attack, he chases after government official Liam Hennessey (Pierce Brosnan) for information, knowing that since he was a former leader of the Provisional IRA, he would have what he needs. The most problematic thing about the film is its weak connections – between the characters, their stories and with the audience. For a film that relies heavily on its characters' back stories, it does not devote enough time to allow us to explore and understand their psyche. What we are given is a rather bland emotional palette. I sympathised with Quan's past and present despair, but only on a surface level. Chan and Brosnan's stories feel like two separate ones, forcibly meshed together. The most effective revenge tales requires magnetic chemistry between the hero and the villain, where one has something the other doesn't. In this film, Quan is, as Hennessey puts it, 'always one step ahead'. This hurts the dynamic balance, and it is deadly, when it comes to holding the tension. As a result, there is lack of urgency for the majority of the film, and coupled with the implied invincibility of Quan, there is nothing much left for us to guess and anticipate. Chan and Brosnan are both capable actors, but here they are inhibited by the fixity and thinness of their characters. We see who they are too clearly. When I think about the film more, it also occurred to me that Quan's actions closely mirror that of a terrorist's, as he uses terror tactics to extract information and force obedience. An eye for an eye mentality is what the Foreigner suffers the most from, it stereotypes and lends its characters no depth. In the end, I am ambivalent about this film. I don't like it, neither do I hate it. It is quite plain and gives me a plain feeling. It needed more pieces of the puzzle for us to solve, and most crucially, its single-minded and simplistic painting of characters caused it to be just blood and guns, leaving little for us to connect with.",The Foreigner

Prior to watching the movie tonight I had read no reviews, nor had I watched the trailer again because I prefer to see a movie with as little as possible spoilers - and the brief trailer I saw seemed like a serious thriller so I was really excited!The movie begins with the most tragic story one can experience - the death of a child, and in this case from an IRA bombing, killing innocent people. 
I soon realised that this wasn't going to be a normal Jackie Chan movie and it really sucked me in as a viewer with suspense, drama, intrigues and the vengeance made with precision and great acting! The story really depicts the conflict between IRA and the British and I felt it was very well written, based on facts - not fiction.Here Jackie Chan was able to show what a fantastic actor he is, not just jump-kicking his way through every scene but top level stage acting! Major goosebumps throughout the almost two hours for sure!
This is easily the best acting Jackie Chan has ever done and I hope he gets to play more deep acting roles in the future because this was magical!Pierce Brosnan plays an IRA leader turned politician and his performance is absolutely on par with Jackie Chan - spot on, dramatic, energetic and with precision! Using his Irish heritage (he was born in Ireland) means he can deliver an Northern Irish accent that's very accurate. Best acting I've seen from Pierce Brosnan!I'm not going to spoil anything else for you by going on any further but this movie was easily the best I've seen so far in 2018 - and probably the best one I've seen in a very long time! I might even go so far to say that this is amongst the best drama/thrillers I've seen in my life!There are no computer generated special effects in this movie, only great acting, directing and camerawork! It's easily the Jackie Chan movie with the least fighting scenes - but the few ones in it are beautifully made and realistic.There are many very strong supporting actors too in The Foreigner and I honestly can't say anything less about a single one of them - all superb acting! Whoever did the casting did a fantastic job.It's anything but a Hollywood movie and if this movie doesn't win a load of awards it's only because it isn't made in Hollywood... Jackie Chan is so good that I wouldn't be surprised if he'd be nominated for an Oscar for this performance?! That's how good it is!Giving a movie a score of 10 isn't something you do lightly because that's the score of the best movie ever made, but for me it was such a story, made with such precision and quality, that I simply have to give it the highest score.If you only like Jackie Chan's more comical movies then this isn't what you expect, but it's such a great drama/action/thriller that it should appeal to anyone that appreciates quality movies. I can promise you that you won't regret watching it!It's directed by Martin Campbell who's made great movies like GoldenEye, The Mask of Zorro and Casino Royale in the past, and now this! Thank you for making this fantastic movie - and one with one of the best endings I've ever seen in a movie! TL;DR Best movie in years - just go and watch it!",The Foreigner

Determined to avenge the death of his daughter, he elaborately targets senior republicans until eventually finding out the names of the people responsible for her death. He kills all but one of them who is latter assassinated by British security forces then goes back to work in his Chinese restaurant. The end. 
As a fictional action movie it's not bad. However, it's based on the troubles in Northern Ireland and fails in many respects to represent anything close to reality. 
With a little bit of research and perhaps casting people capable of performing convincing Northern Irish accents or even actors from Northern Ireland it could have been a far better movie. Liam Hennessy the deputy first minister is played by Pierce Brosnan, it's difficult to tell if he's based on Martin McGuinness or Gerry Adams as his back story appears to be similar to McGuinness but he looks more like Gerry Adams and his accent is terrible. It dips in and out of something similar to a Northern Irish accent, a Scottish accent and a Southern Irish accent. Near the begging of the film there is a meeting of what I presume is supposed to be Sinn Féin, all of whom are male, this despite there being a several female senior Sinn Féin members in reality. The inaccuracies continue throughout the movie with Liam Hennessy (Pierce Brosnan) at one stage personally confronting and shooting a fellow republican (it's extremely unlikely that any senior member of Sinn Féin would get their hands dirty in this way these days).The inaccuracies continue throughout the movie, there really are too many to mention. It's not a terrible movie nor is it an excellent one. Just another film about the troubles in Northern Ireland written by people who know very little about them. It joins an undistinguished and lengthy list of films that don't appear to place realism at their core but wish to exploit the history of the troubles in order to tell a story. There are a few movies based around the troubles that actually get it right, this is certainly not one of them.",The Foreigner

And if they're supposed to be Chinese why were they in the Vietnam War?Maybe the Chinese production company figured most westerners wouldn't care about such little details...Asian is Asian, right?Gosh, that's almost as asinine as making an IRA terrorism movie in 2018 when the Islamic world is literally on fire.",The Foreigner

I just don't know. Look, it WAS entertaining because it just is. What it is not is suspenseful, I can assure you that. It's plain as day that Jackie Chan will make it through this movie alive. There's just no way on god's green earth that Jackie Chan will die in this and that's how I felt the whole time I was watching. I was surprised by the things Jackie Chan's character did, I mean he did some crazy things, he blew sh*t up, he killed people, and he must have scared the tea and biscuits out of half of Ireland. So, frankly I found it entertaining. I found the premise of a ""chinaman"" attacking the Irish roughshod by blowing people, cars, and buildings up like there's no tomorrow rather entertaining...

You may be right but with the plot, the way the movie relaying the messages and all, even if it's not entirely sticking with the reality/ truth/ history, it certainly seems as though it is carrying certain truth.Another reason why this' a 8/10 movie, for a man age after 60 years old like Mr.Chan, to fight in the ways he did in the past, that itself is certainly not an easy task. We all may be able to hold a gun, but to fight like he still do after 60 years old......I am not sure I can do so, even the whole ordeal is fake motions acting like fighting. These actions are not that easy to bear with.There are certainly several plots that seem quite brutal to me, so spoiler alert here.I certainly don't think there are any needs to kill bad men/women who no longer pose any threats.Hence the deduction of rating. It's a happy ending, sort of, in the end. Chinese have come a long way indeed, if you ever read any Chinese recent history dating back to the beginning of Opium war in Qing dynasty, you will know what I am referring to.

The way he plans his strategy makes sense (although his info gathering would normally require a team of rear-echelon support). On the other hand we have Brosnan. Cool as a whistle, pretty in a beard, he acts OK and with a confidence as if he knew his part from the past (which he probably did).

321,Gendorius90,AAA Movie (Major spoiler-free review),8,12 March 2019,"This movie did everything I expected of it and even more. As someone who grew up with Jackie Chan I enjoyed watching him play a role where he became a mix of Rambo and Walter White and throwing in a serious Chan I have never seen yet.Playing a former special forces soldier in England Jackie Chans last family member, his daughter, is caught in a new IRA bombing and dies from it. It sounds very typical so far, doesn't it? It is set up to be the typical lone wolf soldier where you follow him throughout most of the movie, but Chan takes a backseat and is more the reason for things going along.The second main character played by Pierce Brosnan is a former IRA member and a politician who has worked his entire life to prevent things from ever going back to the bloody old days, and with this new bombing he has a lot on his plate since everything is pointing at him or his old friends.A lot of the movie is played out following Brosnans character, his family and his colleagues how they try to track down this new IRA group at the beheast of the brittish government while having the Brittish police hounding after him, and unlike most movies like this, they are not useless, they actually fulfill a purpose.
Brosnans character finds himself with an asian Rambo on one hand and a plot similar to Sons of Anarchy (Including the irish! Hah!) he has a lot to deal with and little time to do so.The casting is great, the acting is incredible, and even if Jackie Chan is no longer young, and you really feel it in the acting, he is still great at what he does. The martial arts are kept to a minimum in the movie however, but you can still tell it is him.
I was only able to find a single plothole at first watching, and it was rather minor and it is actually not really connected in any way to rile up Brosnans character even more so I could see that scene cut out entirely or given more time to breathe before coming to a conclusion.I think The Foreigner is a great movie and I am more than happy to see a couple of familiar faces, and I hope it will not be the last time.",The Foreigner

Watching it I often got the feeling it's really two different movies packed into one. The first one being a father (and ex military of course) avenging his daughter who got killed in a terrorist attack. I always felt that Jackie Chan's acting and fighting style are more suitable for action-comedies and he feels wrong for this film. To see him turn into some kind of mix between Liam Neeson's character in Taken and Rambo is very hard to take seriously. No, I'm not exaggerating here, First blood is an obvious inspiration. Jackie's character is also very one-dimensional. The other story in this film is quite interesting about the internal conflicts inside an Irish terror organization and their dealings with the British government. Unfortunately this part often lacks realism due script flaws. For example, after finding the only surviving terrorist, the police just kills her instead of taking her in for interrogation.

The title says it all. There have been so so so many revenge movies about someone deciding to become full-vigilante and kills a bunch of bad guys. This movie does a better job at mixing the subtle with the trope.As a Jackie Chan fan, I was very impressed by seeing some semblance of his old-school choreography. The fights are actually pretty good.Another enjoyable aspect of the movie was that falls and fighting seemed to show the toll that it took on the people evolved in the action. Reminds me of the one-shot scene (this isn't one shots) from dare-devil.Jackie Chan's mourning father acting, seemed very accurate. The strange and persistent behavior made more sense post seeing his exceptional-fighting-skills as it becomes more very obvious that he is more than a restaurant owner. The explanation is satisfying because it makes sense, and in a typical revenge plot, you might just have and angry dad that kills a bunch of thugs, but context matters and this move did a good job.I marked this as spoiler because I went into this movie blind, and I probably enjoyed it more for having known nothing about it.

Many of the episodes focused on the IRA, and if Jackie Chan (or Quan) had been recruited in an episode, this is what the result would have been. The Foreigner is much more a thriller than an action film, and Jackie Chan's screen time is not as much as you'd assume, but it actually makes it a better film as it shows a guy caught up in a world he is not part of(albeit one he can destroy with some crazy marine training), rather than a traditional revenge film which follows the revenge seeker. The film is centred around Pierce Brosnan's character and the mirroring of trying to sort the mess a terrorist attack causes, but from the other end of the snake. The filming is classically British, and the explosions may not live upto purists standards, but make no mistake, this is an amazing film. The plot twists will keep you hooked and the cat and mouse genre is refreshed by a really great script. It's a shame this isn't coming to British cinemas, but at the same time, I am glad I watched it on a TV, as it felt like a great episode of Spooks (MI-5 http://imdb.com/rg/an_share/title/title/tt0160904/) and no-one will ever be able to tell me that is a bad thing.",The Foreigner
334,pzhuwang,"Jackie tried, really tried!",6,16 November 2017,"The Foreigner is a movie directed by Martin Compel, who revitalized Bond films twice with Golden eye and Casino Royale and also Zoro. It follows a Chinese businessman who seeks revenge for the death of his daughter, during which he discovered the secrets of a former IRA agent played by Pierce Brosnan, and decided to take justice to his own hands I saw this movie a couple of weeks ago and here is my thought: this movie is not as horrible as the trailer made it out to be. When I saw the trailer I couldn't believe it is 30 mil budget movie and releasing to theaters. So one good thing I can say about this film is that it showed a lot of pretty decent production value. The greatest strength about the film is the acting. Pierce Brosnan had given his best acting for a long period of time. He played an ex-IRA agent who had a troubled past and he is very believable. Jackie Chan also did a great job, he acts his ass off as if he is trying to get an academy award. There is no bad actors in the film. The action choreography is pretty splendid, reminds us that Jackie Chan is still the king of action. Unfortunately, the good thing stops here. This is a very forgettable movie. The story had many twists and turns which, at first is very interesting, but if you sit down and think about makes no sense. In one case, Jackie Chan is willing to let the terrorist carry out an attack so that he can locate them. He is supposed to be good guys and there is nothing in movie helps us justify his actions. But the biggest problem is that the film felt like a 2 completely different pasted together. There is the Pierce Bronan story and the Jackie Chan story. You can cut Jackie Chan out of the film and it won't influence the other. The film has a very interesting idea about post-911 impact on non-US society but it never developed on it. But my biggest problem was the effects and editing. Some of special effects looks awful. They are so bad that they took me out of the moment. The films are filled with quick and jump cuts and it felt very disjointed. I had a hard time following the movement. It was almost Taken 3 level bad. Overall, is it terrible, no.

I missed this one completely however until a friend mentioned it to me and what a fantastic recommendation. It is one of the few films which feature the IRA which doesn't portray them to be freedom fighter or heroes in some way. It shows the recent version of the terrorist organisation to be blood thirsty criminals which is what they are. The fight scenes are almost all realistic apart from maybe one scene where he grabs a pole when falling off a roof. The storyline is completely realistic and as someone who lived through the Troubles, I can vouch for the detail they went into while not bogging the neutral down with nonsense they don't need to know. All the actors are fantastic and Jackie Chan is superb.",The Foreigner
337,abcornell1,Jackie like you rarely see him,9,5 September 2018,This for me is one of Jackie's best in a long time. This is not a typical Jackie Chan film so if you were thinking this is going to be one of his slapstick outing's then you would be sadly mistaken. Instead this is a great action drama that you see oh so sparingly from one of the greatest Kung fu exponents to ever grace the silver screen. Without giving to much away Jackie is out for revenge after his daughter is killed in a terrorist bombing by a rogue faction of the IRA. The length's he goes to in order to get the information he needs to exact revenge is what makes this movie. So if you are a fan of Jackie or just a lover of great movies then this is a must see.,The Foreigner

I felt unsatisfied after the film even though there were some really good action scenes with or without Jackie Chan. The problem lies between Jackie Chan's character, Quan, and the convoluted political subplot. Half way through Quan's story became the subplot and Hennessy's (Pierce Brosnan) political mess became the main plot. Quan's character became stale and uneventful. He spends most of his time in the woods around The Farm, where he basically stopped searching for answers and just wait for Hennessy do most of the dirty work.I was expecting this film to be more alongside Taken and Bourne Identity, where you follow the main character through a sh*t storm from start to finish and come out of it vindicated.So to summarize, this film misses the target for a potentially great Jackie Chan movie starring Jackie Chan - a foreigner with a vengeance on a rampage out for blood, not Pierce Brosnan - a politician who tries to maintain stability.",The Foreigner

This is not the slapstick Jackie Chan we are accustomed to. He is dead (or maybe more accurately, deadly) serious in this one. But for me, the revelation was Pierce Brosnan. I thought it was by far his best acting job ever. The movie has a relatively complex plot and for about the first 3/4's of the movie you think Chan is on the wrong path in trying to track down the terrorists responsible for the death of his daughter. I won't bother to recount the content of the movie. That's already been done in countless reviews here already.

Action/Drama/Political/Thriller is something that we rarely see him playing in.Performance of the actors are high and you will like to be with their presence. Maybe Brosman accent will be ringing in some ears.
Movie is not mainly about action but you will see more than few sequences that you will enjoy to watch and wonder how Jackie is still able to give us more than many younger actors lack.Story is not hard to follow but not paying attention in certain political discussions may lead you confused.
We had quite some movies that weren't purely action based and Foreigner is definitely better than most of them released this year.",The Foreigner

It doesn't even get the simplest of things right, such as zero attempt to make London pass for Belfast. How hard could've been to just shoot in Northern Ireland anyway? Game of Thrones managed for 300 seasons! Most baffling, is how an Irishman (Brosnan) fails so miserably at a Northern Irish accent?Maybe if you're not a Brit or familiar with how things like, counter terrorism and accents work, you could derive some entertainment from this? However, seeing as I enjoy an IQ of almost double digits, this production not only made me want to do violence, it forced me to break my cover and more than 2 decades of IMDB lurking, just to write this bloody review.Don't become just another time-waisted victim, and avoid this picture and all costs.

Obviously at 60+ years of age no one could. Having watched ""the foreigner"" I really enjoyed it, JC played a good serious role and pulled it off convincingly. Pierce Brosnan was also convincing and played a good role. Would recommend this as a good watch for any Jackie fan. Not much martial arts in there, but some good solid action",The Foreigner

This movie is about an a splinter group of discontent Irish Republicans who seek to pursue political means through violence which threatens to destroy the peace.Chan's character literally uses the same tactics and strategies of his enemies and we are made to feel that he is the good guy because these means are acceptable if they are for a good cause. This movie whether many viewers are aware of it are not also morally justifies this splinter groups attacks for if Britain didn't illegally invade and occupy Ireland she would not be reaping what she sowed by being targeted by militants.,The Foreigner

364,ptounas,My Review,8,14 November 2017,"Overall, the movie was great and kept the audience's attention every step of the way. Before watching the movie, it seemed like Jackie Chan would be doing his old dark regime rendition of films such as Taken, or Falling Down. In reality, it is a lot closer to Jackie Chan doing Rambo. He spent half of the movie running around in the woods, which sounds cool too, except that this is not a Jackie Chan film. The movie is barley justified marketing Jackie Chan as the protagonist. The Foreigner is a less of revenge flick, and a lot closer to a political thriller. It splits focus between two protagonists, and asks us to emphasize with each of them in different ways. Something that likely translates far better in book form, than in film. It wasn't bad, but also doesn't entirely work as well. The movie had a few motivational inconsistencies, and character logical leaps. On the flip side, there were also outstanding performances in this film by Jackie Chan and Pierce Brosnan. This is the darkest I've seen of Jackie Chan in a movie, and was also really looking forward to checking out this film from the beginning. However, the film has some interesting things to say about the nature of lost and revenge. One of the stronger story elements is that nearly every character is given the opportunity to address these themes from their prospective. If you are into decent political thrillers, this movie is worth your time to go see.",The Foreigner

The Chinese production has an acceptable main character Jackie Chan acting in a North American context but the plot is completely ignorant of how the culture here works.
 Chan loses a daughter in London to self described IRA terrorists. The Northern Ireland government tries to ID and shut down them but that does not satisfy Chan who terrorizes the government itself to identify the other terrorists. Chan foolishly runs around, miraculously unharmed by the government's efforts to stop him from attacking it, thinking he can force out the ID of who killed his daughter. Why do we care ? He is attacking an innocent party and a government friendly to the Brits. This production team thinks all anti government terrorism is pleasing but fails to appreciate the notion of good guts/bad guys. As a result Chan is the bad guy.No drama here as the plot fails by the 20 minute timeline.",The Foreigner

Who wouldn't like that!? And I have to say that it definitely lived up to the hype. I thought the film was very well done in every aspect. The twists and turns will keep you guessing. One of the things that I thought was best well done is the two different stories that are intertwined throughout the film. In past films I've seen, where there is more than one story going on, information gets lost, things get confusing, and in the end you walk out feeling unsatisfied and like the film was a waste of time. 'The Foreigner' however is NOT like that. Although it does have two story lines that are intertwined, it does not get confusing or hard to follow. Whether the story at one point is following Quan (Jackie Chan) or Liam Hennessy (Pierce Brosnan) you will not get lost in the information coming at you, and you will be able to understand everything going on. Each story line will keep you on the edge of your seat wondering and eagerly awaiting what will happen next. Jackie Chan and Pierce Brosnan, as usual, both delivered a brilliant performance in the film. Some people may disagree with my rating, but that is just me personally. The film was entertaining, not one slow moment, kept me on the edge of my seat, and left me satisfied in the end.This will definitely be a film I purchase when available.",The Foreigner

The actions scenes are gritty and realistic, considering the Rush Hour and James Bond franchises these actors have become known for. The score for the film is also very captivating, building levels on tension and insecurity at very appropriate times. My only complaint is the absence of Chan for a decent proportion of the film as well as the way it feels like you're watching 2 different films at a time. The film doesn't get boring however and is by far one of the best films of 2017.",The Foreigner

415,imort-e,A criminally underrated thriller/crime drama!,9,23 May 2020,"This movie is about the politics, intrigue and histories, last and least this is an action movie. It seems a lot of people were mislead about that seeing Jackie Chan's name attached as well as some misleading promotional content and were expecting pure martial prowess, there is that here but only a few sprinkles.Nevertheless this movie gripped me, the thick history between the IRA and British gov. weighs heavily on the characters, as those two factions are brought towards the open conflict they tried to overcome. Reformers and hardliners turn on each other, as some strive to avoid future horrors while others can't forget those in the past. It's a story where good men show their underlying ruthlessness, where death squads take no hostages, where if you can't win you might as well take them down with you. Thrown in the middle of this is a wild card, otherwise known as Jackie Chan, just to make things more chaotic.This movie came from the guy who directed Casino Royale, if you like that you'll like this. Also know that the more attention you give to this story the more it returns to you.There are scenes in certain movies that almost haunt you, years after you've seen them.

430,coffeecake26,Botched plot is unintentionally funny,6,25 October 2019,"I'm not the first to notice that, far from a run of the mill Taken rip-off, this movie's plot is actually two totally different stories frankensteined together into a grotesque hydra. I do seem to be the only one who found it unintentionally hilarious. So why 6 stars? It was enjoyable to watch, no really heart-pounding moments but certainly competent, and the performances were solid all around. Taken on a scene-by-scene basis, the writing seemed fine too. Now buckle up bois as I criticize the botched implementation of a bizarre dual premise.First, we have Quan's story. While this is ostensibly about him getting revenge and closure, it quickly devolves into a strangely Rambo-like tactical battle. The action movie plot is devoid of emotion but treated with a dramatic gravitas that only calls attention to how laughable the events are in a realistic setting. I couldn't help thinking the tagline should have been, ""the IRA get more than they bargained for when they bomb a bomb expert! Bombings ensue!""Then we have Hennessy's self-contained political thriller. I can't stress enough, the movie's actual story has nothing to do with Quan. Hennessy has plenty of other incentives to find the bombers. This would have been the more interesting part if they'd developed it a little more. As it was, I kept wondering what the political situation was supposed to be in Northern Ireland, how much support there was for renewed violence, if there's really been peace for 19 years why is no one talking about what inspired the bombings, ect. The funny part is they made Brosnan look exactly like Gerry Adams. After doing a small amount of research it seems like the character is more based on Martin McGuinness, but in any case, why?? The movie doesn't have anything at all to say about politics and instead this makes a lot of scenes amusing.The tone gets really wacky when the two movies collide and everyone ignores that being menaced by an old man who's hiding in the woods and randomly blowing up your property is very unusual. Since the scale of the terrorism and character motivations ect. were pretty grounded, in contrast Quan's bombings felt super uncalled for. His chaos-inducing presence could have even made him feel like a villain if the incongruity wasn't so funny. I suppose guerrilla war in the forest and strategic negotiation could have complemented each other, but instead the two plots matched each other rising action for rising action, climax for climax, with no acknowledgement that the viewer was seeing both of them at the same time in the same movie. The film is such a two-headed monstrosity that the same loose end is actually tied up twice. Why have Katherine discover Hennessy's incriminating relationship with Sara McKay just to have Quan destroy Hennessy's reputation after all minutes later?THEN, for the last scene, we are transported to an alternate universe where Quan really did defeat the terrorists the government was too afraid to take on. Bromley decides to leave Quan alone because they ""owe this chap something"". WTF?? Not only did the British suspect Hennessy almost as much as Quan did, they actually figured out the bomber's identity all on their own. They REALLY didn't need Quan's help, in fact if he'd succeeded in killing Sara he would've messed things up big time. From their point of view, Quan has committed a ludicrous number of serious crimes for nothing, and he's probably suspected of killing Mary Hennessy too now that I think about it. I don't think Bromley even knows about the Sara stuff, but either way that hasn't helped them...it's suggested that Hennessy was less sympathetic to bombing than most of his supporters, and his replacement won't have the relationship he'd built with the British.Overall, it was honestly not bad, but it could have made a brilliant genre parody.",The Foreigner
431,kimblen-212-676856,"love Jackie, but movie disappoints",4,11 October 2017,"I love Jackie and he had a great interview with Colbert to promote, but I felt let down. several reason 1) Changed the backstory of most characters, and obvious pander to Chinese Audience. (main character is Vietnamese with a full story-line. Here they just gloss it over quickly and said he was Chinese and threw in lots of mandarin for good measure) 2) Overall character development of Quan, Liam, Sean, and others were very weak. I understand movie time needs to be condense, but the lack of the top 3 really made it harder for us to invest into the characters 3) Pacing was way off...some parts too rushed, many parts seem drawn out 4) a Too much reliance on cinematic/Chinese style fight scenes which ruined the scene intensity and meaning 5) Unfortunately Jackie missed the mark on Quan character. He rushes to make him too aggressive and completely misses the ""docile and unsuspecting"" character build and release of tension 6) the ending completely ruins the original books main message...the ending really pushed me over to big disappointment from""meh"" Overall entertaining, but i ultimately felt disappointed in the end",The Foreigner

The characters felt immensely developed, especially that of Chan's as the story unfolds and we learn more about his past. However, the pace at which Martin Campbell unveil details to audience personally felt a bit slow which sometimes made the scenes felt a bit repetitive and unconvincing.Plot-wise, the film definitely tackled the problems many recent Jackie Chan movies had and provided a complete story.Haven't seen the trailer, I had next to no expectations entering the theater despite being a big fan of Jackie.

Jackie Chan gave a believable performance of a father stricken by grief and Pierce Brosnan a commanding portrail of a conflicted member Irish parliament and of Sein Féin.
Both gave a performance that should be listed as one of their best...ever. 
It's not full of 'cinema' martial arts but effective and authentic skills, even the use of a curtain/towel as a tenugi.

438,costasimeon,Jackie Chan,8,12 February 2018,"I have read all of the descriptions of the skill of the director or the lack thereof and the technical word usage to describe why or why not they believed he did a good or bad job. On that front I am in agreement with those who gave a positive review.I also read the various descriptions of the supporting cast from Pierce Brosnan on down the line. Although I would say it felt like this movie had two lead roles, Brosnan being one of them. Of course there was strong support for Pierce and rightfully so. He is believable in this role as he is in everything I've ever seen him in. An underrated actor in my opinion. I will also add that I thoroughly disagree with those that made comments such as ""boring"", ""predictable"" and many other words to describe the story and how it played out in the movie. I was thoroughly engaged from beginning to the end. And yet, I must admit that the reason I was so involved in this film was the brilliant work of Jackie Chan. I must say that every negative review and even some positive reviews got it wrong. To the naysayers, I am speechless as to how you did not see the work he clearly put into this role to portray a character we have NEVER seen him play before, PERIOD. And to the post reviews, they missed it as well because they said some semi positive things but almost in a patronizing way as though ""good job"" is enough to really describe the transition he clearly made from the comedy roles we are used to seeing him in, to even the action star we are used to him being. You can see even in his fighting scenes he did not choreograph them as he has in the past. He toned down his style to where you believe he is not merely this superior fighter so that he shines far above the rest but you see him get hurt, and not in his normal comical way, but as someone in real life would. The stunts were toned down and done realistically. And yet, all of that does not compare to the somber tone that he walks in and the pain he bears in his heart for his losses throughout this film. To me I have never seen Mr Chan play this kind of character and it was so believable that I felt his characters pain. I don't cry in a lot in movies but I teared up in this one. It was Mr. Chan that gave this dramatic performance that tells me Mr. Chan is being underutilized in Hollywood. This man is ready for some serious roles if only given the chance. Sir, I am sure you will never read this but I must say this is your best work yet. Keep up the great work Sir. I saw a side of you I've never seen before and it was eye-opening.

445,aprilxiaochina,We have our own incomprehension,9,6 October 2017,"When I just finished watching advance screening couple days ago, I wasn't fully satisfied at first. Because I don't use to the accent nor knew well about the history. For the film, it did not introduce much about historical background, or personal background. But after I read some history of Ireland and the British, I have to say now everything makes sense. However, the depth of the story above the general understanding of most of audience. And the film seems to default to the audience to know the background. As an action and thrill movie, that might be hard to persuade audience to buy popcorn for it. It was released about two weeks earlier in China than North America. Douban score is about equal to the IMDb score. As a fan of Jackie Chan and 007, in my viewpoint, most of us give high scores to excellent performances for the actors. Obviously, audiences who doesn't rank it high say that they didn't seem to get the point too much. Similar situation as Ang Lee's Lust, Caution releasing in North America, the audience asks WHY! and WHAT! Personally speaking, not just history, but also something like science and high technology, niche hobbies need film makers to tell customer why it is interesting. Every region or person has stories that worth to tell, but without scenario analysis, people just see it like general.Que(Jackie Chan), as a Chinese immigrant, stable life in western countries is not easy to achieve for him. If terrorist attack made he lost the only and most important focus of life, his spiritual world would collapse. As Buddhist attitude, all the toil of a life is in vain. Therefore, all the crazy and strange ways of revenge would choose by him. Yas, he has no other way to go. Jackie Chan's acting is his realism. He usually does not take the realistic style that much and this refreshing is linked for many years out. Do you remember how Jackie Chan acts in his previous films? He falls down, he makes fun with enemies and throw little items as weapons. But trust me you will feel ""hurt in your body"" this time. Every awkward moving, heavenly falling down make you couldn't recognize this Jackie Chan but a Dad. Maybe his art film there will be surprises too.Another main character, Liam, Irish Politician, Pierce Bronan, 007 , I saw half way and felt he was so bad luck. Smart and decisive, and also in the executive. ""All the toil of a life is in vain"" is also for him. He doesn't want to see innocent families are killed by boobs. He doesn't able to not obey to the government. He doesn't like his mistress is a spy. He doesn't feel happy that his wife two times on him with his nephew so unhappy! These are showing up step by step by a foreigner's trouble, from the beginning to the end. So don't think you are smart as God! The nephew, Sean, Rory Fleck Byrne, is a typical hot soldier. Our industry people all LOL when it shows him making out with his aunt. I also shouted in silence my heart, Come On Do it!!! The wife, aunt, Mary, Orla Brady is a more than wise woman, betraying her husband engage in terrorist attacks and make her looks 100% innocent. Treat to the nephew is clearly not the first time. I boldly think, when 007 starts with pretty mistress, in the same time Mary dates Sean. The arrangement of UDI is really not leaky.There is also a question that why the terrorists kill people to chase independence? It can be said that the lives of innocent people could give the government huge pressure of public opinion. For example, a single woman waiting in the subway station is sexually harassed by a bad man. And the security police are steps away. Single women will ask the police for help. And if the police ignore it, passengers will be immediately by the police and judge as angered. As a result, the police lost tracking of another bad guy.",The Foreigner

I rarely see a movie as engrossing and entertaining as a good book and Pierce Brosnan, Jackie Chan and indeed all the players give 150%. Well crafted and directed with many points to discuss well after the movie event. I hope some awards are won.",The Foreigner
451,ShepherdStronghold,The Little Things,6,27 October 2017,"-Contains Spoilers-The Foreigner isn't what I expected, in a good way. The summary of the movie reveals Quan (Jackie Chan) as a humble British citizen and a loving father on a quest for revenge after his daughter was killed in an explosion by a terrorist organization. At first you'd assume this terrorism plot had something to do with mainstream media in wake of recent attacks but impressively enough, they expose a terrorist organization out of Ireland, the IRA (Irish Republican Army).The movie evolved around politicians within the IRA as it slowly introduces potential public attacks throughout the film. British Government officials are working closely with one particular member of the IRA. The main focus is this terrorist organization, their history, ideals, and strategies for terrorist attacks. Quan was simply a side story. He is a British citizen and his daughter was killed in a terrorist attack. He served in the U.S. military and had an extensive background. He is highly trained and able to seek revenge, even in his older age. In the first few minutes of the film you're introduced to Quan and his daughter. In a short car ride you can see she's a cheerful, pleasant young lady and supposedly her smile and sweet personality will emotionally tie us to her and Quan. I would have put forth an extra scene to buildup the emotions for his daughter, seeing as we're supposed to sympathize with Quan. To me personally, they just kill her off too fast.The title of the movie had nothing to do with the film, nor was Quan a foreigner (use of this word is highly outdated). He was an immigrant but his past didn't have much to do with the film nor the title.The actions scenes were okay. The attacks were too digitized and the director put all his money into powerful explosions. If you're gonna use Jackie Chan to bring people to watch your film, make sure the fighting choreography is on point, please! Even in his old age he's a great fighter but the hand to hand combat didn't match up to other movies today such as Taken, or more recently John Wick. A mix of martial arts and tactical shooting is more terrorism savvy and much of the movie had ""trained"" professionals dealing with Quan yet didn't seem like anything more than fancy bodyguards or night club bouncers. There was a decent dialogue, Jackie Chan still has a sense of humor we missed and acting didn't disappoint. Movie could have been better though",The Foreigner

453,pig-sick,Brilliant,10,1 December 2017,"Very moving and powerful movie from the start, till the end,Jackie Chan plays a excellent roll, worthy of a Oscar in my opinion, if you expect to see loads of martial arts well you would be disappointed, Well worth watching. I wont give any spoilers as it would be better for you to watch it yourself's and make your own mind up, I really didn't think that Jackie Chan could play a straight role, however he has proved me wrong this time.",The Foreigner

I have been sad about the fact that there are hardly any good action movies to watch nowadays with Jackie Chan gone. Thankfully, Jackie Chan is still in action in mixed plots like this movie which involves fight choreography as well as an emotional plot line. Must Watch for any Jackie Chan Fan.",The Foreigner

457,alexkouvatas,What a great and enjoyable movie.,10,30 December 2017,"I have read some of the comments and I see people who are not, in position to rate, rating this movie, discussing about acting and plot. But as most of the times, they don't have an idea about film industry. Jackie Chan, as a a father who is in pain, does a remarkably good job, for his first role in a drama thriller. He provides an amazing performance that, will get you right away. The way that he moves and talks, are so different from what we have got used to see him doing. You will understand his motives, as the movie progresses. Pierce Brosnan, from the other hand, acts amazing as a political figure. The way that he handles the situations in the movie, resembles what it could or might happen in real life. This movies is a political thriller, with some actions scenes. And that's good.",The Foreigner
458,wwwgr,Better than expected,8,4 January 2018,"Very surprised to see a movie like this with Jackie Chan as the lead: this movie had a good plot, realistic action scenes and a great ending. Its a good action film with a good plot: two things that often don't go hand in hand. Jackie Chan was a great lead, Pierce Brosnan was good also. Had a cool British feel to it too which I enjoyed.Recommend this to anyone looking for an action film with some substance.",The Foreigner

462,goezjie,Great performances by Jackie Chan and Pierce Brosnan,9,5 February 2018,"'The Foreigner' has been a pleasant surprise to watch and is highly recommended! The main reason this movie works so well are the inspired performances of Jackie Chan and Pierce Brosnan. Both turned fairly standard-format roles (i.e. a grieving-father-with-a-dark-past who goes off alone to find the bad guys and avenge his daughter, and a power-hungry politician who is involved with the bad guys in an unclear way, for unclear reasons) into unique and captivating characters. Another positive is the pacing of the movie, which is able to keep viewer attention focused without resorting to excessive use of sound and light effects, or choppy action sequence editing.
All in all, a good movie with an engaging plot and characters, plus some nice action (even at 60+, Jackie Chan still got it! ).
Finally I would like to briefly address a few supposed 'plot holes', mentioned in the imdb review of this movie by a Mr. 'Jonathan Cressman', dated December 15th. - SPOILERS BELOW -
Mr. Cressman seems particularly confused about the links between Mr. Hennessy (Brosnan) and the bombers. Does he know anything? [Yes, he knows, but he was betrayed, so many things to find out! ] Why does Mr. Quan (Chan) target Hennessy? [Uh.... seen on TV that he likely is - or knows - the person who set up the bombers. Why not shake the tree to see what falls out]
Luckily, all his questions are also explained very clearly in the film, but likely Mr. Cressman was distracted at that moment, as he seem rather disturbed by the ""extra judicial (sic)"" violence in this movie, calling it ""morally the worst movie ever made""(!!) Reading his reaction to this movie, I do sincerely hope Mr. Cressman will never accidentally stumble across an episode of '24', 'Homeland', or something similar. The moral outrage induced by those episodes might be too much for Mr. Cressman to handle.",The Foreigner

464,phantomhunter-46175,"Lies, lies and more lies...",1,4 January 2019,"Another story about how true British people - a brave black general and chinese ex-black ops - won a war against evil white terrorists. I'm truly surprised how almost all of the movie white people are getting humiliated - even when good SWAT guys infiltrate the terrorist place - they are outplayed by Jackie. I guess, it's bit of good'ol' Jackie, which is fun, right? Well, don't mind that, Jackie is just a sellout in this movie, to help masquerade general message. When Pierce get's the call from the government lady in the end - she says - you will do as I say. All he tried to accomplish for Irish people - it turns to be a bad thing, because he had his own motive. Is this the message you want to give to Ireland? That we own you? Showing how Irish people presented as terrorists are murdered by chinese vigilante? And the black general who says - don't arrest him, he helped us a lot. I'm not even from UK, I'm Russian, we don't usually see eye to eye with UK, but seeing this movie disgusted me just like if I would be British. You, the people who finance these movies, I hope you will one day face a judgement for all the cultural genocide you've done to the people of the Britain.",The Foreigner
