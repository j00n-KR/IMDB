0,bkoganbing,You ought to be in pictures,7,10 March 2018,"Years ago George Raft who hung around so many mobsters in real life was asked
whether he preferred the wise guys or Hollywood. Without a hesitation the man
who played so many gangsters so well because he hung around them so much and
it just rubbed off said that he preferred Ben Seigel to Harry Cohn. He never had
a mobster go back on his word to him.John Travolta probably studied that bit of wisdom from Raft, I'm surprised no
Raft clips are in Get Shorty. Travolta plays a collector of debts and right now
he's to get about $300,000.00 from producer Gene Hackman. But one look at
Travolta and a star could be born.There's also a schlepp who ran off with that amount and is thought to be dead
in a plane crash. And some Columbians who are looking for some money they
are owed for drugs. All three of these elements are woven rather nicely together in a nice black comedy.And the girl Travolta is aiming for, Rene Russo star of the B picture horror schlock that Hackman produces. Shorty of the title could only be Danny DeVito who spends a lot further than his latest salary will take him.My favorite scenes are when heavies Delroy Lindo and Dennis Farina both get
some justice. Travolta and Farina don't like each other, but what happens to
Farina is truly poetic.In fact they put into pictures.",Get Shorty
1,SnoopyStyle,Breezy Jazzy fun movie,7,12 October 2013,"Chili Palmer (John Travolta) works for the mob. He's volatile, intense, and extremely street smart. When Ray Barboni (Dennis Farina) takes Chili's coat, he promptly punches Ray in the face to get his coat back. Too bad for Chili, his boss dies and he has to work for Ray's crew. He's collecting from producer Harry Zimm (Gene Hackman), and ends up getting into the world of movie making.This is from an Elmore Leonard novel, and the sharply written characters are a testament to that. Whether it's Leonard's words, the top actors, or the flash of Hollywood. There's an artificial sense. It's light. It's breezy. It's jazzy. The movie is having lots of fun. It makes for a cute movie.",Get Shorty
2,nogodnomasters,You look like a wet kiss,10,20 August 2017,"Chili Palmer (John Travolta) a debt collector travels to L.A. to collect a debt, only to get involved in the film industry.I had missed this film when it came out and it has gone on to be an iconic ""B"" film crime comedy. The humor was crisp and well time. Travolta was great in the role and had a his pre-botox face on the screen most of time. A feel-good dark comedy and Golden Globe winner for Travolta.Guide: F-words.

3,classicsoncall,"""I think you're a decent type of man, even if you are a crook"".",8,17 September 2016,"I read the Elmore Leonard novel ""Get Shorty"" about a year ago and recall that keeping track of the players as the story went on tended to be a bit difficult. The movie, which seemed to follow the book pretty closely, made the character identification a bit easier since most of the main ones were handled by a well known actor or actress. Still, it's easy to get confused once the action gets going because people move in and out of scenes fairly quickly, and some that you expect to have a major role wind up being ancillary characters.Like Leo Devoe (David Paymer) for instance. Since it was his three hundred thousand dollar swindle that opened the story, you would think he'd be the main focus, but he really wasn't on screen that much, while his bundle wound up trading hands more than once. There's also a neat red herring thrown into the picture when Bear's (James Gandolfini) little daughter picked up Yayo's (Jacob Vargas) discarded envelope from the top of the trash bin at the airport. If you were concentrating on that minor development expecting it to mean something, you'd have been wrong. Nothing ever came of that situation.Which is to say, you better be prepared to pay attention to this flick or you could wind up in left field pretty quickly. I thought Travolta did a nice job as the mob strong arm Chili Palmer, attempting to trade up to the movie business. Always thinking ahead, that was a pretty slick move with the C-17 locker to divert the FBI's attention away from him. It turns out he really was a lot smarter than Barboni (Dennis Farina); gee, Bones should have saw the pinch coming ahead of time but I guess greed does that to a wise guy.Anyway, this was a creative caper flick coming from the mind of Elmore Leonard, better known for his Western stories and novels, so this excursion into gangland was a nifty diversion. Since I picked this flick up at my local library, what I think I'll do now is put in a request for Karen Flores' (Russo) two starring roles - 'I Married a Ghoul' and 'The Atomic Mummy'.Say, did anybody wind up getting the money?",Get Shorty
4,gavin6942,"Travolta's Transition From ""Pulp Fiction""",7,14 January 2015,"A mobster (John Travolta) travels to Hollywood to collect a debt (from Gene Hackman) and discovers that the movie business is much the same as his current job.Following Travolta's role as a hit-man in ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994), he got a sudden boost in popularity. Today (2015), this seems to have waned again. But anyway, at the time it made sense to put him in a similar role and it pays off. He comes across as a really good enforcer, who also happens to be passionate about movies.The ensemble cast is also incredible. Beyond Hackman, you have Danny DeVito and a fine role from Dennis Farina. The story is great, and it draws a nice parallel between loansharking and Hollywood, but this cast really sells it and it is just fun watching them interact.",Get Shorty
5,lee_eisenberg,"""Get Shorty"" stands honorably tall.",8,3 July 2005,"John Travolta followed up his ""Pulp Fiction"" comeback with ""Get Shorty"", in which he plays Miami hit-man Chili Palmer. Moving to Hollywood to collect a debt, he finds that show biz isn't much different from the mafia, and he decides to get involved. But of course, once there's anything mafia-related involved, things start to get ugly. Not that they weren't already seedy.This movie has its strengths mainly in the script, but also in the strong performances from Travolta, Gene Hackman, Rene Russo and Danny DeVito. I guess that any time that someone gets a chance to show Hollywood's unseemly side, they take it. Of course, there's plenty of reasons to do so. The sequel, ""Be Cool"", wasn't quite as good, but still worth seeing.",Get Shorty
6,ccthemovieman-1,A Perfect Example Of How Out-Of-Touch Critics Are,1,3 October 2007,"How many times have you read rave reviews - one after the other - and then seen the film and discovered it was horrible? How many ""critics favorites"" are total bombs with the public? (Answer: thousands.)This is Exhibit A of that, a terribly incoherent, unappealing, slimy mess of a film that did very poorly at the box office....and was loved by the critics, of course. ""Sick,"" not ""slick"" is one adjective to describe this Tarantino-wannabe crime movie. It also smacked of too many ""in jokes"" in which these snobby Hollywood elitists got their jollies. FACT - Film makers don't care if the public likes their films, only if their peers do. This is why you get so much of this unpopular garbage cranked out every year - they don't care! That's especially true about films in which Hollywood is part of the story, like this one involving screenwriters.Gene Hackman is one of the finest actors of his day but dark comedy, obviously, is not his forte. Rene Russo's resume says all you need to know about her hard-boiled personality and character as a human being. Ditto for John Travolta, a good actor but a man who will never be mistaken for someone of strong moral fiber. He can smirk, however, with the best of them....as he does in this film.With a hundred f-words and 30 blatant abuses of the Lord's name in vain along with other comedic touches, this is real classy material. As one reviewer here aptly puts it: this is ""trash culture at it's peak.""",Get Shorty
7,rmax304823,"Never Mind Shorty, Get the Money.",8,18 July 2009,"A thoroughly enjoyable comedy/thriller about a connected loan collector, John Travolta as Chili Palmer, who is sent by his boss, Dennis Farina, from Miami to Los Angeles to collect $300K from a drug dealer who has decided to keep the payment for himself by hiding it in a locker at Los Angeles International Airport. What Farina doesn't realize is that Travolta is a stone movie freak and is converted by the seductive movie-making atmosphere of L.A. from a semi-hit man into a would-be producer. The money that Travolta intends to invest may still be sitting in that gym bag in LAX, surrounded by ill-disguised DEA agents who are waiting for someone to try to get it, but everyone knows the money exists and they treat it as if it's not just real, which it is, but readily available, which it's not.It reminds me of the fiscal situation on Yap, an island in Micronesia. The Yapese have a kind of ""money"" too. Huge stones, laboriously carved out of a mountain on a distant island and carefully shaped, then shipped hundreds of miles to Yap. In one case, a monstrously heavy stone fell from the canoe offshore and fell to the bottom of the ocean. But it was still counted as being in circulation because, after all, all the Yapese had seen it and knew it was there.The story in this movie is more complicated and involves a dozen or more characters, all of whom would love to get their hands on that money. Some want to use it to make a lousy movie -- with Travolta cheer leading this contingent -- and others want it because they figure it belongs to them. Some die but no one mourns them. The deaths may be richly comic.What makes it possible for us to enjoy this story of bullying, threats, violence, greed, lust, and murder is its cheerful acceptance of the philosophical propositions of moral nihilism.When Travolta is confronted by a muscle man, James Gandolfini, he kicks him in the shin and sucker punches him without adumbrating the act. When Gandolfini hits the ground, groaning in pain, we can afford to laugh at it because the values behind the movie have given us permission to do it. Travolta squats next to the supine figure and begins chatting with him about the movies in which he's been a stunt man. Sixty movies. Oh, yeah? asks Chili, which ones? And Gandolfini modestly begins mentioning some, dismissing their quality over Travolta's objections. The two chat as if the assault had never taken place.Nothing is good or bad but thinking makes it so, said Hamlet. We're on the side of Travolta, of course, because he's the unpretentious hero captivated by movies, just like the rest of us, but a guy who can handle himself too. And he convinces us, just as he convinces the others, that an entertaining movie can be made from this lousy script he's come into possession of. He cares nothing about other people, just movies. But at least he cares for movies. That's ""good"" in a film like this. It's constructive and Travolta's motive is passion. The ""bad"" guys just simply want the money because it's coming to them, and in some cases they're right. The Latino gang has taken a risk by shipping the drugs into the USA. They have a legitimate claim to it because, as one of the four factors of production, the ""entrepreneurs"", they've earned it. They may be right but they're still ""bad"" in this context.The ""friendships"" and affairs mirror the moral nihilism of the other narrative strands. Nobody's in love. Nobody really cares deeply about anybody else. Allegiances shift like the wind. Betrayals are commonplace. And it's all so boldly stated that it comes out amusing.The dialog is pretty sharp and the characters well observed. The egocentricity of celebrities and the rich and powerful is used for laughs. Tiny Danny DeVito sits down at an al fresco café and orders the waitress to bring an omelet, but it has to be made with only egg whites, and the shallots have to be only slightly browned -- not too much -- and then he leaves before it arrives. When an acquaintance addresses him as ""Marty,"" DeVito smiles in a friendly way, nods, and corrects him -- ""Martin.""Dennis Farina arrives at LAX, strides purposefully to the sidewalk, arriving at a right angle to the curb. A taxi sits a few feet away to his left. Without looking, silently, Farina snaps his fingers and the driver pulls up until the rear door is directly in front of his fare. The cab driver is a non-person to Farina. So is everyone else, to everyone else, except to the extent that they can be useful.It's a movie that's almost completely without heart. It is to empathy what the Marx Brothers were to social niceties and that's what makes it so funny.",Get Shorty
8,Tweekums,Mobsters want to get into the movie business and filmmakers think they can act like mobsters,8,26 May 2017,"Chili Palmer is a debt collector working for the mob in Miami. He is instructed to collect on the debt of a man who apparently died in a plane crash his wife tells a different story; he missed the flight but the airline thought he was on board so paid her $300,000 in compensation. He then took it to Las Vegas. Chili follows him there but discovers he has moved on to Los Angeles. While in Vegas he is asked if he can help out collecting a debt from a film director in LA he agrees and so begins his introduction to the film business. He meets Zimm who agrees to pay up within ninety days; they get chatting and Chili pitches an idea for a movie the movie we are watching. Of course at this point he doesn't know how it will end. Zimm also owes money to some local gangsters, who in turn owe money to a Colombian drug cartel. It isn't long before Chili wants to get into the movie business and, having retrieved the $300,000 is looking to invest it in Zimm's next project, he is also getting involved with an actress and trying to help get a leading actor to play the protagonist.When written down the plot seems a bit convoluted but when watching it all makes sense. The story is told with flair; it is fun and provides lots of laughs without the humour seeming forced It also contains lots of entertaining characters. The cast includes lots of well-known faces; John Travolta is on fine form as Chili and is ably supported by Gene Hackman as Zimm; Rene Russo, as love interest Karen Flores; Danny DeVito as film star Martin Weir; Dennis Farina as Miami mobster Ray 'Bones'; Delroy Lindo as LA gangster Bo Catlett and James Gandolfini as his enforcer 'Bear'. There is lots of sharp dialogue delivered in a way that makes the characters feel real rather than becoming caricatures. There is some violence but the way it occurs is more comical then upsetting. Overall I'd recommend this for anybody looking for a slick film with gangsters, assorted wannabes that has a gentle poke at Hollywood and provides more than enough laughs.",Get Shorty
9,moonspinner55,Enjoyable crowd-pleaser...puts Travolta's charm and talent to good use,6,8 July 2010,"Elmore Leonard story about a modern-day runner for a Brooklyn mobster, freelancing after the mob boss dies of a heart attack, relocating to Los Angeles to collect on a debt from a low-grade movie producer, who himself owes a bundle to Las Vegas hoods. Pitching a story (a factual one, it turns out) to the producer about a schnook who collected illegally on an insurance claim, the shark manages to infiltrate high-rolling Hollywood. Super-slick, easy-to-take gangster-lite. In the lead, John Travolta does some of his best under-playing ever, nearly disappearing into this role as too-cool Chili Palmer (if Travolta hadn't already made a comeback, this performance would have accomplished it for him). Surrounding Travolta are some mercurial, colorful hams: Delroy Lindo as the Vegas snake who practically slithers into a room, Gene Hackman as the movie producer who can't keep his mouth shut, Danny DeVito as a (short) Method actor, James Gandolfini as a stuntman turned roughneck. They're all originals, and the movie crackles with both humor and mobster heat. Followed by ""Be Cool"" in 2005. **1/2 from ****",Get Shorty

While in Vegas, a casino boss sends Chili to Hollywood to collect on a bigger debt from a low-budget horror film producer, Harry Zimm (Gene Hackman). Chili actually has an idea for a film, based on a true story. He soon finds himself involved with drug dealers, the producer's scream queen star (Rene Russo), a short but big star with a tall ego (Danny Devito), who is the scream queen's ex, murder, money in an airport locker, the Feds - in short, it's business as usual. Chili decides that his skills are a great match for Hollywood and decides to become a producer.A very funny send-up of the movie-making business, with a terrific cast and several cameos by people such as Penny Marshall, Harvey Keitel, and Alex Rocco. Bette Midler has a small but showy role as well.What makes the film is John Travolta's performance as Chili. Easy-going, smart, and personable, with solid rock underneath, Travolta is fabulous and the anchor of the film. The dialogue is crisp, and the cast helps to create some strong characters, and there is great pacing by director Barry Sonnenfeld.Recommended.",Get Shorty
11,Quinoa1984,"Like an ol' familiar song, done with some twists. Nice casting",8,5 July 2004,"Barry Sonnenfeld was and maybe wasn't the right choice to make Get Shorty. He's a great visualist, and his films (Adams Family, Men in Black) are also very funny, but it's hard to say whether or not another director might've taken Elmore Leonard's sly comic novel more seriously or with less depth. As it is, however, Get Shorty is a cool little treat that doesn't over-stay its welcome, and provides its cast a plethora of witty dialog.  John Travolta brings on some sharp attitude, knowing the angles and wanting, as his character Chili Palmer, to get into Hollywood and out of loan sharking. Gene Hackman's funny as a fledgling producer with his first, true big hit in his lap.  And supporting parts from Delroy Lindo, Renne Russo, Danny De Vito (as 'Hollywood' as you'll ever see him), and James Gandolfini, are all very worthy.  It's a worthwhile watch, with a dead-on score from John Lurie.  But I would reccomend Out of Sight or Jackie Brown to Leonard fans looking for a great adaptation.  It's a very good Hollywood picture (reflective of what it's about), though it's not a masterpiece.  A-",Get Shorty

The latter always was able to bring in two diverse groups in his stories. This yarn seems to follow that pattern with mobster Chili Palmer, a heavy smoking John Travolta, going to Hollywood and seeing for himself mob-like activities in tinsel town as well.Travolta is very good in the part. What became of the David Palmer character in the film. He had stolen $300,000 from the airline who had paid his family, not realizing that he had taken himself off the plane before it crashed.Dennis Farina, an ex-policeman in real life, is terrific as one of the mobsters and Gene Hackman is a riot in a different type of performance for him as a producer who is in the thick of things as well.I wish that someone could explain to me the role of Danny De Vito here. As a two-time Oscar winner, De Vito's role should have been expanded here. This is also true for Rene Russo.",Get Shorty

After seeing the film for the first time tonight I`m somewhat suprised what all the fuss was in the first placeGET SHORTY is by no means a bad film in my opinion but nor is it Oscar worthy material either . The problem I have is that it lacks an identity of its own . From Travolta`s smooth gangster to the pastel coloured lettering in the title credits this has "" Tarantino wannabe "" written all over it . I mean look at the scene of the funky black geezer ( I guess Samuel L Jackson turned the part down with the fear of type casting ? ) walks through the airport terminal , it`s like the opening scene of JACKIE BROWN . And being similar to Tarantino we have to put up with people getting blown away in a darkly comical manner and insults like "" I`ve seen better film on teeth motherf***er ""Okay it`s certainly watchable but tell me is this a darkly comic thriller or is it a satire on Hollywood ? If it`s the former then stop ripping Tarantino`s overrated style and if it`s the latter then someone should have employed Robert Altman as director which would have led to certain Oscar recognition",Get Shorty
16,jotix100,Mafiosi love movies too!,8,24 March 2004,"Elmore Leonard's books must be loved by film screen adapters. His characters translate very well from the written page to the moving picture. ""Get Shorty"" is one of Mr. Leonard's best stories and it gets a very good treatment in the hands of Barry Sonnenfeld, its director, with the help of Scott Frank, who adapted it for the screen.The casting of the movie was it's greatest asset. John Travolta is so cool as Chilli, the mafioso who loves movies! In his scenes with Gene Hackman, he demonstrates what a good actor he is. On the surface, he appears to do nothing; he works with an economy that is very hard to imitate. Granted, after Mr. Travolta's amazing appearance in Pulp Fiction, this was a confirmation and validation of his talent.It was surprising, since I didn't remember his appearance on the movie, to watch actor James Gandolfini, prior to his recent fame. He plays a stuntman turned wise guy. Mr. Gandolfini must have gone through a great dental cosmetic transformation, unless he was made up to look very ugly, as Bear, in the film. I have greatly admired his work before his TV series, as a fine character actor, which he demonstrates here the potential he had and was not discovered until much later.Delroy Lindo is also excellent as one of the bad guys in the film. This actor, who is as great in films as in the theater, deserves much better. He is a man that always gives an honest performance. Not being a Danny DeVito fan, I must confess that he was very restrained here. He can do very good work with the right director behind him, as he shows playing the egotistical actor, Martin Weir.Also excellent, Dennis Farina. It's unfortunate he doesn't get better choices because he is always very effective in whatever he plays. In this film, he is hysterical as Ray ""Bones"" Barboni. Rene Russo, as the bit player with a heart of gold, is good. What can be said of Gene Hackman that hasn't already been said? His Harry Zimm is so accurate that we believe he is this sleazy Hollywood producer. Mr. Hackman is a consummate performer who keeps getting better all the time.

17,Hey_Sweden,"Chili, I don't think we're in Miami anymore.",8,16 July 2019,"At this time, John Travolta was riding high after Quentin Tarantino and ""Pulp Fiction"" had completely revitalized his career. He's full of poise and self-confidence in the role of ""Chili"" Palmer, a debt collector for the Miami mob who travels to L.A. on business. One of his targets is Harry Zimm (Gene Hackman), a veteran producer of utter schlock who's looking to break into mainstream filmmaking with a better-than-average script. And Chili, who's a movie fan, realizes that connecting with Harry is his ticket into the movie business. He must still deal with various unsavoury types, but handles it all in style.Elmore Leonard is treated with a degree of respect by a talented cast & crew, led by director Barry Sonnenfeld. As a former cinematographer, Sonnenfeld knew how to make a visually rich film, and since his previous two pictures were the ""Addams Family"" feature films, he clearly had a knack for comedy, as well. He works from a solid Scott Frank adaptation of the Leonard novel, complete with a large amount of witty dialogue, and some effective digs at Hollywood and its ""types"". (Danny DeVito is a hoot as an egotistical movie star who enjoys talking about his acting process.) Even at an hour and 45 minutes, it never feels that long, due to excellent pacing and a great many compelling scenes.Travolta receives strong support from a well-chosen cast of famous faces and reliable character actors. Hackman is quite funny, although his character is quite senseless. Rene Russo is appealing as a former schlock starlet who has far more talent and savvy than her roles would have indicated. And get a load of this supporting lineup: Dennis Farina, Delroy Lindo, James Gandolfini (a few years before his subsequent stardom on 'The Sopranos'), David Paymer, Martin Ferrero, Miguel Sandoval, Jon Gries, and Linda Hart. Bette Midler appears uncredited; other famous performers make cameo appearances.Enhanced by a jaunty music score by John Lurie, ""Get Shorty"" is good, breezy fun.Followed by the sequel ""Be Cool"", and a TV series.Eight out of 10.",Get Shorty
18,Boba_Fett1138,When mobsters come to Hollywood.,8,11 March 2007,"I absolutely loved this movie when it first came out. It has an amazing cast, a pleasant light way of storytelling and a cleverly written story, featuring some great stereotypical gangster-type of characters.So, ever wondered what would happen if gangster interfered with producing Hollywood movies? See ""Get Shorty"" if your curious about the result. It's an unusual original story about tough gangster put in an unnatural environment, who thinks that are making movies is the same as any other criminal activity.The movie is cleverly written with many different characters, that all follow one and the same plot line. All characters have different motivations but they are all cleverly connected to each other. The many characters often mix and meet each other in the events, which also causes all of their motivations to mix. The movie is really cleverly written and executed. It perhaps sounds like a complicated and hard movie to follow but it really is a light, great written and pleasant one to watch.The movie also works because of the many fine characters and of course the actors that portray them. Basically every character in the movie is deliciously stereotypical, from the Hollywood-producer to the stunt guy and from the successful acclaimed Hollywood actor to the mobster boss. The movie is well cast with actors that are obviously not cast because of their comical talents but purely because of their acting skills. The cast is one to kill for. John Travolta of course knows how to play a cool and likable gangster. Gene Hackman also plays one of his most fun roles as low-budget Hollywood producer, who thinks that he is going to make it big time. Danny DeVito is great as an Hollywood-actor and Dennis Farina, Delroy Lindo, Miguel Sandoval provide the good gangster parts of the movie. David Paymer also does what he can do best; playing a guy with a hat. The movie is filled with many more well known actors in small roles, such as Bette Midler and James Gandolfini and even small cameo appearances such as Harvey Keitel makes.Also mainly due to the movie its professional cast, this is not an hilarious type of movie but more the sort of movie that has a constant pleasant and light atmosphere that will surely put a smile on your face. The comedy is more of the subtle kind, that everybody should be able to appreciate. Nothing in the movie ever feels forced, no matter how crazy and mixed up the movie and its situations ever get.As far as the '90's go; this movie is about as cool as they could get. This movie was the definition of cool in the '90's, at the time of its release. Of course times have changed now but the movie still has an overall cool atmosphere and pleasant way of storytelling. It's a light fun movie to watch and re-watch over and over again.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Get Shorty
19,AlsExGal,It's all simply business for Chili Palmer...,9,23 December 2020,"... as a debt collector for the mob who is based out of Miami. John Travolta is borrowing a lot from his part in ""Pulp Fiction"" here as far as attitude and presence. At least the cool mob guy part. But he's completely likeable and he has a love and encyclopedic knowledge of film comparable to the late Robert Osborne. And he gets rough when he has to, usually with another mobster from a different crew who is always trying to push him around (Dennis Farina as Ray Barboni). Chili gets the best of him without breaking his stride or his countenance. He'll graze the top of a guy's head with a bullet just on the chance he is up to no good when he enters his office without knocking, yet open the car door for a woman because he is a gentleman - a truly fascinating character.Twists of fate have him in LA collecting a debt from a schlock horror director, Harry Zim (Gene Hackman) who also owes money to some other mobsters, who owe money to still other mobsters. It gets complicated, and I won't spoil it for you, but it is easy to follow if you pay attention, and Travolta is a delight to watch as a shylock who really just wants to make movies and uses his inherent charm and street smarts to wheedle his way into producing movies and get the girl.With Danny De Vito in a supporting role as big star Martin Weir (the ""shorty"" in the film title ), Rene Russo as a B horror actress with brains who actually wants to produce, and James Gandolfini as a two-bit hoodlum four years before The Sopranos.It looks like one of those films everybody had a good time making, and you know you are watching a satire when somebody has a line saying someone is ""Dead as disco"" when talking to Travolta. Highly recommended as a love letter to and a satire of Hollywood.",Get Shorty
20,anaconda-40658,Get Travolta.,7,19 December 2015,"Get Shorty (1995): Dir: Barry Sonnenfeld / Cast: John Travolta, Gene Hackman, Rene Russo, Danny De Vito, Delroy Lindo: Interesting film with an awkward title that leaves much to be desired. It stars John Travolta as Chilli Palmer who arrives in Hollywood to collect a debt from filmmaker Gene Hackman. He takes interest in a script and convinces Danny De Vito to star. Others also seek the script and will resort to any means to obtain it. Interesting and detailed plot although the conclusion is questionable. Directed with insight by Barry Sonnenfeld with great insight into Hollywood backlash. Winning performance by Travolta who switches gears when applying his skills within the realms of Hollywood. Hilarious turn by Hackman as a producer owing much and may have a way out through Palmer. Unfortunately the methods applied are questionable. De Vito is funny as the hottest actor in Hollywood who is taught to act by Palmer in a very funny sequence. Rene Russo is effective casting as Hackman's mistress. The issue is that the role is somewhat a con yet she is actually the bait to Palmer's charm. Delroy Lindo technically plays the film's villain as he forces his demands in the business outskirts.

I was always a fan of Elmore's stories, but in the mid to late '90's Mr. Leonard was golden movie adaption-wise as well, with this movie, Jackie Brown, Out of Sight, and his TV film Last Stand at Saber River, and Gold Cost. Sadly the adaptations of the new millennium leave MUCH to be desired thus far. But back to the movie at hand, the acting by Travolta, Hackman, Russo, Dennis Farina, and Gandolfini are all pitch perfect. While Devito and especially Bette Midler leave a bit to be desired.

That high concept of making a mob guy seem normal in the crooked movie industry. And the cast on this bad boy is just incredible. Travolta is cool as ice, Russo is damn sexy, Hackman, Farina and Devito all play great assholes, and it's rounded out by plenty of familiar faces (Delroy Lindo, David Paymer, Martin Ferrero, Uncle Rico from NAPOLEON DYNAMITE).

23,christopher-underwood,I remember enjoying this much more the first time I saw it,7,3 September 2020,"I remember enjoying this much more the first time I saw it but without a doubt John Travolta is perfect in the central role and pretty much makes the film a decent watch all on his own. Having recently reread Elmore Leonard's book and watched Out of Sight, it would seem that the wry humour of the book has been broadened almost into farce and that Steven Soderbergh kept a much tighter control over proceedings in the George Clooney/Jennifer Lopez film a couple of years later. As well as Travolta, James Gandolfini and Delroy Lindo seem to get the level about right whereas Gene Hackman, Danny DeVito and Dennis Farina are seemingly allowed to go there own sweet excessive ways. Another big surprise, for me, is, ironically, how subdued Rene Russo is. She would be great the following year with Kevin Costner in Tin Cup but here barely gets going, seeming awkward with both Hackman and Travolta and managing to not even look as good as the brave and bold Bette Midler who makes far more impact in her uncredited cameo. Overall, still worth a watch, but for me, Soderbergh got it just right.",Get Shorty

To be honest, there was no way I would've had an interest in seeing this movie if were not for my mother, because I mean, John Travolta as a hit man? For me it didn't work. But my mom insisted that he and the rest of this brilliant cast, Renee Russo, Danny DeVito, and Gene Hackman, were just great and I should give the movie a chance. I was glad I did, the plot worked so well and this movie just kept me on my seat wanting to see the next scene.John plays Chili, a mob hit man, who is on his way to Hollywood just to catch a run away with his boss's money, but he has a better idea. Chili goes to Gene who plays Harry Zim, a B-movie director, and Chili tells him an idea for a movie of the same plot that he came here to do with the run away. Everyone thinks it's a good idea for a movie, including a B-actress Karen Flores, played by Renee, and an Oscar nominee Martin Weir played by Danny. But when Chili takes the run away's money to invest in the movie instead of coming back home with it, the mob families are not so happy and come back for the doe.""Get Shorty"" is a great movie, especially if you're into the mob films.

26,MovieAddict2016,I didn't like it before - now I do,8,12 June 2005,"It's funny; I used to really hate ""Get Shorty."" Well, perhaps ""hate"" is too strong a word  I simply disliked it. I didn't get it. Everyone always praised it for being so hip, smart, and clever; I thought it was just a distasteful stab at Hollywood, a one-joke pony with a Tarantino complex.It wasn't until I watched the film more recently that I realized just how well made it actually is, and how the humor  which is never really as outrageous as it is subtle and chuckle-inducing  is perfectly pointed and aimed squarely at its target: the film industry.John Travolta plays Chili Palmer, a Mafia loan shark collector whose boss dies of a heart attack one unexpected night. Positions change and soon Chili is working for Ray ""Bones"" (Dennis Farina), a dim-witted-but-violent madman who orders Chili to collect life insurance on a guy who died in a plane crash before paying back his loan. Chili talks to the widow and finds out the guy is still alive, hiding out in Vegas with his fortunes, gambling it all away.Chili makes the trek to Vegas and is directed towards Hollywood to collect a debt from a Hollywood Z-grade movie director named Harry (Gene Hackman). Chili decides to throw Harry a pitch for a new movie based on his own recent adventure, and Harry loves it  they decide to try and finance the film together, but first they need a big-name star. So they attempt to hire Martin Weir (Danny De Vito), a hugely successful Oscar-nominated movie star. That's where the whole ""Get Shorty"" part comes in.This movie is very confusing on first viewing as it moves around so quickly. It's based on a novel by Elmore Leonard, and if you've read anything by Leonard, you'll already be aware his strengths are his plotting, characters and dialogue  ""Get Shorty"" has all of this.Travolta delivers his coolest performance ever as Chili, who can stare at a person and tell them everything he needs to just with his eyes. Travolta's dialogue is the best, with lines like ""I won't say any more than I have to, if that."" Gene Hackman gives one of his funniest and sleaziest performances and is really fun to watch.The entire cast is superb and Dennis Farina is an absolute scene-stealer with some of the most memorable one-liners, including my personal favorite, ""I.e., e.g., screw you!"" Only he doesn't say ""screw."" ""Get Shorty"" is very heavily influenced by ""Pulp Fiction"" (which had been released a year prior) and in fact Quentin Tarantino was the person who told Travolta to take the role because he thought it might further his career even more. He was right. ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Get Shorty"" are the two defining films of Travolta's career in the 1990s and it proves that Travolta is at his best playing characters like this. It's unfortunate that he now seems to strive towards mediocrity. Even the sequel to ""Get Shorty,"" named ""Be Cool,"" was worse than the book, which was pretty bad to begin with.But ""Get Shorty"" is good. Very good. It's fun, it's hip, it's dark and it's got a great script. It's not a substantial masterpiece, but it's hugely entertaining, and a spot-on parody, and I think that's all that matters.",Get Shorty

28,Robert_duder,"Brilliant, Sattirical, funny, did I mention Brilliant??",9,15 March 2006,"Well another surprise from left field for me. I just found another of my favorite movies of all time and this one has been hiding on me since 1995...11 freaking years!! I finally got around to watching Get Shorty and didn't stop watching it until it was done and over with and then I wanted to watch it again!! Get Shorty reminds me of Ocean's 11 in the way that it brings together some Hollywood elite for a good time and better yet an amazing story and interesting film. I have yet to see the sequel but now I absolutely cannot wait another minute to see it!! John Travolta plays one of the greatest characters in film history...Chili Palmer. A loan shark/gangster who ends up in Hollywood while on a collection run for his new boss who he hates. Taken in by the Hollywood glam Chili meets up with a starlet and a down on his luck director in order to bring his own personal idea to the big screen. Travolta's tough guy is the best of the best...""hey, hey look at me"" goes down in my books along with ""You talking to me?"" and ""I'll make you an offer you can't refuse."" Travolta plays the greatest anti hero, he's mean and a bad ass and yet you love the guy and root for him. He's smart too and always outsmarts his adversaries and he has a few!! Enter the amazing Gene Hackman as the director Harry Zimm. Harry has the worst luck and it gets worse when Chili Palmer enters his life. Hackman is terrific and it's not often you see him getting beaten up, shot at, stepped on and it makes for some funny moments. Hackman should have gotten award nominations as should have Travolta. Rene Russo does what she does best...support. She's a support actor and she does well doing that. She has had scenes with more top leading men than any other actress in Hollywood and she's glamorous and does a good job. Her character Karen Flores is a little empty, there isn't a lot to it but she certainly plays her part. Danny Devito is Hollywood legend, two time Academy Award winning actor Martin Weir. Part of the sarcastic comedy is the idea of this little man being such a huge Hollywood player. His self involved, womanizing Weir is wonderful and fun to watch. Devito impresses!! Dennis Farina plays Ray ""Bones"" Barboni. I've always considered Farina as more of a TV actor, he never really opens himself up to greatness but he is pretty good up against Travolta as his nemesis and new boss. He's violent and cruel and he's stupid and Travolta gets the better of him every time. He adds to this cast for sure!! Delroy Lindo is even better as the maniacal Hollywood mobster Bo Catlett. Lindo would have made an even better villain if it was just him. The story is pretty complex and intense and has so much going on so his true acting brilliance as Bo Catlett gets buried a little but it's still great. Finally Mr. Soprano himself James Gandolfini is Bo's henchman and former Hollywood stuntman Bear. Nobody plays the tough guy better but he plays his own tough guy role to a bit of poking fun as he gets beaten by Travolta badly every time until finally he ends up on his side. Gandolfini is a great villain, always has been (check out the brilliant ""The Last Castle"") but he's even better as a brooding sidekick.Director Barry Sonnenfeld is no stranger to comedy but most of his comedies before this and since this have been pretty juvenile. This is without a doubt his best work and probably always will be. Get Short is the exact definition of black comedy. It's funny but in a weird, twisted way and it's satirical and really pokes fun at Hollywood and stereotypes in general. The story moves so quickly and there is so much going on and so many characters but you never lose grip on any one of them and all the stories are intertwined perfectly and at the heart of it all you have the amazing Chili Palmer who Travolta embraces and creates as his own. It's a Hollywood film, heist film, comedy, gangster, buddy film, romance...you name it...it's everything and it's now probably one of my top ten favorite films of all time. Why did I wait so long?? Oh well better late than never...go see this one, rent it, buy it, it's an absolute film must see!! 9/10",Get Shorty
29,A_Different_Drummer,reality disguised as fiction disguised as reality...,9,30 October 2013,"One of the great mysteries of all time, right up there with Area 51 and the Da Vinci Code, is why the film industry, now into its second century and -- as you read this -- consuming on a relative basis more bandwidth than any other form of media, cannot produce consistently decent product? Now don't misunderstand. This is not to say that most movies are inherently bad, for that is not true either. However one of the dirty little secrets of the industry is that the ""breakout"" ratio is around 20:1. That is, for every 19 forgettable products that are churned out -- products that keep the cable and streaming media pipelines full, and keep food on the table for all the electricians, caterers, and Best Boys -- about one actually is memorable enough to attract a permanent audience or become near-iconic. Not a very efficient ratio! The late Marshall McLuhan tried in his lifetime to develop the notion of ""media ecology,"" essentially the premise that the cultural output of a society was no less important than any other industry output, and therefore an effort should be made NOT TO WASTE THE RESOURCES or (simply put) produce junk. Like the infamous joke about about the ""Nietzsche graffiti"" (first line: ""God is dead - Nietzsche."" Second line: ""Nietzsche is dead. God"") that attempt did not turn out so well. McLuhan is gone, and the ratio has arguably gotten worse, because there are now many more pipelines to fill. Which brings us, belatedly, to GET SHORTY, not only a great film (one of Travolta's best performances, so effortless you wonder if he phoned it in, and Pixar just added a body) but one of Hollywood's most ""inside"" scripts ever. (Comedians have ""inside jokes."" Hollywood has ""inside scripts."") The premise here is that the making of a movie has little to do with the movie, and everything to do with egos and business capabilities of the people making it. The idea that a professional mobster could stumble into Hollywood and suddenly realize that making a film is no different than planning a hit, or a robbery, is sheer brilliance. And very close to home. In the history of the medium, it is one of the only movies to deal with the delicate (and unpopular) issue of ... why so many bad films have to be made, simply to produce one good one...?",Get Shorty

Leonard, who has had a prolific and varied career, provides a script that is generally entertaining, but there are too many plot threads and it doesn't all come together as well as it does in the best comedies. The cast is terrific: Travolta is believable as a tough goon, Hackman is smooth as a producer of schlocky movies, Russo is sexy as an actress past her bimbo prime, and DeVito is a shallow movie star (and title supplier). However, it is Farina who steals the film in a hilarious performance as an insecure mobster who's always left holding the wrong end of the stick.",Get Shorty
31,The-Sarkologist,A satirical look at the movie making business - absolute gold,8,16 February 2012,"Now what does one make of this rather strange movie. What is the plot and if there is a plot, what is it? Get Shorty is not a mindless action flick, that is not what I am referring to when I am asking about a plot. Most action flicks generally have a plot, even though they are probably extremely shallow. Get Shorty, on the other hand, has a rather strange plot with some even stranger events.Chilli (John Travolta) is a loan shark who has been upset by another mafia boss in Miami named Ray Babone (Hal Linden). Chilli breaks Babone's nose and then shoots him just to let him know that he is not in the mood to be pushed around. Unfortunately Chilli's boss, Momo, dies in Brooklyn when he walks into a surprise party and has a heart attack. Babone then convinces him to go to Los Angeles to chase a laundry operator who owes him $300,000 after he allegedly died in a airplane crash. When Chilli gets to Los Angeles he is also asked by somebody in Las Vegas to get some money from a movie producer (Gene Hackman). When he breaks into the producer's house, he is struck with the movie making bug and decides that the current events would make a good movie. Thus he begins to try to drum up interest, mostly from a famous actor named Martin Wier (Danny DeVito) and gets involved with Wier's ex-wife who is an actress (Rene Ruso). Meanwhile another loan shark is after the producer for money that was lost at a casino.Pretty twisting little plot I thought and there were some quite funny scenes in the movie. It is the twisting plot that makes this movie shine. The major thing with the movie is a satirical look at Hollywood and the loansharking business. All of the films mentioned have really corny names suggesting the meaninglessness of the movies that are made. It is also shown as a bug that influences everybody that comes into the scene. Chilli and the LA loanshark are both caught by the producing bug and want to get into the film industry. Martin Wier is a typical actor and his personality is also satirised. He is shown Chilli's rent-a-car and decides that he likes it so much that he buys one himself. When they are having lunch, he orders everything for everybody and eats none of it suggesting that the actor always wants to be in control of the movie, even though it is the producer and the director that run the show. Then there is the ending where Ray Babone goes to the locker at LA airport and is caught by the DEA agents. This is twisted around in the film being made replacing the agents with Chilli, somebody much shorter, and a bad imitation of Babone. This goes to show the delusion that Hollywood creates. In a true story, the people become vague caricatures of the people that they are based upon, and are twisted to allow the famous actors to take the spot. Martin Wier is nothing like Chilli yet Chilli knows that to capture an audience, one must turn to a famous face.Then there is the film studio ending, the removal of the veil that shrouds Hollywood. It is revealed that all it is is a movie and any bad ending is meaningless because the antagonist is only an actor who walks away afterwards. No matter how evil this bad guy is and no matter how much he is hated, what happens in the movie is only an illusion. The bad guy is only an actor and his apparent death is just some ploy shot in front of the camera. In the end, they will all pack up and go home.Thus Get Shorty is a very intelligent and satirical movie. The bad guys are not threatening, but rather a caricature of the typical Hollywood villain. The movie is focused entirely on Chilli who is fearless and able to bend even the most intimidating person to his will. The most outstanding part of this movie is Gene Hackman's role. When I do not recognise the actor then that actor is doing a very good job. This was the case with Ed Harris in The Truman Show, and it is the case in this movie. Hackman has a famous face, yet it was a face that I did not recognise in this film.",Get Shorty

33,sol-,Got Shorty,7,13 July 2016,"Sent to Hollywood to collect a debt, a film-obsessed mobster seizes on an opportunity to become a movie producer himself in this star-studded crime comedy populated by some truly kooky characters. Dennis Farina is especially memorable as a fellow mobster who keeps getting scarred by the protagonist, but the film is most propelled by the charisma that John Travolta brings to the lead role, constantly telling others to look directly at him in an intimidating manner. Travolta's love of cinema is a nice touch too with a great scene in which he watches 'Touch of Evil', quoting the dialogue word for word, and some funny business as 'Rio Bravo' and 'El Dorado' are confused. Travolta also offers an interesting comment on 'Touch of Evil', claiming that ""sometimes you do your best work when you have a gun to your head"". It is worth mentioning that this is a film that works better the second time round. The one-joke nature of the premise is disappointing at first with the very blatant comparison drawn between Hollywood producers and mobsters never all that funny, but there is a lot more to the film than just that and a second viewing helps to appreciate how well everything flows. Whatever the case, the film is engaging whenever focused on the gangster-like elements of filmmaking, Gene Hackman is very effective as a timid producer caught up in the mess and the ending (if not wholly original) is pitch perfect.",Get Shorty

John Travolta is laid-back cool as Chili Palmer and Dennis Farini as Ray ""Bones"" is near to bursting with pent-up resentment; but theirs aren't the only noteworthy performances in the film: Gene Hackman as schlockmeister Harry Zimm, a movie producer of very few scruples, and Delroy Lindo as a loan-sharking dealer in narcotics who's dying to produce a movie in Hollywoodland, deliver the goods as well. Sonnenfeld's direction couldn't be improved upon (at least, not in my opinion). To hear these characters- especially the career criminals, like Travolta and Lindo- talk at length about movies is worth the price of admission (and I thought so back when I saw this one when it was first released). Hackman offers this tidbit to Travolta: ""I once asked this literary agent what kind of writing paid the best. He said, 'Ransom notes.'"" Later, having sat through a showing of TOUCH OF EVIL, Travolta tells Rene Russo: ""Sometimes you do your best work when you got a gun to your head.""",Get Shorty
36,johnnyboyz,"Muddled and sparsely entertaining, there will be those that 'Get' it much more than I do but it remains only moderately pleasing fare.",6,12 October 2010,"With the benefit of hindsight, you might say 1995's Get Shorty plays a lot like one of those Coen brothers features that come along every few years or so and end up being a lot less than the film it wants to come across as. The idea usually reads well on paper, the film feels like a good idea at the time; sees some scenes work better than others and while it doesn't really know what it wants to be, it's almost as if that in itself is part of the charm - it's only afterwards when you think back that you shrug, adopt a ponderous tone and wonder whether it was really worth getting excited about. Get Shorty's like that, the film is an interesting mess and that's the best thing you can say about it; it doesn't know whether it's coming or going, it doesn't know what it's about, some characters are more interesting than others, some don't work at all but like something like 2008's Burn After Reading, it has a charm that works in the moment and only when it isn't bothering itself with either narrative or large amounts of substance.For a film to so heavily involve the notion of filmmaking, it's only natural I suppose to note how even its title possesses a sense of deeply rooted sense of cinema; of which are infused in the form of 1971's Get Carter, itself a film about a hardened gangster travelling a large distance so as to get a job done with various parties and elements getting in the way. Get Carter had something about it, something solid and central and it maintained enthralling and gripping throughout. Here, it is the antithesis: several tangents as well as supporting characters, whom the film makes the golden mistake of making either ten times funnier or more interesting than the lead, are all going off at once thus creating a muddled and only marginally interesting piece. Was the film about a Florida based loan shark out of his element but falling in anyway with the crowd around him? Was it about a Miami mob boss who's owed money and wants it back? Is it about a heist? A con? Filmmaking? Gangsters? Is it a love story? A pair of hoods whom have a stake in a film company? The short and long of it is: too much of too many to be deeply involving, not enough of one or two to be deeply affecting.The best thing about the film is quite easily Dennis Farina's initially Miami based mobster Ray Barboni, nicknamed 'Bones'. Most of the scenes in which Farina's angry, foul mouthed, border-line scociopathic gangster is around present to the audience the best material and the biggest laughs, with his lack of presence greatly diminishing the film. He gets agitated when Travolta's Chili Palmer flies out to Los Angeles so as to collect a debt following complications with a mob boss, eventually taking it upon himself to fly out there too so as to clear everything up. His exodus is because of Palmer's newfound sense of existence amidst the higher-ups of America's filmmaking industry, and his friendship with American B-movie filmmaker Harry Zimm (Hackman) whom it's established is a bit slimy and who makes, judging by the titles, some equally slimy films. Meanwhile, Delroy Lindo's L.A. based gangster Bo Catlett and beefy accomplice Bear (Gandolfini) have their own problems involving South American drug barons and stakes in the industry themselves, as actor and actress Martin Weir (DeVito) and Karen Flores (Russo), two character's we might have done without, hover around.The film begins on a gloomy day in Miami, Palmer's fondness for film established by way of a rueful tone regarding a local disused cinema which he believes it would be fantastic if it were up and running. The kind of guy, in Palmer, that we're informed to be dealing with is put across in his attitudes and reactions to Bones' waltzing over with two cohorts. The threatening behaviour and petty jibes twinned with the taking of Palmer's coat on the way out of the diner they're all in means little to the man, the nervous reactions of the clerks in regards to Bones further adding to the strength and reputation the man carries. For Palmer, it means little and a later visiting to Bones' house along with the taking of everything in his stride aids in getting across what kind of person Palmer is for later skirmishes.Therein the word skirmish lies the problem, Get Shorty effectively being a series of moderately entertaining, even more-so when Farina is on screen, bits and bobs sequences together that work on occasion but not enough to get truly excited about. The pithy self-aware jabs at the film industry and those within it in Palmer's dismissive talk of film producers and Catlett's equally dismissive talk of screenplays in their usually error ridden forms are amusing, but don't contribute to the greater extent of anything. The film is ultimately less interested in something that I had more of an interest in, in its noirish tendencies, and ended up more interested in something my attention waned in relation to in its filmmaking sub-plots; the systematic rejection of which is evident when a low level hood is disposed of at a character's luxurious home only for dialogue about movie making to immediately succeed the event and the fall out which it spawns. Its underlying idea that anybody, in this case quite literally, regardless of their past can waltz into the American film industry and lobby for some success is generally scathing in an understated sort of way, and there is, ultimately, enough to get caught up in for Get Shorty to work in the long run.",Get Shorty

The two (mob movies and Hollywood) have always gotten along well together from ""The Godfather"" to ""Goodfellas,"" so ""Get Shorty"" taking the humorous business angle is only a natural evolution. Starring John Travolta hot off of ""Pulp Fiction,"" it's an enjoyable film for those who love movies and those who love the mob.""Get Shorty"" is mostly about the former. Chili Palmer (Travolta) is a loan shark/shylock who flies out to Hollywood to collect a debt and partly to avoid his new boss, Ray Bones, the perfect jerk with a foul mouth played by Dennis Farina. In LA, Palmer meets producer Harry Zimm (Gene Hackman) and becomes fond of the movie business, offering to help Zimm get some lenders who've invested in one of his films off his back.There's some strong irony between the movie business and mob movies, e.g. Chili pitches the story of why he's out in LA as a movie idea to Zimm who thinks he's got something, but its the rock solid performances of Travolta, Hackman, Farina and Delroy Lindo that sell you on ""Get Shorty.""Film-lovers will appreciate many references from ""Touch of Evil"" to ""Three Men and a Baby"" as the movie takes plenty of shots at the industry. Those more into the mob angle will enjoy how everyone's out to get everyone -- some for legitimate reasons, others because they want in on the movie business. It displaces the gangster movie from its cozy home in New York, Boston or Miami and drops it into the glitz of Hollywood where it fits well seeing as the industry is not exactly the cleanest.""Get Shorty"" is not overly impressive, maintaining interest through its performances and our wondering just when one of these guys is going to up the stakes and off someone -- such are the thrills of a mob movie.

He has got no money and no talent though. How does he get the money and the talent? Through theft and coercion ofcourse, like any gangster would. How this all works out is what this story is all about. Nice supporting roles by Gene Hackman and Danny DeVito.There certainly are better gangster comedies out there. This story is somewhat burdened by the fact that it is trying to hard to be cool. Quentin Tarantino pictures are cool, many attempts at copying his style have been made. But a style can never get copied without losing spirit and punch. This is also the case with ""Get Shorty"", it is mereley a reasonably nice copy, because it simply tries to steal from Tarantino's style and succeeds only halfheartedly. Still a nice gangster comedy to pass the time with.., but dont expect originality or greatness.",Get Shorty
40,Vartiainen,Relies heavily on its actors,5,14 December 2015,"Get Shorty has a pretty sweet set-up. A loanshark mobster named Chili Palmer (John Travolta) has to travel from Miami to Los Angeles in order to collect a debt for his new boss. There he finds out that the movie business doesn't really differ all that much from what he has done successfully all his life, and thus he decides to produce a movie while he's at it. Very nice idea. Just exaggerated enough that no one will take it too seriously and the jokes practically write themselves.Which makes it all the more baffling that I didn't really laugh while watching the film. I enjoyed its plot a lot, but its humour didn't connect with me at all. I enjoyed the suaveness of John Travolta and all his serious scenes a lot more than I enjoyed any of the jokes the script had him say every once in a while. And that's basically the movie in a nutshell. It has a really good cast of actors, all of them charismatic and able to play their characters to perfection, but the script doesn't give them all that much to work with, meaning that they're not all that funny. Perhaps this would have worked better as a drama film with a humorous undertone. More drama than comedy, whereas in this case it's the other way around.Then again, perhaps it's just me. I've heard a lot of people say that this is a really funny film, so it might just be that it's not my cup of tea. Wouldn't be the first time when it comes to comedies. And, as stated, the film works very well as a story about a mobster that decides to do Hollywood. The characters are interesting, the various plot twists are just convoluted enough and the plot has a good structure.All in all I have to rate the film as just slightly below average because for me it doesn't work as a comedy. Still, definitely worth a watch if you're more omnivorous when it comes to comedies, because even if the humour doesn't hit you, at least you'll get a pretty decent mobster film out of it.",Get Shorty

It has to do with a scene in ""The Way We Were"" he once heard a woman telling a clerk about in a Pick 'n' Save.""You know what she didn't say?"" Zimm says. ""'What I loved was the way the director moved the %&@*ing camera around and made me seasick.""In ""Get Shorty"", director Barry Sonnenfeld moves the %&@*ing camera around like nobody's business, and it's terrific. Terrific at setting up and underscoring the drama of a lesser Leonard storyline, to the point where it feels right up there with Dutch's best work. Terrific at giving John Travolta, as lead character Chili Palmer, his best vehicle for wall-to-wall cool without undermining his considerable charisma. Terrific at giving Hackman, Danny DeVito, Dennis Farina, Rene Russo, and Delroy Lindo, among others, ample chance to shine playing various Hollywood topcats and leeches.The thing that makes Leonard so readable is normally the same thing that flummoxes those who try to film his work, with a few exceptions. His quick changes, his disinterest in setting scenes for the sake of setting scenes, his fast action, all seems to trip up most directors trying to do justice to his work.Not Sonnenfeld. He just has fun capturing on screen the way Leonard playfully turns the tables on his readers, mimicking that displacement with the odd camera turn or the long pan on a twisty stairwell where Chili grabs a big guy and throws him over like a bag of potatoes. ""You know, for a guy his size that's not bad,"" Chili says about the fall, and the charm's in the genuine appreciation, not gloating, Chili shows for his fallen victim.Leonard can sometimes annoy a reader with the way his protagonists anticipate every adversarial move, but Sonnenfeld turns it into an in-joke we share with Chili, a wink of his eye or the way he punches our shoulder in appreciation after watching, for the umpteenth time, Orson Welles telling Marlene Dietrich she did him wrong. ""You're going down, Orson!"" And so are we, willingly.That is, if you are a film fan. If you aren't, you may find ""Get Shorty"" a tad smug. Even though it clearly makes fun of its Hollywood milieu, and the way we expect (and get) a happy ending even after all we've been through.Me, I will always love this film for the way it showcases Farina as the ultimate good bad guy, at least in the unintentional comedy division, barring only Larry Linville as Frank Burns on TV's ""M*A*S*H"". ""When I say jump, you say okay"" his Ray ""Bones"" Barboni tells Chili, striving to sound threatening while mangling another tough-guy cliché.Or ""How'd know he's dead, did he tell you?""""Yeah, he told me that he was dead.""""Personally?""Ouch.

""Get Shorty"" is a light yet black look at the underworld and the movie scene that is rich in humour. Sonnenfeld has done a very good job bringing Leonard's satirical novel to the screen.Adding enjoyment to the entertainment are John Travolta, marvellous as the disenchanted mob thug who takes a shine to Hollywood, Gene Hackman as the hack director who has run across the most unlikely of investors, and Dennis Farina, who is perfect as the inept crime boss who chases a bad debt all the way across the US.

I had a lot of fun watching 'Get Shorty', based on the novel by Elmore Leonard, so it doesn't really matter. The movie is about a mobster from Miami, Chili Palmer, who ends up in Los Angeles. After meeting a movie producer named Harry Zimm (Gene Hackman) he gets interested in the movie business. This is the main story, but this movie is based on an Elmore Leonard story so there are a lot of sub-plots with lots of interesting characters, all with great dialogue.Besides Chili Palmer and Harry Zimm we meet Karen Flores (Rene Russo), an actress known for her screaming, Martin Weir (Danny DeVito) who is the hot actor of the moment, Ray Bones (Dennis Farina) who wants to collect some money that Chili has, Bo Catlett (Delroy Lindo) who wants money fro Harry Zimm, Bear (James Gandolfini) who was a stuntman but now is Bo's bodyguard, Leo Devoe (David Paymer) who stole the money that brought Chili to Los Angeles and Doris (Bette Midler). All characters are colorful, have great dialogue and an interesting part in the story, but all those great things are there together with Chili. For every nice moment Travolta is present.The actors play their characters very well. Again, Travolta is great and owns the movie, but especially Farina and Hackman do a great job as well. The movie is well directed by Barry Sonnenfeld (from 'The Addams Family'), knowing how to avoid boring moments. The story with its dialogue would be enough to make a nice movie out of it.

It is a beautiful thing to watch him flake his way through power-brokering scenes, while all those around him cringe & roll their eyes. A few scenes really sell it; the acting lesson with Danny DeVito. The ""It's the Cadillac of mini-vans."" line. etc. Structurally it's a lot of fun.

It didn't get old then and it's still fun to watch him come alive in a well-written movie. He's perfectly fine as Chili Palmer.What didn't work so well? I thought the plot-line got too confused in who swiped what money from who, the myriad relationships and etc all doubling back amongst themselves. That loopy kind of plot line gets tired, quickly.Delroy Lindo was solid as the baddie, Gandolfini as 'Bear' shows promise, Rene Russo plays herself rather well, DeVito apes DeNiro/Hoffman, Hackman is somewhat mis-cast as a Roger Cormen-ish genre directer. Dennis Farina was dead-on as the Goodfellah out to get his.I liked the Harvey Keitel cameo at the end too-that was funny.I'm giving it about 2.5 outta ****, I think it's worth watching but don't be fooled, it's not a classic and you will note it's pretty dated.",Get Shorty
53,PredragReviews,"""Look at me, hey, look at me.....""",8,7 May 2016,"Through the course of the movie, parallels are drawn that depict the Hollywood work ethic as being similar to the type of mob work Chili is involved with. These amusing comparisons play themselves throughout the film, with classically stereotyped roles by an outstanding cast that range from the slimy director/producer to the Colombian drug-lord. In fact, it is the characters and the dialogue between these characters that make the movie outstanding. There is Chili Palmer (John Travolta), arguably one of the last true gangsters in the old tradition, whose speech and actions are undeniably cool and cutting. As a contrast to Chili, there is his boss, Ray Bones (Dennis Farina), who is a curt, abrasive character that is always looking for a way to one-up whoever he is dealing with. He is the type of person that wields more power than he actually possesses, creating several memorable scenes between his laughable character and Chili's perpetual coolness. Then there is the slimy director, Harry Zimm (Gene Hackman), a second rate director of B horror movies, whose interactions with Chili show us a less professional view of Hollywood. There is also the pompous, egocentric actor Martin Weir (Danny De Vito), who makes us laugh at the lifestyle of the Hollywood star. All of the characters in Get Shorty show us an amusing side of Hollywood that is simultaneously paying homage to and poking fun at movies.There are two problems with this movie. While I did find the storyline entertaining, I did find it extremely confusing to keep up with the specific ""details"" of the story - namely who is who and who did what. Perhaps this traces back to the original Elmore Leonard novel for which this book is based on. I usually prefer my films at a ""simpler"" level - and I think that would have helped this story. The other problem is that I found the ending to be weak. While I think this movie does a very good job at not ""dragging out"" the ending, I ultimately found the ending a bit anti-climatic. It was an ultimate let-down to a movie that despite the confusing ""details"" of the plot, does provide an entertaining edge. All in all, this is a very well made movie. The actors are wonderful, the homage paid to prior films of it's ilk are subtle, yet, crafted skillfully, and the cinematography and music perfectly compliment the film flow and style.Overall rating: 8 out of 10.",Get Shorty

55,seymourblack-1,"Punchy Dialogue, Eccentric Characters & Lots of Laughs",9,8 August 2016,"Crime, comedy and action are brilliantly blended together in this fine thriller that has a lot of fun, mainly at the expense of Hollywood's movie makers. Its complicated plot illustrates how easily a mobster adjusts to the world of movies where, for obvious reasons, he instinctively anticipates the kinds of problems that an aspiring producer might encounter. His story is littered with numerous subplots that are richly entertaining and a variety of characters whose eccentricities are a great source of dark humour. What really illuminates the whole undertaking though, is its punchy dialogue that's witty, sharp and full of wisecracks.Miami loan shark, Chili Palmer (John Travolta) is instructed by Mafia boss Ray ""Bones"" Barboni (Dennis Farina) to track down a local dry cleaner who tried to avoid repaying a hefty loan by faking his own death. After speaking to the dry cleaner's wife, Chili establishes that Leo Devoe (David Paymer) is actually still alive and has gone to Las Vegas. In Vegas, a casino boss confirms that Leo had been there but had since moved on to Los Angeles. Knowing that Chili's next stop would be L.A., the casino boss then hires him to recover $150,000 that he's owed by a Hollywood movie producer who ran out on his debt after a recent gambling session.Chili breaks into the house where B-movie producer Harry Zimm (Gene Hackman) is in bed with his girlfriend Karen Flores (Rene Russo) and watches TV until Zimm comes downstairs to investigate. During their conversation, Zimm agrees to repay his gambling debt within a reasonable time and Chili, who's a film buff, pitches a story for a movie that's based on Leo Devoe's exploits. Zimm doesn't believe the story would have enough commercial appeal but has another script called ""Mr Lovejoy"" which is so good that if made and released, could elevate him to the A-list of producers. Chili is desperate to be a part of the project and so offers to help Zimm by relieving the pressure he's under from his creditors and helping with his efforts to get top film star Martin Weir (Danny DeVito) on board. Karen is an actress who's featured in a number of Zimm's monster movies but more importantly, as Weir's ex-wife, she comes in useful for helping to get him involved.Things seem to be going well when Weir makes it clear that he's favourably impressed by the script because his involvement would make it relatively easy to attract the $500,000 investment that would be needed to make the movie. Problems arise, however, when Ray Barboni comes to L.A. to recover the money he's owed by Devoe and volatile drug dealer Bo Catlett (Delroy Lindo) also arrives to collect the $200,000 he invested with Zimm to make a movie which never went into production because Zimm gambled the cash away in Las Vegas.The star-studded cast of ""Get Shorty"" bring huge energy, flair and colour to the wonderful characters that they play and deliver their fast-talking dialogue with great panache. Danny DeVito (as the title's Shorty), Dennis Farina, Gene Hackman and Delroy Lindo all stand out in their roles but John Travolta ultimately carries the movie because his special combination of toughness, coolness and charm makes Chili Palmer both believable and immensely likable. Director Barry Sonnenfeld also deserves great credit for bringing such clarity and pace to a plot which is both complex and character-heavy.",Get Shorty

Dark humor and richly textured characters drive this story of Chili Palmer (John Travolta), the shylock from Miami Beach who aspires to a life beyond keeping a book for thugs, in this faithful adaptation of the Elmore Leonard novel.  When circumstances take him to Las Vegas to look for one Leo Devoe (David Paymer), a dry-cleaner in debt up to his eyeballs who blew town after an airline scam, Chili goes on to Hollywood to do a favor for the casino operator who tipped him off as to Leo's whereabouts.  The `favor' is contacting film director Harry Zimm (Gene Hackman) who has payment overdue on a note issued to him by the casino.  Zimm has made a name for himself (at least in his own mind) by directing horror movies; but he's not the sharpest tool in the shed.  Ultimately, Chili gets involved with Zimm and actress Karen Flores (Rene Russo), who has starred in some of Zimm's horror flicks, as well as with two time Academy Award nominee Martin Weir (Danny DeVito), the `shorty' of the title.  Chili is finally in his element, but his Miami Beach days are not yet behind him; there's still some settling up to do according to one Ray `Bones' Barboni (Dennis Farina), owner of the book kept by Chili in Florida. 	Travolta not only goes the distance here, but creates a definitive character in Chili; even as Sean Connery is James Bond, and Basil Rathbone is Sherlock Holmes, Travolta `is' Chili Palmer.  With nuance and charisma, he does this guy from the inside out.  He has the look and the mannerisms; he walks the walk and talks the talk.  And nobody in the history of the cinema has used a cigarette as a prop better than he does in this movie. It's a commanding, Oscar-worthy performance, every bit as good (possibly even better) than the role of Vincent he created in `Pulp Fiction.'  His presence simply dominates the film, and he's up against some stiff competition, because this movie is filled with great characters.  Not only Hackman, who does a terrific job as Zimm, but Russo, who sizzles, and DeVito, who adds some real flair as the `Movie Star,' and Farina, whose toughness and lack of wit make him a memorable character.  Also exceptional are Delroy Lindo, as Bo Catlett, a thug and wanna-be movie producer, James Gandolfini, as `Bear,' a stuntman who works with Catlett, and Jon Gries as Ronnie, a `Hollywood' style tough guy who also works with Catlett. 	Sonnenfeld did a great job of bringing this world of `Get Shorty' to life. The story is interesting and delivered with outstanding dialogue and plenty of action, all of which Sonnenfeld keeps moving at a perfect pace and with impeccable timing.  This is one thoroughly enjoyable, funny movie that absolutely begs for a sequel.  In recommending it, I have to borrow one of Chili Palmer's best lines:  `Look at me.'  Because that says it all.  This is one movie you don't want to miss.  I rate this one 10/10.",Get Shorty

But still seems to lampoon it's own industry with ridiculous situations and quirky characters.Deriving from a novel, the plot is one filled with dozens of turns and developments and while it's not dull, it's so energetic that you have to really work to keep up with it before it completely escapes your interest.I've never read the book so I can't if the movie's style is extracted from Elmore Leonard, but it's almost like a cross between Coen brothers and Tarantino and offers the same things they do: characters, comedy and panache.",Get Shorty
60,RJBurke1942,An engaging caper movie that also satirizes the Hollywood scene,8,25 May 2007,"I saw this movie in 1995 when first released, but never got around to thinking about a review until I saw it again a few weeks back on late night TV. I'd forgotten just how good it is...From a novel by Elmore Leonard, this story is arguably the best satire about the Hollywood dream factory yet done, for two reasons: it savagely exposes and lampoons the behaviors of actors, writers, producers and directors and it implicitly compares that business with the business of small time hoodlums and loan sharks. So many times during this story does Chili Palmer (John Travolta) announce, in a bemused fashion: ""I can't believe how youse guys do business out here..."" Chili, as we learn very early, is a loan shark from Miami who is ordered by Bones (Dennis Farina), his new boss, to recover a $15,000 debt from Leo (David Paymer), a loser with a garrulous wife, Fay (Linda Hart) who's helped Leo fake his own death on a plane crash and collect $300,000 as a settlement from the airline. Fay, of course, can't keep her mouth shut and tells Chili that Leo scammed the money and was now living it up in Vegas. Chili, in Vegas, finds out that Leo has gone to LA. But Chili also makes a score: a Vegas casino owner asks him to lean on an LA movie producer, Harry Zimm (Gene Hackman) for $150,000 still owing.So, off to La-La Land goes Chili, and that's where the fun really starts...The plot then changes direction, almost completely: Chili, after recovering most of the $300,000 from Leo (and letting him off lightly), gets involved with Harry in two ways  first, convinces him to take on Chili's own idea for a movie production and second, fend off two ""investors"" (who just happened to be drug pushers also) who want their money back from Harry who  you guessed it  is late in getting some other movie off the ground, and has spent all their money.However, those two pushy investors, Bo Catlett and Ronnie Wingate (Delroy Lindo and John Gries), have another problem: the $500,000 drug money that they can't retrieve from a locker box at LAX and which Chili sees as an opportunity to make more profit. That idea, however, is blown away when Bones  who would like nothing better than to see Chili dead -- arrives from Miami looking to muscle in on Chili's business in LA.How all that threads together into a gloriously comedic and ironic slice of Hollywood life and death is a testament to Leonard's brilliant story, a great screenplay and cinematography and tight editing  not to mention the almost flawless acting by actors who are continually taking the mickey out of the whole business, right up to the final scene.There's no doubt that this is Travolta's comeback movie. The guy just oozes dangerous cool and --- ooops  chilling competence as he maneuvers between the high and low life of a strange town, with some very strange people and even stranger business practices. But, kudos also go to Dennis Farina, Gene Hackman and Danny DeVito as the klutzes they portray; and Renee Russo is suitably decorous as Chili's love interest. Watch out for cameos from Bette Midler, Harvey Keitel and other Hollywood luminaries.And, here's the supreme self-referential irony: there really is a real Chili Palmer in the movie; he's one of the actors who has a bit part as one of Bones' buddies! What a gag...Finally, note the title: Get Shorty. That's Elmore Leonard's delicious swipe at the whole gangster genre. Remember Get Carter (1971)...? Ho-ho-HO-ho-ho! Highly recommended.",Get Shorty

62,caa821,Outstanding - from start to finish,10,1 January 2007,"Anything involving something by Elmore Leonard is generally very good, in and of itself. But when coupled with performances like those of John Travolta and Gene Hackman in this picture, the result is a superb piece of entertainment.Danny De Vito, Dennis Farina and Rene Russo all deliver outstanding performances - but all pretty much convey the types of personas, on-screen, which you'd expect from seeing their other work.However, of all actors today - young or older, new or veteran -- there are no two who are more convincing, in everything they do, than Travolta and Hackman. Serious or funny, crafty or clueless, hero or villain - - each has been completely convincing in every role, and seeing them together, one would like to see them teamed again.In this movie, both are funny, and both have their roles ""nailed:"" Travolta as the confident tough guy, completely in control; and Hackman as the ""B"" flick producer, operating on the fringe of the Hollywood scene and life in general.As much as I liked this movie, I first saw it in a St. Louis hotel suite, where we selected it from the PPV menu. I was ""fried"" from a day-long business meeting, and fell asleep early into it. The next day, my wife insisted that I catch it (she's one of those people who has perhaps only wanted to watch one or two other movies a second time, ever), and I was glad she did. It's an outstanding film, and one which entertains thoroughly from the outset to conclusion, with not a single lapse between.",Get Shorty
63,Horror-yo,"Wow, my, this is really bad !",3,23 March 2017,"Why people love it ? Because they feel acting alone is an argument as to a film's quality. Add snappy pseudo-witty dialog, the criminal mob type environment, and as mentioned a good cast of actors and voila. Easy.But really, here's the thing. Relying entirely on the complicated network that is the plot alone, does not make for an effectively good story, or film. Picking up a piece of paper and writing a bunch of different vapid characters with different arbitrary incentives and mixing them all up together without any ultimate moral or any genuine meaning, does not make you a story-writing genius. At all.Structurally, this film is random, the scenes interchangeable. The events just pile on, and yet it feels so immensely linear and uneventful. It's like the film is so dead, and drags on, no action could possibly finally get it going ! It's boring to death, and it never finally picks up.The details are often stupid, and the film relies A LOT on totally convenient details to move on at all. The naivety of a character, the stupidity of another...this is just gratuitous mob-comedy like it was written by amateurs or something.This is more of the same: random tough guy talk, redundant scenes like the guy secretly waiting in the dark at someone's place, the remote killing that makes little to no sense, relying on a character's very particular reaction...And in such films, as the viewer you at least have something big to look forward to at the end, like a twist or a big prize or something special that catches you off-guard and puts the whole picture into perspective... here, nothing.

I felt there were too many Hollywood in-jokes and the acting (and these are good actors, so I'm sure this was deliberate) played their roles without a lot of tension. So the suspense sort of fizzled.That would all have been OK if a lot of stuff was blowing up. I am an action movie buff, first and foremost. But it was only OK.Who should see this film:-- Drama types who are closet action buffs and don't wantanyone to know-- Action movie buffs on a rainy day with nothing better to doand only if you'll ""get it"" about HollywoodI'll give ""Get Shorty"" a 5 out of 10.",Get Shorty
65,SkullScreamerReturns,I couldn't stop smiling!,8,28 September 2021,"Before we get to the actual movie I want to tell you some background stories about why I wanted to see this movie. First of all, I remember when it was new but I was probably too young to see it and wouldn't have cared anyway. But I remember seeing a tv commercial and that was probably the first time ever I heard the name Gene Hackman. But I first thought it's spelled Jim Pacman. Haha.A couple of years later I downloaded a video clip with the late 90s slow internet connection. It was ""sexy.mov"" or maybe mpg or whatever format but the video's name was just ""sexy"" and I didn't know what it is. But my teenage brain wanted to know. I was disappointed to learn that it was Get Shorty trailer in a very low picture quality. I thought: well, that's a genius marketing strategy. Name your trailer as sexy, and every teen guy will download it. Its lines got stuck into my head: Get Travolta! Get Russo! Get Hackman!Now, some 20 years later I finally watched the movie. Just because I want to see every movie I had even a slight interest when I was younger. And it was great! Though I probably wouldn't have understood its charm when I was younger.I don't know how to describe the mood of the film. The only word I came up with is: ""groovy"". It's a comedy but not relying on typical jokes. It's more about some overall funny vibe that is almost constant. Maybe it's the great cast, especially Travolta is excellent in the lead role. The only other movie that I remember having at least a little similarly funny tone was ""The Big Lebowski"". There's also some similarity to Tarantino's lighter moments like ""Jackie Brown"".At times the dialogue was so fast that I had to concentrate to follow what's going on. But I was a bit tired, so I don't blame the movie for that.It's a very good and quite original crime comedy. Probably not everybody's cup of tea but I recommend checking it out.",Get Shorty

68,mhasheider,A very cunning and wickedly funny movie.,9,1 November 2000,"Watching ""Get Shorty"" reminded me of ""Midnight Run"", the two differences is the film's length and pace.    The film is based on a novel by Elmore Leonard and it's wonderfully adapted into the screenplay by Scott Frank and is directed by Barry Sonnefeld.    It's a great tale of Chili Palmer (John Travolta in a great performance), a patient mob enforcer who is sent to Las Vegas to collect a debt from a deadbeat who faked his death.  Then Chili is sent to L.A. to collect another debt from a B-movie producer Harry Zimm (Gene Hackman), who's living on hard times.  Once he's in L.A., Chili tells Harry that he wants to make a movie.    After that scene, the rest of the film goes in a patient pace as Chilli and Harry get help from B-movie legend Karen Flores (Rene Russo) and big-time movie star Martin Weir (Danny DeVito) while Chili deals an old mob rival, Ray Barboni (Dennis Farina) and Bo  Catlett (Delroy Lindo).   The film's cinematography is great as Sonnefeld's direction of the film.    Besides Travolta, Hackman, DeVito, Russo, Lindo, and Farina also give very good supporting performances.     Harvey Keitel and Bette Midler also appear in the movie uncredited.",Get Shorty
69,higherall7,Shorty goes to Hollywood...,7,29 April 2021,"This movie has a cool poster like THE LEGEND OF NIGGER CHARLEY (1972). Curiously enough, the lead character, Chili Palmer instinctively follows the Three Laws of Fred Williamson. That being, he has to win the fight, you can't kill him, and he has to get the girl in the end. Here we have Travolta surfing the wave of success that was PULP FICTION (1994), for a second turn at bat as a mobster with a heart of gold. That's Hollywood gold, for you suckers who didn't get the producers memo, and even here Travolta hits one out of the park with the assurance of one now completely comfortable and secure in his superstar persona.The production values being a few levels above the debut of Williamson as an action hero in his Blaxsploitation flick, this film is a comedy of shifty characters involved in the usual business of pulling a fast one on each other. But no one ever seems to get the better of Palmer, as he moves from Miami to Vegas and finally Los Angeles to tie up a few loose ends for his bosses. Whether parting the hair of his arch enemy Ray 'Bones' Barboni, as played by Dennis Farina, or showing James Gandolfini as Bear the bodyguard the way down from here, or serving as an acting coach for the actor Martin Weir, making the most of his Napoleonic complex, as played by Danny DeVito, he appears to always know where his marks are one step ahead of everybody else.Travolta has an elegance to his tough guy swagger, which in a sense likens him to Bogart. He does not have to let it all hang out in expostulation as in earlier roles. The histrionics are left in good hands with Bette Midler, David Paymer and Linda Hart. Here less is more and he can be the charming model of understatement for once. It is this charm lacquered over the makeup of a character who makes his living from the physical and psychological intimidation of others, that also makes him appear to be a family friendly version of Bella Lugosi. Lugosi in real life was an individual of tremendous presence and panache, and Travolta evokes all this without even smoking a cigar.Delroy Lindo has a great view from his balcony as Bo Catlett. He deals in drug shipments and could be considered Chili Palmer's peer. He conveys the physical and passionate strength of a John Henry as his qualification for running around with this bunch. But these days it becomes clear he allows Bear to do all his dirty work and stunts. Gene Hackman as the Hollywood Producer Harry Zimm ladles out generous portions of sleaze and can't help acting like a gangster in one of his movies even when he comes face to face with the real thing in Ray Barboni.Rene Russo is noirish as the Scream Queen of B Horror Movies Karen Flores. She also makes a smooth romantic interest and movie date for Palmer. But this is largely a tale of interpersonal relationships spiced with betrayal and one-upmanship and just a tap and a taste and a touch of larceny and the rough stuff. Barry Sonnenfeld the director keeps it light, but sometimes you need a flow-chart to keep up with all the unraveling complications. The musical score by John Lurie helps the viewer to go with the flow even when you can't nail down all the details even with a scorecard. Like the poster, everybody is copping a pose to be cool, but not everyone gets to ride the Cadillac of mini-vans in the end. When Penny Marshall finally yells ""Cut!"" on this fusion of reality and fantasy for fun, we discover that in the world of Chili Palmer crime really does pay once you have the right agent.",Get Shorty
70,ThomasColquith,Sort of good,7,15 October 2021,"""Get Shorty"" is a well made film with nice camera work and John Travolta is great -- he makes this movie. All of the other actors sort of play their usual typecast roles. It is entertaining and sometimes mildly amusing and shrewdly stops short of becoming too offensive. For those positives I will give it a 7/10 rating, but there are several negatives which make this a film that I will not revisit anytime soon. First, I dislike movies about making movies, they always become too meta and self-referential. A lot of the material feels too narrow-minded, like it's a lot of inside jokes for people from such depicted lifestyles, as if it were written by and for the entertainment of such people. As I have nothing in common with the people and storyline I felt unable to relate to it, but that can be said for most movies, however ""Get Shorty"" is one of those movies where the viewer is keenly aware of the fact that he is indeed watching a movie, they do not get lost in the drama, being caught up in the fictional universe. That is a big flaw for any movie, one which keeps it from being great.",Get Shorty

The loose plot of movie w/in a movie was too weak and tried to do too little with too much. The actors seemed like they were phoning it in. Devito & Hackman & the guy that played Leo were pretty funny, but nothing special. Russo was just there as the one-dimensional ""girl"". Travolta's a brainwashed cultist (Scientology) who had basically one line ""look at me"". so I just tried to pretend he's not in the film.

I just kept thinking, OK, stereotype of mob guy, stereotype of Hollywood, stereotype.... where's the humor?I've seen a lot worse so I won't say avoid....

72,buzznzipp1995,Elmore Leonard's Favorite adaptation,10,12 September 2006,"After hearing, I can see instantly why this is the author, Elmore Leonard's favorite movie adaptation from his writing. First of all John Travolta was a solid-standard, as Chili. If you're a Travolta fan, this is an instant classic performance for him!! He personifies East coast attitude and 'M.O'. His breeze onto the scene and in control persona are a part of this movie that would have collapsed it, had it not been an ingredient in this mix of action, sarcasm and loan-sharking gone amok. Chili is superior. Gene Hackman, is an attempted to be cool, b-movie director, who hasn't had a hit in years, and you can feel it. Gene's man Harry is so played-right it's embarrassing. I know people that are like that. I was laughing till it hurt, from the familiar pain, of the ones who reminded me of the great Harry Zimm. Hackman is astounding.Before there was the Sopranos there was {James Gandolfini as} 'Bear' Bo's handy-man, his fix-it guy all around. Bear reminds me (sort of) one of my cousins. Ha, take that home with ya in a doggy bag!Danny Devito, is a great self-conscious (and to others feelings) selfish and unconscious, totally absorbed actor, who is about the way it is with many of the actor types, who let it go too far. Danny is the man!Rene Russo is the lovely, Karen Flores of course and she is as pretty in pictures as in 'Real' life. I got to meet her in 1992, and got a really great hug from her, she's very thoughtful and talented, with much more talent to follow after this great film.The way the story was set up and progressed with, makes me love this and puts it in a special place in my entertainment library. This is a fun 'You gotta see it and experience the mood and all the other emotions that follow' type of movie madness that makes watching some movies, very worthwhile. This is a high rater!!!

Pulp Fiction was a smash hit, and studios were quick to pounce on both the style and the star.In short - this is the best film that Tarantino never directed. His style is emulated almost to the point of plagiarism by Barry Sonnenfeld (although in a much less violent way), but this works to the film's advantage as what we end up with is a smart, sharp, and witty movie about the seedy side of Hollywood.Travolta is on fire, as is the rest of the cast, and they all work wonders with the great script. Gene Hackman, Danny DeVito, and Rene Russo play off each other like the pros they are, and their screen presence adds more fuel to already sizzling dialogue.A gem of a movie and no mistake.",Get Shorty
74,oshram-3,Far better than the book it's based on,7,2 March 2005,"I can't believe this movie came out ten years ago. It doesn't seem that old, and it certainly doesn't play that old. I think the reason I never went to see it in the first place is that while I really like Elmore Leonard, I had read the book, and frankly, the book stinks. Knowing that most bad books make worse movies, I stayed away from the film, forgetting that in fact sometimes weak books translate pretty well up on the screen (such as Sharkey's Machine).Shorty follows the story of Chili Palmer (John Travolta), a mob tough from Miami who gets involved in the movie business almost by accident. Along the way he hooks up with an over the hill director, Harry Zimm (Gene Hackman) and his ex, Karen Flores (Rene Russo). Chili ends up insinuating himself in Hollywood and becoming a major player - but not without a few bumps along the way, most of them provided by local thug Bo Catlett (Delroy Lindo) and an old Miami rival, Ray Barboni (the ever-terrific Dennis Farina).While the entire cast gives pretty good performances (including Danny Devito as a self-obsessed movie star, Martin Weir), the movie really rests on Travolta's shoulders. While I don't consider Travolta one of the great actors of our time, I do feel when he is particularly suited for a role, he shines. Chili was tailor-made for him and he seems so comfortable in the role he makes it look effortless. Only Farina's dopey, almost parodic mobster comes close to stealing any thunder away from Travolta, but the big man is so at home at the center of this film that he's just a joy to watch.Shorty has quite a few really good laughs in it as well, from Chili's manhandling of the local muscle to his one liners to a great scene where the weak-willed Zimm tries to act tough over the phone. Farina is always a source of merriment and Leonard's patented brand of cynical ironic humor shines through here far better than it came across in the book.Get Shorty is worth a look again, not only because they've released a mondo edition with extras (not the version I saw), but because a sequel, Be Cool, is due out soon, and if it's even half as good as this movie was, it should be worth your $7.50 at the metroplex.",Get Shorty
75,noizyme,Travolta is a great mobster,6,8 March 2005,"John Travolta really made this a great dark-comedy work. Usually I don't like his over-the-top seriousness when he likes to get serious, but in this movie he's (ha!) getting shorty...whatever...let me move on.Get Shorty is the title of Travolta's made-up film about his connections in the mafias around town. He gets to this point through a shady deal with some other mobsters to come up with some cash to pay them back after the leader goes down...that was my recollection. Honestly I wasn't able to follow this plot because the film was kind of always transforming and adding characters in from nowhere, and you weren't sure if you should pay attention to one set of people or the next. It's a dark-comedy because it's not really totally humorous, but it has a light tone throughout the film even when there's dying and serious moments.Travolta was a pretty good mobster in this film, I must say, and the rest of the cast did equally great jobs...especially Danny DeVito's performance of trying to get the right face down for his job as a Hollywood actor turned ""mobster."" The film was a great idea to transition someone like Chili Palmer (Travolta's character) from a mobster to a movie exec.I gave it a 6/10, though because everything stopped making total sense for me, and I had a hard time following the plot. I enjoyed the performances, though. I would definitely rent it before buying it, or going to see its new sequel ""Be Cool.""",Get Shorty
76,TheMovieDoctorful,Travolta's Best! Hail to the King!,10,29 September 2020,"There's no way to get around it, John Travolta has become a meme. From his soft hearted assassin in Pulp Fiction to his Nu Metal alien in Battlefield Earth. From his genderbent 50s mom in Hairspray, to his lock jawed gangster in Gotti. He's a Hollywood personality we love to snicker with and at. That being said, it's very important to remember that none of this is due to a lack of a talent. Much like Nicolas Cage, Travolta is an actor with so much oozing personality that it can truly consume the role, the scenery, even the entire film if a director doesn't know exactly what they want from him. Enter Get Shorty, Travolta's finest performance in an illustrious, highly accomplished career.Barry Sonnenfeld's outstanding direction has a lot to do with that. Sonnenfeld has always such a charming, hyperbolic comic style to his films, an exaggerated and cartoony truth that can be seen in the first Men in Black as well as his Addams Family adaptation. Get Shorty sees that style at its best and most refined, a colorful, slick pulp film combining the best aspects of 90s indie cinema with vintage throwback. That smooth, sexy, Jazz musical score and poppy, colorful 90s film filter are just so satisfying. The role of Chili Palmer, the cool and confident eccentric who's strange and sincere enough to feel relatable and aspirational despite his larger than life persona, was tailor made for Travolta. He gets to flex that wonderful charisma and natural weirdo likability while always seeming clear, focused and consistent in his character; a stubborn, wisecracking movie buff looking for a second chance and riding on a winning smile and assuring tone.It's not just Travolta that shines, however. Gene Hackman gives a career best performance here as well in a role much more submissive, meek and diminutive than the forceful, dominant roles that the actor usually takes on. His Harry Zimm is perhaps the funniest part of the entire film, think Ed Wood through the lens of the Coen brothers and you get a pretty solid idea of his performance. It's almost a shame we haven't seen him take similar awkward and dorky roles since.""Second chance in Hollywood"" stories are rather hit-or-miss, especially with such a ludicrously impressive main character, but the uncommon moments of authenticity found in Get Shorty in regards to both the dangerous, risky, high stakes world surrounding Chili and the character's slow unraveling into someone of genuine humility and grounded nature truly elevates it above the pack.1995 was a killer year for movies and Get Shorty was one of its absolute best films.

78,DanB-4,"Well written, fun movie",9,14 August 2001,"This is a great movie. It sealed John Travolta's comeback (although he really has made many dogs since) and is unique, fast-paced and funny.When you look around the IMDb and see how many countless directors there are, you get a sort of empathy for Harry Zimm, the low-life horror director at the centre of the movie. Gene Hackman shows true acting genius by portraying this hackneyed drek-meister with dreams of winning an Oscar - making a movie that crosses him into legitimate Hollywood if such a thing exists. At the other end is Martin Weir, an A-list actor played by Danny DeVito, who Hackman wants to star in his film. An ego-maniac of epic nature, Weir wants another Oscar nomination and another hit film, but at the same time barks out lines that leave you unconvinced he cares about his craft.Then there is Bo, the loan shark who wants money from Harry - money that Harry took to Vegas and lost - Money that Harry hoped to use to buy the script to make the film that would star Martin.This connects them all to Chili Palmer, a mob enforcer who comes to collect the Vegas debt from Harry and gets caught up in all these people lives. Chili loves movies and sees his meet-and-greet with Harry as his big break.Travolta plays Chili with an aloof confident swagger, short on words an big on presence. His immediate acceptance by folks like Weir reminds me of Being There - if you act in a certain way, people will simply make judgements about you that in turn enter a room before you do.Get Shorty's movie-within-a-movie plot may seem confusing, but it is enjoyable and very watchable. Every role is played perfectly, most notably Dennis Farina as the foul-mouthed angry mob underboss who can't keep his underling Chili in Line. Also watch the role of Bear, played by the theretofore relatively unknown James Galdofini.I highly recommend this film, especially if you liked The Player.

I grew up in Brooklyn and have had many experiences with people who were ""in the mob"". Many people have played very good tough guys in the movies, but Travolta's performance was the best I have ever seen. Gene Hackman was great. Without him this would have been a good movie, but he made it a great movie. Harry Zimm is one of the all time great movie characters and he fit like a glove with Travolta. Rene Russo and Danny DeVito also gave great performances but Dennis Farina, Delroy Lindo, and James Gandolfini gave the best performances of their lives.

It's quite a twist to see Gene Hackman playing a wimpish producer, but he shows he has a flair for comedy...and that's what this film is...comedy, and a lot of fun. Travolta is a real control freak in this one, but gets caught off the mark at one or two critical points. But with ""Wise-Guy"" bravado, he navigates his way through the likes of Dennis Farina, Delroy Lindo, and Mike Gandolfini among others. The switch from juicing and loan sharking to movies comes about as quite natural for him, though he does have issues to settle before he can nestle in to his newly found occupation. I only recently saw the movie (2010), and I always thought that it was called ""Get Shorty"" on account of the presence of the diminutive DeVito...but that is not the case. The title must be an ""inside joke"" to some in the industry, but it threw me for a loop, and I determined I did not care to watch it.

86,MadReviewer,"Sharp, Smart, and Hilarious",8,9 May 2001,"The running joke throughout `Get Shorty' is that there's virtually no difference between Hollywood and the Mafia.  Both places involve lying, cheating, threatening, and constantly dealing with lowlifes in order to get ahead.  It's no surprise, then (although it's certainly funny) that a formerly `connected' loan shark and legbreaker becomes an overnight Hollywood success story.The loan shark in question is one Chili Palmer (John Travolta), a tough guy with a passion for movies who's sent to Hollywood to chase down a guy named Leo (David Paymer), who owes the Mob a lot of money.  While in Hollywood, Chili decides he's no different from the rest of the Hollywood moguls, and starts putting in motion an idea for a film  the story of a loan shark hunting down a guy in Hollywood.  Real life and fiction start blending in seamlessly with each other, as Chili starts pushing other people's buttons to see how he can improve the `story' for his movie.`Get Shorty', which is faithfully based on the Elmore Leonard novel of the same name, is a film that crackles along at a good pace, moving along and weaving together a half-dozen entertaining subplots with incredible ease. The characters and the dialogue make the film great as well  `Get Shorty' is a comedy, but while the characters say a lot of funny things, they treat each other and the events of the film quite seriously.  Also, the dialogue's so good, it can been savored like a fine wine.  (Example:  `How'd you get in my hotel room?' Chili Palmer says at one point to mob lieutenant Ray `Bones' Barboni (Dennis Farina).  `It was easy,' says Bones.  `I told the front desk that I was you, and I lost my keys.  I acted real stupid and they believed me.')  Sharp tongues rule in `Get Shorty', but those tongues have a lot more to say than just acid wit  Palmer's relationship with the actress Karen Flores (Rene Russo), for example, blossoms into something quite sweet after an initially rocky start.Travolta's terrific as Chili Palmer, putting together the right mix of laid-back coolness and serious intensity.  It's funny to watch other characters treat his threats as a joke  ironically, Chili Palmer's probably the most honest person in the film, even though he's the one considered the criminal.  Gene Hackman is also quite good as Harry Zimm, the Roger Corman-esque producer of B-movies who likes to consider himself a Hollywood power broker, even though he's not.  The one weak link in the cast is probably Danny DeVito as the Hollywood mega-star Martin Weir  it's not so much DeVito's performance so much as he's simply miscast.  Martin Weir is supposed to be this all-powerful movie star (and a short one at that  hence, `Get Shorty'), but he never really exudes the magnetism or charisma that Weir's supposed to have.  It would've been interesting if a real Hollywood star could've been convince to play `himself' in place of the Martin Weir character (a la John Malkovich in `Being John Malkovich')  Bruce Willis or Tom Cruise might have made interesting alternatives.With its great characters, razor wit and out-and-out laid-back charm, `Get Shorty' is a fantastic, funny film (and one of John Travolta's best).  Go watch it!  Grade: A-",Get Shorty

88,treadwaywrites,Not Short On Goodness,8,28 March 2009,"Sometimes all you have left to play is attitude. With a lot more than attitude to play, this film starts with attitude, stirs in some laughs and then adds quite a lot of good actors. Based on the novel by Elmore Leonard, Get Shorty is a delightful, well written, smart film with loads of plots twists. The pace is deliberate and the character studies are fun and well thought out. The character study for John Travolta comes one year after his comeback role in Pulp Fiction with Quintin Tarentino.The main character is Chili Palmer (John Travolta) who works as as loan shark and part of a group of mobsters out in Miami. Chili has become tired of his mob life and when a job comes to him that enables him to perhaps go to L.A. and try another line of work, he seizes the chance. There Chili meets up with B-movie mogul, Harry Zimm (Gene Hackman) who owes quite a considerable debt.. Zimm agrees to help Chili get a project off the ground with the help of his girlfriend, Karen (Rene Russo) and they suggest casting academy award nominee Martin Weir (Danny DeVito), while Chili also tries to get his immediate job finished. Director Barry Sonnenfeld provides a film that takes the idea of loving movies and its tongue-in-cheek gangster characters in stride as if that idea is simply a starting off point. He doesn't rely on conventional clichés of the criminal underworld and tells this search for a new career in a refreshing new light. Even when the characters are not the most likable they are still very entertaining. The added bonus that Chili is such a movie fan makes him doubly likable in the film.This film is a totally character driven film and everything in the film is for the characters. The combination of John Travolta (won Golden Globe, Best Actor), Barry Sonnenfeld and Elmore Leonard's words are a wonderful ebb and flow of comedy and drama. There are some terrific L.A. spots and locations that are also highlighted. The location which is also my favorite movie mogul office of all time is Harry Zimm's office.",Get Shorty
89,CWP-,"Funny, smart, satisfying comedy.",8,27 September 1999,"My Age: 13Chili Palmer, played by John Travolta, is a Miami mobster.  His boss, Momo, dies from a heart attack, and his new boss becomes Ray ""Bones"" Barboni, played by Dennis Farina, whom he doesn't like.  Bones sends him to a casino in Vegas, where they tell him to collect a debt from low-budget horror-film producer Harry Zimm, played by Gene Hackman.  Chili gets swept up by the whole movie business, and tries to get shorty, Martin Weir, played by Danny de Vito, in a new Harry Zimm film, with the help of Karen Flores, played by Rene Russo, the leading lady in most of Harry Zimm's horror films.  There is also the matter of the money in a locker, which Harry could use for his next film.  But not everyone in Hollywood is nice.  Chili soon meets Bo Catlett (the money in the locker is his), played by Delroy Lindo, and his band of cronies, who are sponsoring Harry's next production, and Bones is back in town.Get Shorty is a very satisfying comedy.  It is funny, it is smart, it isn't too complicated.  The acting in the film is great.  John Travolta is very good in his Golden-Globe winning performance as Chili Palmer, and Gene Hackman, Danny de Vito, Rene Russo, Delroy Lindo and Dennis Farina are all good also.  It is based on an Elmore Leonard novel, so you can be sure that there are interesting characters, which there are, just like in Out of Sight.

91,dragonshield,"Great characters, simply a good comedy with a waterproof plot",7,19 May 2007,"""Get Shorty"" is a celebration of that usual Barry Sonnenfeld style of film making. Great characters, done by a great cast including John Travolta, Gene Hackman, Rene Russo, Danny DeVito, Dennis Farina, Delroy Lindo and.. Well the list just goes on and on. A perfect mix-up of that so called ""character-comedy"", a movie progressing and dependant on the characters, making it hilarious comedy chaos.The best thing about this film is obviously the whole cast, John Travolta as the smooth bad ass Chili Palmer, Gene Hackman as the hectic Harry Zimm. A bit unusual role from Hackman, which also makes the character so hilariously surreal. Rene Russo as ""the girl"" Karen Flores, Danny DeVito as the movie star Martin Weir with a huge ego, Dennis Farina as the loud mouth usual himself Ray 'Bones' Barboni. Delroy Lindo as the tough Bo Catlett and James Gandolfini as Bo's bodyguard, failed stuntman Bear. Everyone just simply click together, which makes the movie even better than it actually is. It's just all about the characters. Chili Palmer must be one of the coolest characters ever seen on the big screen.Like mentioned before, Barry Sonnenfeld is the director of the movie and I honestly can't imagine anyone else directing a movie with a screenplay like this except Steven Soderbergh, the director of for example both ""Ocean's Eleven"" and ""Ocean's Twelve"". I think that Sonnenfeld's and Soderbergh's styles connect together, they are very similar. And if they'd do a British version of the movie, the director would be Guy Ritchie without a doubt. If you recognised both Soderbergh and Ritchie, then you know the style I'm talking about and if you like both of their movies you should see ""Get Shorty"". The other thing similar between these three directors besides the directing is the music used in their films. It's that usual horns and trumpets, giving that funky and exciting feeling for the film. It just fits for movies like these, creating that what is needed for the style. It also connects with the cinematography as well; Sudden movements of the angles, sudden stops, shots really close of the faces in these specific angles and when you add the music to that it's voilá.""Get Shorty"" is all in all a great comedy with a plot that doesn't go over the silliness level. Sometimes movies like these go over that level, which usually make them funnier but also makes the whole story so unbelievable that it just isn't enjoyable as a movie anymore. Well the movie itself isn't THAT serious, it's a comedy after all, but it's definitely some quality entertainment. It includes a nice storyline, great characters and directing that just doesn't let you down. I recommend this movie to everyone once again. It's not amazing or phenomenal, it's a nice piece of entertainment, keeping you glued to your sofa throughout. What more can you ask for a boring Friday evening?",Get Shorty
92,fullonrobotchubby,Very entertaining (if you forget the toxic sequel ever happened),8,15 August 2006,"Get Shorty is a pretty pleasing film as long as you stay clear of its poisonous sequel that came out last year, Be Cool. That being said, in the first film, John Travolta's character Chili Palmer, a loan shark for the mob who's a huge movie buff at heart (How can I resist that?), is a classic character with all the right moves. Palmer is sent to Hollywood to do what he does best and gets wrapped up in the showbiz while he tends to his business. He meets a lovely leading lady (Rene Russo) he already admires and tries to get his own film made with the help of a monster movie director (Gene Hackman, who I think got his acting inspiration from Wes Craven), all the while avoiding goons played by the explosive Delroy Lindo and the hilarious and fast-talking (as he is in Snatch.) Dennis Farina. My favorite scene is Lindo's gang's first encounter with the new guy in town at a two-story restaurant when pre-""Sopranos"" James Gandolfini, as a stuntman/hired-hand, takes a spill down the stairs, courtesy of Chili. Gandolfini nearly steals the show as a strong guy who turns out to most of all be a strong dad, but Travolta is having too much fun to have a movie swept from underneath him this time. Forget Be Cool ever happened, if you can; Chili Palmer and his world were best when he loved movies. Ahh, that sentence felt good to type.",Get Shorty

95,MIK7x3,Where's my money? Where's my @#$*ing money?,10,3 August 2000,"Based on the best selling novel by Elmore Leonard, ""Get Shorty"" is a movie about Hollywood society, about the underworld, but most of all, it is a movie about movies.  It parodies several facets of the motion picture industry from the B-horror movies produced by Harry Zimm (Gene Hackman), to the Hollywood star who is dwarfed by the size of his ego, in this case Martin Weir (Danny DeVito), to the underlying mob connections to the industry.  Every character contributes to the plot in a significant way, including Zimm, Chili Palmer (John Travolta), and Karen Flores (Rene Russo). Which brings us to Ray Barboni (Dennis Farina).  The jive talking, wise cracking, smooth operating tough guy from Miami is a ruthless gangster who is out to get Chili, but you can't help but like his character.  Some of his lines are among the best in the movie - after punching a woman in the face, he says ""I want us to be friends, and both you and I know that friends...don't hit each other"" - and the scene of him sitting on the toilet when the phone rings is, in my opinion, easily the most powerful in ""Get Shorty.""  Also keep an eye on the subplots involving Yayo, Momo, Bear, and Bull, not to mention the cameo appearances by Harvey Keitel, Bette Midler, and Miguel Sandoval.  It may take a couple times of watching the movie to figure out exactly what is going on, but that also means more opportunities to watch Ray Barboni torment his chauffeur about ""the smog being the reason for the beautiful sunsets.""",Get Shorty

As a further complication there is a drug dealer (Delroy Lindo) who has invested in one of Zimm's pictures. But he has gotten in trouble with his supplier for $500,000 and a missing nephew.DeVito does a wonderful job playing the self-involved, pretentious Weir.

There were good performances all around, not to mention a great script, but the end just didn't do it for me.

I'll admit, it was a great way to Barboni to get what was coming to him, but there could have been more worked in there before that whole scene transpired.

He actually manages to show that a brilliant actor needs absolutely no support but can actually sustain a movie on his own.No other actor has been able to do this, ever.",Get Shorty
114,GuitarGod75,disappointing...,5,9 February 2003,"another great book turned into a mediocre movie.  I had hopes for this one, considering the last few Elmore Leonard novels-turned-movies turned out great, but this one was a constant disappointment.  Rene Russo did a pretty good job as Karen Flores, and Travolta did ""ok"" as Chili, but other than that I think every character was mis-cast, and because of it, most of them fell flat and lacked depth.I have to recommend that you read the book, and steer clear of the movie, or check out one of the other movies based on Elmore Leonard books, like Out of Sight or Jackie Brown, both of which were much better...",Get Shorty
115,HGH-3,Some funny things happened on the way to Hollywood,8,18 February 1999,"At last it happened. A novel by Elmore Leonard made justice as a movie. It's been tried before but with more or less poor results.  (""Stick"" anyone?) The actors are absolutely perfect. Even the cameos are brilliant. The script is unusually faithful to the novel. As well as a far fetched story about petty gangsters, it manages to strike a minor blow at the superficial Hollywood lifestyle. Sonnenfeld has guided the actors and the story along in a very comforting stride. Great entertainment.",Get Shorty
116,Malko Linge,Just not good enough with so many top actors,5,17 February 2003,"It's sometimes funny, specially some dialogues. But overall it didn't really grab me. We get John Travolta, Gene Hackman, Rene Russo and even James Gandolfini (Tony Soprano with beard!) but it's just not that. OK, the plot is nicely done. With the actual movie going together with the making of the movie by Travolta and Hackman. And there are some good scenes like the one were Travolta gives Danny DeVito acting lessons in how to look mean. But mainly that's it. I think they could have done more with such a top cast. 5 out of 10.",Get Shorty

I only watched this movie because I wanted to watch every movie that the actor, The Rock, was in at the theater and he happened to be in the sequel to this movie, Be Cool, and thought that since I was going to the theater to watch Be Cool, that I might as well watch this movie, Get Shorty.Not knowing what this movie was about, I got the movie from my local public library on DVD and put it into my DVD Player. Right away, the movie got my full attention; not that many movies do. What I don't understand is what the movie title has to do with the storyline. Anyway, there is as much action as is with the movie Cradel 2 the Grave. I would highly recommend, if you enjoyed this movie, Be Cool, the sequel to this movie coming out to the theaters March 04, 2005.",Get Shorty

119,Thom-Yorke,"Funny, entertaining comedy with style.",7,11 March 2005,"Chili Palmer (John Travolta) is highly into movies. He's a super-cool guy and he always knows what to say. So through his connections he tracks down a Hollywood producer by the name of Harry Zimm (Gene Hackman), wakes him up in the middle of the night and tells him that he has an idea for a movie. That is the first time Chili sees Karen Flores (Rene Russo) and is attracted to her right away.So Chili and Harry agree on what actor they want in their movie. It is none other than the famous Martin Weir (Danny DeVito). Martin agrees with them to make this picture. Harry is still wondering if he should make this movie with his new friend, Chili, or the selfish Bo Catlett (Delroy Lindo), who wants nothing more than to get rid off Chili.However, Chili's issues aren't over, because a tough guy, Ray 'Bones' Barboni, (Dennis Farina) that's never been out of Miami is looking for him to collect his money which Leo Devoe (David Paymer) has stolen.Other supporting roles are Harvey Keitel as himself and Bear (James Gandolfini) as Bo's bodyguard.If you liked Out Of Sight and Jackie Brown, which are also novels by Elmore Leonard, you'll enjoy Get Shorty.There's lots of humor in here and some funny scenes for example: when Gene Hackman calls Dennis Farina and tries (tries a bit too hard, which is the fun part) to act tough over the phone like Chili does in real life.Overall, good cast, enjoyable movie.Rating: 7.5/10",Get Shorty
120,zenbuckaroo,Tight Script,8,30 December 2010,"In film writing seminars, they tell you to include nothing that does not advance the story. The same should hold true for a well paced novel (alhough seldom does). For Elmore Leonard the rule was gospel. You may or may not like his stories but you will never fall asleep because they are too slow. With a good solid script; great actors; competent direct and tight editing; Get Shorty moves with a speed that will not leave you any breaks to make a head call or a popcorn run. It is full of humorous anecdotes and just enough action to keep the action fans awake. Story synopsis is included in the main reviews of this movie, so I will skip that. You can get a copy to see at most of your local video stores or by ordering through netflix (not available through streaming at this time )",Get Shorty
121,vacousin,An inside joke,5,16 February 2000,"Not a bad film, but very disappointing. It plays too much like a Hollywood inside joke that not enough of the audience is in on. Travolta is his usual charming personna, but Rene Russo is badly miscast. Gene Hack seems to be having the most fun by doing a great take on schlock director Ted V Mikels, down to Ted's trademark horn necklace. I did enjoy the poster of Danny DeVito as Napoleon.",Get Shorty
122,sigmoid23,Boring violent criminal movie,5,20 June 2005,"I'm not sure who decided criminals and their deviant lives are entertaining but this movie has a lot of both. Travolta plays the cool 'shylock' a criminal loan shark who works for some mafia type criminals in Miami. There are some of the usual tough guy threats, beatings and shootings *yawn*. Travolta, as Chili Palmer, flies across the country to track down some guy and somehow ends up in LA with movie director Gene Hackman who's involved with some criminal types - drug dealers - who do some violent things and shoot some people. Travolta out-toughs them by doing some violent things, then his boss shows up and puts the director in the hospital after killing one of the bad drug dealer guys. In short, it's a pretty sick film.There are a few funny lines. Travolta says ""look at me"" about 50 times. and then the other characters start imitating him *yawn*. The plot is pretty thin, but in the end the bad guys get killed or arrested and the good guy - Chili - gets the girl and gets to make his movie.",Get Shorty

I actually HATED him seeing disastrous flicks like 'Three guys and a baby' 'Look who's talking'The director is so genius in this film. This is the best work for director Barry Sonnenfeld so far. I didn't much care for 'MIB' and stuff.I'd rank this as one of the best cool movie in my LIFE!!!I hear a sequel is coming out!!!! I hope two things. One, the sequel is as good as the original.

He plays a very amusing mobster who is serious almost all the time, but has a soft spot for movies.  The movie is witty, while maintaining the standard mob theme.  It's not quite a satire, and it's also not quite a hardcore mob movie. It's a little of both worlds, and it's a whole lot of fun.",Get Shorty

Comedy? I think I chuckled a couple of times. As usual, Gene Hackman should stay away from comedy films as he seems to pick the worst ones. Travolta tries his best with at best a ""rubbish"" script.Maybe a lot of people brainwashed themselves before seeing it and thought with the cast that it had to be good. Watch it again, nothing really happens...",Get Shorty

He makes his roles really come to life and Rene Russo and him made a great couple on the screen. John Travolta always has this toughness to his roles but at the same time this sweetness and cuteness.Get Shorty was an awesome movie and I watch it over and over again all the time. It is very funny and serious at the same time. I do recommend that you add this movie to your collection. ~Kathy,Get Shorty

Then I thought it was realistic, because I can imagine that movie producers do not always get their money from boring, wealthy investors that wear a pearl necklace or a three piece suit. But I don't think it is realistic that these cool aggressive people that become killers every once in a while, are also smart, witty and charming, especially to each other. And then I thought it was an action movie. But there aren't even any chases in the movie. You simply travel to one of the biggest cities in the USA and find the person you are looking for in his office, as if he was waiting for you. There is no suspense in this movie either. So how will I remember this movie? Maybe it's better I don't. Still I vote 6 because the actors are some of my favorites.",Get Shorty

Dennis Farina gives a short, but very funny performance as collector, John Travolta does one of his best performances, and Gene Hackmen was probably the best of everyone.

I try to channel Chili Palmer whenever I am involved in a sales pitch or business meeting. The confidence it gives me has helped my sales career immensely! ""Look at me"" ""I'm the one telling you the way it is!"" Fantastic! Hackman is great as always. When he shows up at the restaurant all bandaged up and wired shut, it always cracks me up. I've probably seen this movie 25 times at least! Gandolfini and Lindo are great together. This was my first exposure to James Gandolfini. His threatening manner in this movie must have been what first gave the producers of ""The Sopranos"" a hint that he was going to be their man.

In fact 90% of the humour in this movie is the banter between groups of people who are not happy with each other.In my opinion the funniest scene was when then movie producer, Gene Hackman, tries to pretend hes a tough mob type guy and gets a real mobster to come out and ""invest"" in his movie. This ends with the mobster beating up Gene with his own telephone. At which point a second mobster comes in to the office to harass the producer and ends up getting shot by the first mobster. The first mobster then looks down at the producer, whose head is under his shoe, and asks him not to puke on his shoe.Plenty of dramatic irony, fast dialogue, Renee Russo. Enjoy.",Get Shorty

The truth is, there may be somebody out there in the ether that truly feels in his gut that ""Freddy Got Fingered"" is pure unadulterated genius, (and that person needs to be locked up for psychiatric evaluation.)The Big Point is I get this satisfied feeling at the end of Get Shorty every time I watch it. I have the movie on VHS and DVD, and still I'll watch it on TV when I catch it on.Some have called it dark, Tarantino-esquire, witty, sharp, blah, blah blah. All it is is a Hollywood fairytale, but I like it. I treasure it. Is it Citizen Kane? No. Is it The Shawshank Redemption? No. It's the story of a mob loan shark turning into a Hollywood movie producing, and his sly adventures along the way. It has a good beginning, some humorous complication, and one of the coolest ending ever.Look at me. If you haven't seen it, see it, capishe.

Even the soundtrack -- heavy on Booker T and the MGs -- is absolutely perfect. This movie manages to do what The Player wanted to do and couldn't... expose Hollywood's dirty little secrets in a funny and intelligent manner. Chilly Palmer goes from Miami-based mob collections guy to movie producer in a way that doesn't seem as crazy as it sounds. In Get Shorty Hollywood is a town where the cool show business types drive mini-vans and anybody can write a script because the just have hire someone to ""put in the commas and stuff"". Scenes and characters flow from one to the next creating a kinetic energy that is a hallmark of Director Barry Sonnenfeld. Actors in simultaneous story lines cross paths and seem to hand the batton to one another. Dennis Farina just about steals the movie as a dimwitted mobster. In ""early discovery"" roles Delroy Lindo and James Gandolfini both show why they are now A-listers. Repeat viewings don't disappoint and, if anything, reveal even more details. Far superior to the sequel, Be Cool but I think that Elmore Leonard knew that going in. Get Shorty is brilliant and deserves a lot more attention.",Get Shorty

Travolta playing a gangster? I've seen Pulp Fiction, so I figured it will be another mind blowing piece of acting. But no, not far from it. De Vito in a gangster movie? We'll all laugh together, I'd say. Gene Hackman? The blonde hot woman named Ruso? I thought how could I have not seen this movie...After seeing it, I wonder want did all this great names said to each other at the first film visualization. I bet it was a festive set, with all the producers around. I have a close idea about what went through their minds. How the did I played in this movie? Can I afford to pay the producers not to distribute it? Is this the end of my career? Another Ford Edsel? All my saying lead to the only conclusion. The movie is rubbish!! I have barely kept my self aware. Now I think it would have been be more satisfying to sleep. The script is terrible. The actors had nothing to act. A law should prevent this for happening. Good actors should never be allowed to play this kind of scripts. Rubbisshshsh!!!",Get Shorty
