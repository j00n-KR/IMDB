0,Leofwine_draca,A solid turn from star Roberts in this wife beater thriller,5,6 October 2011,"One of the best-known entries in the psycho-thriller genre, thanks to the starring presence of Julia Roberts. This time the story is the husband-from-hell, and watching Roberts dealing with him at the film's outset makes for engaging viewing. What follows is entirely predictable and fairly watchable, although it's safe to say that this film is fairly dated – it was made in the early '90s, a period which seems to date films far more than those from a few years before or after, for some reason.I'm no fan of Roberts, but she's pretty good here, underplaying her role for the most part and rarely resorting to shrill histrionics. Patrick Bergin is fine as the creepy, controlling husband, although most will find Kevin Anderson's hairy teacher a bit of an irritating character. The film manages to avoid slasher stereotypes for the most part and only screws up on one occasion, during an absolutely awful fashion montage segment showing Roberts dressing up in various hats etc. – straight out of PRETTY WOMAN and totally out of character for somebody who was previously very scared, fragile and introverted.",Sleeping with the Enemy
1,SnoopyStyle,Lifetime movie on steroids,5,23 November 2013,"Martin Burney (Patrick Bergin) is an abusive husband to Laura (Julia Roberts). So she plans to escape by faking her own death. She starts a new life and falls for neighbor Ben Woodward (Kevin Anderson).This is a Lifetime movie on steroids. Bergin is a cartoon character. Roberts is showing her movie star credential. And I don't like Anderson. I get the creepy vibes from Let's-do-a-Deal dude. It's the easiest thing to play the nice guy in this movie.This is a movie where flashbacks may be preferable to revealing everything right from the start. The first 15 minutes has Martin hitting Laura, showing Laura escaping, and basically laying out the entire story. There is a lot of possibilities that is lost there. The almost accidental run-in at the hospital is probably the only tense moment after the first 15 minutes. It just lacks tension or suspense.",Sleeping with the Enemy
2,kosmasp,Issues,6,27 December 2020,"Abusive relationships are quite the problem. Especially because women have problems to get out of them. Now the fact Julias character can do that ... well seemingly can do that, is a nice things. Although her approach or the way she achieves it, is quite riddled with holes (planning wise). There are also a lot of other convenient things (ring in the toilet, phone call, visit at a certain facility at the exact same time and so forth) that happen, that normally should make you cringe in terror.So either suspend your disbelief in a way you haven't done before ... like really ... really ... really suspend it all the way to the moon. Or be prepared to roll your eyes quite a lot. Having said that, the actors do their things amidst all the cliches and the movie still kind of works on a basic level. Tension is there and you can see why Julia was considered everyones sweetheart for quite some time - no pun intended",Sleeping with the Enemy
3,jboothmillard,Sleeping with the Enemy,6,4 September 2006,"This is probably the first time I saw Julia Roberts in a thriller, and she delivers quite a good and quite a real performance. Laura Burney (Roberts) and husband Martin (Patrick Bergin) have been married for four years and seem to be a good couple, but the truth is that he has been beating her for ages, and she has not been able to escape it. One day, she sees the chance to get away from this horrible man, and she claimed not to be able to swim, but she had secretly been training and jumped off a boat at night. Soon enough, she moves away from the area and head for Iowa to start a new life, as Sara Waters. Along the way she meets and falls in love with drama teacher Ben Woodward (Kevin Anderson) who is perfect. What she does not know however is that her husband discovers she is still alive through the wedding ring down the toilet and the swimming class saying sorry to the husband. He will not stop to find her now, and kill her. Julia Roberts was number 29 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Good!",Sleeping with the Enemy
4,Tweekums,Not too many surprises but a solid enough drama,7,15 September 2019,"Outwardly it would appear that Laura and Martin Burney have a perfect marriage in their beachfront property on Cape Cod, but looking closer it becomes apparent that he is controlling and abusive. Everything in the house must be just so; she wears what he wants her to wear and as he tells a neighbour he likes to get her out on the ocean at least once each season... despite her being terrified of water due to a near fatal childhood incident. That night Laura and Martin join their neighbour for a sail; the weather turns bad and she disappears overboard. She is assumed drowned but, as we soon learn, she has been planning for this moment. With Martin thinking she is dead she starts a new life in Iowa. Unfortunately a series of events leads him to suspect the truth; then it is only a matter of time before he finds her.This is a solid little drama even if certain aspects do feel like an 'issue of the week' TV movie. It becomes obvious that Marin is controlling a little too soon and given that Laura has meticulously planned her escape she makes some incredibly silly mistakes... most obviously one involving her wedding ring. We also get quite a few cliché moments, especially during the film's final scene. All that said it passed the time well enough; there are sufficient tense moments as well as some lighter scenes. Julia Roberts is solid as Laura and Patrick Bergin is suitably menacing as Martin... just about avoiding slipping into pantomime villain territory. Overall I'd hardly say this is a must see but it is a decent enough example of the genre.",Sleeping with the Enemy
5,BA_Harrison,Julia Roberts and the husband from Hell.,7,3 November 2021,"Julia Roberts does the psycho-thriller thing that was so popular in the early '90s (Hollywood still trading on the success of Fatal Attraction): she plays battered housewife Laura Burney, who fakes her own death to escape from her controlling, violent husband Martin (Patrick Bergin, who has the 'psycho stare' down pat). Adopting the name Sarah Waters, she settles down in an idyllic small town in Iowa to be near to her mother, but has stupidly left enough evidence for Martin to figure out that he has been taken for a fool. And he's not happy about it.Directed by Joseph Ruben (who also helmed the excellent psycho-thriller The Stepfather), this is wholly predictable, by-the-numbers Hollywood product, right down to the final jump scare from the presumed-dead maniac. The film threatens to get dark when Martin, pillow in hand, menacingly approaches Laura's loveable mother in her nursing home, but doesn't have the balls to go through with it in the end, the murder of a little old lady deemed a step too far for a mainstream audience. Ruben even throws in a 'trying on costumes' montage for those viewers who loved Roberts doing the exact same thing in Pretty Woman. Originality be damned!Don't get me wrong, though: Sleeping With The Enemy might be trite, Hollywood nonsense, but I don't hate it. Roberts is extremely likeable as Laura/Sarah, Bergin is truly menacing, and Ruben's direction is polished, the film being suitably slick in all departments. And how could I not enjoy the ridiculous notion of Laura successfully posing as a man with a little help from Ben Woodward (Kevin Anderson), her drama teacher love interest? Ruben keeps things trundling along at a reasonable pace, and delivers a tense final act, when Martin is finally reunited with his dead wife. I particularly enjoyed Laura fighting back, kneeing the nutter in the plums, grabbing his gun, calling the police, and saying ""I've just killed an intruder'. Gotta love the look on Martin's face when he realises what's coming!6.5/10, rounded up to 7 for IMDb.",Sleeping with the Enemy
6,moonspinner55,"Tired scares, little suspense, but as a showcase for Julia's adorableness---not bad",6,22 September 2005,"Julia Roberts' style of acting never wavers: she's resilient and adorable--always. This brainless vehicle for her--a monster movie dressed up as an abusive marriage thriller--has the requisite dopey pleasures, and it's well-produced and moves right along at a fast clip (even if the viewer is always ten steps ahead of the narrative). Seems Jules has married a psychotic-obsessive who abuses her; she plots a fake demise, which takes her not on a journey of self-discovery but to the Midwest, where she finds a charming old house next-door to a heterosexual drama teacher (he can't cook a meal without nearly setting his kitchen on fire). It's ridiculous, yes, but Roberts has a few choice moments; I liked the exchange between she and the stranger on the bus, also the sequence with blind mom Elizabeth Lawrence is riveting. The hubby is made to be your standard violent psycho (how trite) and utterly wastes Patrick Bergin's charisma, but someone had to play the part. I don't excuse ""Sleeping With The Enemy"" for being so basic (and dumb), yet strictly as a pulpy, non-think entertainment it isn't bad. **1/2 from ****",Sleeping with the Enemy
7,blanche-2,"entertaining, absorbing drama",7,14 September 2005,"I'll say right off that I'm not a fan of Julia Roberts. I find her acting very external. I do, however, like a lot of her movies. I think our tastes run to similar type stories. What can I say. ""Sleeping with the Enemy"" is a good, if not great film. It held my interest, especially at the beginning, where one feels the tension in the beautiful home, and when all the little pieces of conversation come together.It seems like the object was to showcase Julia rather than the story - I found some of the scenes a big waste, such as her MTV video doing costume changes and yet another one of those couples dancing together and falling for one another scenes.I thought Kevin Anderson, a marvelous stage performer, did a great job as Julia's love interest, and Patrick Bergin was one scary husband. The suspense did build at the end. Yes, the movie has holes. I just went with it.",Sleeping with the Enemy
8,edwagreen,Sleeping With the Enemy- A Rude Wide Awakening ***1/2,9,27 July 2006,"This abusive husband is just too much and as a result, wife Julia Roberts fakes her own drowning just to escape.When a fellow swimmer calls to pay his condolences the maniacal husband becomes suspicious. Seems that Julia never learned to swim.By a series of conniving ways, our fiend finds out where his wife has gone. She has settled in a small town in Iowa and attempted to make a life of her own. She even told her husband that her blind stroke victim mother had died when in reality she had her moved to another home in Minnesota.Julia finds love in the way of a college teacher. There is one funny line when the husband puts a gun to the head of a drama teacher. It can be him since he is in a relationship with another guy. The ending will tell you just how miserable Julia was when she makes the phone call to police. It also tells you that getting papers to keep these fiends away is nothing more than worthless.This film is exciting and nicely paced. How the husband finds out the whereabouts of his wife is also fascinating.",Sleeping with the Enemy
9,sunwarrior13,A Psych Thriller That Features A Battered Wife,8,1 October 2012,"Sleeping with the Enemy is a psychological thriller film starring Julia Roberts.Patrick Bergin,Kevin Anderson,Elizabeth Lawrence,Kyle Secor and Claudette Nevins co-star to play supporting roles. The film is based on Nancy Price's novel of the same title. Roberts plays a woman who escapes from her abusive, obsessive husband from Cape Cod to Cedar Falls, Iowa, where she captures the attention of a kindly college drama teacher.Laura Burney, the wife of a rich investment counselor, Martin. Martin appreciates his wife as a trophy, but at home he abuses her for not keeping the house as clean as he would like it. The verbal abuse descends into physical violence so much so that Laura decides to disappear rather than live a life under Martin as a brutalized slave. Laura fakes her own death by drowning, and relocates to Cedar Falls, Iowa, where she changes her name to Sara Waters. She starts a relationship with her friendly Iowa neighbor Ben Woodward but her happiness is short-lived. Martin has discovered that Laura has staged her drowning and is coming to Iowa to reclaim his possession.It's the sort of movie where all of the characters and plot moves are tailored to the thriller mechanics and have no existence apart from their crude functionality.The only good thing about it is Julia Roberts' presence and her performance as Laura.",Sleeping with the Enemy

11,hitchcockthelegend,Berlioz Symphonie Fantastique will never sound the same again!.,6,4 March 2008,"Laura marries Martin Burney who appears to be the perfect man, he is handsome and successful, yet the dream of the perfect man becomes a nightmare as Martin is a control freak who abuses her both physically and mentally. Once she decides enough is enough she plots her escape by way of faking her own death by drowning, a new life beckons, but she will always be looking over her shoulder to see if Martin finds out the truth and tracks her down.Thus the vehicle for Julia Roberts pans out as your just above average thriller. It has some decent moments that keep it from drifting into tedium, the set up perfectly portrays the double life that some people lead, on the social circuit it appears the couple are happy and at one with each other, yet behind their own walls there is violence and the crushing of the spirit. The final third of the film is also well worthy of the word thriller, for the tension is nigh on unbearable as we slowly come to the conclusion, whilst Julia Roberts as Laura does a very tidy job as this sort of modern day princess escaping the evil clutches of her keeper. Must mention the great use of Berlioz's Symphonie Fantastique, it's eerie and impacts hard for the scenes it is used for.Patrick Bergin plays his role well enough, it's just that his villainy is never fully realised, we see enough to know that what he does is wrong, yet it feels a bit too polished. Whilst a sequence that sees Laura dress up as a man is clearly the low point of the film, it really does stretch the viewers patience, and sadly insults their respective intelligence. It's a mixed bag that isn't quite a waste of time, it just doesn't leave you with anything other than a feeling of being semi fulfilled, shame as it could have been brilliant with a bit more bravery and brains in the script, 6/10.",Sleeping with the Enemy
12,Theo Robertson,Never Marry Herr Hitler,4,12 February 2003,"I couldn`t help noticing that many people in the opening credits who made this film had Jewish sounding names . I didn`t think too much of it at the time but as SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY progressed I couldn`t fail to notice that the villain is softly spoken and is capable of as much charm as he is of flying into extreme rage , listens to teutonic music , is obsessed with regimentation , doesn`t smoke and believes in the virtues of a health regime. Did I mention he`s got a moustache ? Good job the bad guy isn`t called Adolph `cos that`d be too obvious so the writers give him the non third Reich sounding name of Martin otherwise women everywhere might think it`s a good idea marrying someone with all the character traits of Adolph Hitler . Hey wait a minute ! Wasn`t Martin Burney Hitler`s private secretary ?
Despite enjoying the sly not so subtle characterisation of Martin - Which I don`t think was coincidental - I didn`t enjoy anything else about this film. Despite having an A list female star and the inclusion of sex and bad language this film often resembles one of those TVMs that deals with domestic abuse and is brimming with banality and ridiculous melodramatic coincidences . Come to think of it Martin Burney reminds me more of Dick Dasterdly than Hitler",Sleeping with the Enemy
13,Doylenf,"Another ""you can run, but you can't hide"" sort of thriller...",5,19 March 2007,"SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY has a misleading title. It would have sounded great attached to a drama about romance and espionage but not for the sort of tepid thriller envisioned here for JULIA ROBERTS and PATRICK BERGIN. It's domestic strife that forces Julia to run away from an abusive husband (a psychopathic neatnik who goes to extremes about how he arranges towels in the bathroom or canned goods in the cupboard).Luckily, when Julia escapes to Iowa she's befriended by a kindhearted English teacher (KEVIN ANDERSON) who encourages her to talk a little about her past so that he can understand why she finds herself attracted to him but unable to connect because of some secret in her past. He brings a touch of much needed warmth to the proceedings, but it's all for nothing because the story itself is relentlessly predictable from start to finish.Too many loopholes in the plot to go on a fishing expedition, but the most notable ones involve why a man determined to capture and kill his wife would bother to slink around her house putting things back in apple pie order before moving in for the kill. Indeed, it seems like a cheap ploy just to ratchet up what little suspense there is.The screenplay was obviously written to show off whatever strong points JULIA ROBERTS has as a star personality. I've never understood her vast appeal for today's fans and this film doesn't shed any more light on the matter since her acting here consists mostly of toothsome smiles or timid glances as she tries to protect her identity.Bergin, as the husband from hell with a wicked gleam in his eye, has a tendency to overact and must have had Jack Palance for his inspiration as the psycho husband, but nobody is able to overcome the dullness inherent in the weak script. Nothing new here.",Sleeping with the Enemy
14,preppy-3,Thriller that's not too thrilling,5,6 June 2007,"Beautiful Laura Burney (Julia Roberts) is miserable. She lives with a vicious controlling husband (Patrick Bergin) who beats her up for the slightest infraction. She fakes her own death, moves to a small town in Iowa and starts over. She meets nice guy Ben Woodward (Kevin Anderson) and begins to fall in love...but her husband (in an increasingly unbelievable series of events) figures out she's alive and is hunting her.This movie was just made to cash in on Roberts' ""Pretty Woman"" which was a monster hit the year before. This one also was a big hit...but I can't see why. It's very slow-moving with some truly terrible dialogue and the events get increasingly unbelievable as the story progresses. Roberts (a good actress) is only so-so here. Anderson isn't much better but the poor guy has nothing to work with. Bergin is just dreadful as the villain and the filmmakers go out of their way to make it clear that he's evil. For instance, during the last part of the film he's always wearing black. It's stupidly unsubtle and treats the audience like a bunch of idiots.There are a few good moments--the musical montage to ""Brown-Eyed Girl"" is fun (even though it's an obvious ripoff of the one in ""Pretty Woman""), Anderson and Roberts dancing to ""Runaround Sue"" and a moment at the end when Roberts calls the police. Notice that--two of the best moments in this supposed thriller are musical bits that have mostly nothing to do with the movie! Also the film does look beautiful (love the house the Burneys live in). Roberts fans should like this but all others proceed with caution. I give it a 5.",Sleeping with the Enemy
15,LeonLouisRicci,No Conviction for the Conempt,3,30 May 2012,"This Psycho-Drama concerning Spousal Abuse Fails on Both accounts. There is a Weak try at Showing the Abuse and this includes very Little to Justify the complete and utter Terror that most of these wives endure. A Slap and a Kick and a Can Stacking, Towel Straightening Husband, while is Intolerable does Not really Instill us with too much Fear. This Film just does Not have the Conviction of its Contempt.

16,view_and_review,The Enemy that Never Sleeps,7,24 March 2020,"I went from ""Not Without My Daughter"" to ""Sleeping with the Enemy,"" that's enough spousal abuse to last me a lifetime.Laura Burney (Julia Roberts) was trapped in a very abusive relationship. Imagine being married to a person with an OCD about tidiness and he's violent about it---you'd be constantly getting beat. Well, that was Martin (Patrick Bergin). He was this creepy, monotoned, lunatic that demanded perfect obedience and perfect attendance from his wife. She had long had enough, but she had no means of escaping and assuring that she'd be safe.Finally, she devised a plan to fake her own death which allowed her to escape. It was an excellent plan if her husband was just a normal abusive husband, even with some of her small mistakes. Those small mistakes were pretty much beacons for a overly possessive maniac. No way was he going to let her get away.""Sleeping with the Enemy"" was intense and suspenseful anytime Martin was on the screen. Everything he did, even he smallest of things, was as menacing as a terror plot. You couldn't help but hold your breath and gnash your teeth at the sight of him.Julia Roberts, for her part, was as professional as always. She dominated the early 90's and this movie was no exception. This may have been an extreme example of spousal abuse, yet how many women never get the chance to escape.",Sleeping with the Enemy
17,FlashCallahan,That would make you a monster.....,5,16 March 2014,"Laura and Martin have been married for four years. They seem to be the perfect, happiest and most successful couple. The reality of their household, however, is very different. Martin is an abusive and brutally obsessed husband. Laura is living her life in constant fear and waits for a chance to escape. She finally stages her own death, and flees to a new town and new identity. But when Martin finds out that his wife is not dead he will stop at nothing to find and kill her.....After the success of Pretty Woman, it was inevitable that Roberts would be huge, and the next few films she starred in would be guaranteed hits, regardless of their quality. In 1991, she starred in two dodgy movies, Dying Young, and this shlockfest.It's the kind of film that has a woman explain a plot point over the phone to the villain, and has someone search for clues in a box labelled 'Laura's Personal Records'.Despite the absurdity of it all though, Roberts is good, and Bergin is the funniest pantomime villain, and plays the role with the right amount of cheese.This is the film to thank when you think of other films like, Single White Female, The Hand That Rocks The Cradle, and Unlawful Entry.Its a load of old cobblers, but its funny cobblers.And Roberts looks like Michael J Fox when dressed as a man.",Sleeping with the Enemy
18,JamesHitchcock,The Husband From Hell,7,12 October 2006,"""Sleeping with the Enemy"" is an example of the genre which I have come to think of as the "" from Hell"" movie, and which enjoyed a vogue in the late eighties and early nineties after the success of ""Fatal Attraction"". In this case, the villain is the husband from Hell. Laura Burney is the beautiful young trophy wife of Martin, a wealthy and successful investment adviser. On the surface, they have the perfect relationship, but in fact Martin is obsessive, abusive and violent. While out sailing near their beach home on Cape Cod, Laura fakes her own drowning and disappears to start a new life in small-town Iowa, where she meets a new boyfriend, Ben. Martin, however, discovers that she is not really dead, and tracks her down to her new home. Laura realises that she and Ben are in deadly danger..That might seem like a simple, and fairly trite, plot, the sort of plot which one would associate with an ""issue of the month"" TV movie about spousal violence. What raises the film above the level of the commonplace is the way the theme is handled. The opening scenes, dealing with Laura's life with Martin, are very good indeed. Their home is luxurious but cold and forbidding, a glass, steel and concrete Modernist palace, a reminder that architectural Modernism, even at its most stylish and elegant, lacked the humanity of the Classicism that it tried to emulate. The cold, emotionally repressed Martin is similarly lacking in human warmth. He is obsessed with order, neatness and trivial details, reprimanding Laura if the bathroom towels are not hung neatly or if the contents of her kitchen cupboards are not tidily arranged. He is prone to sudden outbursts of irrational violence, viciously assaulting Laura after falsely accusing her of infidelity with a doctor acquaintance. (As Martin has already arranged to go sailing with the man that evening and has insisted that Laura accompany him, it seems unlikely that he genuinely suspects her of having an affair; his outbursts are a means of maintaining control over her, motivated less by jealousy than by sadism).Martin's taste in music has already provoked some comment on this board. Although it is difficult to imagine a cold fish like Martin as a lover of a wildly romantic composer like Berlioz (he strikes me as being more of a period-instrument Baroque man), whenever he makes love to Laura he likes to put the ""Symphonie Fantastique"" on the hi-fi, specifically the last movement, ""Songe d'une Nuit de Sabbat"". As this movement depicts the artist's beloved transformed into a witch and dancing at an orgy, the choice of music is doubtless intended to tell us something about Martin's personality. (Actually, it probably also tells us something about Berlioz's personality and about why his relationship with his ""beloved"", the actress Harriet Smithson, was not a happy one).When, in the second half of the film, the action moves from Massachusetts to Iowa, the atmosphere changes. The film gives a more positive picture of small-town life than many recent films, as Laura (or Sara as she is now known) settles into a more tranquil existence. The dominant tones of the first half were a cold blue and white; in the second they are warmer greens, browns and oranges. Sara's new home is not a glass palace but a charming, folksy Victorian period house. Whereas Martin was meticulously dressed and well-groomed, Ben is more of a latter-day hippie, with long hair, a straggling beard and scruffy jeans. The music associated with him is not the ""Symphonie Fantastique"" but cheerful sixties pop like ""Runaround Sue"" and Van Morrison's ""Brown-Eyed Girl"". Julia Roberts's style of acting also changes. (This was one of her best performances prior to ""Erin Brockovich"", which I have always regarded as her best film). As Laura she was beautiful but vulnerable and passive. As Sara she is a stronger woman, unafraid to take control of her life.The second half of the film is not as strong as the first. Part of the reason is that Patrick Bergin is far more memorable as the obsessive control-freak Martin than is Kevin Anderson as the kindly, happy-go-lucky Ben, and part is that the plot becomes rather predictable. There are also (as others have pointed out) a number of plot-holes; Martin, for example, seems to track Sara down rather too easily to be plausible. Nevertheless, there are a number of effective moments of suspense; the scene where Martin seems to be about to smother Sara's elderly mother but then, when he is disturbed, contents himself with putting the pillow behind her head, struck me as a very Hitchcockian touch. (The scene at the funfair may also have been homage to Hitchcock's ""Strangers on a Train"", in which a funfair plays an important part). The final confrontation is also very suspenseful, even if certain elements do sometimes seem less than credible. Altogether a watchable thriller. 7/10",Sleeping with the Enemy
19,StevePulaski,The Lifetime film that got lucky,4,9 March 2013,"Sleeping With the Enemy feels nothing so much as a Lifetime drama/thriller that was lucky enough to scoop up mainstream distribution into American cinemas. It's a perfunctory, often middling cross between the two genres, as it starts out giving us an interesting setup with characters and a dysfunctional relationship, before abandoning that to predicate upon a cat-and-mouse game between the couple. If it hadn't been for the interesting amount of tension director Joseph Ruben cooks up during this ninety-eight minute exercise, this review would be comprised of battle-words.The film's selling point is obviously Julia Roberts, who does what the script allows her to do efficiently. She plays Laura Burney, a relatively middle-aged woman living off the coast of Cape Cod with her husband Martin (Patrick Bergin) in a seemingly competent life-position. They talk a lot, they appear to be trusting, and they enjoy having sex in the dining room to Symphony Fantastique. Not long after their fling do we see why their relationship isn't so great; Martin, who suffers from a personality disorder, often abuses Laura if she does not perform tasks to his personal liking or if he assumes that she is being unfaithful. This causes a desperate strain on not only their relationship, but Laura's well-being. When the neighbor offers to take them sailing in a wild thunderstorm, Laura decides to fake her own death at sea and swim to a nearby shore. On the shore, she can begin a new life, under the name ""Sara Waters,"" and leave the calamity behind her.""Sara"" soon meets a drama professor named Ben Woodward (Kevin Anderson), who tries to become close with her, but coming off a disastrous marriage, she wants nothing to do with men anymore. The remainder of the film showcases Ben's efforts to get closer to ""Sara,"" and how Martin begins to pick up leads to her whereabouts where he can finally make her his own again.This kind of potboiler setup doesn't leave too much to be desired. The film has a very ""scenic"" attitude, meaning that much of the film is comprised of listless montages, pretty, yes, but substantial and worthy of inclusion, no. This makes the film inhabit a dreary state, where the characters are not that interesting to stay in-tune with, the plot is nothing but a simple kickstarter to get things going, and the relationships between characters are wholly unmemorable.Yet the most astonishing thing of all, setting aside the scenic atmosphere, the uninteresting characters, the tepid plot progression, and the redundancy of it all is the hammy acting by almost everyone involved. Even Roberts, who is often quaint and sophisticated in her roles. She recites her dialog with a wooden state of mind, seemingly reading it off a cue-card, making much of her delivery awkward and unpolished. Anderson and Bergin don't bring too much else to the table, other than the males in her life that are causing her untold grief.There is, however, a similarity to a newer movie that Sleeping With the Enemy brings to the table, and that film is Safe Haven, the latest adaptation in the line of Nicolas Sparks romance novels. Both of these films, while capitalizing off the same-type of premise, choose to go about their stories in different ways. Sleeping With the Enemy tries to craft a thriller out of the entire thing, providing a more nuanced relationship subplot in the background, while Safe Haven heavily emphasizes the romance value and only seeks out the thriller aspect towards the end of the film. Regardless, these are two examples of films with a promising premise that both provide hokey, unremarkable products in whatever direction they take. Despite this, both films provide competent direction and accentuate a usually difficult detail to capture well (Safe Haven being scenery, and this film being suspense). It's just too bad the surrounding elements in the same picture couldn't have buoyed it.Starring: Julia Roberts, Patrick Bergin, and Kevin Anderson. Directed by: Joseph Ruben.",Sleeping with the Enemy

21,OllieSuave-007,Thrilling movie of survival and concealment.,9,11 November 2013,"This is a thrilling and exciting movie about a woman, Laura (Laura Roberts) who fakes her own death in a boating accident in order to escape her physically abusive husband, Martin (Patrick Bergin).The suspense in this movie builds as we see the controlling and abusive behavior of Martin to Laura finally finding the opportunity to escape and hiding traces of her actually surviving the boating accident. Laura hiding out in a small town in Iowa makes the audience wonder if she is really safe and when/if Martin might be on to her scheme, providing enough intrigue to make the movie go at an exciting pace.

22,sddavis63,Uninspired,5,3 January 2013,"In all honesty, this movie struck me as a bit flat, both in terms of plot and performances. To begin with, I'm not the biggest fan of Julia Roberts in the first place. I've had some mixed reactions to her work. She's been in a couple of good films, but much that I've seen has disappointed me. ""Sleeping With The Enemy"" has to rank in that ""disappointing"" category.It's cliché driven from beginning to end, and it hits every note possible in the story of an abused woman. Roberts character of Laura Burney qualifies on that count, married to a violent OCD-driven husband (played by Patrick Bergin) who controls every aspect of her life and makes her live in fear. Faking her own death, Laura escapes his clutches, moves to a small town in Iowa under an assumed name and, of course, falls in love with a nice guy (Kevin Anderson) - except that you know hubby has to be planning to show up. I'll grant that Roberts was the best part of a cast that really didn't inspire me very much.The movie is at times a bit slow paced, but in the last twenty minutes or so it does have all the required chills for this kind of movie, and there's some suspense about how it's all going to turn out. Still, for the most part it was a rather uninspired effort which left a lot to be desired. (5/10)",Sleeping with the Enemy
23,gridoon,By-the-numbers thriller is boosted by good performances.,6,8 December 1999,"I think most people tend to overlook how well-done the first 20 minutes of this movie really are. Ruben carefully builds a creepy atmosphere, relying on brief glances, moments of silence and quietly expressive performances (especially by Julia Roberts) to help the viewer understand that, behind the image of a perfect couple, something is really wrong. Unfortunately, after Roberts escapes from her husband, the movie turns into a strictly by-the-numbers thriller, where you can predict almost every development of the script. It's a visually polished movie, though, and the very good performances give it a strong psychological center that keeps it above-average.",Sleeping with the Enemy

26,inkblot11,Uber-powerful story of domestic violence and its effects,9,13 December 2007,"Laura (Julia Roberts) appears to be the luckiest bride on the planet. Her husband (Patrick Bergen) is a very successful financial adviser and they have two beautiful homes, one on the eastern seaboard. She has lovely clothing and every imaginable amenity. However, appearances are deceiving. Shortly after a happy honeymoon, her husband revealed his true nature. He is a sadistic, sociopathic control freak who beats her if she so much as leaves a handtowel hanging lower than the others. He also demands sex whenever he is in the mood and never takes no for an answer. Sadly, there is no escape, as he often warns her that he can track her down anywhere, should she decide to leave him. However, Laura is desperate to get out of his clutches, naturally, so she bravely devises a plot to vanish into thin air, or that is, into the water. Her husband believes that she is afraid of the ocean but she secretly takes swimming lessons and uses her new skills to fake her own drowning when she falls off the side of a boat. Escaping to Iowa, Laura begins a new life as Sarah Waters. She even finds a kind and caring man, Ben (Kevin Anderson) living right next door to her newly rented home. But, should Laura really be confident that her crazy ex will never find out about her deception? Don't count on it! This is a powerful story of domestic abuse and its consequences. It is very difficult to entangle oneself from an abusive partner, as this film clearly shows, and those who are brave enough to try should be mightily applauded and supported. Bergen is one of the most lethal, frightening characters ever put up on the screen and his performance towers over nearly everything else. That said, Roberts is really terrific, too, as the caught-in-a-trap woman and Anderson is nice, also, as a measure of hope in her dark world. The costumes are most lovely and the film's sets beautiful, especially those in Iowa. For the record, Robert's rented home is one of the most beautiful abodes in film history and it is my personal favorite among houses. I sometimes play the film just to see the home's lovely interior and exterior. But, to get back on track, this film is a riveting piece of fiction that seems all too real, with a powerful, uber-suspenseful plot line. If you love scary, shake-my-bones mysteries, you hardly do better than this one. But, sleeping afterwards could be a short-term hazard.",Sleeping with the Enemy

I can't complain too much about this movie. Snore through it, maybe, but not complain. Some of it is so ludicrous I wondered whether it was originally conceived as a spoof comedy. I found my spirits sinking the longer I watched it. The opening scenes on the beach were effective and had promise, but the rest if the movie is a complete waste of time. It is essentially a slasher movie in disguise, complete with jumpy soundtrack and a plot that is full of countless holes.Of the cast, Roberts looks good, but that is it, Patrick Bergman seems to be doing a Burt Reynolds impression when nobody (and I mean nobody) not even Burt Reynolds wanted to be Burt Reynolds. He is so cliché, I'm not sure his character is meant to be as funny as he seems. As of the rest they seem to be from a struggling local amateur dramatic group and all just seem happy to be there.How this movie grossed what it did amazes me. My advice is give it a miss. Avoid it like the plague. Tell your friends to pass it by. The acting is bad, bad, bad (Roberts included)",Sleeping with the Enemy
28,filipemanuelneto,"Almost forgotten, but essential in Julia Roberts's career.",4,14 December 2019,"This movie is all about a case of domestic, physical and psychological violence, where the wife of a controlling and violent husband decides to fake his own death in order to escape and start living again. Of course, things get complicated later, when the husband discovers that he was deceived and starts looking for the runaway wife. A classic thriller where she can run but can't hide, which marked (along with ""Pretty Woman"") Julia Roberts' rise as an actress.This is, to a large extent, a movie that has aged quite badly, I think. Looking at him today, it is hard not to see him as a rather weak movie, where only the quality of the actress who gives life to the main character stands out. Continuously betting on the emotional response of the audience, the script is tiring and the story told has a series of problems of logic and likelihood. For starters, why did you prefer the character to fake her own death rather than go to the police, tell everything, risk it, and file for divorce? It was, to a large extent, the first thing to do. And that trick with the broken street lamp? If there wasn't such bad weather on this boat trip, how was she going to pretend she drowned convincingly? There's a lot of luck on her escape. And there's a lack of tension and suspense throughout most of the movie, except for the hospital scene, where things get really hot and we're glued to the screen. Even the ending of the movie was too warm and that was disappointing.Nonetheless, the story is solid enough to withstand the movie and get us to see it all the way through. The construction of the two central characters, played by Julia Roberts (in a performance that showed that she was a safe bet for the industry and a promise of talent), and Patrick Bergin, who can turn his character into something worthy of the game. our hatred, although sometimes quite cartoonish. The worst was really Kevin Anderson, in such a nice stupid character.In short, this is a highly dated movie that has aged very badly, almost falling into oblivion. The one thing that made this movie not completely forgotten was Roberts' performance, which manages to show a promise of talent and make the movie worthwhile in the least.",Sleeping with the Enemy

Julia Roberts puts on a great performance as the abused wife who temporarily escapes the clutches of her abusive and over controlling rich husband. It is more than a decent thriller where most of the audience can be heard mumbling under their breath ""Oh Julia, get out of there NOW!"", or ""Julia, don't open that door!!!"" as cliched as this film is, it still provokes fear and suspense it its audience.Revenge is a dish best served up cold!A decent 7 out of 10 rating.",Sleeping with the Enemy
30,digitalbeachbum,Not bad for a 30 year old movie,6,12 April 2021,"This movie was one of the earliest staring roles for Julia Roberts. She started to gain fame after Mystic Pizza, which led to Steel Magnolias and Pretty Woman. In this role, she plays a domestic abuse character who lives with a psychopathic, uber OCD husband, who beats her for having the towels out of alignment. I'm not sure how someone could marry in to this sort of behavior, its the one main issue I have with the script.I see some reviews about how the lack of violence diminishes the movie, but you don't need violence to have abuse. There is a mental factor involved here which I think Julia Roberts conveys to the audience if they are listening and watching her character. The need to have violence is ridiculous. Kevin Anderson does a fine job of being a controlling freakazoid. He does smack her around a bit, but the way the director presents this is that there has already been a lot of abuse. Julia's character apologizes for a variety of things and straightens out the cans in the cupboard because she has been beaten previously; plus there is the mental abuse which is with the verbal attacks.The movie is basic and flows easily. There are some minor issues I have with the rest of the production, like leaving the ring behind. I find this too much of a deus ex machina. I would have thought that the old mother would have been the clue giver or maybe a credit card company. I don't believe the main character would chance leaving her wedding band behind in a toilet. I doesn't make sense that after all that planning that she would leave chance to a toilet flush. I also can't believe that someone didn't use that toilet in the weeks after her disappearance.Some viewers don't seem to care for this movie, while not the best movie I've ever watched it is still a good movie.",Sleeping with the Enemy

Now with a new identity Laura is now known as Sarah Waters and she lives in Iowa a place that is near her blind mother who is apparently in a nursing home. Problems arise however when ""Sarah"" falls for her next door neighbor who she later confesses about her controlling husband.But since she is enjoying her new life as Sarah Waters will her controlling wife beating husband find her and threaten her again? and can Laura finally get rid of her husband once and for all.Bottom line I've been a fan of Julia Roberts ever since Pretty Woman and The Runaway Bride and frankly she did a good job as the victim of domestic abuse,while Bergin was excellent as the wife beater from hell with his crazy expressions and his weird plans.Similar to the 2013 film Safe Haven its sorta different to that cause in Safe Haven you got a woman like Roberts on the run,falls for a guy who in Safe Haven is a widowed father and his wife died years ago,also in Safe Haven there's this woman who helps the girl who is the victim of domestic abuse and in Sleeping With The Enemy there is none of that.

What scared me was all the physical violence, especially when Martin (Patrick Bergin) beat up Laura when she said, ""I don't know the doctor, Martin."" That really scared me! When that happened, I wanted to scream. If I were Martin's wife, I'd either flee, get a restraining order or tell him that I want a divorce. In conclusion, I recommend this edge-of-your-seat thriller to those of you who like a nice, suspenseful thriller or are fans of Julia Roberts or Patrick Bergin.

33,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Dark fairytale,8,24 August 2015,"Sleeping With The Enemy is one of the best atmospheric thrillers of the early 90's. Anyone who checks it out thinking they'll get a serious, thought provoking look at domestic abuse should think again. It's more of a dark, impressionistic fairytale than anything else, with logic giving way to a nightmarish chase piece. Julia Roberts plays Laura, a naive young bride to Martin (Patrick Bergin), a wealthy advertisement executive who adores her and gives her everything she wants. Unfortunately part of that package involves him kicking the living crap out of her at the drop of a hat. The early scenes have a nerve wracking sense of awaiting disaster, and indeed when things get really bad, Laura escapes by the skin of her teeth, travels by night to a small town in a distant corner of the country, and attempts to start anew. Martin, big bad wolf that he is, pursues her in selfish psychopathic rage, leading to a tense, wicked showdown. This is a misunderstood film. It's not meant as a serious minded piece, but rather an allegory for the way humans prey on one another, relatable to the dark storybooks of our childhood, but manifested in a very adult, mature setting. It's set almost like a horror film, with an ominous score, moody, gaunt locations and an ambiance that sets it just outside reality. Roberts is equal parts resilient and vulnerable as a damsel in distress who ends up rescuing herself, which is as good a character arc as any. Bergin owns, with a towering portrayal of tyrannical, senseless evil. He stalks the film's gorgeous cinematography with a virile madness and relentless sadism that seems one dimensional, until you accept that he isn't meant to be a fleshed out human, but rather an archetype of the bad that human beings are capable of.

When it first came out, I thought this, but have since changed my mind.It may seem hard to believe, but the verbal and emotional abuse in this film is actually fairly common. The issues with Laura, her husband's narcissistic personality, the perfect house, the perfect wife, all are true, subtler forms. Patrick Bergin is overly- psychotic, and the perfect glass house on Cape Cod a bit too perfect, but this is how the message is conveyed to the audience.The soundtrack by Jerry Goldsmith is haunting and effective. Laura (Roberts) finally decides she has had enough, and escapes by taking swimming lessons, faking a drowning to escape the abusive husband.Eventually she travels to Iowa, remakes her life, and even meets a new man. While the story ends a bit predictably, the beginning of the film is very telling and detail-oriented, showing Bergin's systematic breakdown of Laura's self-esteem, her isolation from society and loss of self-confidence; and then her final realization of what she must do. 9/10.",Sleeping with the Enemy
37,triple8,Decent but predictable.,6,28 August 2003,"Sleeping with the enemy was a decent enough film that is involving and holds your attention. It certainly held mine. But that said, I wouldn't call this a great film or even extremely good. The movie was simply to predictable. Was there anyone who didn't see most of these ""plot twists"" coming a mile away? The movie seems to think it's being original and scary and while it's true this was a bit scary, it wasn't original in the slightest.The movie had a chance to deal, much more seriously with a very important subject matter and they really didn't do all they could have with it. There were a lot of very obvious scare tactics used and while they may have been at times scary, it was done in a very ""try to scare"" type of way and takes the focus off the dramatic content in the involving story. As mentioned, the story is involving. I wish actually, that the story that had been the exclusive focus, at times it's like a drama meets thriller type movie which doesn't work here perfectly.Julia Roberts was decent enough but I've seen her in roles much more suited to her(Pretty woman, Erin Brokavich etc). I did moderately enjoy this movie but didn't find it to be outstanding or a ten, though it may very well have been had they dealt differently with the subject matter.",Sleeping with the Enemy

Laura is a woman that suffers domestic violence from her husband, which seems to be an extremely authoritarian man that does everything in his power to dominate Laura. Both these characters are well written, making you feel like any bad thing can happen to Laura once he finds her back. However, there are some few plot holes that made me dislike it for some times. For instance, I don't believe that Martin would have found out about her swimming classes; he had total control over her life, and it feels hard to imagine he'd never found a clue about it. Also, Laura, although being smart and reasonable in some moments, in others, she proves to be quite dumb. First, she should have moved to an apartment, which is much more safer than a house. Second, she should've never mentioned to her mother where her new affair worked. I figured out right away that that'd be the way to Martin find her. This movie as a whole is good, delivering what the spectator usually expects from it, but it doesn't add much to the genre.",Sleeping with the Enemy
39,PredragReviews,Superb psychological drama,8,26 July 2016,"Nancy Price is a spell-binding writer who knows how to dodge every Hollywood cliché, as well as any happy ending Hollywood can imagine. Whatever you say about this film you got to admit it overflowed with clams at the box office. It is a good psychological thriller about an abused wife who gets revenge on her abusive husband and a story about men who treat women horribly ,then go to bed with them! Martin's beach front house is Big and Luxurious and one very beautiful beach front property near the sea that is trouble in paradise for Laura (Julia Roberts). First, it has a beautiful haunting score by Goldsmith. Next it has Roberts: beauty and talent. Her facial expressions tell the story. Martin looks at her, she smiles back. Martin turns away she sinks to near tears. It's hard not to feel for her. Roberts is an emotional communicator. Also you've got to give Bergin's acting some credit as a an effective mental case. His flat formal language and flying fist tantrums makes the viewer wonder what is next. He is one scary iceman. He tries for complete control of Laura, her dress, her cupboard, her bathroom towels. Laura is pretty well trapped by this beast. I think about the character Laura and find it very troubling that a woman being bullied can feel hopeless and unable to find help. Some have suggested Laura simply get a restraining order. I think a restraining order wouldn't even slow him down: not a man like that.Despite is amateurish failings, ""Sleeping with the Enemy"" was a huge hit. ""Sleeping With the Enemy"" is definitely watchable if you have a couple of hours to spare and if you can suspend disbelief and just sit back and enjoy it for the cheesiness of it and the 'easy on the eye' aspect. A great insight to how domestic violence can be at this extreme and how difficult it would be for the wife to escape the violence the amount of planing it would take and the time this would take while still being in extreme danger. The is a great film worth watching time and time again.Overall rating: 8 out of 10.",Sleeping with the Enemy
40,eric262003,Disguised as a Slasher Film,5,1 October 2018,"The opening scenes to ""Sleeping With the Enemy"" packs a very powerful punch, if only I could say the same about the rest of this movie, sadly I really can't because everything else falls flat. The film delves into the life of a poor beaten unfortunate trophy wife named Laura Burney (Julia Roberts) and it ends with another tiring cliche in which the villain hoodwinks his target and downplays his audience. The performances were really good here, but the filmmakers offer little to showcase their talents instead the film is only in for the cheap scares. After coming off the success of ""Pretty Woman"", Julia Roberts decides to go out of the romantic-comedy genre to take part in a B-movie thriller without thinking about how absurd this movie really is. So she and her wealthy sophisticated business tycoon husband, Martin (Patrick Bergin) live in a nice upper crust dwelling somewhere, however most of their scenes emanate from a summer estate near a beach and the epicentre of Martin's reign of terror commences.Martin has the tendency to treat Laura like she's a possession of his and is made to be his servant for free. She's at his parties for him to show off with because she's nice-looking, but at home she ends up as his personal whipping girl if she doesn't obey to his demands making this guy an obsessive compulsive psycho. Even the smallest faux pas can him goes ballistic like if the cans aren't stacked right or the towels are not folded in a certain way. She can't choose her own clothing, she can't be seen with other people in other words, she's a prisoner in her own home. (What did she ever saw in him to begin with?) The first time he strikes at her, the impact is enough to make the heart pound faster. Bergin is excellent as the crazed psychopath, while the film does make the effort to adds some dramatic pathos to this psychological thriller, it quickly lowers the expectancy for fans who love psycho thrillers.Instead it goes incognito as a formulaic slasher film and falls under the the rather repetitive format of our heroine trying to escape her problems only to realize that it's not easy as it seems.So Laura hides out in Iowa changes her name to Sara Waters but before she does that she fake her death by pretending she's drowning while she was on a yacht with Martin. However, Martin is not going to take this lying down. It becomes his mission to track her down and find her and looking for places she might have been. Of course a plethora of incoherent clues leads Martin to her whereabouts which leaves this critic with questions that are greatly neglected.There are some well-groomed scenes that take place in Iowa which includes Laura progressively getting attached with a kindly neighbor drama teacher Ben Woodward (Kevin Anderson). Sadly director Joseph Ruben and screenwriter Ronald Bass demote this great chemistry between these two as a mere set piece for all the horror garbage soon to come. Ruben came strong in the 1987 horror film ""The Stepfather"" about a man who marries women and kills her and her children and gains possession of their belongings. But here with a dependable cast and a surplus budget, Ruben decides to let himself go and let his cast do their thing which is irresponsible on his part.It's a shame how an opening scenes start off so strongly only to end up going downhill so swiftly but that's the way the cookie crumbles.The real turnoff for me is when Martin starts going on his witch hunt to trace down whereabouts of his wife. It was the clues that got to me which was left with holes galore. The plot logic is very puzzling and incoherent. How could a wedding ring be stuck in toilet in matter of weeks? How did the YWCA employee get Martin's work phone number? How do you explain Laura paying the nursing home bill six months after lying to her husband that her mother died? How is it possible for Martin to know where Laura lived before she ever met him? Why do we even care at all for that matter? We'll never get any answer because even the filmmakers don't know either. What were left with is the impression that Martin is a deranged lunatic with a weakness for neatness. But still how is it possible for a man with one thing on his mind to kill Laura and still manages to arrange his cupboards? The simple answer that is not to define logic, but just to get the cheap shock.But then what about Laura? What would you do if you're alone in house and knowing your insane husband's dropping by for a killing visit? And to wrap things up we have the scene where the villain dies only for him not to die but eventually gives in. Sure this might work for movies like ""Halloween"" and ""Carrie"", the gimmick becomes stale bread. Though ""Sleeping With the Enemy"" has a lot of good going for it, it decides to go down the narrow path of slasher film cliches.",Sleeping with the Enemy

On the surface, Laura Burney (Julia Roberts) and her husband Martin (Patrick Bergin) are a wealthy and contented couple who enjoy a comfortable lifestyle and spend their leisure time at their luxurious house by the beach at Cape Cod. In reality though, Laura lives in a state of constant fear which has been created by Martin's abusive behaviour.Martin is a control freak with an obsessive compulsive disorder and a very cold personality. He gets insanely jealous when he imagines that Laura may be attracted to someone else and even exercises control over what clothes she wears. He beats her when her behaviour displeases him and then gives her flowers to show how much he cares about her.Within this relationship, the terrified Laura appears to be completely obedient and passive but in reality, she has for some time been planning to escape. Her husband knows her as a person who isn't able to swim and has a fear of water. In reality, she's secretly taken swimming lessons and this eventually enables her to fake her own death when the couple are involved in an accident at sea and she falls overboard and disappears.Laura secretly moves to Cedar Falls in Iowa, changes her name, makes a fresh start and soon meets Ben Woodward (Kevin Anderson) who's a drama teacher at the local college. She enjoys their friendship and also being able to visit her invalid mother at a nearby nursing home.Martin is under the impression that Laura's mother had passed away some time ago but when he starts to find pieces of information which make him suspect that his wife is still alive, his investigations soon reveal that the reality is somewhat different and that Laura's mother is actually a resident at the nursing home near Cedar Falls.Laura who seemed to have successfully escaped from her abuser soon discovers that, in reality, her intensely possessive and extremely violent husband will go to any lengths to ensure that she doesn't gain her freedom.""Sleeping With The Enemy"" is an entertaining movie which focuses on a form of violence which is rarely featured in commercial thrillers and maybe it's for this reason that some of scenes in which Laura is beaten seem so shocking, even to audiences whose exposure to on-screen violence has hardened their responses.Julia Roberts gives a sympathetic performance as a victim of domestic abuse who is trapped in a nightmare from which there seems to be no way out and also convincingly portrays the anxieties which her character continues to experience when she starts her new life in Iowa.

46,RossRivero99,A bitter disappointment,4,10 May 2019,"I am a huge fan of Alfred Hitchcock's movies and before watching this movie I was hoping that this was going to be something good which it did start out that way and during the course of its ninety nine minutes gets gradually worse and more predictable. Julia Roberts stars as Laura a young woman who is seemingly in a good relationship with her husband Martin (Patrick Bergin) but within the first few minutes of the movie we end up learning that things aren't at all what they seem to be at first glance and also that Martin is very controlling as well as physically, verbally, and psychologically abusive towards her and is very obsessed over the littlest things imaginable. One night Laura and her husband decide to go boating in the ocean in a thunderstorm and she ends up faking her own death and then moving to Iowa, changing her identity and moving on with her life. After she moves into her new house in Iowa she meets and falls in love with a drama teacher named Ben (Kevin Anderson), but during each of the times they meet he senses that she's hiding something and so it takes some time for her to tell him everything that happened to her. Then Martin somehow discovers that she's still alive and goes to great lengths to find her. The movie does have good things about it like the opening scenes as well as the scenes between her and Ben and their growing affection between one another. The problems with this movie truly outweighed the positives for me with this movie because I really wanted to like this movie but found myself getting more and more disappointed towards the end. The movie was directed by Joseph Ruben with a screenplay by Ronald Bass (who co-wrote the screenplay for ""Rain Man"") which really disappointed me even more because the moments which were supposed to strike tension just didn't work at all thanks to the abysmal screenplay. Julia Roberts is usually a good actress but I get the sense that she tried the best she could with this material but was limited by the script, and with Bergin I had the impression that he was trying too hard to be a manipulative sociopath. In the end the movie is a total failure because of its truly major shortcomings.",Sleeping with the Enemy
47,Beejerman,CHEER! - (8 stars out of 10),8,31 January 2019,"The stage curtains open ...""Sleeping With The Enemy"" finds Julia Roberts in her prime. After having such huge success with films like ""Pretty Woman"", ""Steel Magnolias"", and ""Flatliners"" - it came as a surprise that she would take on a project like this with relative unknown actors, Patrick Bergin and Kevin Anderson. A trend she would continue in her following film feature, ""Dying Young"". Despite the buzz this created, the film was a box office success.It is the story of a married woman who seems to have an idyllic life - a husband who is well-off, a beautiful home overlooking the ocean, days of picking seashells off of the beach, and formal events. The reality of her life was quite the opposite as she was the victim of an abusive, domineering and controlling husband. She takes advantage of an opportunity to escape his clutches, faking her death and daring to start a new life somewhere else. But, as she is settling down and finding love again, her husband discovers the truth and begins to hunt her down.This is a very well made and suspenseful movie. Julia Roberts was perfectly cast as she believably portrays her character. Both of the ""unknown"" actors were also very strong in their roles - Bergin as the nightmare of a husband, and Anderson as the drama teacher who genuinely cares for and falls for her. The film has several memorable scenes and holds up pretty well after all this time. The pacing is good, the cinematography well done.I highly recommend this movie. I've enjoyed it just as much as the first time with each viewing and it hasn't gotten old with me. A satisfying story with solid performances. It just goes to show you don't need big names to make a good movie.",Sleeping with the Enemy

From there the film starts to lose it's momentum trying to change gears into a romance film with an after taste of thriller.",Sleeping with the Enemy
50,DavidSim240183,"""I can't live without you. And I won't let you live without me!""",8,16 October 2008,"After Julia Roberts hit big with the vastly overrated Pretty Woman, she tried to broaden her palette and move from the bubbly, frothy rom-coms she began in. First up was Flatliners, the disappointing life after death thriller that had no idea how to tackle its subject without lapsing into cliché, and then the much better Sleeping with the Enemy.Sleeping with the Enemy has faded somewhat over the years, even though it was a reasonable success at the time. But I think its a film well worth reexamination. It deserves commendation for having the guts to dig into domestic abuse, seen through the eyes of a wife, running for her life from an abusive husband.The opening scenes are the best, because this is where we get to see something of they're marriage. Laura (Roberts) has been married to Martin (Patrick Bergin) for over three years (seven months, six days). Martin is handsome, wealthy, an attentive husband and he and Laura enjoy an active sex life. Director Joseph Rubin uses considerable subtlety in the early scenes to illustrate there's trouble in paradise. Like when Martin and Laura are getting ready to go to a party. Laura is all ready, but after Martin's remark about wearing a different dress, in the following scene at the party, Laura's not only changed her dress, she's changed her whole look. Her hair. Her earrings. Everything.This continues into the next scenes. The hand towels aren't arranged properly. Something Martin has to remind Laura of. Prompting Laura to hastily rearrange the cans in the cupboard so the labels all face forward. It all builds to its crescendo when Martin talks to a neighbour. After hearing something he doesn't like (""that must be your wife I've seen staring out the window""), he suddenly hits Laura. Its a scene that shocks you into numbness. Its the first time that Martin drops his mask of smooth charisma, and reveals himself as the impulsive control freak he really is.I wish there had been more scenes like that. I would have liked to have seen more of they're marriage. The rest of the film falls into a much more obvious stride. Laura fakes her own death, because nothing else would ever get Martin out of her life. And when he learns the deception, he begins an obsessive hunt for Laura. Its only a minor disappointment. That doesn't get in the way of a suspenseful, psycho-thriller. And Joseph Rubin keeps the screws turning with an unbearable relentlessness.Rubin's direction is so polished the film glides at a frightening pace. SWTE loses momentum a little in the scenes without Martin, but it isn't long before he's back in the picture again, and when he is, the tension level jumps right back into the red. His whole investigation into the too many clues Laura has left behind are terrifying the way he follows them like a trail of breadcrumbs right to her new front door. In fact SWTE often reminds me of the Robert Mitchum classic Night of the Hunter. They both share a similar structure. Of someone on the run, trying to start a new life but a crazed psychotic from the past is on they're trail.Julia Roberts is OK, if a bit too quietly played. Certainly she can be an engaging screen presence. She won a well deserved Oscar for Erin Brockovich. But she never really brings Laura to life. You never get the impression she's slowly emerging from her shell, and blossoming into a confident new woman. And her scenes with Kevin Anderson, her next door neighbour who wants to help are dreadfully twee, and drag the film right down. There's never that much chemistry between them. Besides, everyone in the cast gets completely upstaged by Patrick Bergin.Patrick Bergin is a greatly underrated actor. With his handsome looks and winning charisma, he has all the qualities necessary to be a perfect leading man. But sadly, Bergin has never had the career he so richly deserves, even though he has talent to spare. Still, whenever someone has the brains to cast him, he never fails to steal the show, and Sleeping with the Enemy is no exception.Bergin is a powerful presence whenever he's on screen. Like a black storm cloud on the horizon, he's come to turn Laura's sunny new life upside down. With his imposing height, silky voice and persuasive charm, he captures the attention effortlessly. He makes Martin utterly charming one minute, and then perfectly sinister the next. Clearly enjoying every minute of this, he relishes playing the irredeemable bastard. He's quite funny at times too. Martin delights in his own cruelty. He even seems privately amused by it. Why Bergin never became a major star after this is a genuine mystery. His dark magnetism propels the entire film. Without him, it would be nothing.It all ends a bit predictably, but Sleeping with the Enemy is a worthwhile addition to the psycho-genre. The familiar story is buoyed by Bergin's captivating performance, and Rubin's dexterous direction. There's also a great musical score from the late Jerry Goldsmith. Seemingly innocuous one minute. Edgy as hell the next. Symphony Fantastique by Berlioz is put to great effect too. It chills to the bone, and works its way into your psyche so well that whenever you hear it in the future, its guaranteed to make you think of Sleeping with the Enemy.",Sleeping with the Enemy
51,roghache,"Haunting, chilling tale of affluent spousal abuse",6,16 March 2006,"I found this movie, if not terribly believable, very moving and emotional when I saw it some years back. Julia Roberts brings a real vulnerability to all her roles, and is perfect here as the affluent but both mentally and physically abused wife.The sad tale revolves around an apparently perfect upper middle class couple who share a beach home...the beautiful young Laura (who has every material comfort) and her obsessive and abusive husband, Martin. Laura lives in terror of her abuser, finally seizing a chance to escape by faking her own death and and fleeing to another town, where she assumes an entirely new identity. Meanwhile, Martin becomes ballistic when he discovers that his wife is not really dead and goes after her...I admit it, the plot is pretty far fetched, a lot of holes in the story, some events depicted not very believable. Leave your logic behind. Still, I was able to overlook all this and focus my attention on Laura's plight, hoping she could evade (or eliminate) this intellectual brute, and build a new life for herself with a new love.The portrayal of Laura's terror is vivid as she tries to appease her obsessive husband, who becomes violent if she fails to keep the pantry shelf items in perfect alignment. The most chilling scene of all is the rape, with its accompaniment of Martin's favorite classical music, a piece which thereafter haunts his young wife. No sympathy here for the husband, whose unfolding actions simply go from unspeakable to unthinkable.Not a particularly believable plot but engrossing, nevertheless, and a pair of vividly drawn characters who elicit strong emotions. However, the best part of this movie is definitely its message. Contrary to the typical image, spousal abuse is no respecter of social class. It would have been much more difficult for me before this film than it is now to picture an affluent, educated, sophisticated abuser.",Sleeping with the Enemy
52,bob_meg,Ron's Bass-o-matic screenplay is the real enemy here,4,24 November 2010,"It's really tough for actors to transcend bad material and the horribly predictable screenplay by Ronald Bass really reinforces that in ""Sleeping With the Enemy,"" It does what I like to call the ""When a Stranger Calls"" crap-out: for the first fifteen minutes, it's pretty engaging, and the last fifteen minutes are about the same. And in between is a boatload of Lifetime-caliber melodrama, and virtually nothing believable or interesting happening on screen.This is nothing new for Ronald Bass and sometimes his movies are so well cast and acted that you don't notice how really creaky the set is around you. Not so here. Patrick Bergen's performance is horrendously hammy, almost campy in spots. His later eye-bugging hysteria totally diffuses any of the character's sinister shadings from earlier in the film...at least before he started shouting LAURA LAURA LAURA like a comedian parodying Brando in ""Streetcar."" I never found Kevin Anderson to be a convincing actor, period, and he's no better with the Miami Vice greaseball look thrown over him.On the other hand, Julia Roberts gives an arguably good performance; it's muted and nicely restrained most of the time (save for the ""Pretty Woman""-type montage in the middle...you can almost hear the Fox execs ordering up Bass' team to recycle something that will retain fans of the 1989 drooler).Don't get me wrong. This movie isn't unwatchable. But at times, it's almost laughable. A shame...from previous reviews it sounds like the book was very good.",Sleeping with the Enemy

The actors don't know how to live within the cinematic space -- a better cast might have given the script some CPR. This is totally surrounded by writing conventions. Note how the writer wrote herself into this; the main character is a 'librarian'. I spent the whole time waiting for anything interesting, any cinematic spark to show itself. They could have reworked this from the lead actor's point of view, and reconstructed the disappearance a la ""Vertigo"". Or played off of Julia's perceived sexiness a la ""Body Heat"".

If there isn't a big enough warning to stay away I don't know what is (although The Mexican is a great film but that's an exception in her oeuvre).Everything from the scenes where she gets a beating (she's like Bambi in these scenes- innocent and a pure victim) through to the scenes where she is predictably 'learning to live again' in her new locale (there is one scene where her and her new boyfriend have great fun trying on different hats. I kid you not. It's as vomit-inducing as it sounds) to the final scenes where her hubby who has now traced her and seems to have morphed into a really rubbish version of Michael Myers, is big dumb Hollywood crud on every level. I hate films that don't warrant their audience with one iota of intelligence. This is one of those films. It took in megabucks at the box-office. In fact how this was made as a film to be shown in cinemas is beyond me. This feels like a Hallmark TV movie.

The acting is first rate and the story of how Laura escapes from her evil husband and fakes her death is told in perfect pace.

60,highwaytourist,Bad script sinks a good idea,6,17 August 2008,"There are a number of good points about this movie- the premise is exciting, Julia Roberts gives a convincing performance as the battered, traumatized heroine, and the film is well-made, with attractive photography and a nice musical score. One thing that makes the story compelling is that it's something that happens in real life, tragically. And Patrick Bergin has some good scenes in a two-dimensional role, portraying the abusive husband as an obsessive-compulsive who is superficially charming. But the truly bad writing keeps it from achieving much. The story becomes both predictable and unbelievable. How was Laura so surprised at her husband's cruelty before marrying him? It's not like she was a mail-order bride. It's never explained how Roberts character was able to hoard that much money before escaping. Shortly after she escapes, she takes the time to cut her hair. Couldn't she have done that later? She goes to great trouble to cover her tracks, up to a point, than throws her wedding ring in the toilet and doesn't bother to check if it gets flushed. It's never explained how she was able to get false identification even though her husband watches her constantly. How on earth was she able to find a place to live so quickly? Most women in her situation live in shelters and low-end boarding houses. Even more amazing, when Bergin visits his wife's legally blind mother, the woman doesn't recognize her son-in-law's voice but recognizes hers instantly. Also, why do she and the nice-guy neighbor fall for each other so quickly? How could such foolish twists have gotten into the story? Because without them, the story wouldn't be able to reach its obvious conclusion. Also, parts are just plain silly. The scene where Roberts tries on a bunch of hats to the tune ""Brown Eyed Girl"" is obviously filler material. And you'll spot the ending at least 30 minutes before it ends. What a waste of a good idea. It says much for the source material and Julia Roberts that the film works to the degree that it does.",Sleeping with the Enemy

63,Noirdame79,"Flawed, But Engrossing",7,10 September 2006,"Although primarily a showcase for Julia Roberts, who had become Hollywood's latest ""IT"" girl after ""Pretty Woman"", this romantic thriller, based on Nancy Price's novel, is watchable and quite suspenseful. It cannot be denied that the book is far superior, as is the case with most film adaptations based on a best-selling novel. The film is obviously aimed at women and the ""yuppie"" attitude that was still prevalent in the early 1990s. In the book, the abusive husband and wife were middle-class, while in the film Martin Burney (Patrick Bergen) is a wealthy businessman, who places his beautiful wife on a shelf like a trophy, expecting perfection and exploding when she doesn't meet his qualifications. While many may argue the change in their financial status in the movie, it does show that domestic violence can happen at every economic level, in all different walks of life and societies. We are only subjected to one instance where Laura (Roberts) is beaten by her spouse, although his control over her, demands and insensitivity to her feelings has been hinted at, and she does indicate that it was definitely not the first time. The novel goes into far more graphic detail of his offenses. Sara (the names that Roberts assumes are reversed in the book) wears a wig constantly after she escapes to Iowa, while the movie only has Laura wearing a wig as she escapes, and then she has her hair trimmed a little shorter and gets a perm. Not a very effective disguise if you're trying to alter your physical appearance so the bad guy won't recognize you! When she tosses her wedding ring in the toilet and tries unsuccessfully to flush it down the drain, Martin finds it after he tears through Laura's personal belongings and cuts himself, he discovers it with no problem - did he not use the toilet in the weeks since Laura's ""death""? Faking her demise, since her husband believes that she could not swim (she secretly took lessons at the YWCA, who inadvertently tips psycho hubby off - how did they find him?), she finds an ideal guy, Ben Woodward (Kevin Anderson), the local college drama professor, who embodies the sensitive, artistic dreamboat with such naturalness that you cannot help but like him. He gets her to open up (at least as far as she is capable of doing) and he senses that she is very traumatized, and is there for her when she most needs him. Anderson has rarely been seen since and I wonder what became of him - he certainly had the talent (anyone who can even partially pull off the opening number from ""West Side Story"" with a garden hose in tow and make it look easy must have something special), and the sequences featuring Van Morrison's Brown-Eyed Girl, and the vintage 60s tune Runaround Sue is actually quite engaging, a break from the intensity of the plot and showing some light-hearted, romantic fun.Bergin is effective if somewhat hammy in some parts - his character, no doubt, had some kind of undiagnosed obsessive-compulsive disorder, but at times he's a little too wild-eyed, but he does have the charm masking brutality bit down quite good, as many violent offenders are skilled at presenting as a front (how can such a charming, wealthy man be such a monster in private?). Bergin, a latecomer to acting (he was a teacher for children with learning disabilities in his native Ireland), has played many villainous roles, although here it was obvious that the filmmakers were trying to get him to resemble a certain dictator (guess who!). And the fact that he seems to be able to slip in and out of her home (and rearrange her towels and condiments) without her knowing is definitely stretching it, something that Robert De Niro's character in the 1991 remake of ""Cape Fear"" also seemed to excel at, and Martin seems to have it too easy when tracking down his frail mother-in-law in the nursing home that Laura secretly placed her in after lying to Martin about her mother's fictional passing.Laura is a terrified woman driven to desperation, who wants to start a new life but she is still living in fear of the man she married, who she fears (and rightly so) will stop at nothing to find her if he discovers that she has escaped him. It's nauseating when he calls her his ""princess"", which again, seems to indicate that she is more of a possession to him, and I wasn't particularly interested in seeing Martin's backside after he ravishes her to Berlioz's ""Symphonie Le Fantasique"". The cinematography is breathtaking.The final showdown, terrifying and voyeuristic (the viewer, of course, is aware of the danger lurking in the shadows far before Laura and Ben are), and it's last resort for this young woman who found that the law could not protect her. Of course, the brief, the bad guy comes back from death momentarily part is ridiculous and clichéd, but when Laura embraces the injured Ben and the camera pulls back, showing the dead Martin, eyes open, his blood streaked hand, with Laura's gold wedding band just a few inches way, sparkling, is very compelling.

65,tmpj,Sleeping with the Remote in Hand.....,4,16 June 2010,"""Sleeping with the Enemy"" is not an over the top thriller. It's a fairly decent vehicle for Julia Roberts, who is--perhaps--the only real reason for watching the film. In escaping from an abusive marriage, one has to wonder how it is that she could leave a trail that her spouse can easily follow...and one must also wonder why she did not continue to move on even after she had escaped his grasp. Certainly, she must have known that he would catch up to her at some point. He did..and she was completely un-prepared. If a husband is abusive, it does not automatically follow that he is a pathological murderer, though Pat Bergin plays the role in that fashion. I was finished with him after it appeared that he was tempted to murder the Mother, though he had nothing to gain by doing so. It just made no sense...not even in movie logic. And then, upon discovering the faked death of his wife, why would he want to kill her? Just because he'd been played for a sap? What a dope. Control freaks don't need enemies. The one they see daily in the mirror is Alpha and Omega for them. This is one you don't really need to see, though I can recommend it for its slight entertainment value. In some of the sidebars I read, Julia Roberts was disgusted with the town of Abbeville, SC, where some of the filming took place. She was disgusted with some the racist backwardness she found there. I give her kudos for that, as I am in the south as of this writing and find it to be the same way.",Sleeping with the Enemy

Well, as the summary says I was mis-lead. This film was nothing like The Burning Bed, which had power and Farrah played the part of a woman you truly felt for, and felt her pain and her need to survive. Sleeping with the Enemy drifted off after the first act into cheap thrills with Roberts faking her death to escape her husband and goes to live in Iowa. Her husband at first believes she is dead but starts to grow suspicious that she may still be alive and sets off after her. The rest of the movie is basically a cat and mouse game with Julia getting a house in this small town in Iowa and changing her identity....there is no mention of course how she got the money for this but at this point in the film I did not care all that much. She meets a guy (Mr. Nice wimpy) and falls for him and her husband does finally catch up to her but not before he re-arranges her soup cans and straightens up the kitchen. This was I assume to provide a cheap thrill to the audience. But I did not care much if she was an abused wife because the film as I have said cheated the audience. If it had stayed the course I might have felt for her and her situation. Of course the husband is killed and all is well for little ol Ms Roberts.

Here she plays a much stronger character, a woman fleeing her abusive husband to start a new life, strong, independent but still skittish, worried that she might be found.A tale of beautiful but terrified housewife Laura(Roberts) who resorts to desperate lengths to escape the constant fear of her violent and controlling husband martin (Patrick Bergin) in which she lives  faking her own death to be able to begin a new life far away. However, finding little peace she is still haunted by her previous life, a life which inevitably catches up with her when her husband discovers she is still alive and attempts to track her down.Roberts can do the strong independent woman role in her sleep and make it appear effortless - a fact proved later with her Oscar win for Erin Brockovich - and in Sleeping with the Enemy she shows the early talent which would eventually lead her to that Oscar win. Meanwhile Bergin is suitably menacing in a rent-a-villain kind of way, all grimacing and intense staring. He does however have a rather interesting tic  a form of OCD- towels all neatly lined up and so on  which could have served as a rather effective tension builder had it been given further development.However the film itself, while entertaining and diverting enough in its' own right, there is still something very standard and formulaic about the plot. For far too much of the film's (admittedly short) 94-minute runtime we seem to be waiting for the film to get going, and the climax arrives far too late and is too short, wasting the tension which has been built up. In addition, Kevin Anderson as Ben, the white knight who should rescue Laura from her fear, just does not seem to gel with the part  coming off as slightly creepy himself rather than a hero, particularly in the early half of the film.Overall Sleeping With The Enemy remains a standard typical early 90s thriller of which there were so many, no better or worse than any of the others. A curio for fans of Julia Roberts wishing to see her earlier career development in an effective performance, but the average plot makes the film a throwaway thriller which could serve for a Saturday evening's entertainment with a bottle of wine, but little more. Reasonable, serviceable but forgettable.",Sleeping with the Enemy

And the manner in which Martin ""discovers"" his supposedly dead wife is totally artificial and laughable.Btw, I think Robert Bergin - with his very, very decent looks - is NOT the right actor for this negative role. He hardly impressed me. It is as if he was deliberately trying to be frightening. I sincerely want someone to remake this movie and create a serious, well-plotted and well-presented psychological thriller out of it – devoid of ""insults to one's intelligence"".This is a totally stupid film made by – hold your breath! – a very experienced director who'd done some memorable films.

73,annlevtex,Good Nostalgic Guilt Watch,5,5 June 2021,"Travel back in time to see what kind of movies (sometimes) did well at the box office in the early 90s. A hugely bankable young female lead, big budget sets and production, a little suspense, a little cheesy romance, loads of plot holes, and performances that are at turns quite solid, enjoyably hammy, and laughable.Roberts is probably the best of the lot as the traumatized young wife trying to escape a husband whose OCD turns into emotional, physical and sexual abuse. Patrick Bergin plays said husband with a campy Gomez-Adams-Gone-Bad vibe, and Kevin Anderson as her other love interest is supposed to be the sensitive, gentle hairy guy who helps heals her. He has dreadful early 90s hair and, I kid you not, is first seen dancing to West Side story with his garden hose. This is supposed to be endearing. It's not.The suspense is quite good in the last third or so of the film, even if Roberts' character makes some highly questionable decisions in her attempts to get free of her creepy spouse. Ever see somebody totally triggered by a really, really organized pantry? You will have if you watch this movie! And I might be triggered by it in the future too. Seriously. I jumped out of my skin when I saw that nice neat stack of cans.The 90s fashion is killer. The little Stepford Wife slip dresses, the high-waisted jeans and cropped sweaters, the long polka dot dress, and the curls! The curls! You know her husband is bad because he doesn't have lots of curls! Straight hair is evil. So are mustaches.A lot of reviewers have mentioned that this is like a Lifetime TV movie. Well, that's where I watched it, and true, it fit in fine.

78,Munin75,Entertaining but mediocre,6,13 March 2012,"Sleeping with the Enemy screams ""I was made in the 90s"" from start to finish, in style and atmosphere. I'm not saying it's a bad thing, but I think it's important to note first and foremost that it's a typical 90s movie, so if you're seeking originality you won't find it watching this one.The subject matter is that of domestic violence, yet the only wife-beating scene is extremely tame, and instead the film focuses on the psychological repercussions of such violence. Unfortunately, that was pretty tame too. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a sadist who'll only like a movie if it contains harsh physical or psychological harm, but when I watch a thriller on domestic violence, I expect it to be thrilling and violent. Sleeping with the Enemy is practically a family-friendly movie. That's not good because actual domestic violence is absolutely terrifying and horrible, and the movie doesn't do the subject justice. No spoilers here, but the climax is also pretty disappointing. The entire movie was (very decently) building for the final confrontation between the spouses, only for it to be surprisingly quick. Meh!The main theme, Berlioz' ""Symphonie Fantastique"" was perhaps chosen as a homage to Kubrick's Shining, which also contains the theme and domestic violence. Unfortunately, whenever the song came up in Sleeping with the Enemy, it only reminded me of how much of a superior movie Shining is.Now, for the good aspects of the film. It's entertaining, which is the least I can ask for in a movie. Not a dull moment. The acting is very decent, and Julia Roberts is at her prime (that is, physically). I must say though, that the two main males (including the abusive husband) weren't in the least bit interesting. Other than that, I don't have much else to say. I'll probably forget most of the movie in a month or two, and I won't want to see it again. It isn't very memorable, but I was entertained enough for 90 minutes.",Sleeping with the Enemy
79,CSM126-1,"""Sleeping with the Enemy:"" Self-Defense Really Isn't Murder. (Spoilers Ahead)",7,26 April 2005,"""Self-defense isn't murder"" That was the tag line of ""Enough"", a film that didn't know the difference between self-defense and pre-meditated murder. It would have been a better tag line for ""Sleeping With the Enemy"", a movie that does know the difference. Whereas Slim plotted and planned her husband's violent death, ""Enemy""'s protagonist, Laura, acts in the heat of a moment and, most importantly, her actions are justified.Laura and Martin have been married for four years, and seem perfectly happy. Unfortunately, Martin's severe Obsessive/Compulsive Disorder and self-confidence issues have put a strain on the marriage. Laura simply can not live up to the standards he needs to keep his OCD under control. If the towels aren't hung correctly on the towel bar, or if the pantry isn't organized just right, he has a fit of uncontrollable anger. When Martin's fits elevate to physical attacks against Laura, she leaves him.Laura fakes her own death and then begins life anew in a small town with a new identity, and she has a romance with a man named Ben.Thankfully the movie doesn't try to justify Laura's running away or her adultery, or make her seem perfect; it simply shows the choices she makes. Whether she makes the right choices is all up to your own moral radar, and I like that. If this were ""Enough"", the case would likely be much different. But this isn't ""Enough"". This is much, much better.""Sleeping With the Enemy"" is a smart film that actually let's the audience see why Laura feels she has the right to leave Martin. Mostly it has to do with her own inability to deal with Martin's mental infirmities, and that's an understandable problem. OCD can ruin lives, and it can seem overwhelming when you try to help someone who suffers from it. I'm not saying it's right to run away, but her fear is legitimately justifiable. And it's obviously her fear that causes her to overlook the possibility of getting Martin some help.Her killing Martin is also justifiable. When he bursts into her house with a gun, that provides a reason to kill him. And, what do you know, it makes sense. Do I even have to say the E word again? We all know that movie provides no good reasons for anything that it's characters do. Even though the end of Sleeping With the Enemy is predictable, it's really the only ending the movie can logically come to by that point so I really can't complain, and I'll stay off my soapbox. Besides, I need to save it for when I review ""Irreversible."" ""Sleeping With the Enemy"" has other merits besides the smart script. For one, the cinematography is beautiful, especially in the early scenes at Laura and Martin's beach-front home. I was left saying ""Wow."" Another selling point is the acting. Julia Roberts, who usually bugs me, does a fine job as Laura. She never takes it into the territory of melodrama or schlock, thankfully. Patrick Bergen, as Martin, does a good job of portraying a sufferer of OCD and, when Laura's ruse is revealed, an enraged husband. He has reason to be angry with Laura for leaving him (or so he believes thanks to his mental issues), plus he has those self-confidence issues that fuel his instability. To some he may seem over-the-top, but to me he seemed very real. Like I said, OCD wrecks those who suffer from it.My only real problems with the movie were the silly way Martin died (Three bullets, and he's still standing? Please!) and an unnecessary dance number with Laura and Ben. Why is it that some filmmakers deem it necessary to use pointless dance routines to show that two people are in love? And what place do songs like ""Runaround Sue"" and ""Brown-Eyed Girl"" have in a movie like this? However distracting those errors may be, ""Sleeping with the Enemy"" is a fine movie that actually makes the effort to realistically portray real issues. And for that, I commend it.",Sleeping with the Enemy
80,corvette-45921,revisited the enemy,2,15 May 2017,"I like most people first saw this movie years ago during a completely different time. Now, re visiting it many years later through more mature worldly eyes, it clearly makes all the flaws so visible now. The most glaring error would be the fact she went out for an evening sail with two men (one her husband) and fails to return home? it would seem that one or both of them might be considered a person of interest? but no, its all wrapped up with a beach side memorial - no body recovered and an untouched house that was clearly not part of any investigation? Secondly I would assume after mustering up the courage to leave an abusive relationship the LAST thing on her mind would be sparking up a romantic interest before she had all her ""starting a new life ducks in a row""? yet she falls right away for an inquisitive young man full of questions about her. As the movie progresses we witness the husband gradually get more and more agitated as he realizes she may still be alive! yet when he first lays eyes on her in the arms of another man, he has the restraint to not say anything and head back to her house to start playing mind games. OH and back to my first point, would it have not been more sensible to have the getaway bag of clothes outside the house? that way she wouldn't have covered the floor with wet sand and salt water foot steps! but I guess it doesn't matter because other than a quick wiping of floor in one area they left that messy part out.",Sleeping with the Enemy

Martin is only interested in having sex with her and becomes very envious when Laura looks at other men. One day he hits her because she looked at the postman. When Laura and Martin drive with a boat suddenly the weather changes ans Laura seems to have fallen into the water. Martin cannot find her and thinks that she is dead. Up to that moment about 15 minutes of the movie are gone. Then the viewer gets to know that Laura swum away and went to another town and bought a house there. There she meets her neighbour Ben and falls in love with him. Martin finds out that Laura is still alive and also finds out where she lives. He goes to her house and tells her that he loves her and wants lo live with her. He also threatens her with a pistol.Laura is scared but suddenly Ben comes in and fights with Martin.Martin loses and dies. End of the film.

We see from Laura's expression that her husband is really raping her. This scene is not on my DVD; it ends right after Laura drops the bowl of strawberries. Why was the scene taken out for the DVD? Perhaps there are enough other clues to Martin's true nature but it is odd that this scene, which is one of the first to clue the audience in to the menace of the situation, is missing. The implications of Martin's favorite music and the Pavlovian horror it instills in Laura is somewhat cheapened by the deletion of the rape scene.

89,hawk-58,Let's answer some of those questions,9,13 July 2007,"I love this movie! I read the book and have seen it many times. I note that the same questions keep appearing over and over. I think by now I am qualified to answer them, or to at least give my opinions.**Why does Laura choose to 'flush' her ring down the toilet instead of taking it off while she is in the ocean or pawning it?** Because she is symbolically ridding herself of Martin and their dysfunctional marriage. She is in a hurry to get out of the house and never stops to think that the ring might remain in the toilet bowl. Under the circumstances, would you? **How did the lady from the YMCA get Martin's work number? And after Martin said he didn't know what she was talking about, why did the lady continue to give Laura's life story?** Martin was a successful Boston businessman. Laura took swim lessons at the Y in Boston for several months and apparently got to know some of the women fairly well. Her name and her husband's name were undoubtedly well known by the time she finished her swim lessons and moved on. It probably only took a look in the Boston phone book to find Martin, as Laura had nothing to hide at the time of the swim lessons (except the bruises, which she explained away) and surely mentioned where he worked, or he had an individual listing. The lady was certain she had the right person when she was talking to Martin, so unfortunately she developed diarrhea of the mouth and provided Martin with too many details.**Why was the ring still in the toilet when Martin cut his finger months later? Didn't he use the toilet in those months? Or does he have a serious digestive problem?** I am surprised so many people overlooked this: the house at the Cape was the Burneys' weekend/summer home. Martin Burney worked in Boston, and they had a house there where they lived during the week. When his wife ""died"", Martin immediately closed up the Cape house - hence the coverings on the furniture when he returned months later - and moved to their house in Boston. Guess he didn't have to pee before he left, or he used one of the other bathrooms in the house.**How did Laura get a house under an alias without a driver's license? What...in Iowa you don't need identification to buy a house or a car? And where did she get the money?** Laura did not BUY a house, she rented it, and for very little, in cash. She apparently bought a used car. As we saw when she returned to the Cape house after faking her death to collect her things and run away, there was a big wad of cash in her travel bag. I don't remember all the details from the book, but obviously she had been saving money all along. She worked part-time at the library in Boston (after her 8:00 a.m. swim lessons, one presumes), so had her own money as well as whatever she could save from the money Martin gave her for groceries, etc. Money talks, in Iowa like anywhere else! **Just because Laura didn't want to have sex with Ben, Ben asks ""Oh my god, what did he do to you?' How the heck does he know that anything happened? What does he have as evidence besides the facts that he called her in a crowd and she didn't respond, and she had a bruise on her head? That's a pretty great assumption to make.** Ben was a perceptive, intelligent guy. He knew right after meeting her that something was seriously wrong in her life and that she was hiding her identity for a reason. He put things together pretty quickly, but figuring out that she was running from an abusive man wasn't exactly rocket science with all the clues she gave out.**And the thing that really makes me mad. She hears a noise so it must be her husband. Instead of calling the cops or running out of the house...she goes and checks the cabinets to see if all of the cans are neatly arranged. I know that this does happenbut if your husband was in your house, what the heck would make you think that he took the time to arrange your cabinet and he's not just going to kill you?** The man had been terrorizing her for four years. She was paranoid. She wasn't thinking clearly and was doubting her sanity. Call it Suspense Movie Syndrome - just gotta look in that dark room/closet!",Sleeping with the Enemy

92,Dianafan79,"Creepy, disturbing and emotional thriller",8,29 May 2007,"Sleeping With The Enemy is a powerful movie about one man's obsession and violence towards his wife and her desperate bid to escape from them. Julia Roberts is very powerful as the abused wife, Laura and Patrick Bergin is cold and malicious as her husband, Martin.The film has a very strong introduction, in which the scene is set. On the surface Laura Burney has everything. A nice, huge ocean front house and a husband that appears to dote on her. But, as we see all is not perfect. We first see Martin's control over his wife when she is dressing for a party and she is wearing a lovely dress, but her husband requests she wears a slinky, backless number and Laura refers to how cold it is outside. The next scene cuts to them at the mentioned party and she is indeed, wearing the dress he orders her to. Throughout the next few scenes you see Martin and all his control freak ways. She has to line up the bathroom towels as he likes them, puts the kitchen larder in order just as he likes it. There are also a couple of sex scenes too, in which you see Laura barely able to put a face on the fact she is not liking her husband being anywhere near her.Finally, after a beating Laura realised enough is enough and when her husband tells her they are going sailing, she plans her escape.The rest of the film shows how Laura changes her name and goes to live in Iowa where her mother, who had suffered a stroke, is in a nursing home. She moves into a huge family sized house and meets a charming and friendly man from next door, Ben who helps her to adapt to a more normal life. Although I like the film, it's in this part that I feel the film starts to drag a slight bit but the performances are still strong.In the end, her husband who, upon finding Laura's discarded wedding ring, tracks her down using private detectives. I wont tell you the ending but it's a powerful climatic ending to a film that has strength of both character and plot all the way through.I would highly recommend this film. I feel it's one of Julia Roberts best films and Patrick Bergin is marvellous as the controlling, menacing husband. Although this has Julia Roberts in it, don't' be put off by it if your male, it certainly isn't 'just another chick flick'. It's quite suspenseful and you really do feel sorry for Julia Roberts and feel quite a strong hatred for Martin.Another film was made a few years ago, Enough, starring Jennifer Lopez. Although it's a good film in a similar vane, I'd recommend watching this one, or at least watch this first if you plan to watch Enough.

94,DoomDealer,Well worth watching,7,15 March 2014,"I'm not a fan of Julia Roberts (or Patrick Bergin, for that matter) and watching this film again after some years reminded me why. To be fair, it was still quite early on in Robert's career, and it's obvious that she was still trying to find her place in Hollywood and a foothold as an actor.Sleeping With The Enemy is a very good film, with what has to be one of Bergin's strongest performances. A somewhat underrated actor, he carries much of the film alone. His performance of the abusive, controlling and manipulative husband is very believable. He really does come across as a genuinely evil character. Julia Robert's performance lacks confidence, so consequently she is just dithering along for most of the film, and Kevin Anderson doesn't really deserve a mention. In fact, you could take out Anderson's part/ character and it wouldn't really affect the film.On a whole Sleeping With The Enemy is well worth watching; it's from a time when Hollywood was still trying to come up with something good (on occasion). Yes, there are holes, it's predictable and it may not be all that realistic, but it's very well acted, scripted, shot and even has a great, memorable score.What more could you want?",Sleeping with the Enemy
95,Wilson102,Second worst big budget film I have ever seen,2,10 September 2009,"Yes there are worse movies out there. Most of them made for fun, on a shoe string budget, or as a t.v. movie of the week, but even if this was the 'movie of the week' it would rate no more than two stars. It is a poor movie about a serious subject featuring an abused woman who flees the king of the slime people in to the protective arms of the king of the wussy people. ( If this is an attempt to show that she doesn't need a man to protect her than wuss man is superfluouse to the film and ought not to be in it at all). It has no suspense, no character development, and an heroine that could be outsmarted by a rotton onion. ( I think she flushes her wedding ring on a boat with a self contained tank rather than just dropping it overboard in the ocean (where her body should be anyway) and after the husband finds her, demonstrating that she is a moron, she still makes childish assumptions that lead to almost getting her killed.)

The acting is so incredibly convincing. Patrick Bergin gets an A+ for being incredibly spooky and making the audience despise him. In contrast, Kevin Anderson provides the epitome of what a man should be. He couldn't be more adorable.

Honestly, the movie became a bit too obvious after Martin found out the whereabouts of his wife Laura. The real suspense came more towards the beginning of the movie especially with Laura's great escape, I didn't see that coming since it was emphasized that she couldn't swim. The main line of evidence that Laura was still alive was quite foolish if you ask me. If I were to flush a ring down the toilet I strongly doubt it would still be floating around a few months later, that's not very plausible.

If plot holes make you mad then it might be time to consider not watching movies anymore!Third, since when do we expect characters to never make mistakes? The story was unrealistic because Laura made a few errors. Newsflash! People mess up all the time in real life. If they didn't, criminals would never be caught by the police.

I guess she's perfect? Too bad for her. I feel like everyone needs to know if they don't already.1990 article on her comments about Abbeville: JULIA ROBERTS didn't exactly love Abbeville, S.C., where she worked on a film recently. In an interview in this month's Rolling Stone, the actress, who starred in the film ''Pretty Woman,'' called the town ''horribly racist'' and ''living hell.'' Yesterday the region's citizens replied. ''Pretty Woman? Pretty Low,'' read the headline of an advertisement in Variety. In an open letter to the actress, the Proud Citizens of Upstate South Carolina defended their town. Hundreds contributed money to pay for the advertisement ($500), which was written by a local agency. MIKE GALLAGHER, a disk jockey on radio station WFBC-AM, urged his listeners to contribute.''People were pretty outraged,'' said JOE ERWIN, president of Erwin-Penland Advertising in Greenville, about 45 miles from Abbeville.

And make no bones about it, it's nothing more than a Julia Roberts vehicle, but unfortunately, her performance is not the most lacklustre thing about it.The plot has all the markings of a late night made-for-cable, and don't be under the impression that it will offer any insight into the dark world of domestic abuse because non of the characters are sketched out enough for you to really care.

106,stevenverb-1,Watchable at best!,3,8 June 2010,"Having seen this movie for the first time in years, I can safely say it is an easy, entertaining watch, but my praise stops there i'm afraid. The story of an abused wife who goes to extreme measures, quickly becomes as predictable as the day after Friday is Saturday. The real highlight is that it proved Julia Roberts could act and go beyond rom-com roles. However the same can't be said for Patrick Bergin and Kevin Anderson. Bergin speaks in a soft voice and bulges his eyes to make him scary, which he fails miserably at; Kevin Anderson's character is neither likable nor realistic. It is little wonder that neither of these two actors careers have progressed that much since this film. Also this film has so many unexplained and unrealistic moments that it becomes laughable by the end of the film. How after, i'm assuming at least weeks, does the YWCA decide to call Bergin and tell of Laura's life story? How did Bergin not spot the ring in the toilet before? How did Laura pay for a home for her mother without the supposed dominant husband getting wind of it? How did Laura suddenly become a brilliant swimmer? I ask this because even a reasonable good swimmer would struggle in a storm on the ocean, yet Robert's character was practically a novice, but swims to shore with ease! How come Laura's mum did not recognise Martin's voice when her daughter was with him for four years? What are the odds they never met? It is an insult to blind people as they recognise people by their voices! Why would Martin suffocate Laura's mum? What would it achieve? Wouldn't it be blatantly clear he killed her since he was the last person seen in her room? Also say Robert's character is at the most is 30, why does her mother look more as though she is pushing 80? So that would make her pushing 50 when she gave birth. How does Martin know where Laura lives before he has even started to follow her? He seems to have rearranged a lot as well in the short space of time he has in the house, would even a crazed lunatic go to such lengths? Also when he is in the house he seems to be the greatest ever player of hide and seek. Its only a small house yet he manages to stay out of sight, whilst over-running a bath, rearranging cans, straightening towels and making a hi-fi turn on by itself.

107,WackyKacky,"Interesting plot line, but some things unbelievable",6,25 September 2013,"I enjoyed this movie on a few levels, and there where things that I found totally unbelievable. The story line is basic: an abused woman who flees from her abuser, the enemy, who happens to be her husband. I picked up something watching a second time. It was when the abused woman (Julia Roberts) calls her mother who was blind and in a care facility. The main character said she had a job and was making her own money. It made me think that possibly the reason she may have remained in the abusive relationship was because she didn't know if she could make it on her own (support herself) without him. She was young and beautiful, but basically uneducated. She is wined and dined by a rich, handsome, powerful man (a policeman) that she marries, thinking he was her prince charming and she his princess. His OCD and lack of ability to view her as a human but only as a possession means a horrible existence for her, filled with fear, as he beats her and completely controls every aspect of her life. She plans her escape and waits for the opportunity, and then it presents itself. Here is where the plot begins to become unbelievable to me. When the impromptu opportunity arises, and time is of her essence for her to make her escape, she takes the time to cut her hair, change her clothes, throw her wedding ring in the toilet, and basically leave a ton of clues that she didn't perish the way he was going to think she perished.This is possibly her once in a lifetime opportunity to get away from this monster and she risks it by taking time at their home doing things that could easily have waited. Of course, she finds a love interest in a town far away. But I think the movie failed to really show the fall-back of women who have been abused for years. I think it would have been much harder that they portrayed it and I think she would have looked over her shoulder for years, possibly always. Forget about sitting on the front porch so soon after she escaped. I also didn't believe the mother daughter relationship. Maybe it was her grandmother and I missed it? Anyway, it lacked believability. And even though the mother didn't know the husband, she did know her daughter had to show up in male disguise to see her and had flown for her life and still harboring fear of being recognized and it getting back to him somehow. As a mother, I would have been way too hesitant to talk to someone who just showed up in my room asking questions about my kid without knowing exactly who I was speaking with. This mother just handed up the info and every detail to the psycho husband. Yes, I know she couldn't see him, but she knew enough about the situation to have been on guard.Lastly, in the final scene when she calls the police to report she had just shot an intruder, why not simply say the truth. She had just shot her husband? Ben was there to back things up (albeit he had been knocked out by the husband). Was this abused woman ever going to get her real identity back now?

Whilst trying to affect an American accent, Patrick Burgin starts shouting Laura in an Irish accent - so obvious I had to google him immediately to see where in the Uk/Ireland he was from. Pretty poor.. In his defence, the actor who played Ben was nearly as shocking! He's supposed to be the knight in shining armour, yet he just comes across as leechy and clingy, and throws her around like a rag doll when they're dancing, despite knowing about her past. Then at the final scene, he's absolutely useless! The errors are also so ridiculous it's confusing that this wasn't a comedy! Julia Roberts cuts her hair at her shoulders to run away to Iowa...but by the time she reaches Iowa her hair is back the way it was, and stays this way for the rest of the movie.

When i watched this as a teen, there was always something fishy i could not put my finger on - it didn't sit right. Well, now i know Julia Roberts was cast at 22 years old and her 'mother' in the movie was a 69 year old actress who looked more like a great-grandmother. It was so weird, and still is. I don't think anybody else has commented on this. This is not a criticism of the acting ability - i was just too conflicted to take the mother/daughter scenario seriously - and it was intricate to the plot! A woman of 40-ish could still have been afflicted with blindness or stroke or any number of ailments that required clinical care, so i was baffled by the granny.The love interest guy wore brown contact lens, when he has natural blue eyes. This made his eyes have no flecks of color, or resemblance to real eyes in human form - i always thought that was a strange thing.Also, when he first approached her at night - in the garden picking apples - and creeped up on her stating they could arrive at an ""arrangement"" she should have whopped him in the head! That come-on lacked finesse, to say the least!And our savvy heroine flushes her wedding ring down the toilet (presumably because she wants no reminders) and looks away without checking to see if it has actually been flushed away! But what? Why? There is a whole OCEAN next door where it could disappear, poetically, into oblivion. But, nah, yeah, the TOILET in their house is good too!And lastly, when he takes her to school to play dress-up in drama class wardrobe pieces, just so he can get pervy and watch Julia's character undress, and he dances with her... Notice how he literally jolts her arms/body with every move he makes. He is trying to rip off her limbs and cause spiritual pain. The actor literally cannot dance to save a life, and she would have been sore and in pain after a twirl on the dancefloor with that oaf.As for the husband, his character is sufficiently crazed and commandeering, however the relationship displayed no truth.

He was only interested in getting into her pants and totally insensitive to her. This type of woman is always attracted to and attracting this same type of man. This movie would have been much better if they had an older lady and/or older man who lived next door who would help her to feel better about herself. Not a potential boy friend. It sends the wrong message that you can leave a three year life of hell and in a week set your whole life up with another person (as long as they don't play classical music). The ending of the movie is the really sad part. She chooses to kill her attacker. She decides not to give him mercy. It would have been better written if this little aside hadn't happened. Once again, it gives the wrong message that you have to kill the person that you chose to marry and live with in order to get away. In real life she couldn't have killed him and gotten away with it. If she had left after the first or second abuse happened then she would've been better off psychologically and physically. Exactly how long did it take her to figure out she needed to leave? This film could have been better written with a more solid, substantial story-line and less predictable. Julia Roberts acting was still emerging at this point in her career and not as matured and well acted as her later performances.

Maybe I'm wrong, but I understood the real enemy to be the guy Julia Roberts ends up with at the end of the movie, not her husband. Here's why. There is a paragraph in the book that describes her husband as he's driving down the road, his fist is clenched, he's angry (I'm sorry...I don't have the book with me or I'd give a page number). Later in the book another chapter starts out the exact same way...practically word for word. In fact, I thought I had opened the book to the wrong page. But as I re-read the paragraph, I realized that the second one was describing the NEW guy, not Julia Robert's husband. That's when the hair on the back of my neck stood up. She was hooking up with a guy exactly like the man from whom she was trying to escape...and didn't realize it! Other bits and pieces in the story only strengthened my conviction--the guy hits the wall (if I remember correctly) as he's thinking about his former girlfriend who had made him so mad because he couldn't control her in some way or other--another control freak. Other things. And the whole rest of the story I kept screaming, ""No! Stay away from him! He's bad! He's the enemy too!"" I don't know. What do you think? Did anyone else catch that?

While I understand that it's supposed to be empowering to abused women, Julia Robert's character is a cowardly liar. She's depicted as a poor, beautiful princess being imprisoned by a cruel domineering man. So why didn't she leave him before the first bruises faded? She obviously married someone she didn't really know (who DOES that, by the way?) and from the looks of their setup, she married him for the money. Instead, she lies to him about her mother's death, creates an elaborate scheme to run away from her problems, rather than facing them, endangers her mother, endangers her new boyfriend (adultery anyone?), is lying to the federal government... the list goes on. But she's supposed to be a strong female character?? Then, when her husband, who obviously is suffering from OCD, or some similar mental illness, comes hunting her down, she provokes him, then murders him.
