0,SnoopyStyle,Did the guys get dumber?,5,27 July 2015,"Nick Hendricks (Jason Bateman), Kurt Buckman (Jason Sudeikis) and Dale Arbus (Charlie Day) are best friends who quit their jobs and bet it all on their invention, the Shower Buddy. Rex Hanson (Chris Pine) and his father Bert Hanson (Christoph Waltz) offer to buy 100k units for their catalog business but then double cross them by canceling the order. The guys decide to kidnap Rex with the help of some of the characters from the first movie.The guys were stupid in the first movie. Dale was a first class idiot. I just don't remember Kurt being as dumb as Dale. It seems like the guys are trying way too hard. The banter overwhelms the movie. It needs to scale back the cross talk a little bit. It's not comedic dialog just because the guys talk over each other.",Horrible Bosses 2
1,Prismark10,Just Horrible,2,1 March 2015,"In the first Horrible Bosses our intrepid trio tended to add two part incompetence with every bad idea they had and the film mixed laughs with just the right dose of dark humour.In Horrible Bosses 2, this time the mark is Christoph Waltz as the Boss who cheats Day, Bateman and Sudeikis over their Shower Buddy product and decide to kidnap his smarmy son, Chris Pine who is also in on the kidnap so they can all split the ransom.Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Aniston and Jamie Foxx who appeared in the first film, pop up again. Things that does not return is a plot, script and jokes.The trio just drone on and on until you are on the edge of entering a deep coma, then Day's irritating character pulls you out of it before the babbling begins again. Its all filler because the film has no proper script. Waltz in fact only makes a cameo in this movie and is left to Pine to salvage what he can with this film.The first film had some inventiveness in its dark comedy, even had some cod Hitchcockian overtures. This was just a shambles and the fact that it contains a few laughs saves it from a total bomb rating.",Horrible Bosses 2
2,nogodnomasters,THE AMERICAN DREAM IS MADE IN CHINA,6,22 August 2018,"Our three amigos decide to go into business for themselves as they patent ""The Shower Buddy."" They sign a contract which ends up with the parent company screwing them over. They opt to kidnap Rex, the boss's son (Chris Pine) but mess that up. As it turns out Rex wants to be kidnapped and helps them out. As in the first feature things blow up in their face.Aniston revives her foul mouthed role which made the first feature super fun. However the comedy in this film is end loaded and it takes a long time for the laughs to come.My advice is a rental.Guide: F-bomb, brief small screen sex. No nudity. Crude humor.",Horrible Bosses 2
3,kosmasp,Untying loose ends,8,4 June 2015,"I know that doesn't make sense, contrary to what we get to see here. Which does make sense. We know the characters know (see part 1 for that), but we do get new ones thrown into the mix for good measure. Though those that were here, go even bigger than in Part 1 (that goes for one male and female character, who could be considered ""guest"" appearances by some, who incredible in this).The new guys in this are really good too, especially Chris Pine. He is so charming and engaging and gives it his everything. The power dynamic he brings into this is almost overshadowing our ""bad guy"" Waltz. If you liked the first movie, you'll love this (it's at least as good as that one was).",Horrible Bosses 2
4,lee_eisenberg,work to be funny,8,27 July 2015,"I only saw the original movie earlier this year, so I had been hoping to see the sequel. Now I've seen it. Having left their original jobs, Nick, Kurt and Dale try to launch their own business, only to see an investor back out and leave them in debt. So, the three morons try to hatch a scheme to get their money back. It's a riot watching Nick, Kurt and Dale end up in a series of embarrassing situations as they try to find a way to get back at the father-and-son investors. ""Horrible Bosses 2"" is one of those movies that makes no pretense about what kind of movie it is. It's a safe bet that Jason Bateman, Jason Sudeikis and Charlie Day had fun filming the movie (the whole sequence with the sex addiction group meeting is wacky enough to merit its own movie). It was particularly interesting seeing Christoph Waltz and Chris Pine (Capt. Kirk in the current Star Trek movies) in the movie.You're sure to love it.",Horrible Bosses 2
5,paul_haakonsen,"Yeah, it's a sequel alright...",4,9 June 2018,"This sequel was not even half as fun and entertaining as the first ""Horrible Bosses"" movie was. Why? Well, it just had too much of a mundane and generic storyline, and it was lacking the originality and humor that was present in the first movie.Sure the movie had a good ensemble of actors and actresses, and it was nice to see people revisit their roles from the first movie, but it was a shame that they had so very little to work with in terms of a proper script and storyline. Jason Bateman, Jason Sudeikis and Charlie Day certainly did carry the movie. It was also some nice performances from Jennifer Aniston, Kevin Spacey, Jamie Foxx, Chris Pine, Christoph Waltz and Jonathan Banks, just a shame that they had such small roles to play.There were some casual laughs here and there, but the movie just felt forced and was running on autopilot. And that is what made this movie crash and burn for me. It simply lacked originality and the ability to bring out some good and proper laughs.This is hardly a movie that you will watch a second time.",Horrible Bosses 2
6,blanche-2,not as good as the original,5,16 June 2017,"In this sequel, the guys (Bateman, Jason Sudeikis, Dale Arbus) have invented the Shower Buddy, which shampoos your hair and washes you at once. The son of a huge catalog company, Rex Hanson (Chris Pine) calls them in and makes an offer - a one time fee and their company takes over the product. The guys refuse, then find out the offer was for $3 million and is now off the table.Then Rex's dad (Christoph Waltz) enters the office, orders 100,000 units, and gives them the name of his bank so they can obtain a loan and get started. After they have manufactured the units, daddy totally screws them over, as he planned to all along. The guys find themselves out $500,000 and have lost rights to their product. It's time to take their usual ineffectual action. And this time, they have an unlikely ally.The usual suspects are back - Jennifer Aniston. Kevin Spacey, Jamie Foxx, and they're all very good. The humor in this film seemed even raunchier than the first, unappreciated by yours truly, which is why I hate these comedies.Chris Pine was hilarious, and Christoph Waltz was excellent as well.The best part? The outtakes during the closing credits.",Horrible Bosses 2
7,edwagreen,*1/2,4,3 August 2015,"Not a very good film and in fact the prequel wasn't good either.The premise which starts out is a good one where 3 losers attempt to start their own business but are thwarted by ruthless capitalist Chris Waltz and his ever shrewd son.Seeking revenge they attempt to kidnap the son in order to get ransom. This appears to fail until the son joins them in the plot to get even with his father for not supporting him in the lifestyle he is accustomed to.The film goes downhill in quality as it is shown how inept these three jerks really are, but at the same time things appear to go their way until the son kills the father and attempts to blame them for the murder so that he can really cash in.The chase scene in this inane film is really about the best this film is able to offer.",Horrible Bosses 2
8,Scarecrow-88,Horrible Bosses 2,3,27 November 2015,"Jason Bateman, Jason Sudeikis, and Charlie Day return as the ""if it could go wrong, it normally does"" trio, now hoping to start their own business, getting manipulated by a shady business investor worth millions (Christoph Waltz), soon deciding to kidnap the son (Chris Pine; the best part about the sequel) of this unscrupulous scumbag. Pine convinces them to collaborate with him in a kidnap scenario after they decide to back out, influenced by him to agree to participate or be turned in to the cops (Jonathan Banks is the head kidnapping investigator). Pine has diabolical plans of his own and it involves screwing the trio over (of course). Get ready for countless crude jokes and profanity for profanity sake. Kevin Spacey returns as a former *horrible boss* from the previous film, still in prison and top heavy with insults and rage-singed-diatribes aimed squarely at the trio who visit him time to time for advice. Jennifer Anniston also returns as the sex-addicted boss of Day, still desperately wanting to include him in her ""cock hall of fame"". This film is certainly unafraid to posit any offensive line of dialogue into the comedy that it can muster. I thought the film tries too damn hard to make you laugh, and no matter how talented those involved might be (I realize Day has his fans, but this guy's hyper-voiced deliver grates my nerves something fierce), if the jokes flatline and the plot offers nothing clever, the dead pan and rapid-fire delivery by the actors just won't have the juice necessary to make magic happen. Pine, out of the cast, gets the best lines and shines as this devious prick who suckers the film's heroes into his masterplan to see pops dead and the inheritance all going to him. Jamie Fox is the third supporting actor to return from the previous film, getting an untraceable phone for the trio and slickly finagling his way into their situation, eyeing the five million Pine fools the trio into negotiating pops for. There's a cop car chase, gunfire (that wounds Day, leading to his coma and Anniston taking advantage of his inability to avoid her sexual contact!), and backstabbings, with the trio more often than not naïve recipients of a lot of hard luck. They just seem to always place themselves in difficult situations (the point of the comedy although their stupidity does make them look so foolish the laughs turn to pity. I think the three stars really want to make the material work and try hard, but I just found the script rather lacking. Think of how the quality deteriorated during the Hangover series and apply it to the HB sequel.",Horrible Bosses 2
9,view_and_review,Not Horrible but Not Great Either,6,25 February 2015,"Horrible Bosses is one of, if not my favorite three headed comedy film. That's Horrible Bosses the first one. Part two is like most sequels, a hollow shell of its predecessor with only the title and the actors as a commonality. HB2 started off well enough with the scene in the news station, even with the sophomoric unintentional/intentional sexual humor. The story was even good as well for a sequel. Many sequels throw together any old hair-brained story just to get a sequel out there but this one seemed clever and well thought out. The considerable drop from part one to part two were the characters Dale Arbus (Charlie Day) and Kurt Buckman (Jason Sudeikis). Maybe I didn't notice it the first time around but they were too talkative and too annoying in HB2. Jason Bateman does a satisfactory job as the straight man, Nick, while Kurt was a rambler and Dale was just whiney. Seriously, Dale's voice was becoming like nails on a chalkboard.There were still some chuckles to be had. The scenes with M.F'er Jones (Jamie Foxx) and Dave Harken (Kevin Spacey) were a breath of fresh air though there was no good replacement for Colin Farrel's character, Bobby Pellit. Chris Pine was alright though his character was there for the over-the-top prickery. So, as a follow up to a really funny movie, just think of The Hangover 2 except maybe not that big of a drop off.",Horrible Bosses 2

More-of-the-same sequel with the three dim-witted buddies reteaming in an attempt to self-start a business for themselves find out only to be swindled by a douche father/son team (Waltz and Pine) in the process with them resorting to their would-be-criminal ways in a kidnapping ploy that winds up becoming more than they bargained for. While the three principals' chemistry keeps the bond of idiocy intact the screenplay by Sean Anders, John Morris & Jonathan M. Goldstein & John Francis Daley meanders more into easy-for-laughs vulgarity than any other point of being made comedy with by-the-numbers direction by Anders. Aniston has a field day as her over-sexed boss from hell and Foxx add a bit more flava than the first film. Frequently funny but one big mess altogether.",Horrible Bosses 2
11,neil-476,"Comical, but far too much unnecessary swearing",7,5 December 2014,"Following the misadventures of the first film, our three friends (level-headed Jason Bateman and his dozy buddies Jason Sudeikis and Charlie Day) decide to be their own bosses, following which they almost immediately make some disastrous business decisions which allow nefarious big business tycoon Christoph Waltz to swindle them out of their company. A lame-brained plan to kidnap and ransom Waltz' son Chris Pine turns from a bad idea to a worse idea when the son invites himself into the plot.The first film recycles the plot of Strangers On A Train, this one recycles the plot of Ruthless People, but the main difference between this film and the first one is that the Sudeikis and Day characters have gone from being merely incredibly stupid to so monumentally stupid that it's difficult to comprehend how they are still alive. Bateman does a phenomenal job in anchoring these two characters, who have strayed deeply into unbelievability, in the real world.There is a VAST amount of foul language in this film – far, far more than is necessary. And yet, despite these two criticisms, I quite enjoyed it, and laughed a fair amount. Mostly I think that this is because of the easy chemistry between the three main characters and especially Bateman's kind, reasonable attempts (all doomed to failure) to steer a best possible course through the villainy of the antagonists and the chaos of the two other protagonists.This film is far from perfect, but I quite enjoyed it anyway.",Horrible Bosses 2
12,morrison-dylan-fan,Horrible Bosses 2:The theatrical cut.,8,29 May 2015,"After recently enjoying the first movie in the Horrible Bosses series,I was pleased to discover that a friend had recently picked up the sequel,which led to me getting ready to find out how horrible the bosses could be again.The plot:Wanting to become their own bosses, Nick Hendricks, Dale Arbus & Kurt Buckman invent a machine called a ""Shower Buddy"" and start searching round for an investor.Meeting the major father and son business team of Rex & Bert Hanson,the guys are left speechless,when the Hanson's order 1000s of their devices,with a promise of paying millions once the items are made.Thrilled to announce to their new business partners that they have made all of the stock (after borrowing $500,000 in order to set up a factory) Nick,Dale & Kurt discover that they have been betrayed,when the Buckman's reveal that they are going back on the deal,so that they can buy the stock and business up cheap when it goes bust.Up to their eyes in debt,the guys try to think up a way to pay off the debt.Reaching their wits end,the Nick,Dale and Kurt suddenly decide that the best way to pay off the debts is to get cash from Bert Hanson,by kidnapping his son Nick.View on the film:Kicking off with a hilarious innuendo scene,the screenplay by co- writer/(along with John Morris/Jonathan M. Goldstein/John Francis Daley & John Morris ) director Sean Anders runs the film into pitch black Comedy oil,which goes from physical comedy such as the guys going undercover for their kidnap attempt,to dry punch lines.such as Nick finding out that a group he has joined,is far from the AA group therapy that he imagined.Along with the sharp Comedy bite,the writers also show a real tightening of the bond between the team from the first one,with Nick,Dale & Kurt each playing their own part in the planning of the kidnap.Ripping up his good boy looks, Chris Pine gives a brilliant performance as Rex Hanson,thanks to Pine showing that behind Rex's good looks is a barking-made psychopath,who is not only a threat to the guys,but also to his own dad (played by a very good Christoph Waltz.) Ganging up again, Jason Bateman, Jason Sudeikis and Charlie Day each give fantastic performances,with Day's frantic energy and Sudeikis excellent awkwardness being underpinned by Bateman's calm, collective manner,as Nick,Kurt & Dale find out how horrible a boss can be.",Horrible Bosses 2
13,anaconda-40658,Not Horrible But Inferior to Original.,7,14 January 2016,"Horrible Bosses 2 (2014): Dir: Sean Anders / Cast: Jason Bateman, Charlie Day, Jason Sudeikis, Chris Pine, Christoph Waltz: Sequel to the 2011 comedy hit that is surprisingly not horrible. What works is a screenplay that avoids duplicating the previous film. Jason Bateman, Charlie Day and Jason Sudeikis return and they have gone into business for themselves with a product called Shower Buddy. An investor makes a promising order to which places all three in debt when he cancels the order with other sinister plans. To retaliate they plan to kidnap his bratty young adult son. Things take an unexpected turn when the son wants in on the kidnapping in hopes of punishing his father for lack of attention. What follows is a series of twist surprises that work both for plot as well as comic blunders. The third act wraps with a sly twist on the already screwed up plan. Sean Anders previously made Sex Drive as well as the Adam Sandler tripe That's My Boy. Here he avoids a xerox with only effective references and cameos from the first film. Bateman, Day and Sudeikis maintain hilarity as they struggle with a plan that they continue to hilariously blotch. Chris Pine makes a great comic addition as the spoiled son whose reaction to the plan shocks the leads before crucial information surfaces. The invaluable Christoph Waltz plays the crooked investor whose conscience is divided with regards to his wealth and his son. This is mainly just a pointless sequel full of more gross humour than the first film but points can be given to a screenplay that avoids the duplication that so many sequels render to thus resulting in a horrible viewing experience. Score: 7 / 10",Horrible Bosses 2
14,HotToastyRag,"If you liked the first one, you'll like this",6,12 June 2017,"Just as raunchy and filthy as its predecessors, Horrible Bosses 2 feature the same three leads and follows them through their wild, only-in-Hollywood adventures.Without spoiling any plot points from the first one, I'll just say that the sequel's plot is slightly different. In this one, the three friends decide to become their own bosses. Start-up businesses are hard, and when two good-looking rich guys (Christoph Waltz and Chris Pine, in case you were wondering) get in their way, the three idiots come up with a plan that's, well, not a good or legal idea.If you didn't like the first one, you're not going to like the second one. If you're over fifty or don't like raunchy, twenty-something humor, you're not going to like either one. If you liked the first one, chances are you'll think this one's funny, too.Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children.

15,FlashCallahan,A pretty bland effort....,5,23 December 2014,"Nick, Dale and Kurt decide to start their own business, but they need investors. A father and son owned company makes them a proposal which requires them to take out a big loan. But they set them up so that they can take over their business cheaply. Unless they can come up with the money to pay the loan, they'll lose everything. That's when they come up with the plan to kidnap the son for ransom which they will use to pay the loan. But they are not good kidnappers, and the son learns what they are planning and decides to go along with them and ask for more money than they wanted.....So this is what happens now in Hollywood. If a film is a success, and everyone is up for it, make a not very good sequel, because people will go and see it anyway, and it will make enough on its first weekend to take away the whiff of its banality.Plus, add more racism, innuendo, and swearing, and there you have it, a sequel to a film that when you think about it wasn't that good anyway.Charlie Day is again the best thing about the film, and the other two just stand around seeing who can be the most smug.Foxx pops up, and isn't terrible, and Aniston returns to prove that you can still try to get away with acting twenty when your clearly not.The inclusion of Waltz was the draw here, but alas, he's hardly in it, and when he is, he looks just a little bored. Pine is over the top, too over the top and just seems out of place in this.So all in all, it's just a cheap cash in on a reasonably successful film that wasn't really that good.No wonder Spacey seems so angry in this.",Horrible Bosses 2
16,mm-39,What I expected.,6,10 December 2014,"Horrible Bosses 2 is funny for a cheap laugh! Not a great film but I needed a laugh. Bateman and his two co-stars create a comic synergy with their huge character flaws. The film has a three stooges style of humor. Spacey and Foxx add to the story with their abrasive characters. Waltz's role was regrettably stale, and did not stand out. Aniston provides the toilet humor which digresses the deprived script even further. Was this a memorable film with a strong social message? No. Was Horrible Bosses 2 similar to the cheap laugh movie Porky's ? Yes. Did I enjoy the cheap laughs? Yes. Is it a great film? No. I give Horrible Bosses 2 a 6 out of 10.",Horrible Bosses 2

Most of the times they are just not good, sometimes it's the same movie as the first one, and sometimes they are just as good or even better. I thought this one was at the same level as the first one. I had fun watching it. Almost all the actors made me laugh, sometimes more sometimes less. Some characters are less humorous in their role, because the character is just stupid, but nevertheless this movie is fun to watch. I think all the actors are great in this movie, and the story might not be the best story ever but I was not expecting a great story anyway when it's a laid back comedy. Fun to watch with some stupid jokes as well.",Horrible Bosses 2
18,Mr-Fusion,"More bosses, less laughs",6,26 October 2016,"""Horrible Bosses 2"" is chock-full of terrible ideas and progressively bad results. I mean this from a narrative standpoint. Getting revenge on your boss was a great hook for the first movie, but here, it's just one ill-advised move after another. It's amazing these guys don't end up dead and buried in the desert.What was off with this movie, as a sequel, is the chemistry between the three stars - which is really a lot of yammering over each other. The real magic here is in the supporting cast (Kevin Spacey, Chris Pine), particularly Jamie Foxx, who steals the movie in the dark of night. I don't think I've ever seen him fitting so well in a comedic role (in my defense, I've never seen ""The Jamie Foxx Show""). But if you ask me, the lion's share of the humor comes directly from him.6/10",Horrible Bosses 2

Sure, the second-hour, where our ill-fated protagonists plan to execute their plan, could've been shorter, with a better climax. But otherwise, this sequel is a riot. The sequences, one after the other, especially the ones with Horrible Bosses Veterans (Portrayed superbly by Kevin Spacey, Jamie Foxx & Jennifer Aniston), bring the house down!

Editing is good. Performance-Wise: Jason Bateman, one of the finest actors in the block, delivers a truly committed performance, yet again! Charlie Day is first-rate, he contributes to some of the film's funniest bits enormously. Jason Sudeikis supports very well. Christoph Waltz deserved more scope, nonetheless, he's passable.

20,KineticSeoul,The epitome of what a comedy sequel shouldn't be,2,8 January 2015,"""Horrible Bosses 2"" is the epitome of how to make a awful movie by milking a actually fun comedy. This was just difficult to sit through, with the plot and characters getting dragged out. Characters such as Jennifer Aniston that worked for the first ""Horrible Bosses"" just came off lame with this sequel. The constant arguing, babbling, bicker nonsense just got old, dull and annoying really quickly. Sure, there is dumb but funny comedy and characters than there is dumb and super annoying. This one is the latter, with characters that come off super dumb with no commom sense what so ever and it gets very irritating to watch. I could tell it's because the actors were trying super extremely hard to be funny but it isn't. It's like watching someone trying super hard to act cool that it comes off foolish kind of deal here. The characters that was fun to watch in the first one, gets bland after they get exposed a bit too much. Kevin Spacey and Jamie Fox was passable. They really should have just ended it with the first one, like really should have. It just ruined what could have been known as a stand out funny comedy with this sequel.2.3/10",Horrible Bosses 2
21,Hellmant,I wasn't a fan of the original 'HORRIBLE BOSSES' but I absolutely love this sequel!,9,3 December 2014,"'HORRIBLE BOSSES 2': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Sequel to the 2011 hit comedy flick 'HORRIBLE BOSSES', which was about three friends who team together to try to murder their bosses. This time the buddies plot to kidnap the adult son of a rich businessman, who conned them out of their own business dreams. All of the main cast, of the original film, is back for this installment (except Colin Farrell, who's character died in the first movie); including Jason Bateman, Jason Sudeikis, Charlie Day, Jennifer Aniston, Jamie Foxx, Kevin Spacey and Lindsay Sloane. They're joined this time around by Chris Pine and Christoph Waltz. It was directed by Sean Anders and written by Anders and John Morris (along with John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein). Anders and Morris are the same team that wrote other popular comedy flicks like 'SEX DRIVE' (which Anders also directed) and 'SHE'S OUT OF MY LEAGUE'; they also co-wrote 'HOT TUB TIME MACHINE', 'WE'RE THE MILLERS' and 'DUMB AND DUMBER TO' (I'm a big fan of theirs). I wasn't a fan of the original 'HORRIBLE BOSSES' but I absolutely love this sequel! Nick Hendricks (Bateman), Dale Arbus (Day), and Kurt Buckman (Sudeikis) have decided to start their own business together; instead of having to continue to answer to the horrible bosses of other companies. They've come up with a unique shower head invention, they call 'Shower Buddy', and think they've attracted the interest of a rich investor and his son, named Bert (Waltz) and Rex Hanson (Pine). Bert promises the trio that he'll buy 100,000 units from them but after they take out a $500,000 loan, and make the product, he backs out of the deal; he then plans to buy all their shower heads, at a discounted foreclosure price, to sell himself. In order to get their money back Nick, Dale and Kurt decide they're going to kidnap Rex and ask Bert for the $500.000, they lost, in ransom. Things, of course, don't go as they planned. I liked the idea of the original movie but just didn't find it to be that funny; I thought a lot of the jokes fell flat (despite an awesome cast) and didn't think it seemed very inspired (especially considering the great premise and great cast). This installment gets everything right that the first film got wrong. First of all it's hilarious, from beginning to end, thanks in large part to the directing of Anders and the clever writing team of Anders and Morris. The jokes rarely miss this time around and it's got a pretty clever caper storyline, and an awesome car chase climax, to boot! The film's success is also thanks largely to the outstanding cast, that seems like they're having a lot more fun this time; you can see it in the bloopers (in the end credits) and you can also just feel it in the movie (the whole way through). This is comedy done right; much better than the original!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/bPyUBLHQdWM",Horrible Bosses 2

He played that role perfectly. Another to add to the list of characters in this movie that are perfectly played by the actor (Kevin spacey, Jennifer Aniston, Jamie Foxx). however the comedy sometimes feels forced where in the first one it felt so natural. and at times it seemed like the main characters were too outrageous and not believable, not to the fault of the actors but that of the director or script (4 viewings)",Horrible Bosses 2
23,Robert_duder,Sometimes when something doesn't need a sequel...it shouldn't get one,4,1 September 2015,"The first Horrible Bosses was stupid fun. It was essentially exactly what you would expect from a dirty, raunchy, crude comedy starring a fairly significant cast of A-Listers. The best part of the first film was definitely the ""bosses"" who were hilarious and shocking. Horrible Bosses is one of those movies that just couldn't possibly support a sequel because it just isn't necessary. There is no more story to tell. And yet sometimes they can pull it off...well they didn't this time. Horrible Bosses 2 is just short of being really awful. All they did was slap together the worst parts of the first film (a non-stop stream of obscenities and dirty jokes) and completely over the top performances from our lead stars. The three main guys were pretty good in the first one but this is way too much of a good thing because they're almost headache inducing in this one. The film is lacking great villains like they did in the first one and everyone seems to play their roles so loud and obnoxious that you can't get past it. Of course we love watching these idiots try to pull off a master crime and its still fun but just barely because its just not possible to pull it off again.Our three lovable losers are back in the form of Charlie Day, Jason Sudekis and Jason Bateman. Bateman is as Bateman does. He's straight faced, sarcastic and looks bored. Sometimes that works great for him but when the movie is so bad, it just seems like he knows it. Charlie Day and Jason Sudekis are really irritating in this film. Day is high pitched and ridiculous and Sudekis just has really bad lines and is nothing more than sex joke after sex joke with no purpose at all. I know the modern day comedy tends to amuse with non-stop filth but it doesn't work this time around. Jennifer Aniston who was my least favourite boss from the first film does return in a decent sized role. Her character is definitely a one trick pony and seeing her do it again is really tiring. Chris Pine might be the one redeemable role although he plays this way over the top too but at least he's new and fresh. He is so eccentric and ridiculous that his role reminds me of Colin Farrell in the first film and he was great. This is different for Pine and he's solid. Christoph Waltz should be an amazing villain because he's a great actor and very versatile but he's underused and under-developed so they missed the boat on that. Jonathan Banks is decent as a cop in pursuit of them and Jamie Foxx and Kevin Spacey return for brutally small cameos.You have to wonder why Seth Gordon wouldn't return to direct the second film. Instead they got Sean Anders who co-wrote the script. Anders has very little experience and his claim to fame before this was the absolutely stupid That's My Boy with Adam Sandler. However, Gordon is a better writer than what the film shows. He has done some genuinely funny raunchy comedies but this must have been rushed or poorly edited or they were so excited that they were getting to do a second film that they just threw everything together and let it splurge out. A sequel this bad to a film that was already just decent really drags the idea down. So watch the first one but stop there because there isn't any reason to see this unless you saw the first film, loved it and just want a little follow up madness but keep those expectations really low. 4/10",Horrible Bosses 2
24,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Flimsy sequel, not as effective when not as inspired as the first time round",4,3 December 2014,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningThe put upon trio return, this time tired of getting it in the beck from bullying superiors, and deciding to go it alone and set up their own company, though having little to no idea how to do it. In order to secure funding, they approach hot shot entrepreneur Bert Hanson (Christoph Waltz), and his obnoxious son Rex (Chris Pine), who seem pretty decent, only to unscrupulously rip them off. The threesome must then try and claw back what's theirs, along the way clashing with their old nemeses from the last film.Regardless of how much I may have individually enjoyed it, I am aware the original Horrible Bosses film opened to only marginally good reviews and certainly made nowhere near as much of an impact as the similarly themed buddy comedy The Hangover, despite having just as inspired an idea. So a sequel is a surprising offering, if nothing else. With all the surviving characters from the last film present, and a few strategically designed new ones to add on, it's a hollow, pretty desperate affair that suffers from being naturally less inspired than it's predecessor.We open with a laborious, overly drawn out and pretty tiresome break in sequence at an apartment complex, which sets the tone for the rest of the film. Kevin Spacey and Jennifer Aniston reprise their respective psychotic boss roles from the first film, but both fail to really fit in with the narrative structure of the film, and their roles feel really inconsequential to the film. It just takes the edgy, irreverent humour of the first film and basically rehashes it all, only to notably less funny effect. This is a pleasant surprise in existence, but in execution it's almost inevitable weaknesses are there for all to see, which is a bit of a catch 22 for lovers of the first film, evasive as we are. **",Horrible Bosses 2
25,bowmanblue,Pretty reasonable sequel,7,5 July 2015,"We all know sequels are hit and miss at the best of times. And, comedies are often the first to find it hard to repeat the magic of the original. 'Horrible Bosses' was fun, so 'Horrible Bosses 2' had a fair amount to live up to. But, it managed it. Just. But, in 'comedy film terms' 'just' is actually better than the average.The three men from the original return for the sequel. Instead of wanting to murder their employers this time, they have set up their own business so they never have to work for anyone ghastly again. Only things go a little wrong when a company director agrees to purchase their product, only to go back on the deal. Once this happens, the trio start along another path of 'dark thoughts.' The first plus point is that it's not just the three main stars who return. All other surviving cast members come back, even if it's just for a cameo here and there and it does help to have a decent cast, again including Jennifer Anniston and Kevin Spacey.The new 'horrible' bosses are pretty vile and you could probably imagine them existing in the corporate works (although probably most of us haven't worked for their kind before). The plot is pretty much the same, i.e. revenge, but they do go about things a little differently this time (which is nice). Special mention to Chris Pine, who is about as far away from James T Kirk as you can possibly get! There are a decent amount of laughs thrown in there to warrant the 'comedy' tag, but two out of the three leading men do tend to grate on you after a little while, as they're just acting a little too immature for the serious situation they've found themselves in.If you liked the first, you should at least smile all the way through the second. If you haven't seen the first, it's probably best to start there before dabbling with the sequel. It's adult in nature, so be prepared for some pretty 'adult' moments (Jennifer Anniston, I'm looking at you!). Not great, but just about passable for a comedy sequel.",Horrible Bosses 2
26,MLDinTN,a comedic sequel that....,6,14 July 2015,"actually worked. I thought this movie was funny which often doesn't happen with comedy sequels. Most sequels to a comedy are terrible, but this film avoids that fate.In the beginning, you have the guys at a news station talking about their invention and when Kurt is in the shower, what you see on screen is funny. And of course in the sequel, the 3 guys come up with another ridiculous plan that just doesn't work out. And what happens with Rex, the rich guy's son, was funny. And of course, MF jones is back, so he's absurd.But the funniest part of the film is when they are being chased by the police, but want the police to follow them. So they cross train tracks right before the train, back up, and wait on the cops. They eat candy and just look funny.FINAL VERDITCT: Funny, worth seeing.",Horrible Bosses 2

29,The-Sarkologist,"No ... seriously, just no!",1,21 August 2017,"Okay, maybe I shouldn't have watched this so soon after watching the first one for the second time (though why I actually did that is beyond me), because I literally got to the point where I simply wanted to scream in agony, and the main reason was because it was just so painful to watch our protagonists go about acting like complete jerks. Sure, that was the point of the movie, but sitting through this film watching a bunch of bumbling idiots stumble from one stupid scene to the next just made me want to twist and turn in agony, yet for some bizarre reason I watched it to the end (then again I am one of those people that will rarely, if ever, stop watching a film halfway through).Well, I have now finished watching the film, so I can legitimately write a review of it, and I can honestly tell the entire world to simply not bother at all – this film is rubbish, painful, all copies of it should be destroyed and it should never see the light of day again. In fact I am surprised that I gave the first movie as high a rating as I did because in all honestly the original film wasn't all that much better. Okay, our idiotic protagonists are a little more tolerable in the original, but only barely.This film has our protagonists trying to start up their own business manufacturing something called the 'shower buddy', but since they are not really cold, hard, and experienced businessmen, they end up getting taken for a ride and find themselves deeply in debt. So, as is the case with the previous film, they decide to take matters into their own hands to attempt to solve the problem by breaking the law, though as it turns out they end up escaping any real penalty.Personally, I wouldn't recommend this at all. Sure, maybe it is that I simply don't like the bumbling idiot type of comedy, and after watching this film I can clearly state that I really don't like this type of comedy. The other thing is that they are basically getting much cruder, and much more offensive, though not offensive in the sense that Southpark is offensive, but rather attempting to be like that and failing miserably. Personally, give this film a wide berth.",Horrible Bosses 2

This time they plan to kidnap the moguls son, however things get out of hand when he wants to be in on the deal.Whilst it was great to see the Aniston and Spacey character again, Chris Pine and Christopher Waltz are both good additions to the cast. The movie is far from perfect, Charlie Day was particularly annoying with his babbling, I was thinking ""just shut up"" nobody could be that stupid.

Most of the original cast is back and while Kevin Spacey, Jamie Foxx and Jennifer Aniston are given disappointingly little to do, the chemistry between the three leads is as strong as ever with their great comic timing the main reason to see the film. Unfortunately, the characters seem even more inept, clumsy and foolish this time round, which sometimes makes them difficult to relate to. They each have their fair share of funny moments though, with Jason Bateman's mistaken belief that he has waltzed into an AA meeting a clear highlight as well as the opening scene in which an automatic shower invention looks incredibly 'wrong' when viewed at a certain angle. Not all the gags are that good (an extra-long freight train is excruciating) but ultimately the film has more hits than misses with a cunning Chris Pine actually outclassing Christoph Waltz as his even slyer father. As with the first film, movie references are used to good effect too. All the 'Predator' quips are highly amusing, as is the trio modeling their kidnapping on 'Nine to Five' and then debating who of them is the Fonda, Tomlin and Parton of their clan. Sure, this is not as fresh and funny as the first film... but how many comedy sequels are?

The direction which was made by Sean Anders, it was good and I liked the way he presented for one more time the main characters, their goals and also their dreams. Regarding the interpretations of Jason Bateman who played as Nick Hendricks, Charlie Day who played as Dale Arbus and Jason Sudeikis who played as Kurt Buckman, I believe they were all very good.

33,Floated2,Disappointing Comedy Sequel,3,23 July 2015,"Horrible Bosses 2 (2014) came above from it's sequel to the critical hit Horrible Bosses (2011). There was a time when it was rumored that the sequel to Horrible Bosses would find Bateman, Sudeikis, and Day in the boss roles with three new guys looking for revenge against them. The idea that we all become the boss we hate could have made for a really clever twist on the comedy sequel, although that would have been a narratively risky proposition, and the problem with Horrible Bosses 2 is that risk was never in the equation. It's a comedy with no surprises. And the first film worked because of the surprises it held especially in the unexpected extremes of the characters played by Spacey, Aniston, and Colin Farrell. Without those extremes to offset the straight guys at the center, this sequel gets surprisingly boring very, very quickly. Pine brings it some nice energy, but Waltz feels completely out of place, as if the writers were too busy with their old characters to think of something for a new one to do. Overall a new atmosphere to the sequel.",Horrible Bosses 2
34,eddie_baggins,Another comedic misfire,4,27 April 2015,"In what's become an increasingly frequent and often mind boggling irritating aspect of modern day comedy films, Horrible Bosses 2 continues the new age trend of being loud, fast and fancies itself on the improv front, creating a comedy that has some nice ideas, but no moments to shine, as things are often just too busy thanks to people talking over each other and an over reliance on crudeness in lieu of genuine smarts.In what is perhaps the most unwarranted sequel of recent times, Bosses 2 reunites our 3 bumbling wannabe criminals in the form of Jason Bateman, Charlie Day and Jason Sudekis but more so than the occasionally ingenious first outing, Bosses 2 loses much of what made the first outing a breakout hit thanks to its slap dash plotting and extremely incoherent scripting that comes across as a constant fight for scene chewing by the three leads in what was clearly meant to be a banter between the stars following films such as Anchorman and This is the End, but unlike those similar films, Bosses just doesn't have the gold to mine that they did.Where Bosses also falls short is in its narrative and while the first was anything but Pulitzer Prize worthy, the second film really comes across as a far fetching grasp at replicating the wins of the first, but the kidnapping device and baddies that inhabit this tale just don't have the same affect that Jennifer Aniston, Kevin Spacey and Colin Farrell had in the first, even though Aniston and Spacey return in cameo like roles that provide some pretty hearty laughs. Most of the films genuine laughs stem from the return of Jamie Foxx as Mr. M. Jones and an extended kidnapping scheme sequence that displays a momentary element of genuine smarts and story savvies. New comers to the Bosses universe Chris Pine and Christoph Waltz seem to be enjoying themselves here but neither have the impact needed to elevate Bosses to another level and it does seem as though our central trio are less enthused about the project when compared to the first.It's worrying that Horrible Bosses 2 is another comedic adventure that lives in the LOUD, OTT and unimpressively made up on the fly style of comedy films and judging by its tepid reception when compared to the first, it's clear that audiences are growing tired of their comedies being made in such a manner. There's enough here to not write off Horrible Bosses 2 completely, but overall this is another supposedly funny film that isn't actually all that funny.2 permanent Sharpie markers out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check into - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",Horrible Bosses 2

36,leonblackwood,No way as funny as the first movie! 4/10,4,4 April 2015,"Review: I honestly didn't find this movie that funny! The storyline was extremely far fetched and it got on my nerves when the 3 main characters kept on talking over each other. It starts of with Christoph Waltz funding the trios shower company, with the idea of taking over the franchise so they decide to kidnap his son to try and save there shower business. There silly plan ends up a right mess but the son decides to go ahead with the kidnapping so he can split the ransom money with them. What a awful concept! It's no way in the same league as the first movie and I personally found it more silly than funny. Some of the old characters, like Jamie Foxx and Jennifer Aniston are back and I personally found there scenes funnier than the overall movie. The chemistry was quite good between the actors and you can tell that they had fun making the movie but I didn't find the characters that interesting. There constant stupid lines and silly humour made the movie a bit annoying and I just wanted them to shut up after a while. Bateman seemed like the only one with any sense but he always ended up going along with Charlie Day and Jason Sudeikis's ridiculous ideas. Personally, I didn't really enjoy the movie that much but it is harmless fun for people who can take there sense of humour. Disappointing!Round-Up: This is one of those cases were the sequel is no way as good as the original. The director tried to be clever by bringing back some of great characters from the first movie but they weren't in the movie that much. Chris Pine fitted in with the characters quite well and it was good to see Kevin Spacey again, but the core of the movie really needed a rewrite. I liked Jamie Foxx's character  and it was good to see him bring his own style of comedy to the movie but it's Jennifer Aniston who shocked me, once again. Some of her lines were really shocking but funny at the same time, and I personally think that she is one of the only reasons to watch the movie, in my opinion. It must have been hard to say her lines with a straight face! Anyway, I think that this movie made so much money at the box office because of the first movie but I doubt that people will be happy with this concept. They have obviously left it open for a 3rd movie in this franchise so I hope that they will take there time with creating something special with these crazy characters.Budget: $42million Worldwide Gross: $107millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their comedies about the crazy trio kidnapping the funder of there shower business, son so they can save there company. 4/10",Horrible Bosses 2

But when a slick investor cons them and they want revenge. This leads to working with another guy, a kidnapping attempt, and a double-cross, everything goes horribly wrong for the three. Best part of the movie: When you discover Rex's real motives.Worst part of the movie: When they're doing a demonstration for their product and they look like they're doing something else.Overall, I give this movie an 8 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Awesome.",Horrible Bosses 2
38,jtindahouse,It works because the story drives the humour rather than the other way around,8,26 December 2014,"It's always interesting to see how comedy series go about their sequels. 'The Hangover Part 2' took the route of making an almost exact replica of the original, simply in another country and was almost universally panned for it (although personally I still quite enjoyed it). Then with their third entry in the series they went almost the entirely opposite direction (to the point where there wasn't even a hangover in the film) and got a more positive response. Go figure. Horrible Bosses 2 seems to have changed things up just enough to keep people satisfied while still staying very true to the format that made the original so good.The main three have tremendous chemistry, there's no doubt about it. Every scene is so much fun. Then you throw in the brilliant cameos from Jennifer Aniston, Kevin Spacey, Chris Pine, Christoph Waltz, Jamie Foxx (the best of the lot) etc. and you have a very enjoyable film. It's actually a very smart movie and could easily have been tweaked here and there to make a reasonable thriller out of it.

So was with Horrible Bosses 2, where good (the 3 ""stooches"") or greater (all supporting performances by famous actors, different from their usual roles) performances brought along multiple smiles and laughs, and ""over-the-spindle"" and restless plans and deeds did not cause blah feelings. In many places, rather witty cinematography was used, and the plot - in spite of some fragility - was rounded up in a twisted and distinct manner.

Maybe it has to do with the essential banality of the story. Comedy of course does not have to be high brow; low brow can work too. This movie chooses the low brow approach and the result is low brow. If one is a fan of low brow humor, then this movie should prove entertaining. Yet such a result is not assured. The story is a cross between a Three Stooges short and Abbott and Costello, but lacks the sharpness and originality of both acts. In short, this movie offers no new or innovative comedy routines but rather a tired rehashing of standard low brow fare, hence it's mild humor.

So if the first movie is about hiding bigfoot the sequel is about the characters trying to run a successful ostrich farm. For example.My point being that you might think it would be hard to believe that these guys really did try to pull off a crime *again* but they do actually plot this very intelligently. By which I mean I didn't notice any glaring illogicalies, they even have a character's stupidity negate an easy way out more than once.They began this in a logical place considering the ending of the first movie and developed that idea in such a way that you really want to route for them to do with they plan on doing in this movie. The plot twists and turns without being predictable and you never feel like challenging character motivation.I don't quite remember two of these three characters being quite so stupid last time. But it's not really about them, it's the story we want and this one really delivers.It's one of the few movies that comments on our hyperbolic attitude to the issue of child sexuality and it nicely reminds us of issues of the economic system we live in.This is a movie that never settles for easy answers or solutions. Too often in movies I find myself wondering ""how will they get away with this!?"". And then they don't. Which is so lazy on the writers part. But I don't want to see the plan go off without a hitch either. With all the formulaic police procedurals on TV glamour zing law enforcement, this was a breath of fresh air.One big issue I had though: I don't want to spoil anything but there sort of isn't enough karmic retribution on our rapist character.

What could go wrong with a comedy I had already enjoyed starring three Oscar winners? A lot when you bring in a new director whose most popular film up to now was That's My Boy. The sequel tries to bank off the success from the strong chemistry between the three lead actors (Jason Bateman, Jason Sudeikis, and Charlie Day), but unfortunately the formula felt repetitive and excessive at times. As much as I enjoyed their chemistry there were some moments that felt forced this time around. I am glad they didn't repeat the same scenario from the first film and tried to change the structure of the comedy by centering on a kidnap attempt, but despite some funny scenes the sequel still falls flat by repeating some of the jokes from the first movie. Chris Pine was an excellent addition and once again the cameos from Jamie Foxx, Jennifer Aniston, and Kevin Spacey are the highlight of the film, but I was expecting a lot more from Christoph Waltz, who's an actor I highly admire. I think he could be great in this sort of comical villainous role, but he was underused here. All in all, Horrible Bosses 2 fails to deliver the same amount of laughs as the original but it still remains as a watchable and entertaining comedy. 2014 has yet to deliver a satisfying comedy, but if you're bored this is a sequel that will keep you entertained for a while. I actually found the first half of this film a bit stronger than the second half. It begins with a lot of promise introducing some of the new characters while centering on the relationship between the three amigos. Chris Pine is hilarious as well and he plays off the leads very well. There are several funny moments including the cameos with Jamie Foxx, Kevin Spacey, and Jennifer Aniston who you can tell is very uncomfortable with the dialogue she has to say but pulls it off nonetheless. The weakest part of the film is the resolution which in my opinion was a bit exaggerated, and many people might find the jokes offensive. It doesn't come close to matching the potential of the original film, but I didn't hate it either. The film is silly, but the cast makes it a worthwhile experience elevating the dull material and making it a little more fun than it had the right to be.",Horrible Bosses 2

There are oodles of lewd hijinks blended with lots of sexual and potty humor.

52,aidanratesmovies,A lot better than I expected it to be,9,2 September 2020,"With an eager and hilarious returning cast, and plenty of fantastic new faces on screen, Horrible Bosses 2 never tries to hard to live up to the first film and proves to be one of the more amusing sequels I have seen in quite some time. The film is never boring, it feels entertaining through and through. Rather than rely on cheap gimmicks and make the film for simply the case of money, Horrible Bosses 2 feels like a genuine comedy and delightful return of our lead characters from the first film. The film is quite funny, and it never feels like it is forcing jokes upon the audience like so many other sequels and comedy films do today- which is refreshing, and provides for an easy viewing experience. There isn't anything too great about this film, it can feel rather average at times, with montages and plan set ups, and the situations that unfold. You can feel the tension rising on the screen, and you now when something bad is about to happen, which can be a bit annoying- but for the most part, the film does a good job for what it is. I enjoyed the return of the trio from the first flick, Jason Bateman, Jason Sudeikis, and Charlie day- as well as the return of Jennifer Aniston, Kevin Spacey, and Jamie Foxx's characters respectively. The true standout of this film, however, is Chris Pine who brings something to the table he hasn't done before and does a terrific job being one of the foes throughout the picture. I also enjoyed Christoph Waltz's performance as always, but he didn't seem to have a lot to work with, so if you were hoping to see a whole lot of him on screen, I suggest his other films. In the end, Horrible Bosses 2 was a delightful surprise. It's flawed, but a very worthy and decent sequel to one of my personal favorite comedies- and I wouldn't mind seeing these guys on the big screen again sometime soon.

It's still fun, it just lacks the same originality or spark the original had.If you haven't seen a Horrible Bosses movie, definitely see the original first. Don't get me wrong, Chris Pine adds some fun to this one and, after everything that's come out, it's a bit fitting to see Kevin Spacey play someone behind bars.

55,Seraphion,A bit more interesting than the first movie,6,12 December 2014,"The movie picks a little bit after the the first installment. Nick, Kurt and Dale have quit their old jobs and hit quite a break by inventing a shower head product. But the father-and-son crooked businessmen Bert and Rex Hanson swindled them off their own company. The three again think of a crime to exact vengeance on the Hansons. Failed at murder attempts, they turn to kidnapping the son Rex to be held at ransom against Bert. They first sneak into the place of Julia, Dale's old boss. Julia comes unexpectedly so Kurt and Dale, who Julia already knew from the first movie, hides in the closet. Nick 'sacrifices' himself to satisfy Julia's addiction problem so that Kurt and Dale can escape unnoticed. They sneak into Rex's house with a stash of nitrogen supposedly to gas the owner. But as usual, a mishap occurs, releasing the nitrogen on themselves inside Rex's closet. The next day, Rex pulls a gag on them and then quickly escalates the situation, forcing the three to continue on the kidnapping plan, only with Rex in on it too. Rex marks up the ransom from half a million to five million dollars, claiming that his father will cooperate and not call the police. But the opposite happens as Detective Hatcher suspects the three for the kidnapping.They eventually slide away with it and Rex assists them in making a supposedly fool-proof plan.The plan's key is that they would fool the police in doing the ransom drop. Instead of pointing Bert to a drop point, they would kidnap Bert in the drop point while Kurt disguised as Bert's body double goes and supposedly continues on to the real drop. They execute the drop plan, and another stupid clumsiness happen where Kurt misplaced the untraceable phone with his own. Already knowing about the break-in at her place, Julia comes to Nick, Kurt and Dale's meeting place. They finally subdued her and continue on with the plan. As planned, Bert goes to the basement parking lot where the three hold him at gunpoint. But he doesn't surrender the money. Suddenly Bert gets shot from behind by Rex who then reveals that he's framing the three for the murder and kidnapping. As Rex escapes, Madafaka Jones, whom the three had again consulted about the kidnapping plan beforehand, comes and take them with his car. He tells them to race Rex to the kidnapping spot warehouse. They made it to the warehouse just narrowly after Rex sets himself up as the kidnapping victim, framing the three as police arrive. But Kurt's phone, which Rex took from Bert's hand, rings. The three appeals to the police in why didn't Rex call the police if he had a phone with him all the time. Defeated, Rex quickly grabs Detective Hatcher hostage. In panic Dale attacks him but Rex shoots him. Det. Hatcher quickly subdues Rex amidst the chaos.The story is quite a nice sequel from the previous crazy half-witted criminal minds. Although I should say that this time the movie's title rather loses it's relevance since the three main characters don't work for anyone anymore, let alone their old bosses. There is also some gaping plot holes in the story especially for those who haven't seen the first movie yet.For example when the three sneaks into Julia's place, why did only Nick who dares to get out of hiding? Those who have watched the first movie know that Julia already know Dale and Kurt, which will make the story different. But this proves to be a question mark for first-time viewers of the franchise.The comedy is just at a standard level of funny. Kurt still is the stupid idea source, Dale is still the insecure push-over, while Nick still tries to be the most coherent in the mind yet he still surrenders to the craziness of his friends' ideas. What I notice is that the comedic moments and triggers tend to shift to more of a stupid jokes done in idiot-comedies such as Dumb and Dumber, Idiocracy and Step Brothers. It still retains the circumstance based comedies like in the first movie, but the stupid jokes sure do increase in number.The acting overall is a slight little bit above my expectation. The two Jasons nicely retain their complementary characters. Jason Sudeikis' Kurt will be group's craziness initiator, will Jason Bateman's Nick will try to hold the group together from straying into trouble although he eventually yields to it too. Charlie Day's insecure and panicky Dale nicely adds the family oriented man into the group's equation. Exchanging Donald Sutherland and Colin Farrell with Christoph Waltz and Chris Pine nicely helps to add into the overall acting job. Having Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Aniston and Jamie Foxx retain their characters really helps in connecting this movie to it's predecessor. One noticeable thing is that although his acting is really that good, Christoph Waltz doesn't really get it when it comes to being funny.My final say for Horrible Bosses 2 (2014) is a score of 6 out of 10. It gets a little bit more interesting compared to the first movie. You can get quite a good laugh from this one indeed.",Horrible Bosses 2
56,Movie-ManDan,A Rare Sequel That Surpasses The Original.,10,30 November 2014,"Horrible Bosses was 2011's best comedy and one of the very best that year too. It is awesome like The Hangover movies. When I heard about a sequel being made, I was all over it. Ready to see an awesome flick as a confidant to the first, the movie exceeded my expectations to the point where I thought it exceeded the first. There is ten times more danger, more complexity, and the guys actually ARE guilty of the crime they commit. Nick, Dale, and Kurt invest in a new kind of shower head and are approached by Chris Pine. He makes them an offer they disagree with, then his father (Waltz) makes them an offer they do agree with. After making their own factory and hiring many new employees, Waltz pulls the plug leaving them in debt. They then plot to kidnap Pine for ransom, but he catches them in the act and actually helps them construct a brilliant ransom. So as you can see, the three main men are guilty of kidnapping (even though Pine stopped them), fraud, and ransom. But as characters cool like The Wolfpack from The Hangover movies, you don't care how guilty they are and you just want them in the clear. There are some predictable parts that the director knew was predictable, so extreme hilarity and unpredictability from grounds around it make the predictable bit apathetic, which it good. The abundance of danger and things at stake make this movie easily more suspenseful than the first. Personally, I found this funnier than the first by just a little bit. Each character is funnier and the perilous situations I mentioned are as hilarious as they are deadly. Jennifer Aniston, Jamie Foxx, and Kevin Spacey also make returns as crazier people they were in the first.4/4",Horrible Bosses 2
57,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Horrible Bosses 2,6,27 November 2014,"In most of his movies, Jason Bateman has always excelled as a fast- talking, speak easy kind of comedic actor. Unfortunately, a lot of his work is saddled with lousy scripts or in the case of Horrible Bosses 2, almost no script at all. Bateman, his co-stars (Jason Sudeikis and Charlie Day), and other assorted cast members, sprint through ""Bosses 2"" saying whatever pops into their dainty little heads. To say that this raunchy sequel is tainted with improvisation overload is a complete understatement. Director Sean Anders basically lets the cameras roll and doesn't look back. I'm thinking someone should have walked up to him and whispered ""cut"". Nudge, nudge.Anyway, with a strong cast, almost no segway from the inception of the first Horrible Bosses flick (from 2011), and a sex-addicted character in Jennifer Aniston who says, ""have you ever done it in a dentist's chair?"" (hey Jen, we hardly knew ya), Horrible Bosses 2 finds our three fearless leaders (if you can call them that) trying to sell their subpar, inventive product (the quote unquote ""shower buddy""). Nick Hendricks (Bateman), Dale Arbus (Charlie Day), and Kurt Buckman (Jason Sudeikis) from the first film have moved on and now they want to make a fortune by working for themselves. As the proceedings begin, these guys show up on Good Morning Los Angeles to promote their shower gadget and then try to sell 150,000 units to a slimy investor named Burt Hanson (an underutilized Christoph Waltz). When Hanson accepts the offer to buy said product, he then reneges on his decision forcing the trio of bumbling knuckleheads to kidnap his whiny son (Chris Pine who surprisingly kills it as Rex Hanson). Things to watch for in ""2's"" 108 minute running time: An outrageous car chase that has a vehicle burning rubber with a torn fence encased around it (I'm not kidding) and a shocking sex scene that gives new meaning to the term video surveillance (just think 1993's dud, Sliver).Plot and storytelling aspects aside, the out of the box casting for these Horrible Bosses movies has always fascinated me. I mean where else can you see three Oscar winners (Jamie Foxx, Waltz, and Kevin Spacey), a Golden Globe winner, and an Emmy award winner strut their stuff in a pair of critically panned (not to mention frequently inappropriate) R rated comedies. If you've seen the trailers for this sequel to 2011's highly successful original, you've probably figured out that every star (and co-star) is returning along with a few celebrated additions. That makes ""Bosses 2's"" helping of strap- on innuendo, underage fascination, and suggestively coarse language much more over the top. Lord help us!Now as I took in a midday viewing of Horrible Bosses 2, I made the following observations (good and bad): 1. why would Christoph Waltz, a double Oscar winner, take on such a nothing role as the film's woefully underdeveloped, arch villain? 2. I never thought I'd say this but Chris Pine, an actor who has never done anything comedic, outshines everyone in the laughs department. There are a couple of scenes where he brazenly harms himself in a very violent way (or as the Sudeikis character says, he quote unquote ""Fight Clubs himself""). Pine's a hoot and I think he might have found his niche here as opposed to being the equivalent of bland green beans via the new Jack Ryan. 3. In case you aren't familiar with the law, I'll lay it out for you: Kidnapping (or ""kidnaping"" if you've already viewed this thing) is punishable up to possibly a sentence of life in prison. To the characters in ""Bosses 2"", it all seems like one big joke. I mean, I know it's a comedy but no one on screen takes any types of repercussions seriously. Tack on murder too. Someone gets shot towards the flick's conclusion and the three Dodo bird best friends still manage to crack jokes. Gimme a break!Overall, despite being about as predictable and standardized as any sequel has a right to be, I can still name hundreds of them that are worse than Horrible Bosses 2. This November release is putrid, crass, and off-putting but will at times, actually make you laugh out loud. And to the critics who seem easily offended by its vulgar themes, I got one thing to say: lighten up people! It's only a movie for crying out loud. Bottom line: Horrible Bosses 2 ain't no classic. It will however, provide you with some nervous, guilty giggles. It's entertaining to a fault and far from being ""horrible"".Of note: As I've just mentioned, the movie I've just reviewed isn't a bad one but the end credits are. I mean, it seems that every Jason Sudeikis outing these days has to have outtakes completely tacked on. The ones in Horrible Bosses 2 are exceptionally stale and just plain unnecessary. Skip them and just exit the theater. Trust me.",Horrible Bosses 2

When the film opens with a simulated handjob between two guys in a simulated shower enclosure, and segues into the Nick/ Kurt/ Dale misheard website line, I knew I was in for a long ride, and the filmmakers were digging the deepest depths here.The three leads are unlikeable and so moronic, their goal is a federal crime as bad as was committed against them, and the attempts at humour are so poor that several people in the audience walked out before the ending. A couple walked out when Anniston was using a dildo on Bateman's character, another pair left shortly thereafter, and one more about 15 minutes or so before the end.",Horrible Bosses 2
59,brando647,"HORRIBLE BOSSES 2 is a Worse Crime than Anything Nick, Kurt, and Dale Have Done...",5,24 October 2015,"As a fan of the original HORRIBLE BOSSES, I was sort of hopeful when it was announced the cast would be returning for another adventure but I knew exactly what to expect: a soulless cash grab. HORRIBLE BOSSES 2 was so lame it's given me cause to go back and reevaluate my enjoyment of the first movie. I will give the filmmakers credit for not totally going back to the well again and switching up the central premise of the second movie, but there's no mistaking the desperate attempt to rehash what we loved in the gags from the original. HORRIBLE BOSSES 2 reunites us with Nick (Jason Bateman), Kurt (Jason Sudeikis), and Dale (Charlie Day) following their triumph over theiruhmhorrible bosses. The three have banded together and developed a new product, the car wash-inspired Shower Buddy, and they're in the market for an investor. Everything seems to be going their way when their contacted by Rex Hanson (Chris Pine), son of wealthy entrepreneur Bert Hanson (Christoph Waltz). When it becomes apparent the Hansons have lied and their sabotage will crush the trio's business before it ever opens, desperate timesonce againcall for desperate measures. This time, the boys plan to kidnap Rex and hold him for ransom. Nothing extreme, just enough to get them back out of debt to where they can try again for an honest start. Plans go awry and Rex catches on but, surprise, he wants in on it. Now we're merely faking a kidnapping to extort a half million dollars instead of conspiring to murder.HORRIBLE BOSSES 2 takes all the elements I enjoyed in the first movie and beats them into an unrecognizable mess. One of the many parts I loved about the first was Charlie Day. His Dale was a hyperkinetic lovable moron; he was the group's family man whose only concern was getting away from the constant sexual harassment of his boss (Jennifer Aniston, another gem from the first movie) and keeping his marriage intact. In the second film he is a screeching harpy, screaming most of his lines. When he's not screaming his dialogue, it's delivered simultaneously with his cast mates. For some reason, the people behind HORRIBLE BOSSES 2 decided that characters chatting over each other is the same as naturalistic dialogue delivery. I instead call it an unintelligible mess. And it happens for most of the movie, primarily when the three mains are interacting and it's meant to be comical. It's not. It just serves as a distraction from how the jokes aren't nearly as funny. Moving on from the main trio, Jennifer Aniston returns because she too was well-received in the first movie. Aniston was a trip in the first movie because she went against her good-girl image to play a sex-obsessed dentist determined to have her way with Dale one way or another. Bringing her back for a minor cameo is understandable but we don't need any more than that. She adds nothing more to the story. So why is she dropping by again in the third act? She appears out of nowhere, having tracked the guys' whereabouts as they're beginning the final stage of their scheme, just to add an extra complication.The problem is that her arrival is totally unmotivated, just as Dale's family's sudden arrival immediately afterward. Things are building speed as the final con goes into action and everything grinds to a halt when Aniston shows up. Timing is of the essence at this point and the guys are stopping everything to argue logistics of how they're about to handle a foursome with a horned-up dentist/stalker. This is followed by the arrival of his wife and children. Again, for no discernible reason other than a ""funny"" awkward moment as Dale argues why he should get thewellprime real estate in their ménage a quatre. It's lazy writing and it's scattered all throughout the movie. The jokes land flat and the characters are less likable than ever. Jamie Foxx reprises his role as Motherf**ker Jones and, while his similar third act surprise visit is equally unlikely, at least it leads to a car chase that proves to be one of the most fun moments in the movie. Foxx is probably the only one to make it out of the movie unscathed; his character is just as funny the second time around and he doesn't over do it. HORRIBLE BOSSES 2 was a misstep for the studio and a solid reminder that sequels to comedies aren't generally the best idea. After attempted murder and kidnapping, the biggest crime these people are guilty of is beating a dead horse.",Horrible Bosses 2

Like the first movie, they are dealing with a corrupt boss and his son who deceives them and ruins their business, only its not very funny this time around. This sequel to the 2011 hit comedy is sorely disappointing. This film takes the laughs and humor that made the first film hilarious and waters it down with generic sex jokes and humor that is only funny on paper. I don't think I laughed no more than two or three times throughout the entire duration of the movie.Many comedies today seemed to be running out of ideas for good raunchy humor. This movie would be a prime example. Some of the characters try too hard to be funny and fail miserably. Charlie Day's character was the probably the only one I found remotely funny. Then the rest of the characters seem to use the almost same joke in every scene throughout the entire movie.The Hangover Part 2 was not very great of a sequel, but it was pretty funny compared to this movie.",Horrible Bosses 2
65,Troy_Campbell,"A decent chuckler, but no more.",6,12 December 2014,"After collecting over $200m in worldwide box office receipts (from a budget of $35m), Horrible Bosses was a commercial home run, whilst garnering favourable reviews from critics to boot. Posting those numbers meant it was inevitable a sequel would be forthcoming, but is HB2 the fresh, well thought-out continuation that audiences are hoping for or just a carbon copy cash-grab? It's a bit of both. Swapping murder for kidnapping, and horrible bosses for horrible business partners, there are a few tweaks to the formula that open up doors to new laughs. Flipping Jennifer Aniston's sex addict (again stealing the limelight) from working against our hapless trio to helping them is one change that reaps big benefits, and a clever fantasy/reality double-sequence of the boys planning, then executing, their ambitious plan is hilarious. The numerous rehashed gags, however, are much more hit and miss. The odd recurring joke still hits the mark, but most have outlived their worth; Jamie Foxx's returning crime-adviser barely elicits a titter, whilst call-backs to specific dialogue (""50 states"") and moments (dirty toothbrushes) from the original are dull and uninspired. The dynamic between the three protagonists hasn't changed a bit either, for better and for worse. Jason Bateman is still the most consistently humorous member of the bunch as straight-faced leader Nick, whilst Jason Sudeikis' man-child Kurt and Charlie Day's shrieking ball of paranoia, Dale, are sporadically funny in their own, over-the-top way, but can also grate on the nerves. Elsewhere there's Chris Pine having a blast sending up his pretty-boy persona, Christoph Waltz looking bored in a ludicrously one-dimensional role and Kevin Spacey hamming it up in an extended cameo as Nick's former boss.

'Horrible Bosses 2' has its moments but lacks ideas and the originality of the first film. The guys are a lot more stupid in the sequel, they reminded me a lot of the Hangover trio. Whether that was deliberate or not I don't know, but they weren't that dumb in the first film.By the standards of the average comedy movie, it's not bad. I laughed a few times, which is more than can be said about a lot of comedy sequels. Like in the first film, Aniston and Sudeikis are the highlight for me. Both are brilliant in their roles.

The whole concept of wanting to murder ones work boss really hit a cord with me and many others I'm sure. Why? because it was completely relatable for most common regular folk, us mortals that toil in lame soul destroying jobs. That concept and the movie was also similar to another fantastic comedy 'Office Space' which I think helped with its popularity.Now we have the much anticipated sequel which reunites all of the original cast...accept for Farrell, did I say anticipated? This time around the three main guys are trying to start their own business with a homemade invention. They go to Hanson (Waltz as a wealthy businessman) to pitch their idea, Hanson likes it and makes a big order. Later on down the road Hanson screws them over and basically puts the guys up sh*t creek without a paddle. What do they do next? well they decide to kidnap Hanson's son Rex (Pine) but discover its harder than they expected. Things then take a twist as Rex decides to assist them in getting back at his emotionless father.That's the one thing this movie does have in its favour and that's twists, although they aren't hard to spot but at least they are there. There are a few mini plots going on here with different characters at different times, its not confusing but in fact essential to keeping this films head above the water. Obviously everything comes together at the end and is tied up in a neat package with a pretty bow. Did I enjoy the ride though? well kinda I guess, the main problem here is the plot is so very bland, clichéd, unoriginal and non-engaging. The reason why the first film worked was, as I said, you could relate to it, you can't relate to this because most people don't go around kidnapping other people.They have shifted from a solid idea to this very meh idea which is just typical Hollywood spiel. It starts off quite funny I'll admit, the dirty and childish visual gag of Day wanking off Sudeikis and then giving him a reach around (trick of the eye gag) is actually very funny. When the guys are carrying out their plan to pinch some laughing gas from Dale's old sex obsessed boss Julia Harris (Aniston), the walkie talkie camaraderie between the three is hilarious. Bateman's blank, dry, deadpan expressions of exasperation as his two buddies continuously fudge up and prove how imbecilic they are is comedy gold. Day does get slightly annoying as the hyperactive fast talking Dale, can't stand too much of that character, whilst Sudeikis as Kurt is a worthy comedic foil to Nicks (Bateman) level-headed sensibilities.Around the point where the guys meet up with Rex to discuss his diabolical plan is where this film starts to lose its way. Up to then it was quite funny with some admittedly solid laughs and good sleazy toilet humour. But as the plot goes down the stupid Hollywood action route which ends in car chases, police activity and gun play it ceases to be funny and merely becomes very meh. It was still a joy to see Aniston dress like a slut and hear her talk like an even dirtier slut describing how much she loves cock, loved her character in both films. Twas also great to see Spacey do his evil tyrant thing again which he does oh so well, apart from that everyone else is by the books frankly.I'm afraid its the usual error that Hollywood just keeps making. Every time a film does well they have to make a sequel no matter what the original film was about. I've said it before and I'll say it again, certain films don't require sequels, they are stand alone flicks, one shot deals, lightning in a bottle. Just because a film does well that doesn't mean you have to try and franchise it! and this is another perfect example. The first film was very funny and it did well, right...now leave it at that! There was never a need to make a sloppy bottom of the barrel scraping sequel, it was never gonna be better or do as well.5.5/10",Horrible Bosses 2

After the events of the first film Nick, Kurt & Dale have quit their respective jobs & are now their own bosses. They invent a Shower Buddy. This invention consists of a built-in shower gel & shampoo in the shower head. They look for investors. A businessman named Bert Hanson(Christoph Waltz) shows interest in the trio's product. He agrees to buy their product for a lot of money. However, he later double crosses them. This prompts Nick, Kurt & Dale to plan a kidnapping involving Hanson's son, Rex Hanson(Chris Pine). Horrible Bosses 2 is freaking hilarious! I was laughing non-stop from start to finish. At first, I was skeptical when I learned that they were making a sequel to Horrible Bosses(2011). However, all my doubts were laid to rest when I started watching the movie. Every single joke in this film had me guffawing uncontrollably. There were some scenes that were so funny that I was struggling to catch my breath! The cast works really well together & you can tell that they had a whale of a time shooting this movie. Jason Bateman is great as Nick Hendricks. Jason Sudeikis is brilliant as Kurt Buckman. Charlie Day is outstanding as Dale Arbus. Jennifer Aniston is spectacular as Dr. Julia Harris, D.D.S. Kevin Spacey is hysterical in his short but important role as Dave Harken. Jamie Foxx is mind blowing as Dean ""MF"" Jones. Chris Pine is awesome as Rex Hanson. Christoph Waltz is good as Bert Hanson. Jonathan Banks & Lindsay Sloane are impressive as Detective Hatcher & Stacy Arbus respectively.

In an attempt to break even, they kidnap his equally cruel and charming son Pine and hold him for ransom. The banter between Bateman, Day and Sudeikis is just as sharp as the original, and the plot itself isn't half-bad for a sequel. The downfall is the minor roles from Aniston and Spacey that—albeit fun—are too forced into the story that is stretches the movie into unnecessary territory.★★★ (out of four)",Horrible Bosses 2
72,billygoat1071,Hammier Crimes,5,28 November 2014,"2011's Horrible Bosses worked because it takes things simple, if a little too light. In spite of its inconsequential nature, the movie tends to be creative in its silliness and humor, bringing some memorable characters, which leads to this sequel. Horrible Bosses 2 is like any other sequel out there: the production is heightened, the humor gets even more outrageous, but most of the time, the heart of the predecessor is seemingly lost. There are still some big laughs to be found around, with lots of lively performances, but everything else feels enervating, even with its vibrant scale, it still feels pretty lacking.The common clichés of comedy sequels are doubling the budget and doubling the craziness. This movie is no doubt one of them, but we've already proved that those merits aren't necessarily enough. It's obvious that there is hardly any better ideas for this sequel. What this movie only did is to makes things bigger, but the common lesson we usually learn is bigger doesn't always mean it's better. The plot takes more serious stakes, while there is some surprisingly decent suspense to be found in those, we're getting the same punchline of how terrible these guys at being criminals. But the real problem of the overall film is the main trio becoming total idiots. These characters were once relatable, but now they are starting to have a behavior of a cartoon, which makes most of their actions look lesser of a deal.Even the creativity falls short, thus the film reprises some of the best characters from the last movie, instead of making actual new engagingly insane bosses. The villains here are fine, works great for a thriller, but doesn't reach the heights of Harken, Julia, and Pellitt, which is why they decided to extravagantly cameo two of them in case the fans misses the original's strongest flavor. What the movie only improved is its external; everything looks better, there's also some crazier action sequences and larger visuals. But as a comedy, those aren't exactly what we seek for. What keeps up the appeal are the stars. The main characters may have turned into bigger morons, while it is supposed to make the comedy much outrageous, it might as well could have made them very unlikeable. But their actors; Jason Bateman, Charlie Day, and Jason Sudeikis; never let that happened, they thankfully still have the same charm no matter what. Chris Pine also makes a promising addition, having fun with the trio, with a dash of insanity.Horrible Bosses 2 doesn't quite aim beyond than being more outrageous and, well, big. It also doesn't still bother bringing some consideration to its dark concept of killing (and even kidnaping) their bosses. Instead, we have these characters doing the same stuff, except with over-the-top attitude. It's not entirely bad, there are some hilarious moments here and there, but in the end this is just another needless sequel, trying to relive the same quality of the original, but doesn't quite succeed. It's not really that hard to think of good ideas for these movies, but Horrible Bosses 2 chooses to be mediocre anyway. There's some fine effort in craft, but if they don't want to be bold enough to take its darkness into a different level, then they could have at least be as creative as they were at the first one.",Horrible Bosses 2

Sure, the critical consensus was that it was ""meh"" and they thought the jokes started to run their course long before the end but I was definitely going against the grain with this one because I found it very amusing.My only real complaint is that I felt Christoph Waltz wasn't used as much as I had hoped he would have been but with, aside from that, I was entertained with the story, felt the cast had a great chemistry and loved all the fun characters they were playing, was super blown away with how awesome Chris Pine was in his role, and loved the silly, offensive, and occasionally perverted comedy.

Then we compare them to the real events directly after, that is just the best part, it is similar but not quite, they are clumsy, insecure and very very unlucky :)There are some great moments, but all in all this should have been much better and maybe it could, but it didn't live up to my expectations at all.",Horrible Bosses 2

Then I heard there where going to make a squeal and I think it's about last year I think, but anywhere I was a bit interested of what they can do next and how they going to top the first one, but I really wasn't expecting anything this horrible and disappointing as this movie, because Horrible Bosses 2 is one of the most underwhelming comedy's of this year.I chuckled about 2 times during the film and that's, the movie isn't all that funny and I don't get why people find this funny and yes I know people like different kind of comedy's but this one isn't.The writing isn't smart, the character's are stupid and forgettable and it was depressing experience that I every had during a movie that supposed to make you laugh, not to put you into silence.On light side of things is there anything good in this movie and I can say yes.

What audiences got was a surprisingly funny and refreshing comedy. Horrible Bosses 2 does not have the same luck or freshness.After attempting to kill of their bosses in a Strangers on a Train motif, Nick, Dale and Kurt want to try to become their own bosses. They want to start their own business together but things go horribly awry because of a wily and morally slippery investor. So, once again Nick, Dale and Kurt look to Motherf***er Jones for advice but this time kidnapping seems a better option than murder.Horrible Bosses 2 suffers from the sequel curse and not in a refreshing way, a la 22 Jump Street. The premise for the first Horrible Bosses may not have been novel or revolutionary but it was original and fresh. Horrible Bosses 2 attempts to recreate and manufacture the plot of its predecessor and the films ends up forced and tired.Of all the bosses from the original film, Jennifer Aniston's sex addicted dentist was the most overacted and exaggerated and by far my least favorite. With the other bosses from the initial story either dead or in jail that means Aniston's character is center stage weakening the plot further. With room in the story for new characters, the incomparable Christoph Waltz is cast as the corrupt investor that dupes Dale, Kurt and Nick. Waltz is unforgivably wasted and writer/director Sean Anders is wholeheartedly to blame.Horrible Bosses 2 is a worn out version of the original and while amusing-ish, would be very surprising if audiences laughed at any of the jokes.Please check out our website for all the recent releases, reviewed in FULL.",Horrible Bosses 2

84,LloydBayer,"While Horrible Bosses 2 is not entirely horrible, it is still a carbon copy of the first film.",5,7 December 2014,"You know something is not quite right when the original director and screenwriters are not involved in the making of a sequel. While some sequels have actually benefited from new scriptwriters and a different director, Horrible Bosses 2, if anything, stands testament to an age old maxim – 'don't fix it if it ain't broke'.What made Horrible Bosses a laugh out riot was a funny yet believable story about three white collar stiffs locking horns with their evil bosses. More than just an outrageous comedy, it was a dark fantasy appealing to every Tom, Dick and Harriet cursed with an over demanding boss. At some point, that fantasy works with universal reference to almost anyone watching that film. What worked well in the first film also ended with that film because original director Seth Gordon ensured there weren't many loose ends. One of the main problems with this sequel is the fact that there isn't an actual boss. After the farce that left one boss dead (Colin Farrell) and another in prison (Kevin Spacey), Nick (Bateman), Kurt (Sudeikis) and Dale (Day) return as potential entrepreneurs of a bathroom gizmo they call 'Shower Buddy'. But even before they sell their product, the trio is fleeced by real billionaire entrepreneur Bert Hanson (Christoph Waltz). Now calling themselves Nickkurtdale Inc, (pronounced as one word, this is even used as a racial gag), they then retort to the dark side by contracting the services of their former no-good adviser – Dean ""MF"" Jones. Returning as Jones, Jamie Foxx has the best lines in the film and somehow stays above the rest with nothing but amusing screen presence. With a little poking and prodding from Jones, Nickkurtdale devices the perfect plan – kidnap Hanson's equally ruthless son Rex (Chris Pine) as revenge and ransom. Problem is, Rex hates his father too, thus setting up this sequel into a heist of sorts.Gone is the chemistry between the three leads. Instead, they are written off as imbeciles. A major chunk of Horrible Bosses 2 is made up of whining and bickering from Nick and Kurt, and high pitched squealing from Dale, who turns out to be the team's dimwit with a retarded solution for every situation they encounter. If this is director Sean Anders and a trio of new scriptwriters' way of saying that office workers barely think outside their cubicle, they may be on to something by reiterating that a boss is only as horrible as an employee allowing said boss to remain so. That tick aside, everything else is mere copy-paste from the original including an almost ditto ending.With the story remaining the same, albeit without any real boss, the only difference is watching actors play concentrated versions of their former characters. Fans of the first film can revel in two short scenes that bring back Spacey, now a criminal with even more wicked sarcasm, while those who fantasized having Jennifer Aniston as a man-eater boss is in for another steamy treat. On the other hand, new additions played by Pine and Waltz aren't penned with enough gusto, especially if like me, you go in expecting maniacal devotion from the latter. At best, Horrible Bosses 2 is a re-written version of the first film. At worst, it is unnecessarily re-written. But if you decide to watch this sequel, the best thing you can do is highly recommend it to your boss; just don't blame me if you get fired.",Horrible Bosses 2

86,shawneofthedead,"Like its predecessor, this is uneven, offensive and fitfully funny, though it does benefit from a fantastic comic performance by Chris Pine.",5,1 December 2014,"In 2011, twisted workplace comedy Horrible Bosses made a killing at the box office - despite being tasteless, uneven and only fitfully funny. By the laws and logic of Hollywood, a sequel was, of course, inevitable. Horrible Bosses delivers much of the same stupid - and sometimes perversely enjoyable - comedy, buoyed by a cast so good and so game that many scenes end up being funnier than they probably were on the page.After failing to kill their horrible bosses in the first film, long- suffering pragmatist Nick (Jason Bateman), perennially horny Kurt (Jason Sudeikis) and clueless new father Dale (Charlie Day) decide to reclaim their lives and independence by becoming their own bosses. But they're again forced to contemplate criminal measures after falling prey to a scam of a deal brokered by ruthless billionaire Burt Hanson (a sadly under-used Christoph Waltz). The trio decide to pay off their imminent debts by kidnapping Rex (Chris Pine), the arrogant heir to the Hanson family fortune. Unfortunately, the course of true crime never does run smooth.There's definitely a lot going on here, much of it unfolding in episodic bursts of incompetence. Nick, Kurt and Dale sweat, squabble and offend a television host on the air. They optimistically bring Burt cake and balloons, only for their hopes and dreams to be ground into dust. They accidentally crash a sex addiction group when trying to break into the offices of Dale's sexually rapacious boss, Julia (Jennifer Aniston). This doesn't even account for the various spanners flung into the works by Rex, who gets more involved in the kidnapping attempt than anyone would expect.It's a shame that the narrative is powered by such a wildly uneven script. The film pokes fun at any and all targets, from Asian women to gay men, and takes particular delight in embarrassing its three leads. But, for every dumb and/or offensive joke that lands, there are three or four that barely raise a chuckle. Before the film charges into its frenetic final act, the relationships and characters have already started to wear thin - Nick constantly tries and fails to temper the abject idiocy of his two friends, while Julia pops up in a largely pointless subplot to serve, once again, as a tasteless walking punch-line.What Horrible Bosses 2 has going for it is its cast. Bateman, Sudeikis and Day bicker and banter energetically, striking up an amiable chemistry that makes some of the script's crasser moments work unexpectedly well. It remains great fun to watch Aniston, Kevin Spacey and Jamie Foxx reprise their roles from the first film, although the repetitive gags that accompany their characters can get a bit tiresome. The surprising standout is Pine, who exudes such a charming willingness to give himself over to the crazy comedy of his role that he steals pretty much every scene he swaggers through.Did a sequel to Horrible Bosses really need to exist? Not really. But, since it does exist, there's something to be said for the efforts of its hugely appealing cast. Their evident camaraderie and quite sublime comic timing frequently elevate a film that's just about as tasteless, uneven and fitfully funny as its predecessor. We're pretty sure the already tired jokes can't support a third film in the franchise, but who knows - the box-office receipts for Horrible Bosses 2 may beg to differ.",Horrible Bosses 2

88,squirrel_burst,"Rocky start, but full of big laughs",8,29 November 2014,"""Horrible Bosses 2"" starts off rocky, but in the end I laughed so hard and so often that it could easily see past that. The setup, like I said is pretty rough, but it leads into some good stuff, so bear with me. Between the first movie and this one, Nick (Jason Bateman), Kurt (Jason Sudeikis) and Dale (Charlie Day) have quit their jobs and started their own company. When a millionaire (Christoph Waltz) ends up putting them in a no-win situation, these three idiots get caught up in a kidnap and ransom scheme involving the man's son (Chris Pine).I can't reiterate enough how rough the beginning of this movie was. From the moment I saw the poster for this movie, I was wondering how they even set up a ""Horrible Bosses 2"". Weren't all of the issues from first movie totally resolved? How would these characters end up with bosses that were as bad, if not worse than the ones from the first film? That's why the weakest part of the movie is the beginning. They basically have to jump through these weird hoops to give us a new story. Once you get past that, and I certainly did, it is filled to the brim with laughs.There were not just one or two big laughs during this movie. I laughed consistently out loud because although I've come to kind of love the heroes in these movies, they are total idiots. That's what works with this movie. I'm sure there would be easier ways, if you applied real-world logic to this plot, for them to get out of the pickles they get themselves in. These guys are not bright enough to do this though. They think they learned their lessons from what happened in the first movie, and I suppose in a way they have. That doesn't mean they're any smarter though. This time around they have a slew of wholly new idiotic actions and decisions to make and they will do them over and over. That means you will get a joke, and it'll be funny and then out of the blue they will repeat that joke, right when you had forgotten about it and it becomes twice as funny. What I found surprising is that because the characters in this movie are so stupid, the plot becomes completely unpredictable. Oh you know that things are going to go wrong, but with these three, who knew what it was going to be? I think my favourite thing, above all is that this film is similar to the first one, but it isn't a rehash. It's just kind of inevitable at this point that these three idiots (and I really mean idiots; these guys couldn't willingly pull off a murder between the three of them in the first movie, and they barely got away with not getting all three of themselves killed) are going to get themselves in trouble. The trouble this time might have to deal with another horrible boss, but it's not the same exact situation where all three of them have to deal with a bad person and they decide to kill each other's bosses. This movie really is a sequel. It's the further adventures of Nick, Kurt and Dale. I was glad to be along for the ride.You can tell that everyone making this film was having a great time, and that it's infectious. The laughs come in quickly and consistently (and there are some outtakes during the credits to ensure you leave with a smile), there's great chemistry between all of the actors, the additions to this ""universe"" are a lot of fun, and they manage to make a sequel that will bring back some of the favourite elements from the first movie too. I didn't know what to expect out of ""Horrible Bosses 2"" and I really had a terrific time. I can't wait to watch the first movie again because knowing that these guys will have further adventures will probably make it even better. I'd be excited to watch it again because I was laughing so often that I know I missed out on a lot of the jokes. (Preview Screening on the big screen, November 20, 2014)",Horrible Bosses 2
89,trublu215,"As far as sequels go, Horrible Bosses 2 isn't all that bad.",6,27 December 2014,"Horrible Bosses seemed to be a miracle comedy back in 2011. It was funny, entertaining and had a great cast. Much like its predecessor, Horrible Bosses 2 is funny and entertaining but wastes its cast. Swapping out Kevin Spacey and Colin Farrell for Christoph Waltz and Chris Pine sounded like perfect replacements. Eh, I was half right. While Chris Pine is a horrible boss and his character lives up to being a colossal jackass, it isn't nearly enough to sustain the hard laughs that we got with Colin Farrell. Christoph Waltz is wasted in this film, it felt as if anyone could have played the part. Waltz is a phenomenal actor and why he would take such a useless role is beyond me. Despite these two problems, Jason Bateman, Jason Sudekis, and Charlie Day are hysterical as Nick, Kurt and Dale. The banter between Sudekis and Day are worth seeing it just for that. And while these performances are awesome, this is merely more of the same. Jennifer Aniston returns as the sex crazed dentist and has a few moments but it feels like they are wasted with having her spout off ramblings of graphic sexual dialog. It isn't creative, its lazy but like most comedic sequels, we've come to expect the film to be a re-hash of the first film. While there are a couple genuinely funny moments, Horrible Bosses 2 fails to improve on the original and feels more like Horrible Bosses 1.5 rather than a full on sequel. But, as I said above, for a sequel to a comedy, this isn't half bad. It has its moments of hilarity and if you like the first one, you'll like this one but if you're expecting an improvement or if Horrible Bosses 1 was enough for you, look for something else.",Horrible Bosses 2

The joke in the first one is good and make me laughed a lot but in this one its just become so stupid, its really stupid till its become as annoying as ever. I think that the joke its not like this in the first one, in this sequel Charlie and Jason are really looks like a clown duo who want to entertaining their audience with their obviously stupid joke. I laughed a little actually for some part but its really dragging and tiresome to absorb. I don't know why I forced myself to watch this till the end but I will not regret myself because my time will never come back. Better watch the first one again.

I actually enjoyed watching this, while the humour was of course sometimes a bit dumb, but like the first one, Horrible Bosses 2 is a dark comedy. When done well it can me hilarious, when done poorly it can be absolutely horrendous. With Horrible Bosses 2 they did an okay job. Sometimes the dark jokes go too far, but sometimes they are also just right.Still I got to laugh a lot, which is always a good thing when watching comedies. One thing that bothers me though is that the name is still Horrible Bosses while there really isn't a horrible boss here, not as clearly a in the first one at least. This is what can happen if you make a sequel when you didn't exactly plan it carefully. It has the title, and while Horrible Bosses 2 had a better plot, better twist, it's still carrying the name which is a bit ehh.",Horrible Bosses 2
93,robsta23,Surprised,7,12 February 2015,"I had low expectations going into this film, having watched the first again just hours before only to be disappointed with how little of the film I found funny this time. This being the first time seeing 2, I pleasantly enjoyed it. What surprised me the most was Chris Pine's psychotic performance - one great moment of the film is when Kurt yells that Rex is ""fight-clubbing"" himself (watch Fight Club by the way, great film and it will only make the joke funnier). From this moment and many others like this, 2 is similar to 1 in that it is a meta- film; it is not about making movies but discusses pop culture and the characters recognize crucial plot moments in the film saying ""this is the part where..."" or ""what a great twist"" and so forth. Meta-films have the effect of reflecting on themselves, reminding the audience that this is fiction, and while I have discussed this recently in class I'm not sure whether it necessarily makes a film ""better,"" but it is interesting to think about. What I both liked and disliked about the film is that it made use of jokes and similar plot structure from the first film. It was amusing to hear Harken use the ""50 states"" quote from the first film, but that made the film seem to rely on old material in order to be funny, and this isn't even clever like how 22 Jump Street actually made fun of the fact that it was a sequel. The plot structure relied on imitating that of the first film in certain ways which really brought my enjoyment down since it could not be more original - but at least it wasn't an EXACT copy like The Hangover Part 2. I was also surprised with what this film was able to do visually with a few different montages and the transitions between segments of those montages. My verdict is that Chris Pine was surprisingly the best part of this movie, and overall, even though I rate it higher mainly because the jokes of the first have grown old on me, it is as good as Horrible Bosses. 3.0/4.0",Horrible Bosses 2
94,MickeyTheConstant,The odd funny moment,5,29 March 2020,"There was the odd funny moment but all in all not as good as the first. If I could describe this film in one word it would be noisy. Charlie Day is the biggest culprit. He just shrieks and yells throughout the entire movie, that is his comedy style it seems. It just all felt a bit pointless and childish to me. Genuinely, I like movies like the Hangover and Bridesmaids but this is not in their league. It felt like three mates being told, here is a camera, just make it up as you go along and be as stupid as you want. Am a Bateman fan so not got any gripe against him or anyone else, just a very average film. Aniston is game as always, Foxx likewise. My wife normally likes this kind of stuff but even she said it was utter utter utter s#*%e. It gets five because it made me laugh a few times, it was non offensive and the cast seems like they gave it their all and had loads of fun. Am being kind to be honest.",Horrible Bosses 2

99,stephendaxter,Fails at doing what the first film did so well,5,15 December 2014,"Horrible Bosses 2 was yet another comedy sequel that failed to live up to the original offering very few laughs throughout. I did enjoy the first film and was looking forward to this one but this film lacked what made the first so good. For the most part the three leads in this film were largely unfunny and at times were trying too hard to force jokes where there wasn't any purpose for one. A lot of the jokes attempted felt too cheesy and obvious to be considered funny and the rape related jokes really highlight the lowest points this movie goes to. Many times throughout this movie it takes quite a bit of time away from the jokes to set up and continue the weak plot that felt way to comical and included everything we have seen before in generic comedy films. There were a few funny moments that made me chuckle but they were too little and not often enough to have much of a positive effect on the quality of the film. This attempt at a sequel was a definite miss by the director and actors that failed to live up to the original, even losing much of the focus on the 'bosses' idea that was the focus of the first film. I don't believe we will be seeing this band of brothers returning anytime soon. - 5.5",Horrible Bosses 2
100,lois-lane33,A genuine waste of time.,1,8 January 2015,"I thought the first Horrible Bosses film was good-a bit unpolished in places but basically a good & watchable funny movie. The sequel is actually an awful movie. The first film was flirting with tackiness but never really 'took the plunge' into true tackiness-but this one does. Unless you like jokes about gay men licking other gay mens asses: don't see this film. I think there is some stuff you just shouldn't say in a movie-apparently the producers of this potato don't feel that way. Also the interactions between the three main characters was so hard to watch in many cases in this sequel it made you crave watching a film on brain surgery-it was that crappy. Fortunately the cinema where I saw it took pity on the fact it was such a horrible movie and allowed me to get a refund after I departed the film after about 20 minutes worth of its brain shattering crap. I don't think there has ever been a time where they have made so many nothing movies before and I'm not talking about films like The Interview. Many of the supposedly funny/entertaining films that are more recent are just stupidity like this film. Just avoid it. The thing about that is the spate of dogs that they have been releasing are probably gong to coast some cinemas their businesses. I was the only person at this movie so when I left it was playing to an empty room, and that was in the early evening on a shopping night-the time when most people will take the time to see something at their local cinema.",Horrible Bosses 2

102,eschetic-2,The exception which may prove an essential Hollywood Rule,6,21 December 2014,"Two essential Hollywood Rules for considering HORRIBLE BOSSES 2: 1) Sequels are never equals and 2) Absolutes are never entirely accurate.HORRIBLE BOSSES 2, as the title makes painfully obvious, is a sequel to the ultra-broad 2011 (three year old) comedy HORRIBLE BOSSES out of the HAROLD & KUMAR / HANGOVER / DUMB AND DUMBER school. The original was somewhat scattershot with three friends attempting a comedic three-way variation on Hitchcock's classic STRANGERS ON A TRAIN plot and doing in each others' outrageous eponymous employers. OF COURSE it doesn't go as planned - only one of the bosses doesn't make it to the final credit roll and our heroes are free for the sequel under consideration here. This time the writing is rather more focused (only one crime motivated by one spectacular rip-off the three pals suffer in their first independent business venture together). The film being riffed on is technically every kidnap flick you've ever seen, but hews remarkably close to another superior comedy, RUTHLESS PEOPLE (the 1986 Danny DeVito/Bette Midler opus). OF COURSE the plan(s) ""gang aft agley."" Particularly aft...and in ways calculated to set up yet another sequel (what's a franchise without a trilogy?), but if the writing and acting maintains this basically funny a level with Jason Bateman a slightly dim voice of reason to ground the dithering of his clueless cohorts, Jason Sudeikis and Charlie Day, few will be seriously complaining.The surviving bosses of the first film, the now jailed Kevin Spacey and Jennifer Aniston as the libidinous therapist, return here in more peripheral roles (and promise to be around for the remainder of the franchise), as does the ""deus ex criminal machina,"" Jamie Fox. It is the new STARTREK's ""Kirk,"" Chris Pine (playing off his ""all surface"" image to indicate some real acting ability here), as ""Rex"" and INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS' Chrisoph Waltz as his nefarious industrialist father ""Burt Hanson"" who take center stage this time as the ""horribles"" with deliciously wicked two faced performances - sometimes more - although it is more of an open question who the BOSSES are in this case. What the heck?! We had six marvelous THIN MAN films and the titular thin man was only in the first.As the double entendre ads for the film trumpet: ""new crime, same tools."" Sean Anders (who also directed) and John Morris' screenplay dangerously quotes from the specifics of the failed plans from the uneven first film, but keep the comic drive on target and a good time is had by all - seemingly even those who ultimately get shot. The ""R"" rating is basically tied to several over the top rude speeches and general sexual references which are, in context, surprisingly innocent - although one of our heroes does ""get some"" in a clever turnabout of circumstances.Hardly the high comedy of those THIN MAN films, but a better structured and actually funnier film than the original; HORRIBLE BOSSES 2 is a perfectly fine way to spend a rainy Saturday afternoon.",Horrible Bosses 2

In reality the ""original"" plot, based on a rare (for a mainstream American comedy) case of fight between classes (but it is always lived with the aim of enrichment, so in a capitalistic point of view), were used in the first film, so here works more as a repetition.

105,vistheindian,Not so horrible,7,29 November 2014,"Quickie Review:Nick (Jason Bateman), Kurt (Jason Sudeikis), and Dale (Charlie Day) decide to become their own bosses and start a business together. However after being deceived by their investor Bert Hanson (Christoph Waltz) to the point of bankruptcy, they decide to kidnap the son Rex (Chris Pine) and hold him for ransom. Their misguided plan escalates in shenanigans when Rex willing participates in the kidnapping. Horrible Bosses 2 is one of the rare cases where the sequel is a noticeable improvement. This is thanks to actually having a different story from the original and the comedic chemistry of the trio. Horrible Bosses 2 may not be as gut punching hilarious as other comedies of this year and there are some missed opportunities with the new cast, but you'll still be laughing consistently throughout the movie.Full Review: My feelings towards the first Horrible Bosses were somewhat lukewarm. The comedy was a hit or miss for me. So going into this sequel I had managed expectations. I have to admit, my friends and I were laughing for most of the movie and we had a lot of fun watching it.First off, the main cast delivered well on their comedic timing. Bateman, Sudeikis, and Day balanced the line of lovable yet idiotic nature of their characters to hilarious effect. If it weren't for their chemistry and ad libs, the movie would have been a complete failure. It really comes across that they are having fun improvising their scenes, hence fun for us to watch. That's confirmed by the bloopers at the end as well. A surprisingly great addition to the cast was Chris Pine. I don't think we have seen a purely comedic side to him before. Nevertheless his character was a great fit, a blend of mild douchieness with the cockiness of Captain Kirk. Additionally I appreciate that the writers went a different route with the story. They could have easily given the three main characters new bosses and rehash the original story. Then we would have had another Hangover 2 situation on our hands. By making it different, the comedy felt fresh with plenty of unexpected twists and turns.I have praised the movie a lot for trying new things, but when it doesn't do that there are some problems. Mostly, this has to do with the returning supporting cast Jennifer Aniston, Kevin Spacey, and Jamie Foxx. There were many instances that felt like they were forcefully put in the movie to pull a specific kind of gag. This is most noticeable with Aniston's character. It's not the fault of the actors, they were funny in their roles, but it just felt out of place and pace with rest of the movie. On top of that, these supporting characters had so much screen time, there was barely any left for Christoph Waltz. This man is an artist when it comes to playing a villain, so it is shame how he has been relegated to at most 4 scenes for the entire movie. That for me is an unforgivable mistake on the filmmakers' part.All in all, Horrible Bosses 2 succeeded in what it was meant to do, make people laugh. Comedy is one of the most subjective genres, so here are some similar movies of this year to get an idea for the type of comedy: Bad Neighbours (Neighbors), and 22 Jumpstreet. If like me you weren't too fond of the first one, give this one a shot, I'm glad I did.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",Horrible Bosses 2
106,CowherPowerForever,Nick Kurt Dale,7,30 November 2014,"Three years after the widely successful and good film, a sequel has been made. Who didn't see this coming, right? While the idea of the first film falls apart in this film, this film still delivers some good laughs, and is about on par with the quality of the first film. The original film gets the edge because it was something different, while this is mostly more of the same. The following is my review of Horrible Bosses 2.This sequel was written by Sean Anders, John Morris, Jonathan M. Goldstein, and John Francis Daley. Anders and Morris did not work on the original film, and their recent work was Dumb and Dumber To, which was recently released. The story while not really involving much of the plot of the first film, and thus making the title of the film worthless, is still fairly interesting. The three guys are starting a business for themselves having the idea to create the Shower Buddy. When things go south on a deal, they all decide to kidnap the son of the man they have been dealing with. There are some twists and turns, and some very good subtle jokes that keep the movie fresh in my opinion. While originality has to be a factor for a sequel, we really don't get much of that here except when it comes to the jokes, which is why I say this film is almost on par with the first film. Overall, the writers have delivered a good story and some amazing jokes.The film was directed by Sean Anders(also writer). He recently directed the Adam Sandler film That's My Boy and also Sex Drive. While the overall film doesn't contain much that would warrant major acclaim, since it is a comedy film, there are some action scenes that look amazingly well shot without much CG. Getting the actors to work together so well is another key aspect, and Anders really is able to bring back those great aspects from the first film. Jason Bateman, Jason Sudeikis, Charlie Day lead the film as they did in the first movie, and they are just as hilarious as they were in the first film. I believe the subtle jokes in this film really give it that edge that most sequels don't have in this genre. With some good performances from secondary actors like Christoph Waltz, Chris Pine, Kevin Spacey, and Jennifer Aniston, this is one of the better acted comedy films.In closing, while there is not much in terms of originality compared to the first film, the jokes flow nicely and with a more subtle approach, it gives the film what it needs to be near the quality of the first film. Fans of the first film should be rushing out to see this film, while comedy fans in general should be excited for it as well. If you haven't seen the first film yet, that would be a good start, but it really isn't a must to see before viewing this film. Going into the film I heard so many critics saying they thought it was too far over the top, and in some aspects they are correct, but so was the first film. Major critics are often wrong and this is another example of them being wrong. Horrible Bosses 2 is one of the better comedies of 2014.7/10",Horrible Bosses 2

There is a lot plot development here compared to the first one and the story drives the humor and not the other way around.

I love Bateman typically, and he is still funny here. But the ""horrible"" writing, and the over involvement of other cast members has these guys doing too much and there's not enough room and lines for Bateman. The original also had three bosses, some dark humor, some wit, and some crazy graphic descriptions of their bosses. Here, there is literally none of that. With the cast, there is potential.

Original horrible bosses Spacey and Aniston get a couple of scenes each, and they are funny. New additions vary in effectiveness. Christoph Waltz and (in particular) Chris Pine are great picks to fill the antagonist slots. It's the same winning combination as the first movie, with silly, hilarious situations , my favorite probably being the Ocean's 11 style slick plan that goes totally haywire.The rude & crude humor, that's trademarked by the R-rated Jennifer Aniston who returns as Sex addicted dentist Julia. Bateman, Sudeikis & Day are on top form, ably supported by the returning characters of aforementioned Jenifer Aniston, Jamie Foxx (Django) as the shady ""MF"" Jones & Kevin Spacey as the hard boiled Harken. The fresh injections of Chirs Pine & Christoph Waltz are class, particularly Pine whose frenetic, zany prankster is priceless.Conclusion, Horrible Bosses 2 is a solid sequel, the continuity of the characters/atmosphere , new story with some surprises up it's sleeve & fresh injection of characters make for a fun time.

116,jackbanister16,Not worth the price of admission.,5,12 December 2014,"Just about every movie I've seen lately is not worth it. In fact, I feel like a dummy for even going to the movies lately. Maybe my taste is changing, but this movie was just boring. I, like most of the folks I've seen leaving a review, enjoyed the first ""Horrible Bosses,"" immensely and found it to be one of the better comedies in recent memory. I went into #2 knowing it wouldn't have the same comic surprise or wow factor, but I wasn't expecting it to be so boring.I'll be quick about my reasons why this movie sucks. Christoph Waltz' role is wasted. All he does is say, ""Oh, I am going to buy your company."" Oh and then he gets shot to death. One of the best actors in the film is probably the least used in the movie. Surprising because he could have been a really maniacal ""boss."" The brand of humor is not that funny. This movie tries to employ gags and sex humor as opposed to the last film which used more situational humor. Ex. ""Which Brady would you f**k?"" ""Oh, I'd have to marry Peter, kill Bobby, and f**k Greg."" Okay, so now we are resorting to pedophilia for laughs? Just dumb.The story is incredibly unbelievable. Really, it is. The first movie was a stretch, but at least it was semi-plausible. Jamie Fox's role as Mufugga Jones is just filler, no substance. The big joke about him being bad about negotiating is just an eye roller. He was not even 1/10 as funny as he was in the first movie. The only time I really laughed is the shower scene in the beginning of the movie. That part is genuinely funny, but the rest of the movie is a bore fest.This movie had an all-star cast and could have gone in any other direction, but it chose the ""kidnaping"" direction.

117,NicolasCostoglou,Even more chaotic...,7,23 December 2016,"This movie manages to be even funnier then the previous one, and has a bit more of a visual flare to some of the comedy scenes, but other than that it's a standard, modern, American, comedy film.The reason the first one worked well was because of the cast, the three leading actors are as great as before and even three (more or less) cameos from the first film are very fun to see.Christoph Waltz joins the cast and is very good as big business guy, but it's Chris Pine as his son who steals the show for the most part. He's absolutely fabulous.

The new Dumb and Dumber was much better and that says it all. Just avoid. A shame, the advert made it look funny.

Remember that old joke where the shadow of someone behind a curtain seems to be doing really dirty things? That's the opening gag in this movie, so I knew immediately that I was not in for a treat like the original. It just kept nosediving from there with an overplayed Macklemore song, a lackluster and forgettable Christoph Waltz villain, some painful jokes on par with the first one, and altogether a movie that should've been much better than the cash grab we were given. That being said, this movie was a better sequel than Hangover 2 because it was different than the first. I know it's ridiculous that yields bonus points for a bad movie, but the Hangover franchise set a new low. This movie is still a bad sequel because although it didn't steal anything old, it didn't bring any good new material to the table.

What we see is another movie that has a decent plot, for this type of comedy, but once again writers with a small vocabulary. It seems as if a third of the dialogue is made up of the f-word.While the sex-addiction sub-plot could be amusing, it went way to far (no pun intended)--with lines suitable for a porn movie. I was never a huge Jennifer Aniston fan, I lost a lot of respect for her with this movie.I believe Hollywood has a responsibility--because we give them so much of our money--to reinforce some levels of decency, if only with language. It seems that nearly every movie is trying to top ""Wolf of Wall Street"" for the raunch-factor, regardless of whether it has anything to do with the plot (and it did in ""Wolf""). Some studios and actors manage to make entertaining movies without lowering themselves--why not all? It adds NOTHING to these films and only serves to send our young people the message that this is an appropriate way to communicate.",Horrible Bosses 2
123,Allen_The-Shep_Shepherd,Horrible Bosses 2 Review,7,26 November 2014,"My Thoughts: Here we go again Nick (Jason Bateman), Kurt (Jason Sudeikis), and Dale (Charlie Day) are back and this time they want to be their own bosses and open their own company. The only thing is their is a new player in town Bert Hanson (Christoph Waltz) who wants to take their idea and make it their own. And then highjinxs ensues.I have to first say this was not as great as the second one but there is no doubt I was laughing my ass off during this movie. I do not know what it is when these three get on screen, the chemistry they seem to have and the way they play off each other just works. And throw into the mix Dr. Julia Harris (Jennifer Aniston) seeing and hearing the things she does in this movie are just eye openers and jaw droppers. She definitely steals the show when she is on the screen. Which I would say is hard to do with the main trio.Then enter Bert Hanson and his son Rex (Chris Pine). Christoph Waltz is an amazing actor and he plays the power hungry business man to the letter. And then we get Chris Pine and I have to say he does a good job playing the spoiled heir in waiting business man while his dad makes a business empire.Like I have said this movie is very funny. They do it right. They don't show all the great parts in the trailer and they have incorporated everyone that made it in the first movie into the second one nicely and even given them better roles in my opinion. Does this movie slow in places? Yes. But it makes it up in all the hijinxes that ensue.My Recommendation:If you are in need of a laugh this is the movie for you, go see it.",Horrible Bosses 2
124,InMyHonestOpinion,Déjàvu - recycled trash for the young of mind,3,26 December 2014,"Why do they always need to make sequels to films? I understand that making money is important but why do they continue to rehash and ultimately destroy something that was once good. When I first reviewed Horrible Bosses I thought it was OK and gave it 3 out of 5 due to the chemistry between the characters. Unfortunately though in a sequel things need to develop we need a reason to fall in love with these characters again, we need a reason to want to get involved in their lives even if it is only for a brief two hours or so. We also need some originality, new ideas, new jokes, and new laughs. What we don't want is recycled old cliché jokes once again based around exactly the same thing as the original film. We don't want the same we need it to be new or at least newer. Now their own bosses Nick Hendricks played by Jason Bateman (Arrested Development, Juno) , Dale Arbus played by Charlie Day (It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Pacific Rim), and Kurt Buckman played by Jason Sudeikis (We're the Millers, Hall Pass) having dumped their ex bosses have invented a shower buddy type of contraption that they want to market, after going on a morning show they are approached by an interested investor Rex Hanson played by Chris Pine (Star Trek, This Means War) and his father Bert Hanson played by Christoph Waltz (Django Unchained, Inglorious Bastards) who are both very keen in investing in the boys product who agrees to 10,000 units if the boys can manufacture the product themselves. They hire a warehouse, staff and on finishing the production go out to meet Bert Hanson and his son out on the golf green, where Bert quickly and callously informs them that he is no longer interested and instead will be picking up the products when it goes into foreclosure, as the trio can no longer afford to pay back the loan now that Bert has pulled the pin leaving them desperate. They devise a plan to kidnap Rex and ransom him for the amount they are out of pocket As I said earlier this is recycled trash and it stinks just as badly, the jokes are old and has been done to death, the fights between Dale and Kurt gets so tired very quickly. Once again it is d#ck jokes and who is the biggest loser out of the pair, who can scream the loudest and yell like a two year old, throwing a tantrum. Who can say the cheesiest sexist line also plays a huge part in the pairs antics, all the while Nick is the older mature figure who has to keep the peace. It's relentless and tired. Jennifer Aniston shows up once again reprising her old role as the sex mad dentist who'll do whatever she can to get Dale into her (literally) While Kevin Spacey also reprises his role albeit behind bars and still as arrogant and obnoxious as ever, also returning is Jamie Fox as MotherF#cker Jones, they trio's go to man when they need to commit a crime. A film for those young of mind, those who want to enjoy the stupidity that these kinds of movies offer. I can see this being appealing to mainly a male adolescent crowd but anyone who is in a good mood will get a laugh or two out of it as well.",Horrible Bosses 2
125,suicidea,"""Babies are like... potatoes with arms."" HAR HAR HAR",1,28 May 2019,"""Babies are like... potatoes with arms."" This is just one of the many scenes where Jason Sudeikis can't hold himself, breaks character and smirks at his own joke, in the early minutes of Horrible Bosses 2. Probably a sign of the horrors to follow. Along with scream-queen Charlie Day, Sudeikis plays a part of a trio of wannabe modern-day Stooges. The third part of the trio is Jason Bateman, who is forever doomed to play the straight man in comedy duos, trios and the rest.Not having seen the first movie, which I heard was actually funny, I went into this one with very little expectations. The plot involves the trio mentioned above, who come up with a simple product that could sell quite well and make them rich quick. But their investor is a cunning old fox, he screws them so bad that they're left with nothing. Nothing to do, except make him pay.While this sounds like a nice premise, what follows in the movie has little relation to it. This film could have the plot of Pulp Fiction, Citizen Kane or any Hitchcock film, and you still wouldn't remember anything about it afterwards. Charlie Day's constant screeching will drown out any thoughts you may have about the story.The main idea in a nutshell, the very basic concept of comedy that's being mass-marketed to audiences here, is this: ""Three guys talking and yelling all at once is funny."" How in the world this slipped through the meetings with the studio execs, the first drafts of the script, the later drafts, and afterwards slipped through the whole shooting process, without anyone noticing anything fishy about it, is a mystery.There are many, I mean MANY scenes in this film, ranging from 15 seconds to many long minutes, that consist of solely three guys yelling at once. Nothing else happens in these scenes, just constant yelling. It's impossible to understand anything that's being said, and if you happen to actually catch a word or phrase through all that noise, it's impossible to make out who said it. It doesn't matter, anyway. Because the big shots up there, holding the ropes to moviemaking for all the world to see, have decided that ""Three guys talking and yelling all at once is funny.""An example of the comedy routine, that's repeated many, many times throughout: Charlie Day starts yelling (you'd think his voice doesn't have any other mode) then the others join in the yelling... then Day suddenly shuts up and sits down extremely cool, like nothing happened, his hands on his lap, knees together, lips puckered, and... yes, you guessed it: eyes rolled up. Hello, and welcome to cheap comedy troupes from the 1920's. I almost expected a pie fight.Of course, the movie could still be somewhat funny if there were a few elements of real comedy, like well-written side characters. Like the Jamie Foxx character, ""MF Jones."" He's supposed to be very funny, and the audience is supposed to roll on the floor, breathless from laughter, because his name is MF. Get it? Now if you don't think a guy named MF is funny, you're missing what comedy is all about. Foxx doesn't utter a single funny line in his scenes. The whole premise of this character being funny is that his name is MF.Christoph Waltz, on the other hand, proves that he's one of the best, most convincing actors of our times. I've seen him on promotional interviews, saying ""...they (Sudeikis, Day and Bateman) are three of the funniest guys in show business."" And he said it without losing it. He didn't spit out his coffee or start laughing at his own words (unlike Sudeikis). He actually said this with a completely serious, straight face. His masterful acting was extremely out-of-place in a movie like this.Jennifer Aniston gives the strong impression that she was sick of her goody two shoes image from Friends and the by-the-book romantic comedies that followed, and craved to show audiences that she had a sexual side as well. She obviously wants to be recognized as a real hottie, a female, anything that is seen as a ""woman"", instead of ""Rachel"". Why wasn't I surprised that on the same promotional reels, the producers said ""She wrote some of the most explicit sexual lines herself"" ? You get the feeling that she'd even pay to have a role like this, rather than get paid.There is only one single line in the whole movie that's laugh-out-loud funny, and unfortunately it comes from Sudeikis, which made it somehow less funny. It's mind-boggling that he was given a part in these movies. He's never in character, he's Jason Sudeikis all along. I have never seen an actor so in love with himself, with his image, who finds himself so attractive and charming. He even surpasses Johnny Depp in that regard. A man who, if possible, would marry himself.",Horrible Bosses 2
126,dillylamar,Horrible Bosses 2,6,27 May 2020,"Despite its use of the same formula and gimmicks as the first film, its overall unnecessary attribute, losing some of its freshness and a lot of its black comedy energy, and maintaining some of same flaws, Horrible Bosses 2 is still a wild, fun, crazy, thrilling, and entertaining comedy, with a lot to offer in its insanity.",Horrible Bosses 2
127,jan_kalina,"""The right answer is because you are all morons!""",8,28 November 2014,"The chemistry between the main trio is what kept the first film together. It was the reason it was so successful, because of how visible the camaraderie is. The constant banter, Day's squeaky hamster voice and those sociopaths and psychopaths disguised as their bosses were the first film's big draws.This time around Nick, Kurt & Dale become entrepreneurs, start their own business with this shower head device called ""Shower Buddy"" and they are looking for a distributor. In comes Bert Hanson, who offers them a deal and in the end robs them of their company and the ownership of the ""Shower Buddy"" concept. Our three regular Joes are looking for a revenge and a way how to save the company. First time murder didn't work so let's try something else, right? The most noticeable difference about this sequel is the different approach to the humour.What I loved about the first film was the how much present was the black humour, which was a unusual for such a commercial comedy. The balance of the characters have changed instead of dealing with just one idiot in the group, Bateman's Nick now has to deal with two. Sudeikis's Kurt has changed from a sex-obsessed playboy into a sex-obsessed idiot. Nick now knows how to cope with his friends' moronity in order to not get upset. But still the banter between these morons is what makes the first film a great film, only this time they sometimes operate on borderline idiocy where you have to suspend your belief a bit.Revisiting the titular characters from the first film is a great but unnecessary activity - Kevin Spacey nails it once again and he is there for just a cameo, which is the exact time needed. Main problem for me was Aniston's Julia Harris. Her character is shoehorned into the story and creates an unnecessary obstacle for the main trio. Plus she forces Nick into telling one inappropriate story, not offensive, though. There is nothing offensive here. It just feels weird and out of place. Christoph Waltz who has showcased his incredible comedic talent numerous times is severely underused. He pops in for two or three scenes and doesn't really have any lines. Chris Pine, though comes off as a great comedic psychopath, he is that something fresh that every sequel needs. Although if you want to see him in a truly crazy, borderline psychopathic, devilish role then I recommend this year's Strech. Jamie Foxx returns as Motherf-cker Jones, although again unnecessary, his interactions with the main trio are still one of the funniest scenes in the film. Plus his role is quite significant in the third act. The car chase they get involved in has one gag which reminded me of the classic Simpsons humour.This time it is more visible that most of the film is improvised, when not all the jokes come off as funny. But the scripted ones (the imagined pick-up of ransom vs. what goes down afterwards, the car chase and plenty more) hit you hard and you end up laughing in your seat.A bit of a step down from the first (for me a classic) film but still a great a sequel which serves you a great time at the cinema.",Horrible Bosses 2

This sequel, however, is one of the funniest films I have ever seen and certainly to my mind the most outstanding example of a sequel improving on its predecessor.The film is cleverly plotted with refreshing comedic ideas. It also references the first film in welcomed ways. This time around the trio can just go for it with a great script and the experience of the 2011 film. I found Charlie Day's Dale Arbus annoyingly over the top at times in the original, but in this sequel everyone is on point with real comedic chemistry.Christoph Waltz continues to flourish with his supporting role. Chris Pine is great in his role. Jamie Foxx and Kevin Spacey successfully reprise their roles as expected. I do not normally think of myself as a Jennifer Aniston fan, but she is indispensably good in both films.

Spacey plays ""Dave Harken,"" ""Nick's"" now jailed boss whose incarcerated for murdering Kurt's old boss. The trio seeks hopeless advice from ""Harken"" when they visit him in jail, but all he does is criticize their bad business decisions which leaves them with nothing but a bad but funny situation.

Finally, Jamie Foxx is the bad boy ""MF Jones"" in the film they also seek advice from, but he really has nothing good to offer them until a helping hand towards the end of this movie.I found this Rated R Film to be entertaining, funny, and some of the comedy skits featured the main characters, Nick, Dale, and Kurt plain playing dumb.

132,Matt-144-792009,Bends You Over A Barrel Of Laughs and Shows You The 50 States,8,19 November 2014,"Horrible Bosses 2 picks up right where the original left off, joining Nick (Jason Bateman), Kurt (Jason Sudeikis) and Dale (Charlie Day) on another hair brained scheme. They are joined by some familiar faces, Jennifer Aniston, Kevin Spacey and Jamie Foxx as well as some new characters played by Chris Pine and Christoph Waltz. This time our guys find themselves involved in a kidnapping plot, where similar to the Big Lebowski the kidnapping details come secondary to big laughs. Bateman, Sudeikis and Day show us they are a comedy trio as strong as the original Stooges. Yet they have the endurance to push it to a second film and with any luck, beyond. Having recently sat through the molestation of my childhood favorite comedy in Dumb and Dumber To, I needed to be reminded of how occasionally Hollywood gets it right. Like in this movie and 22 Jump Street; a film I feel is as much on par, getting the same level of fresh laughs. I just love a good comedy, enough to subject myself to the long shot of an enjoyable sequel. Like a battered wife I went back to all three Hangover films. They will change, they will get better, I promise. Never did. The writer and director of Horrible Bosses 2 Sean Anders, was one of the many writers called on to fix the Dumb and Dumber To script. I assume he saved all his good ideas for HB2. And with a cast as great as this, from what I can assume are genuinely hilarious actors all at the top of their game. Face it Jim Carrey, the torch needs to be passed. What works so well about HB2 is it does not try to recreate the original, shot for shot, plot for plot. If fans wanted to see the exact same film they would rent Horrible Bosses 1. The formula in HB2 is they take the brilliant dynamic of the guys, bring back the hilarious side characters and up the stakes with some new blood. This film has quotability, re- watchability and with any luck a fun filled franchise that can continue to generate great laughs. Or know when to quit when its ahead.

The three leads are good and have good chemistry, but even they seem to be going through the motions for much of the movie. I got so tired of the tongue in cheek references to the first movie, we already saw the first movie, do something new. There is just not enough new here, and the tacked on new characters bring nothing, nor does Kevin Spacey impersonating someone picking up a paycheck. If the movie is on HBO and you have HBO, enjoy.

Dale, Kurt and Nick decide to start their own business but things don't go as planned after a slick investor really screws them over.I was a fan of the first Horrible Bosses film but Horrible Bosses 2 is a good example that not every good movie needs a sequel. The writing feels lazy and rushed; I found myself chuckling but I was hoping to have more big laughs like in the first movie.The cast is made up of amazing actors: Jason Bateman, Jason Sudeikis and Charlie Day have a fun chemistry together but for some reason this movie didn't harness it, which hurts the film. I love Jennifer Aniston's character but this time they toned her down when they really should of amped her up. Kevin Spacey also returns and the scenes with him are worth watching and as always he steals the show. Christoph Waltz is a new addition to this movie; I'm a big fan of Waltz but just like the rest of the characters in this film his is two dimensional.The director Sean Anders did a grate job with the car case by using the right mix for action and comedy. As for the rest of the movie, he really depends on montages which should really only be used occasionally in a movie.Most of the time Horrible Bosses 2 is quite boring, it doesn't bring anything new to the table and it feels lazy.

This well executed, politically incorrect caper movie hits the comedy bulls-eye. Jason Bateman has so paid his actor's dues since having to take such schlock roles as Ray in Will Smith's 2008 'Hancock'.As in his absolute 2013 gem, Bad Words, Bateman nails the comic timing along with his ensemble buddies, Charlie Day and Jason Sudeikis. These are three comedy actors at the top of their game. Their riffing is exquisitely funny and relentless. It's done without falling into indulgences so often seen from their contemporaries. And Day's stressed, high pitched voice, like the story, is naturally hilarious.

141,jvormer,Probably worst sequel ever,2,30 September 2020,"To start of Horrible bosses 1 was epic and funny as hell. But when analyzing why it was funny it was mostly due to the antagonists ""the bosses"". The second installment misses that and 25 minutes into the movie I was still waiting for an original joke. Timing is totally off and the past of the movie is so annoyingly slow, the jokes so lame that the whole experience becomes a horror instead of a comedy.Do your self a favor stick to the original and treasure those moments. Dont let Horrible bosses 2 ruin it!",Horrible Bosses 2
142,film316-125-427677,This time it's kidnaping,6,1 February 2015,"It's strange how films reflect our climate, 2 years ago during the recession, Horrible Bosses was released; a film about taking vengeance on the millionaire tools who we work for, it was a film about justice and revenge, with sex jokes. So try to imagine a film without justice and revenge as a theme, that's Horrible Bosses 2, but don't worry they have kept the sex jokes.So what can be said for a film about 3 losers with some style who go on a crazy unplanned adventure together? Well quite a lot really, as there are A LOT of films fitting that outline, so what makes Horrible Bosses 2 different? Was it that Jason Bateman in it? No I mean what makes it REALLY different? Oh that's right. Nothing. So why watch the film you are wondering? Because, as much as it pains me to say this, it is hilarious.Yes, Horrible Bosses 2 is a film that made me laugh out loud on multiple occasions, it is sharp with its whit and clever with its references. Horrible Bosses was a movie that was confined to one single premise, but with Horrible Bosses 2 the writers were able to stretch their wings, and boy do they.Sure the film doesn't have anything particularly imaginative in and it won't change the way you see the world, but it's a comedy about 3 idiots kidnapping a billionaires son, did we really expect Hamlet? I know I didn't and that's what made it funny.The best stuff in Horrible Bosses 2 is when Nick, Kurt and Dale are left to their own devices. It's clear that Jason Bateman, Jason Sudeikis and Charlie Day are naturally funny people, you can see it just by the way they are on screen. When it's just the 3 of them talking or interacting comedy happens, however as so often with great groups the bigger the group the less time for jokes.It's interesting to see Chris Pine and Christoph Walz join the team as Bret and Rex Hanson. These are two men I would not directly connect with comedy, yet here they are doing just fine in Horrible Bosses 2. It's good to see Christoph Walz chewing the screen up with his deadpan performance as Bert, but I'm starting to think the man is typecast as a villain forever. What surprised me about Horrible Bosses 2 is how good Chris Pine really is, you can see he is truly enjoying himself but he plays an all-out lunatic in Rex. I never knew he had it in him. Just in case we thought we could forget Kevin Spacy and Jennifer Aniston drop in for an appearance. I've always enjoyed seeing Spacey try and convert his natural menacing persona into funny.Horrible Bosses 2 is a movie that I enjoyed more looking back at it than I did at the time, I'm sure some people will LOVE it, but for me it ticked all the boxes for a strong comedy about 3 guys with no clue. Horrible Bosses 2 is like if The Inbetweeners were adults.",Horrible Bosses 2
143,anteksw,Fun... but Ultimately Disappointing,7,16 February 2015,"I had a strange mix of expectations when going into this film, I was feeling sceptical due to initial critic and audience reviews... yet I still expected greatness simply from the chemistry between the trio continuing their strangely delightful shenanigans. After all, the first 'Horrible Bosses' is one of my favourite films, and one of the things which I greatly admired was the naturally flowing chemistry between the trio of Nick, Kurt and Dale; for me, it was one of the most important aspects of the film and helped it maintain as enjoyable as it was. Anyhow, let's get to the actual review of this film instead of showing my appreciation for its predecessor.'Horrible Bosses 2' was, in all honesty, not a ""terrible"" film. It's definitely not one of those films that is unbearable to watch purely due to how bad it is. Instead, it is just simply ""fun"", it had certain (although small) aspects that definitely made the film work, but it also had extensive aspects which ultimately made this film a disappointment. One of those aspects that largely brought the film down throughout was the poor writing, not the actual plot, but some of the dialogue and predominantly the idiocy surrounding every character in the film. This could be understandable in a comedy filled with absurd humour such as 'The Naked Gun' or 'Anchorman', in which the naive characters are constructed in such a way purposely, and on top of that, very effectively in terms of the comedy. In this film, though, the naivety and simple stupidity of some of the characters is highly questionable; it's never clarified and frankly takes away from the engagement in the plot as well as the characters.Just to reinforce, the script is so badly written that the characters seemingly changed aspects of their personalities as well as their IQ levels severely since the previous film, purely for the comic relief of essentially ""acting dumb"". This also affects the unforgettable chemistry between the three characters which ultimately made this film a disappointment for me, unfortunately. All of the actors work well with what they have to work with, to put it simply, I would personally blame the poor script rather than the individual actors for certain scenes that felt forced or simply unnatural. However, there are certain segments which certainly pay off in terms of humour and genuinely made me laugh out loud, despite the fact that I wasn't initially expecting great humour as the first film didn't make me laugh that much; it simply succeeded in being entertaining as hell with many more perks.One thing that is worthy of praise however, is the perfect soundtrack. It carries the tone from the first film smoothly, but unfortunately, that tone also becomes slightly distracted by the poor writing and drastic character changes as mentioned previously. The plot itself isn't actually bad either; initially I saw a lot of potential for a lot of entertaining 'shenanigans' occurring, but the lack of focus made the supposed 'shenanigans' in this film highly unbelievable and thus left me with the feeling that the whole film was rushed. Overall, it's pretty obvious to assume that I am mostly disappointed due to the sequel not living up to its predecessor (which, in this industry, is highly unusual anyway). Nonetheless, this is a fairly enjoyable film and although its weak points are highly visible throughout they are not too overly distracting, and the overriding tone from the previous film allows for a decent and light-hearted watch with your family or friends.",Horrible Bosses 2
144,Discogodfather9622,Better than the first.,6,18 February 2015,"I was not a fan of the first Horrible Bosses, so naturally when I heard they were making a lazily named sequel I ignored it. The bad ratings certainly helped with my decision-making as I sat smugly behind my computer congratulating myself on not throwing more money into the Hollywood machine. I was wrong. Horrible Bosses 2 is a funny movie and a HUGE improvement over the first and I think we can thank director Sean Anders for that by focusing more on laughs and less on the lame plot. Charlie Day, Jason Sudeikis & Jason Batman reprise their roles as friends and now business partners who create a bathroom accessory called the ""Bathroom Buddy."" Approached by father/son investors Chris Pine & Christoph Waltz, the three friends think they finally made it until at the last minute it's reviled they have been ripped off. The DVD's bonus features consist of deleted scenes and various featurettes as well as the film itself being an extended cut. The plot is secondary in this sequel and rather boring, but it's made up by the fact it's filled with a lot more laughs than the first. Plus we get the added bonus of hearing Jennifer Aniston talk dirty oh, so dirty.",Horrible Bosses 2

146,jeffdrollins,An unnecessary but funny sequel,7,19 December 2014,"Hollywood's strategy of wringing every last ounce of life out of a successful idea via sequels, prequels, spin-offs and the ""partification"" of films has been discussed to death. At this point I'm almost as tired of having that discussion as I am seeing the subject at hand play out in real life, over and over again. It is with this mindset that, upon seeing the trailer for Horrible Bosses 2 for the first time, I loudly sighed in my theater seat and thought to myself, ""Why the hell are they doing this?"" And despite the actual answer being EASY MONEY, after actually seeing Horrible Bosses 2, I can honestly make a case that maybe – just maybe – these people actually wanted to get together again and make a funny movie for the sake of comedy. Exhibit A: The jokes are solid and, in most cases, funnier than the first film's. Part of that is a result of just letting a joke breathe and flourish naturally via timing and delivery. One gag in particular regarding the use of walkie-talkies nearly made me choke on my popcorn specifically because of how well it was executed through dialog alone. The first Horrible Bosses was more comparable to The Hangover films in that a group of white guys get in over their head and endure insane circumstances, each one more outlandish than the one before it. This time around, while we're still very much in the Hangover spirit of storytelling (I use that term in the loosest of senses), the film is much more reliant upon the comedic chemistry between our three leading men. That leads me toExhibit B: This cast is simply fantastic. Reprising their roles as Nick (Jason Bateman) the straight man, Kurt (Jason Sudeikis) the womanizer, and Dale (Charlie Day) the fool, the three stars of this film bounce lines off one another like bumper cars to increasingly hilarious effect. Bateman shines brightest and that speaks volumes on his talent considering he's been playing variations of this role for nearly his entire career without the shtick showing any signs of wear – at least as far as this film is concerned. Sudeikis and Day get to play human cartoon characters the entire film and it simply just works. Also back is Jamie Foxx as the criminal consigliere, ""Motherf***er Jones."" While this character did nothing for me the first go-round, this time I find myself enjoying his dimwitted power plays and Big Gulp inflected sit- downs. Jennifer Aniston also returns as her sex-addicted dentist from the first film and gets to appear in the funniest scene of Horrible Bosses 2. Newcomers Chris Pine and Christoph Waltz also bring a welcome exaggerated Big Business brass ballsiness element to the film's central plot that just makes the story that much more relevant. Speaking of the plotExhibit C: This story is conducive to comedy as well as being socially relevant. Nick, Kurt and Dale have created a product that Christoph Waltz agrees to help manufacture. Once the order has been completed, Waltz's character then cancels the order in a strategy that will allow him to purchase the product at pennies on the dollar once our three heroes have to claim bankruptcy. In a climate where we are mistrusting of the unscrupulous 1%, this plot has a sort of resonance that hits home with modern movie goers. I'm also fairly certain that more folks can relate to being screwed over by their boss (or the boss's conniving underling) than they can to their mega-hot co-worker trying to seduce them against their will. Basically, this film corrects every issue I had with the first one in that it unifies the protagonists motivations with the audience's desire for them to stick it to the man. It reaches across the aisle and finds a middle ground we can all agree on – and then it amps it up to mach speed by way of kidnap, hostage taking and much worse.With all this praise you might think I'm ready to call this a modern comedy classic. I'm not. Horrible Bosses 2 has problems. It's not shy to rely on gross-out gags, it has no shame in reprising jokes from the first film (albeit sparingly so), and it might as well have been directed by Apple CEO Tim Cook because, as Erik Walkuski of ScreenCrush noted in a tweet, Horrible Bosses 2 looks like it was filmed on an iPhone. That is to say there is no personality to the look of the film. It just is. While that's not a major concern for a comedy, it does leave a bit to be desired in the aesthetics department.I present my case that Horrible Bosses 2 is a win for everyone. Hollywood will make a nice payday while being able to say, ""See! People want more of the same"" without a hint of irony to be found. Audiences will get to laugh for a straight 110 minutes in the company of characters they already know they like spending time with based on the success of the first film. And although this could mean ""more of the same"" is all we're ever going to get, I'd like to put a positive spin on things and hope that maybe someone behind the scenes is paying attention. Maybe, just maybe, someone will pick up on the fact that this film is better than the first because it's actually just better in every sense of the word. Probably not though. *a football hits me in the groin and a laugh track explodes from an unknown dimension*",Horrible Bosses 2

If not, go right ahead",7,12 April 2015,"Horrible Bosses 2 [2014] is the comedy film (directed by Sean Anders) which reintroduces Nick (Jason Bateman), Kurt (Jason Sudeikis) and Dale (Charlie Day) from the first installment. Sick of working for someone else, they create their own company and invent 'The Shower Buddy' (a new product that cuts shower time in half). When their only investor cancels their order, the comically inept trio secure a large debt and 100,000 units of their own product. To recoup their financial losses, they decide to kidnap the rich investor's son (Chris Pine) and hold him for ransom. Better than the original. A comedy sequel that's funnier than the former film is a rare thing. HB2 features the first HB characters: Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Aniston and Jamie Foxx in standout expletive laden scenes that will be quotable for quite some time. I had no idea that Chris Pine could be funny. Right chemistry and timing. At every turn, the trio make such stupid decisions, that one would start to resent these characters that take us along on a cringe inducing trip. But, the dynamic between the main characters with their incessant yammering and likable demeanors makes the trip worth it.

With the success and popularity of the first movie horrible bosses 2 was inevitable. For the most part whilst watching this film i was entertained however after thinking it over there are a lot of problems. Les start with the positives. The main trio are back and they are great together. Jason bateman Charlie day and Jason sudeikes are all great together just like in the first. With that said there characters have gotta act like dumb asses half the time and after a while it does get kinda boring. Ill give the movie credit as it does try and be different which i actually liked. The addition of Chris pine is also a plus to the movie and he had some really funny moments. However Christoph waltz is a different story. He wasn't bad in the movie but he wasn't in the movie enough which is kind of disappointing. Actually that is another big flaw with this movie. There are so many characters in this movie and they are all kinda pointless and didn't need to be there at all. Kevin spacey,Jennifer anniston and Jamie foxx characters feel like there in this movie just because they were in the previous one which is stupid.

I knew (My Hollywood Boyfriend) Jason Bateman wouldn't let me down — he and the rest of the cast of Horrible Bosses 2 showed us how to properly put out a funny sequel. After a disappointing Dumb and Dumber To, this movie was a welcome surprise that needs to be on your list when it's your turn to pick. If you are looking at the line-up for the weekend and just want something everyone will enjoy, check out Horrible Bosses 2. It's worth the box office price with a side of popcorn and a coke!Horrible Bosses 2 was exactly what I was hoping for — a fun, great, laugh out loud movie to step away from reality a bit and hang out with some of our favorite guys. For those of us that like adding movie one-liners to our repertoire, — Bateman, Sudeikis and Day are happy to oblige. There were so many funny moments from the best characters in Horrible Bosses plus the welcome addition of Chris Pine and Christopher Waltz.The movie didn't try to remake Horrible Bosses. It didn't try to force us into a ""thou shall think this is funny"" jokes. You don't need to see Horrible Bosses to understand or enjoy the sequel. It seemed to just be a fun movie to make. When you can feel genuine chemistry on the screen it plays out for the audience. Simply put, it's just good comedy with a well written script acted by a group of folks who really seem to enjoy each other. Will it someday be on the AFI Top 100 list? No. Is it something you'll want to see again? Absolutely. Will we add it to our purchased list when released to DVD? Oh yes! It's one of those movies that is good to put on when you have someone visiting or just want a night away from drama (on screen or in life!)I'm not usually one to comment on the soundtrack — but I must say every song seemed to come straight from my playlist! Who doesn't want to enjoy a bit of Katy Perry ""Roar"" with some Macklemore & Ryan Lewis ""Can't Hold Us""! Fantastic! Are they still making movie soundtrack CD's anymore?!?! Because I'm in!On a personal note — I also enjoyed the ""American Manufacturing"" and ""American Dream"" basis for the script. Being a huge of American Manufacturing, the story was a welcome (and funny) look at the challenges of ""Making it in America"". One of my favorite lines that I think will get a chuckle out of manufacturing fans — ""The American Dream is built in China"". Hilarious.Bottom line, there are some laughs in here for everyone (unless you can't handle potty humor  that's what this is full of!)

This is all-out-leave-nothing-open-to-questions with regards to every kind of sexual act and the participants thereof.

You wait and see.""- Roger Ebert.That was from the late Roger Ebert's review of Horrible Bosses which turned out to be prophetic. These unnecessary sequels have clearly become an epidemic in Hollywood. A month from now we'll get ""Hot Tub Time Machine 2"" at it doesn't even have John Cusack in it. Look, I really enjoyed the first film, but this is definitely a sequel none of us asked for and does not provide enough to justify it's existence. The antagonist in this film isn't even a Horrible Boss, he's a wealthy businessman who steals the protagonist's invention to get richer. Regarding the plot, it involves a kidnapping, car chases, very little we haven't seen before. Jennifer Aniston returns and did what she did best in the original film playing a sex-crazed Nymphomaniac. Kevin Spacey returns as a cameo in prison and he did the best with what he was given. However another two-time Academy Award winner Christoph Waltz plays the antagonist and I thought his talent was completely wasted. The strength from the original film was the chemistry between Jason Bateman, Charlie Day, and Jason Sudekis, which was present here and it both provided occasional laughs and kept the movie going. Though most of the humor was gross-out sex gags, which got a lot of laughs in the theater but at the end of the day were pretty uninspired. The film's credits are a long blooper reel (like in the original) which I didn't have the patience to sit through. As the sequel in lacks the self awareness of ""22 Jump Street"", a film that proved it's worth as both a sequel and a stand alone film. That film brought out the best of the actors and even gave them more to work with. Just compare the end credits of ""22 Jump Street"" and ""Horrible Bosses 2"", you can see what sets these movies apart.",Horrible Bosses 2

His voice was so squeaky, and forever on-going, I finished that film with a god awful headache. I know the three of them are meant to make bad decisions constantly because it's part of the humor of the show, but for me, all it was, was extremely exhausting, and it was mainly to do with Charlie Cox being the squeaky, childish idiot, who can't keep his mouth shut.

A better title would be ""Horrible Dudes, Too"", or better yet, ""Horrible Tools To..."". On the plus side,the camaraderie between the trio is intact; Aniston and Spacey do not disappoint in some deliciously villainous scenes; Foxx brings much needed braininess; and Pine and Waltz are both welcome additions (though the latter is criminally underutilized). Unfortunately, while there are some decent - or indecent! - gags along the way, this sequel is about as sophomoric as they come and shamefully lame given the calibre of the actors and the size of the film's budget. Beyond the clichés and weak story arc, much of the banter isn't that clever or funny. It's too bad that in their haste to strike while the market is hot, the producers and script doctors so compromised quality, settling for a connect-the-dot storyline that looks like it was developed by a bunch of fifth-graders. While good comedy can come from the most simple ideas and should be edgy, this movie frequently peddles the cheapest brand of chuckles by offensive stereotypes and degrading treatment of Latinos, Asians, and African-Americans.

But this one is a comedy and it must not have a good story to be fun. It made me laugh most of the time and all other people in the theater. So if you want a good comedy to make you laugh and forget about everyday life i recommend you this movie, but only if you watch the first part first. Actors like Foxx, Spacey, Waltz and Anniston made this for a bit better. My favorite thing about this is Mother*ucker Jones. He is maybe the best role in a comedy in the last couple of years. That is why I gave the movie a 10 because it is a comedy and comedy is made to make you laugh. It has succeeded in doing that pretty much.

I guess they kinda have to in order to make the dull and predictable plot work. It's not a surprise that there's a sequel, since the first one made money and of course comedy movies have smaller budget, meaning less risk. So it follows the same path the Hangover series did or the recent Jump Street series.For movies that weren't meant to have sequels, it gets real awkward watching the writers and the directors try to create one. But if the studio wants it then the studio gets it. It's not limited to comedy either. Case in point, Taken.Just like 22 Jump Street this movie makes it obvious that it's trying to recreate the magic of the first movie verbatim. So it follows similar jokes from the first but with minor variation. It knows the people paying to watch it in theatre don't care for the story-line. They just want to be entertained. However, is it entertaining? Well that'll depend on individuals. As mentioned in the beginning, the obvious dumbing down of the characters to make the plot work is very distracting. It didn't work for me but it might for others. At the end of the day, nothing would be amiss in Hollywood if this movie didn't exist. Unfortunately it does.

Horrible Bosses starts back up again with Nick (Bateman), Kurt (Sudeikis) and Dale (Day) with their new invention: the Shower Buddy. They are trying to make their way into the working world again, but they are now they're own bosses. They don't have to deal with the bull they dealt with their former bosses. They thought they were getting a good deal with Burt Hanson (Christoph Waltz), an investor to start up their business, only to get sucker-punched and lost everything to Hanson. They have no other options to get back the patent to their invention but to kidnap Hanson's son Rex (Chris Pine) for a handsome fee. With Rex in on the kidnapping, they think they have a solid plan, but of course, things turn upside down and once again Nick, Kurt and Dale are on their own to make things right again before they end up behind bars. The cast was amazing as always, and Jennifer Aniston returning as Julia, Dale's former boss was hilarious as always. I like to see her in roles like this because she carries comedy very well. Pine was great as well, playing the undermining, crazy, spoiled brat Rex Hanson.This film truly held its own as a sequel. They didn't do much of outrageous situations for laughs. It was just right. It was just as funny as the first one, if not funnier. I was really surprised because I know how I can be when it comes to sequels. My mother even enjoyed herself with this film, and it takes a lot to keep her interests. I would see this again because 1. I liked it and 2. I saw it at a screening and missed a few things, but I wouldn't seeing it again, even if I didn't miss a thing.",Horrible Bosses 2

You must of course like comedies with stupid characters making stupid decisions.I remember watching the first one and felt that it wasn't as entertaining as this one.The first part is kind of slow, but it builds quickly and you get into the movie. What will happen next? How are they gonna get out of that situation?Some «iconic» scenes of the first movie are referred to, but they were shorter thus I found them funnier, as I felt too much time was spent on these jokes in the first movie. Laugh once, get on to the next joke; It was much better.And the car chase is really great and something out of the ordinary. That sequence should be classified with the «most memorable movie car chases».I was torn between giving it a 6 or a 7 out of 10 and decided to go with 7 because I prefer to be in the «Love it» camp than in the «Hate it» camp.

174,ajaysinghjaswal-133-244502,Horrible Bosses or Moron Bosses,6,30 November 2014,"I think the better suited name for the movie would have been Moron Bosses than Horrible Bosses 2. Movie does not have any more horrible bosses to deal with but this time the trio have themselves turn into their own bosses, trying to run a business they have no idea of and hiring staff based on looks than brains. And they are really moron bosses because they can manage to put the jobs of their own employees in danger.The movie is quite hilarious but that is only because it runs on the age old cheap formula of comedy 'dirtier the jokes more the laughter.' The script lacks in many ways. The story itself is quite lame and predictable. I think the only reason the movie is made because the first one was a hit. So it was decided to create the second part. The first part dealt with something that audience could relate to. We know horrible bosses do exist in huge quantity. But Horrible Bosses 2 is just an average story where Nick, Kurt and Dale have turned into even bigger morons. Which is an unnecessary choice of lowering down the characters to get few more laughs. It seems losing the job in the first place did not do any good to their characters. Another painful aspect of the movie is Christopher Waltz role is hugely undermined as villain. I am not even sure why Waltz had agreed for this role. But whatever was given to him he did his part very well and still remains, as always, the charming villain of our time. Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Aniston and Jammie Fox were also brilliant although they have very little to play. Chris Pine is average in his role.Let not keep Jason Bateman, Jason Sudeikis and Charlie day out of the line. Their characters were moron but they still played their roles very well. My rating is only to the acting in this movie. Besides that, I am not inclined to give any rating to the direction and the story. They could have done much better than this. Especially, after seeing what Sean Anders had done in We're The Millers I am sure he could have written a better story here. The chemistry between Jason and Jason and Charlie is kept intact from the first movie. That is a good part of the story. But jokes at some point become too gross. The subtleness of the previous movie is missing here except in few scenes. The movie can give you one and a half hour of laughter but that's where concept of comedy ends. So if you are in for it and do not mind lewd jokes please go ahead and watch the movie but don't expect a brilliant story like the previous one. It ain't there.",Horrible Bosses 2

Outside of the 3 main characters though is well acted and quite funny but the 3 guys have graduated into some sort of parody of the 3 stooges!Actually that is unfair, Jason Bateman's character is the only sensible one and doesn't make you want to scream. The other 2 however are nothing short of awful. They act and react in ways that no one would in reality.The movie is so bad that I struggled to actually watch it. I was determined to see it through the end though but could only watch it in segments 15 minutes long at a time as it became just too painful otherwise.",Horrible Bosses 2

However, I didn't find myself laughing as much as the first time round, and for me I feel it was no longer about their 'horrible bosses'. If you think the film continues with the original story, you are wrong. The 3 men try to launch their own Shower buddy product, and when they go to get it invested into, it backfires. The original cast is still the same, but 2 new characters are added in, and the father and son duo create the new storyline. The 3 men threaten the father by kidnapping his son, even though his son knows about it. After what seemed to me like a very long main story, it finally got good at the end, when the father is killed and the son attempts to get the 3 men arrested, which also backfires. The two horrible bosses from the first film are still in the story line, but it is not about them any more. And for me, I think that ruined the whole story when they become freelance workers, and not as much humour is there any more. I rate the film 7 out of 10.",Horrible Bosses 2

Right? Remember that joke?"" (22 Jump Street being one example). Yes, HB2 makes some shout-outs to the first movie. Duh, it's a sequel. But it's nowhere near annoying, in my opinion.The story is funny and *mostly* believable, and to me that's good enough for a comedy. The cast is still just as on the ball as they were in the first, and I even found their chemistry better this time. Those 3 men work wonderfully together, and when you add in Chris Pine it becomes even more hilarious. Plus several other great names.In summary, I found myself breathless with laughter during about 90% of this movie, and to me that makes it absolutely worth the ticket.

I think the reason why I like this movie so much is because of the chemistry of the the three main characters Jason Bateman as Nick Hendricks, Jason Sudeikis as Kurt Buckman and Charlie Day as Dale Arbus. Personally I think those three really made the movie what it is. Also the way they interacted with each other added some comedic effect to this movie. The supporting cast in this movie as did a great job some particularly memorable performances were by Kevin Spacey as Dave Harken and Jamie Foxx as Dean ""MF"" Jones. The biggest complaint about any comedy is that it wasn't funny. While a few scenes of this movie might not have been funny, I feel that the funnier scenes made up for this. Also the plot was interesting enough to make up for some of the unfunny scenes in this movie. I give the filmmakers credit for not making the exact same plot as the first movie. This movie has a different premise as the first and this adds a lot to the movie. For me, this movie's storyline was not very predictable. This added to my enjoyment of this movie.In Conclusion I think that what makes this movie 8 out of 10 for me is a great chemistry between the starring cast. The supporting cast in Kevin Spacey and Jamie Foxx added a lot to the movie. Also not only was this movie funny but it had an interesting story line that was not the same as the first and the plot was not very predictable.

I watch most films from comedy to war, so i am not just being one dimensional. Plus i really liked the first one. I really am blaming the writer of this film rather than the acting, as once again Jason Bateman and Jennifer Aniston seemed as good as usual. From watching the film, with the filth talk from Jennifer Aniston it is obviously set for adults, and the first conversation was about her talking about gay male sex at 14. This i found extremely uncomfortable. But my main problem were Jason Batemans two friends. i can't recall them being so pathetically annoying in the first one. It was basically every time they said something. It was like they only had 1% of their brain working. They reminded me of the character in Home Alone played by Judge Reinhold as the daft robber (sticky fingers). But that was a U certificate aimed for kids, which was great. The part that made me turn it off was when they were all hiding in a house and wandering if the owner had gone, so they could quickly get out. So one of the brain dead friends just shouted his name about ten times. Luckily he wasn't in but Jason Bateman asked why would you do that, he could have been in? He simply said, Oh i never thought that far. I was basically getting embarrassed for the bloke who wrote this and just turned it off. Getting annoyed by his two friends from the minute it started is NOT enjoyment, and definitely NOT funny at all. There were quips just like the above one on a permanent basis that made you think, Oh dear.. Anyway that is my opinion, but i hope you enjoy it no matter what i think.",Horrible Bosses 2

The chemistry between its three leads (Bateman, Sudeikis, Day), the audacity of the bosses, and the hilarious moments, made that film a memorable one. The film stands good on its own. When a sequel was announced, I like most others thought, ""why""? But hey, Hollywood loves to capitalize off of money makers. That's why the Transformers films keep getting re-made. At least this sequel has some positives to it though.Horrible Bosses 2 is an obvious unnecessary follow-up. Luckily, it knows how to have fun in spite of its pointlessness and ups (or degrades) the personalities of its characters. Jason Bateman's straight man- straighter (except for a brief moment at the dentist's office). Jason Sudeikis' horny goofball- still horny with fewer brain cells. Charlie Day's dimwitted back seater- no change. Jennifer Aniston's slutty dentist- sluttier. Kevin Spacey's arrogant asshole- even bigger. Jamie Foxx's Mofo Jones- still a mofo. Newcomers Christoph Waltz and Chris Pine, show that serious actors have a comedic side too - especially Pine.Nothing is new this time around. Substitute triple murder with ""kidnaping"" for ransom, and you have pretty much the same movie as before. Similar to Grown Ups 2, this movie has a near nonexistent story but, has a consistency of funny scenes that makes you forgive its lack of substance. Everyone is having a good time.

I actually liked the way that they talk, its how my friends talk. we don't hold back, that's what having close friends is like. i am in fact not reviewing the film but reviewing a review of the film by some wretch. Now theirs is the only visible review on the site and it portrays the film as a two out of ten calamity, when it isn't. Don't TRUST THE NEY SAYERS THIS MOVIE WAS FUNNY.Now you may think that a sequel is always going to be worse than the original, that difficult second album. There are too many films to name that have tried to make bank with a second movie and have failed. But just recently my own views have changed on that subject. I was pleasantly surprised by 21 jump street, then very surprised by 22 jump street and how it wasn't terrible. The writers clearly knew about the conventions of sequels and played up on them. Plus the quasi-homo erotic tension between Tatum and Jonah Hill was inspired. So is it possible then that with great writers it's possible to overcome these problems?",Horrible Bosses 2

I've never stared at my Husband so much in the dark HOPING he'd look at me so I could beg him to leave.The banter between Sudeikis and Day was irritating, non-stop and actually stressful....not funny by a long shot. It's like someone ran out of dialog to use. Even Aniston wasn't as funny in this one. Of course seeing Kevin Spacey was a plus, but that's about it.

When these kind of incredibly plausible kind of characters come to life in amazing titles such as these, you start to wonder if we've reached human kind's maximum potential.

The beginning/introduction was fine and even sparked my interest for a little while but after that, it became clear to me that two of the main characters were made into total idiots. A little stupidity in a comedy movie is okay but this went way, way too far.All of the film's humour is centered around the two guys making ignorant mistakes, shouting loudly for no reason and not listening to each other. It becomes more and more annoying as the film goes on. I usually enjoy raunchy series and films but when the *entire* plot and all of the jokes are based on sheer idiocy, that is just too much.I guess this is one of those movies that you either love or absolutely hate, and for me it was definitely the latter.",Horrible Bosses 2

If you've seen the first one, don't expect different results. It's like watching Airplane 2:The Sequel - a lot of the same jokes and carried by the acting.Christoph Waltz is, at the very least, entertaining and charismatic in any role I've seen him in this far. I'm also a huge fan of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia and Arrested Development, so already I was interested. There is a certain allure to the bigger-budget movies that deliver what you expect.

218,owenpearce2011,"the first picture did relatively well, so why not make another?Well, actually, there are many good reasons not to. All of which are highlighted across 108 painful minutes.",1,1 January 2015,"Horrible Bosses was alright. Nothing special, but easy to indulge in, harmless fun that did its job effectively. It had a playful, entertaining premise which was executed sufficiently and left the viewer feeling somewhat fulfilled. But do we need a sequel that follows an identical formula, with an abundance of the same, rehashed jokes? Of course we don't. This distinctively superfluous, and evidently lazy production is the product of an industry that just follows the money. The first picture did relatively well, so why not make another? Well, actually, there are many good reasons not to. All of which are highlighted across 108 painful minutes.While Seth Gordon passes directing duties over to Sean Anders, the cast remains mostly the same, as we catch up with Nick (Jason Bateman), Kurt (Jason Sudeikis) and Dale (Charlie Day), who have become entrepreneurs and started their own business. Thinking they've struck gold when Bert Hanson (Christoph Waltz) agrees to sell their product, it turns out their ineptitude and naivety presented the ruthless businessman a chance to screw them over. So, in a bid to seek revenge and save their company from going under, they decide to kidnap his erratic, and conceited son, Rex (Chris Pine).Partly why this sequel doesn't work – is because our three protagonists are all so imbecilic, it goes beyond the point of being endearing. In the first endeavour, their bosses, who consisted of Kevin Spacey and Jennifer Aniston (who both make cameo appearances in this picture, too) were nasty, pantomime villains, and we got the sense our three relatable, regular guys in the middle, were pushed to the limit thanks to a loathsome employer, and many people could resonate with that sentiment, albeit overstated in this instance. However now they're just being ridiculous, and we can't identify with them in the same way we once did. They agreed to a huge, million pound deal without signing anything. If anything they should be kidnapped on grounds of stupidity.It also doesn't help that Kurt is just becoming a sexual deviant who needs help, while the tone for many of this production's jokes is somewhat questionable. There's one sequence where Aniston's Julia Harris fantasises over a rather graphic retelling of a sexual encounter between two teenage boys. It's just wrong – and more importantly, not funny. Offensive jokes can be excused when they actually manage to provoke laughter from the audience. But in this picture, laughter becomes something of a side note. That being said, Bateman's Nick is persistently the most well-crafted creation. He represents 'normality' and yet he's equally as messed up as the other two. It's an effective, tried and tested comedy trope. Be if Father Ted to Dougal, or Oliver Hardy to Stan Laurel – they give off the impression they're in control of a situation, and yet they never are.It's not enough to save this production however, while if one more filmmaker uses that 'effin How You Like Me Now? song over the top of a montage, expect to wake up to the news headline of 'film critic throws himself through cinema screen'. Yet that's not the biggest sin committed by this director, as we're treated to a contrived, unfunny set of outtakes during the closing credits, in a last ditch, desperate attempt to generate some cheap laughter from the crowd. At least we can see how much fun they had making the film, it's just a shame the same can't be said for those of us watching.",Horrible Bosses 2

Are they so simple that they'll like a shallow story and same 'ol jokes for dummies?Horrible Bosses 2 is not dumb, it's dumber. The humor is immature (I guess, that's a standard for nowadays so-called-comedies), plot is flat as an hand-egg field, but the worst part is the yelling and the ""idiocracy"" of the main characters. They yell almost all the time, talking all at once, screaming words and dancing their erratic dance of ""having nothing better to do with themselves cause of that nonexistent quality of the script""*. So they yell, scream and... And they are dumber then Lloyd Christmas and Harry Dunne from ""Dumb and Dumber"". But Lloyd and Dunne are likable - they are just two heavy cases of idiocy, of being dumb - two dumb chumps, funny and sweet in their dumbness, with some characteristics, a soul - one could say. What about Nick, Dale and Kurt? Nothing. They are soulless and mindless, without the spark of life - characters that you'll forget in no time cause they're like thousands more produced by so many.

I was not surprised when they announced the sequel, however, having learnt my lesson, I did not expect much from horrible bosses 2, given that they had managed to keep the cast intact - goes without saying, the script demanded a tight and really compelling story telling to bring in the characters together; and this is where the movie failed me. Sean Anders did however try his best to weave and deliver a nice compelling situational comedy and I respect that. What works for the movie - a nice ensemble, some witty one liners and trash talks galore.

The movie is full of criminal hi-jinks and semi-extemporized foulness, punching without end over and again at some slippery comic sweet spot where barefaced terribleness and deplorable ineptitude impact — and every so often hitting the imprint The movie's main drawback is that the story doesn't seem continuous at any point. The main leads seem to highlight their roles but they lost the shine as all characters don't seem to work in synchronization. Screen player Sean Anders though is quiet comically sensible and make the scene look natural which is a plus for the movie but most of the running time seem to go waste as in predictable situation the scene seem to lost its reliance as comedy movie and seem like more of half-backed story.

236,mmcdski21,"Not Good - ""Horrible Bosses"" Sequel is Lackluster",5,29 November 2014,"This movie was a broken attempt at trying to ease out any storyline that the previous ""Horrible Bosses"" had. The storyline was vague and relied too much on characters established in the prequel to this movie. The first one was better, though not by far.Any humor in this movie was due to characters saying lewd things, and that got old quickly. The best part of the movie was their final plot, in which the three former employees of different jobs plotted to get the money they needed to start a fledgling business. The plan was far-fetched, but how they executed it was mildly entertaining.This movie was suspended entirely by the ticket price of the last ""Horrible Bosses."" The movie provided little incentive to care deeply about the characters, as they were mostly hollow. The last movie had a better storyline.One of the other parts that was mildly funny was when the three main characters stole laughing gas from a dentist's office, and then in a mishap, opened the gas-containing cylinder, and gassed themselves out. But a vague story emerged on what happened to them afterward, hinging on the fact that there was a psycho waiting to frame them for the crime they had (and hadn't) committed.The movie was disappointing overall, though not much was expected from this sequel to an already bad performance. The directors seemed to rely too much on the humor that alluded to the first movie, and did not flush out the storyline well.

238,shafeeq13,stupid and bad,1,24 March 2016,"i've seen both 1 & 2..and this movie is super bad. i wish that i don't watch it. the character make you wanna punch them in their faces because of their stupidity.it is not worth a penny at all.nick is stupid. dale is stupid. Kurt is stupid.they all basically stupid. this movie is super suck. should not be produce at all. they try hard to be funny to the point of bad+suck+super annoying. all i can say don't get your hope to high.I don't normally review films as plenty of people manage to put across a good enough review. I feel so angry about how bad this film is that I really need to warn you about how bad it is. It's not funny and it's boring to add insult to injury. It does have a couple of funny moments in, but for a comedy film, that's nowhere near enough. The acting is bad, the script is bad, the plot is even worse. I don't need to say any more as you'll either watch it anyway or have watched it and are looking for reviews to prove you're not alone in hating this film. This is the second worse film I've seen this year behind Godzilla. I'm even doubting that the first film was as funny as I remember. i will score it 0/10. because it is super bad. it is really irritating.",Horrible Bosses 2
239,buddah99,Amusing but I didn't expect much,4,25 December 2014,When I watched this movie I didn't expect to be on the floor laughing. The first one had it's funny moments but didn't break any comic ground. I liked the chemistry between the three actors and I would have liked a little better material for them to work with but alas that wasn't to be. Jamie Fox was good in it and I would have liked to see more of him. When the material was good I found the scenes funnier than I expected but that was few and far between. That all been said I just think it was my low expectations that made me grab onto any moment of humor. I am just not into low brow humor and would like a little thought in some of the movies these days.,Horrible Bosses 2
240,rsandsiii,I wish i had more thumbs to put DOWN!!,1,7 March 2015,"The title of this movie sums it up 100%, Horrible. I didn't laugh once during the entire film. Which is a huge disappointment as I LOVED the first one and had high hopes when I saw the trailer for HB 2. The characters written for Day, Sudeikis, and Bateman (who are amazing actors) were such babbling idiots that it ruined the little bit of comedy that was actually in the movie and made the whole thing an annoyance that was extremely difficult to sit through. I would not purchase, watch again, or recommend a friend to see this. Very unfortunate to see this quantity, and caliber of actors and actresses in a film of this quality. On a more positive note, I enjoyed the character portrayed by Chris Pine very much.",Horrible Bosses 2
241,lauren-e-nisbet,There are a lot of bad comedy sequels in the world and this is not one of them,7,15 March 2015,"Here's the thing about comedy sequels: you're kind of screwed no matter what. People obviously loved the first instalment because it was popular enough to prompt a second film, but a comedy premise can really only go so far. You run into dangerous territory when you try to recreate the exact same effect with a re-used storyline (I'm looking at you Hangover 2) or if you hit the same humour but lose the fresh hilarity of the original (Anchorman 2). Unfortunately you'll also lose out if you stray too far from the original and leave fans disappointed.I was not expecting to enjoy the original Horrible Bosses as much as I did, and I think the surprise factor was part of what made me such a fan. Going into the sequel with slightly higher expectations may have been my downfall. That being said, Horrible Bosses 2 was a solidly funny movie. I LOL'ed, I cringed, I saw Jennifer Aniston say and do ridiculously over the top sexual things, so overall I'd say I got what I paid for...

243,Dohnuts76,Constantly Talking Friends 2 (spoilers),3,31 March 2015,"A few funny-ish scenarios that could all have been avoided/resolved if the 3 friends just stopped talking all the freakin' time! I get that their ineptness is supposed to be a part of the ""fun"" but literally every scenario is scuppered by one of the friends blathering out of control, especially the little bearded fella who has one of the most annoying voices ever put to film!Oh we're hiding in an office... let's use the toilet and tell each other what a bad idea it is at the top of our lungs! Oh the bad guy is not going to get away clean... let me just shout that at the top of my lungs before he leaves! Etc etcThe first film was a fun enough romp; this one is just really, really annoying to watch.",Horrible Bosses 2
244,britquatrini,Pretty good for a sequel,7,20 August 2018,"Personally I loved both the first movie and this one. Although the storyline is a little predictable it definitely is funny and it's great to see everyone from the first movie in the second movie with the exception of Colin Farrell. (Obviously) I love Jason Sudekis, Charlie Day and Jason Bateman together and I'd definitely watch another movie with these three. Is this sequel Oscar worthy? No, but it is definitely funny and a pretty good sequel.",Horrible Bosses 2
