0,SnoopyStyle,devastating performances,8,12 July 2019,"It's 1960 small town Montana. Jeannette (Carey Mulligan) and Jerry Brinson (Jake Gyllenhaal) seem to be a loving couple with their teenage son Joe. Jerry loses his groundskeeper job at a golf course. Instead of accepting an offer to return to his old job, he surprises his family and takes off to fight wildfires burning nearby. The couple fights. Jeannette goes out with the older successful Warren Miller who owns a car dealership.Paul Dano is trying his hand in directing and adapting this novel with his partner Zoe Kazan. It's a slow and quiet start. Dano does leave a sense of foreboding with his style and an unnerving Gyllenhaal. With his departure, Mulligan takes over with a devastating performance. I do wish for the boy to do more with the girl. He's the audience substitute as he sits quietly while the firestorm rages all around. This is a movie of quiet explosions. These are two great actors doing some powerful acting.",Wildlife
1,nogodnomasters,The snow will put it out,4,25 January 2019,"In the 1960s the Brinson family moves around and finds themselves in Montana. Jerry (Jake Gyllenhaal) loses his job as his wife Jeanette (Carey Mulligan) and teen son Joe (Ed Oxenbould) take on jobs to help out. Jerry decides he is going to fight fires and temporarily leaves his family. Mom, at age 34, finds passion and security with an older man (Bill Camp). Joe is caught in the middle.In the early 60s, divorce was rare. Growing up in this era, I could count the number of couples I knew who were divorced on one finger. People worked through their problems and infidelities. Jake Gyllenhaal tends to take roles that are odd or boring. This one was no different. While I will grant you some good performances (Ed Oxenbould sucked), the plot went nowhere and the drama didn't do it for me.Guide: No F-words.",Wildlife
2,ferguson-6,a product of that era,8,23 October 2018,"Greetings again from the darkness. Actors becoming directors is a Hollywood tradition going back many years, although it seems to be quite the trend these days. Just within the past 3 weeks, there have been feature film directorial debuts from Bradley Cooper, Jonah Hill, and now Paul Dano. You surely know Mr. Dano from his work as the uber-quiet brother from LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE, his dual role in THERE WILL BE BLOOD, and his turn as the early years' Brian Wilson in LOVE & MERCY. He's a talented actor who now flaunts a near-master's grasp of filmmaking.It's Montana in 1960 when we meet the Brinsons, a typical family of dad Jerry (Jake Gyllenhaal), mom Jeanette (Carey Mulligan), and 14 year old son Joe (Ed Oxenbould). Jerry is a gregarious golf course employee, Jeanette is a former substitute teacher - now stay at home mom, and Joe is a mostly normal teenager who only attempts to play football in order to make his dad proud, and needs his mom's help on his math homework. Jerry drinks a few beers each night and Jeanette cooks a nice family dinner. Nothing to see here.This idyllic world is shaken to its core when Jerry gets fired from his job for not respecting the boundaries with club members (not what you're thinking), and his manly pride won't allow him to return to the job when the club reconsiders. Jeanette does what moms do - she takes a job as a swim teacher at the local YMCA to tide them over until Jerry can find a new job. It's at this point when we realize son Joe has extraordinary observation skills for a teenage boy, and he has a front row seat to a disintegrating marriage. Bearing the shame and frustration of a man in this era who can't provide for his family, Jerry abruptly leaves to go fight an out of control forest fire in the mountains. Joe longs for normalcy - the only life he had known to this point.Joe watches in quiet confusion as his mother evolves from doting housewife and caring mother to something and someone he doesn't recognize. She changes how she talks, how she dresses and how she acts. Jeanette is experiencing the contradiction of knowing she needs a man, and not liking that feeling one bit. She latches on to a local car dealer named Warren Miller (Bill Camp). Miller is basically a master-predator seizing on his injured prey through the power of money and promise of stability, and this makes for some uncomfortable situations both for us as viewers and for Joe watching his mom.
This is a family drama that doubles as insight into the changing times - what defines happiness, what role to women play, how involved are kids in household. Based on a book by Richard Ford, the screenplay is co-written by director Dano and his long-time girlfriend Zoe Kazan (RUBY SPARKS, 2012). The story is one part feminist, one part coming-of-age, and one part societal shift. These are fully drawn, complex individuals that walk, talk and react like people tend to.As Jerry, Jake Gyllenhaal is excellent in his limited scenes, and Ed Oxenbould is an intriguing young actor and captures the essence of young Joe - especially that moment when kids realize their parents are individuals, not just devices put on earth to serve kids. This is Joe's story, but it's Mulligan's film. What a terrific performance she delivers, which is not surprising, given her track record. Here she makes us feel everything Jeanette feels, and though this isn't the kind of movie to reach out and grab you, Ms. Mulligan's performance likely will. There is an expressive score, heavy on the woodwinds, from David Lang; and the cinematography from Diego Garcia is also spot on for era - as is the authentic set design. Mr. Dano has delivered an exceptional piece of filmmaking for what will likely be a very limited audience. Those that seek it out will be rewarded.",Wildlife
3,morrison-dylan-fan,Into The Wild.,10,30 November 2018,"Going to do some Christmas shopping in Birmingham,I decided that I would visit the oldest working cinema in the UK (The Electric) and watch whatever title was being screened (at a reasonable time to get a train home!) Aware of the cast but not knowing what the film was about, I picked up a handmade boozy Butterbeer from the bar, ( which was more enjoyable than Fantastic Beasts 2) and got set to observe the wildlife.View on the film:Displaying an impeccable precession not of a debut director, but one worthy of film makers who have spent years behind the camera, co-writer/(with girlfriend Zoe Kazan) director Paul Dano & cinematographer Diego García drive into the big blue sky of 1960's Great Falls, Montana for his first, directing feature,as vast, stilted wide-shots of the sky line the screen, steaming up a rustic, blue-collar atmosphere of the Brinson's trying to find their way out of a downturn.Housing their pressures in, Dano stylishly uses windows to subtly have the foreground be the centre of attention of the screen, via long conversations the Brinson's have about ""absent"" family members, being interrupted by the long look the camera takes out of the window, as the family member arrives home.Adapting Richard Ford's novel, writers Dano and Kazan successfully take an examination on the disintegration of domestic family life and spin it off into coming of age dramas and a road movie. Denting the already brittle state of the Brinson's with Jerry being away at work for days on end, the writers give Joe a thoughtful adult awakening as he finds himself on the road with his mum Jeanette, who goes off the tracks with walks on the wild side which Joe follows.Appearing for a limited amount of time,Jake Gyllenhaal gives a striking performance as Jerry, whose lone focus on work blinds him from what is happening to the family. Putting on a solid fake US accent, Carey Mulligan gives an outstanding turn as Jeanette, as the warmth Jeanette first has sours to pain, and the care Mulligan has Jeanette express for Joe become increasingly on-edge. Trying to hold things together between his parents, Ed Oxenbould superbly captures Joe's loss of innocence, and taken aback state, from finding himself in the middle of a unfolding wildlife.",Wildlife
4,bombersflyup,Nothing here.,2,24 September 2020,"Wildlife has no substance and void of answers.We all know Gyllenhaal and Mulligan can act, but where's the story worth telling and the heart. We are fed this dull tale through the perspective of the kid, in a similar vein to a performance director Dano himself might give and the kid Oxenbould, weak. Jerry let Warren Miller off rather easy and why'd Joe run; cos his dad just came back and will be gone again, but why run? Say something... not ""I went to the police station.""",Wildlife
5,phd_travel,The collapse of a marriage.,7,5 April 2019,The disintegration of a marriage seen by a 14 year old boy is quite involving. Acting is above average. Both parents are at fault in how they handled things. Carey is good at playing the mom who is initially supportive then freaks out and has an affair and leaves. Jake is alright as the stubborn Father who brings his family to rural Montana then leaves to fight fires. Good acting by the boy too who is the most level headed of the three.The faults are a lack of resolution at the end and some unlikely dialog.,Wildlife
6,lasttimeisaw,Cinema Omnivor - Wildlife (2018) 6.9/10,7,7 October 2021,"""While both Mulligan and Gyllenhaal are unexceptionably good, WILDLIFE backs a wrong horse in Oxenbould's Joe. Witnessing firsthand his father's caprice, then his mother's adultery, Joe never acts like his age proper, absorbing his confusion, surprise even agony, like a sponge without giving off too much, it is frustrating for a Bildungsroman. Oxenbould, who looks like a baby Dax Shepard, has a particularly deep adult voice, maybe what Dano sees him is exactly that, he is an ordinary Joe with an old soul, only, WILDLIFE is overburdened with such faux-maturity and world-weary resignation, it has no teenage angst or lability to begin with. Joe might be merely a kid endowed with extraordinary equilibrium, yet the downside is that his blandness cannot engage audience's emotional investment.""read my full review on my blog: Cinema Omnivore, thanks.",Wildlife
7,MOscarbradley,One of the best directorial debuts in American cinema.,10,6 March 2019,"Paul Dano is one of the best actors in the world today though not too many people seem to recognize the fact, or maybe it's just the Academy since Dano has yet to be Oscar-nominated for any of the extraordinary performances he has given. Now he's turned his hand to directing and with ""Wildlife"" he has made one of the best directorial debuts in American cinema. I haven't read the Richard Ford novel that he and his partner Zoe Kazan have adapted for the screen but I honestly believe Dano's film version is as fine as movies can get.Fundamentally, there are really only four characters. Jerry Brinson, (Jake Gyllenhaal), his wife Jeanette, (Carey Mulligan), their 14-year-old son Joe, (Ed Oxenbould), and the middle-aged man, (Bill Camp), the wife meets after Jerry 'deserts' his family to go and fight wildfires, (the setting is a picturesque but lonely looking Montana). The period is 1960, beautifully evoked in the settings, the costumes and even in the language the characters speak, while the film is about a marriage that is neither happy nor unhappy and with characters who are just making do, (the 14-year-old son is the most mature character on screen).It is a deeply sad and pensive film; there are times I was reminded of Bergman but it certainly doesn't feel like a rip-off or even a homage. Dano handles individual scenes magnificently. There is a lengthy sequence where the mother and son are invited for dinner to the home of the man the mother has met that is a master-class in what, I suppose, you could call the cinema of embarrassment. The mother gets drunk and flirts, the man makes a pass at her and the boy is shocked and then it ends almost as suddenly as it began. It is a scene reminiscent of real-life and not of what we are used to seeing at the movies.The whole film is beautifully acted. Perhaps it is Dano's brilliance as an actor that enables him to draw performances of this quality from his players. Gyllenhaal may have the smallest part, (he's absent for much of the film's middle section), but he's perfectly cast. Bill Camp has finally got a part worthy of his talent but it is Mulligan and young Oxenbould who carry the film. Oxenbould is astonishingly good as the boy trying to live a normal life in what is really an abnormal situation and Mulligan has probably never been better than as a woman who married too young and is now regretting it. Near the end, it threatens it dip into melodrama but it doesn't. As in life, things don't go quite the way you anticipate and like life, you just get on with it. ""Wildlife"" is a great film and was totally ignored by the Academy last year; once again I say, shame on them.",Wildlife
8,Pjtaylor-96-138044,A confident and well-made directorial debut that's unfortunately pretty unmemorable.,6,18 November 2018,"'Wildlife (2018)' is well made in every way, with its fantastic performances combining with its restrained but assured direction and solid but somewhat unremarkable script to paint a realistic portrait of a failing family seen through the slightly immature yet more world-weary than he's given credit for young lead. The piece isn't necessarily all that powerful, though, and is, sadly, pretty unmemorable, to boot. It's a bit of a strange case because I was invested in the story, characters and overall world right from the off, always involved in its twists and turns and feeling as though I was participating in its narrative (in the sense that I wasn't spoon-fed everything), but I literally forgot I had even seen the feature not two hours after getting home from the cinema, only remembering after being reminded what it was I'd just watched, which doesn't bode well for its overall lasting impact. It also marks it, perhaps, as an experience more adept at setting up a confident new directorial talent than anything else, one rife with opportunity for its actors to impressively stretch their 'acting muscles' and for its plot to portray a more nuanced view of its core players than we usually see in typical 'Hollywood' fare. Of course, your mileage will vary depending on how much it connects with you, and I'd easily recommended giving it a watch at least once. 6/10.",Wildlife
9,westsideschl,Needed Better Authenticity,4,9 October 2020,"Five stars for portrayal of unemployed dad with stay-at-home wife as family becomes dysfunctional except for the son who stays grounded. Lowered the rating for lack of subtitles for the hard of hearing, ESL viewers and the really poor audio levels & enunciation. Set in 1960 Great Falls, MT the props, settings (buildings, cars, clothing, Great Falls Select bottled beer, grain silos, rr tracks, mountains, rolling grass plains) were so well done I actually thought it was a reissue of a '60 GTF film. But, to have been truly real they would have shown the smelter, Missouri River & dams; Malmstrom AFB, and the H.S. would be blue & white bisons. They did show a few buildings from far away Livingston, MT. Anyway, for some unauthentic reason it was filmed in Oklahoma.",Wildlife

12,zkonedog,"All Of The Pieces Present, But None Of The Depth",4,25 January 2019,"When creating a family drama film, it's one thing to have all the correct pieces to make the emotion work. ""Wildlife"" does that. It's another thing, however, to make all those pieces really mean something the move the emotions of the audience. ""Wildlife"" fails in this key task, rendering it an ultimately poor experience.For a basic plot summary, this film tells the story centers on a family in 1960s Montana. Jerry (Jake Gyllenhaal) struggles to find work around town and volunteers to fight fires instead. While he is away, wife Jeanette (Carey Mulligan) has something of a mid-life crisis of her own, conducting an affair with town car salesman Warren (Bill Camp). Caught in the middle of this is son Joe (Ed Oxenbould), who at 14 is just trying to figure out whether or not he likes football and navigating a female friendship.One major positive I can say about ""Wildlife"" is that it contains some solid acting performances, paramount being that of young Oxenbould. Though his character isn't given much room to emote (a sad fault of the script), he seems to be ""in the middle"" of nearly every key scene. Gyllenhaal is never a letdown, as per the usual, and Mulligan (like Oxenbould) does the best with the material given her.The main problem here, however, is that the viewer never really gets a sense of what the film is supposed to be about. At the outset, it looks to center on Jerry but then he leaves for quite some time. The focus then shifts to Jeanette, whose personality change as soon as her husband leaves is almost too jarring to be believable (or at very least needed some more reasoning behind it). Finally, there are times when the film really seems like it might just be all about Joe, yet none of his life outside his relationship to his parents is given any shrift or importance at all besides nominally establishing his age and adolescence.So, while watching ""Wildlife"", I never really felt like I knew what was trying to be conveyed. This made the emotion it tries to inflict more of a glance blow than an arrow to the heart. The sparseness of the rest of the production (stable camera shots, very little music presence) does not help the cause. I was never outrightly bored while watching, but never even close to ""fully invested"" either.",Wildlife
13,Floated2,Slow family Drama,4,27 May 2019,"Having knowing nothing about this film and barely remember seeing any trailers, but do remember seeing praise for it as being Paul Dano's directorial debut and other praise for the film as a whole. Although Jake Gyllenhaal gets top billed, this really isn't a film where he is the main focus- he is in it but the main focus is the son and the mother.Wildlife isn't too interesting and has a very calm and nuanced tone where not much of note really happens. It's not really a dysfunctional family film to an extent but there are some typical family drama that is the main focus (father leaving home after getting fired, wife cheating on husband, son adapting to these changes) .The lead boy of Joe doesn't show much range and is very much relaxed and calm throughout the entire film, as where Carey Mulligan- playing the mother isn't likable and comes across as selfish. Jake is possibly the highlight but there is a large portion in the middle where his character isn't in the film.Overall, Wildlife is a film best described as it doesn't really have a big high point or climax, and where the pace is relatively the same throughout. It is well shot, with solid acting but for the most part not interesting.",Wildlife
14,eddie_baggins,A collection of fine performances lead the way,6,24 February 2019,"When you've worked with such esteemed directors like Paul Thomas Anderson, Denis Villeneuve, Steve McQueen, Spike Jonze and Ang Lee, it's only natural that you'd learn a thing or two about how to make a decent feature film.Graduating from just a presence in front of the camera, renowned character actor Paul Dano makes the leap to the director's chair with his adaptation of Richard Ford's novel Wildlife, a solemn and sharply observed tale of a marriage between Carey Mulligan's stay at home mother Jeanette Brinson and her out of work husband Jerry (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) breaking down around Ed Oxenbould's teenage boy Joe.It's exactly the type of film you'd expect Dano to be interested in, having in the past shown a keenness to play characters that are humanly drawn and openly flawed, from There Will Be Blood's chameleon like Eli Sunday through to Little Miss Sunshine's Dwayne, and when teaming up with his real-life partner and writing compatriot Zoe Kazan, Wildlife is very much a film concerned mainly with its characters as we follow them around their mundane lives that are slowly but steadily closing in around them.Wildlife isn't the type of film filled with big moments, there's barely any if even one ""big"" showdown like moment and its rather stoic in nature, even if the film is lensed and constructed like a well-polished machine and its likely why Dano's film has found itself a relative no-show at this year's awards circus despite it featuring three noteworthy lead performances.Backed in by a commanding Carey Mulligan performance, one that is equal to her work in An Education and Shame, Wildlife very much showcases Dano's skill with handling his performers.Complementing Mulligan beautifully is another solid turn from young Australian actor Oxenbould (whose created quite the career for himself in Hollywood over these last few years) and another sharply detailed turn from an underused Gyllenhaal, whose quietly heartbreaking as the lost Jerry, a man whose struggling to find his place in the world and come to terms with lost dreams and hopes.Within this solid three pronged ensemble there's enough to keep Wildlife steadily ticking on but there is a sense that despite its solid examination of a relationship breakdown and a coming of age expose, there's not a lot of meat on the bones of this tale and while there's emotion to be mined here thanks to the actors work, Wildlife is a relatively cold and forgettable affair, even if there's nothing particularly wrong with its execution.Had Dano somehow managed to draw more out of this simplistic narrative, Wildlife would've been one of the cream of the crop of 2018 releases and a far more memorable experience overall outside of its noteworthy performances.Final Say -An extremely adept first feature from Dano who has now proven to be more than just a solid actor, Wildlife is a fine showcase for its main cast but a film that never does enough to standout in its own right, making it a watchable but rather forgettable relationship drama that we've seen done countless times before.3 family photos out of 5",Wildlife
15,TheMovieDiorama,Wildlife impeccably presents a delicate family facing marital woes.,8,9 November 2018,"It's important to note that Paul Dano's directorial efforts is his first yet. An actor transforming his knowledge of dramatic performances and pushing it through the camera lens, ensuring that his fellow actors are able to bloom like wild flowers in a sub-urban garden. Witnessed through the perspective of their son, a family are torn apart as they face financial difficulties, resulting in the wife committing adultery. Pure sensational gripping drama that feels nuanced yet powerful simultaneously. A relationship is breaking down, but it's the effect this has on their impressionable son that feels so profound. The need to support his mother, who recklessly becomes selfish, as his father succumbs to pride after losing his job and leaving them behind for another. Stepping up in getting a part-time job, consequently falling behind in education. It's a role reversal. The adults behave like children and the son becomes the man of the house. These actions never once feel forced, the development is presented naturally. Simple, sumptuous and saddening. This is an actor's film. An enclosed environment allowing Gyllenhaal and Mulligan to dramatically entrance us through fierce confrontations and misguided actions. Superb acting I must say, especially from Mulligan. However it's Oxenbould who holds the film together through his fragility and innocence. A sterling performance from this rising star. Dano's directing was outstanding also. From the enhanced ambience of the sub-urban wildlife to the picturesque landscape shots of wild fires. His focus is always on the drama, and he rarely lets you go. I would say the sub-plot involving Joe's school friend was underdeveloped and provided no real development for his character. Further time spent on the family at the beginning when they were more happy would also have helped increase the emotional investment later on, but these are small criticisms. For a directorial debut, Wildlife flourishes in beautiful performances and touching drama. A promising start to Dano's directing career.",Wildlife

17,martimusross,Dreary and Unconvincing Drivel,5,28 March 2019,"This movie was a mixed bags of themes and issues, the question remains as to whether this was realised convincingly on the big screen.To my mind the movie was just too derivative, during the movie we could see Butterfield 8 playing at the picture house, this movie had the theme of a woman forced into prostitution to survive having no money. We also had more than that a touch of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof where a couple take actions to provoke each other and of course the Go-Between, where a young boy negotiated between two lovers.The acting tho crisp was lacking, we entered the issues following a history that was never satisfactorily explained. There seemed no passion between Jeanette (Mulligan) and Jerry (Gyllenhaal) so there really was little to fight over. The son Joe presented a series of vacant expressions being present through most of the drama that conveyed little.Overall this was a dreary predictable drama all observed by a creepy boy, it had nothing redemptive and said little to advance our understanding of the human condition.On a personal note Jake Gyllenhaal has had a series of disasters trying to play a romantic lead, his method style and nuanced palette cannot be dumbed down to a hunk in dungarees.",Wildlife
18,rockman182,Wildlife (2018),8,21 October 2018,"This happened to be one of my most hyped films of the year. I am a big fan of Carey Mulligan and Zoe Kazan so I knew I had to check this out as soon as earthly possible. Had the pleasure of attending a screening of this film at the IFC Center with directer Paul Dano and co-wwriter Zoe Kazan present for a Q & A. The film is beautiful to look at with rich cinematography, has a number of strong performances with a fantastic one from Carey Mulligan, and shows that Dano and Kazan have the talent to get behind the camera and bring a quality piece of work.The film shows a family in 1960's Montana and how life changing events cause their family to fall apart. After the father is fired, he decides to take a job putting out wildfires which causes him to leave the home for an extended period of time. During this time his wife struggles trying to hold her family together by doing whats best for them but she also questions if she even loves her husband. All this while, their teenage son has to watch his parents drift apart silently. The film stars Carey Mulligan, Jake Gyllenhaal, Ed Oxenbould, and Bill Camp.As mentioned earlier the cinematography and especially the scenery in this film are gorgeous. Lush, rich and a perfect description for a simpler quieter time in 60's Montana. The film gets quite uncomfortable as you start wondering about the state of mind Jeanette Brinson (Mulligan) and what she gets herself into. You are basically like the teenage son Joe (Oxenbould). You see things from his lenses, feel exactly what he is feeling, and can't look away much like him. Its a startling tale but one that depicts a perfect looking family where it is anything but.Carey Mulligan is one of the best actresses out there today, that's not even a debate. She's had so many great performances that I don't even know which is her best. This is definitely up there though. It's such an introspective look into the lives of a family where things are just beyond repair. I'm very impressed by Dano and Kazan. Both are talented on the camera but wow they were able to engineer something so wonderful behind the camera. I'm definitely intrigued to see if the duo decide to continue with film-making an writing.8/10",Wildlife

Streaming for rent on Prime
My Rating 7/10
I really enjoyed this film and the performances in it , especially young Australian actor Ed Oxenbold who was only about 16 when Wildlife was being made. Ed's performance is superb as Joe Brinson teenage boy who must deal with his mother's complicated response after his father temporarily abandons them to take a menial and dangerous job fighting a forest fire in Montana.Joe's Dad Jerry Brinson is also well played well by Jake Gyllenhaal a man who is sacked but reinstated from his job as a groundsman at a golf club . He refuses to return on principle and puts his family's security at risk.It's no secret I'm hoping Carey Mulligan wins the Best Actress Oscar this year.I was interested to hear her say in a long television interview yesterday how she is in the enviable position to be able to carefully chose her roles .She prefers playing complex and challenging types of women rather than average or predictable women that's how I found out about this very good film .Carey Mulligan's character in Wildlife as mother and wife Jeanette Brinson fits her criteria of complex and challenging women in similar ways to Cassandra in Promising Young Woman , Maude Watts in Suffragette, Sissy in Shame , Daisy Buchanan in The Great Gatsby and even in her most recent role as Edith Pretty in The Dig.Jeanette Brinson's reaction and behaviour when her husband leaves is surprising but a woman left alone with a teenage son in a backwater town in Montana with no work has only a few options to consider.Jeanette resents Jerry leaving and she is sure he will either burn in the fires he's fighting or find another women while he's away.The film was acclaimed by critics, with many praising Mulligan and Gyllenhaal's performances. In December 2018, the film received award for ""Best Film"" at the 36th Torino Film Festival. The film is dedicated to the late composer Jóhann Jóhannsson.Principal photography took place in Montana and Enid Oklahoma (due to concerns with the winter weather in Montana).The Director and Screenplay writer Paul Dano based the script on the novel of the same name by Richard Ford first published in 1990.Jake Gyllenhaal and Carey Mulligan previously co-starred in Brothers (2009) and obviously work well together.I enjoyed the movie I hope you do also .",Wildlife

21,Alexander_Blanchett,Carey Mulligan at her best,8,3 January 2019,"A moving family drama with strong performances and an interesting story filled with very well crafted characters.
The story is simple and offers a lot of room for a moving character / relationship drama. Paul Dano really concentrates on that rathe than an actual plot which makes it very intimate. Also Dano proves a great hand behind the camera with many interesting visions he brought into this film. The actors were chosen wisely. Carey Mulligan gives one of her finest performances to date. She really delivers something special and showed us a side of her that we haven't seen before. A strong and demanding performance. Jake Gyllenhaal is also great, especially in the last third of the film. He also got the chance to present a kind of character that he hasn't portrayed before. Ed Oxbound is a fine new comer and brought the ideal emotional balance to it all. The cinematography was very good as was the score. it was wisely decided to show the film through the eyes of the kid which made it even more compact. The film had some lengths in the midsection and I am not a fan of its ambitious ending but it was a memorable actor's cinema and a great way for Paul Dano to start his directing career.",Wildlife
22,andrewroy-04316,A solid emotional family drama with excellent performances and direction,7,16 September 2020,"Wildlife isn't telling a story we have never seen before, but it's done with craft that is easy to appreciate. This starts with Dano, debuting behind the camera, who is fantastic in giving the shots space to breathe, using consistency of perspective to make the dialogue personal and emotional, and setting the atmosphere effectively. Dano also gets excellent performances out of the entire cast. Gyllenhaal is great as always, as he adds nuance and layers to every character he plays. Mulligan is really great here and it's such an impressive performance because I found the writing for her character to be very weak. The change in her behavior is so sudden but the things she says to Joe and Miller are so odd and inconsistent. She manages to convey it in a plausible way - she feels conflicted, at once freed but also guilty, and feels like she has to do this but that she's a terrible person for it. Her dialogue is just so black and white, she doesn't care and will do what she wants, and then she is a mess and doesn't have a plan, that it was difficult to empathize with her. That Mulligan managed to make her character work in the movie is a testament to how great her performance was, because it's a truly difficult one. But despite that praise and the fact that my favorite actor has another great turn here, it's Oxenbould that steals the show here. His progression in how satisfied and comfortable with his parents he is early in the film to seeing how perplexed he is with his parent's actions and how deeply the family's separation affects him is perfectly conveyed. The film works because Oxenbould makes us emotionally invested in his journey despite the craziness his parents put him through, and the final shot of the movie accentuates this point. I thought this was going to be a movie about masculinity early on, and I thought it would center on Gyllenhaal, who is clearly proud and has a clear idea of who a man is (having a serious job, not like bagging groceries, and plays football in high school). The themes ended up being more straightforward family-based ones that are fine, but I think Dano could've pushed the envelope a bit more. It's a well made, solid family drama that is elevated by Dano's direction and the three lead performances. I hope Dano gets behind the camera again soon, and boy I can't wait to see his Riddler next year.",Wildlife

24,gsygsy,Beautifully observed,8,24 November 2018,"An auspicious directing debut by Paul Dano, who with his wife Zoe Kazan co-scripted this adaptation of a Richard Ford novel. The result is a steadily-paced, beautifully observed tale of family dysfunction. Many shots by DOP Diego Garcia seem to emphasize how small the human characters are in the context of America's vastness, how relentless their struggle is both with the world outside and inside themselves. Such shots are balanced by intimate, soul-searching close-ups, that paradoxically register our mutual unknowability.The acting is jaw-droppingly good all round, but special mention has to go to Carey Mulligan: she is a revelation.

26,dansview,Point of View Picture,7,20 September 2020,"In a character study piece, the acting is vital. Facial reactions really matter, because not much else is happening. This one was done from the boy's point of view. Fortunately the actor excelled at reaction shots. His bashful and bewildered look fit scenes beautifully.Meanwhile I'm always drawn to Jake's mannerisms, because of their intensity and authenticity. This came out best when he was in a truck bed, on the way to a perilous new job.Something sounded strange about the way the female lead spoke. Turns out she is British. So I guess she was faking an American accent. (It's ok. I don't think most people would even have noticed anything.) Otherwise, this actress did a splendid job of portraying a deeply frustrated and desperate individual.The story is straightforward. Both parents have deep character flaws. He's flighty with regard to employment. This leads to instability. The worst thing for a 14 year old to be around. The mom had been a restless teen in search of an alpha male. Perhaps Jake's character had been one. But now he was unreliable and lost. This realization sets off her impulsive cravings. It's a bad combination.I liked how the whole family's arc revolved around employment. Because that's true to life. A job often brings growth, stability, and self-esteem. One character seeks a purpose in a dangerous new job, the other makes connections via work, and another finds an opportunity for growth in a first job.The cinematography was excellent. One scene shows mountains on fire. Real or not, it looked imposing. Others showed Montana skies and mountain outlines with vivid color.It didn't try to be anything bigger than it needed to be. I respect that. Just an honest portrayal of a poor family lacking the glue that helps get one through a crisis.",Wildlife

A tale of a crumbling family it's handled masterfully, allowing for everything to slowly unfold over time with exceptional performances from all involved, particularly Gyllenhaal (as you might expect from him at this point) who's also off screen for a good chunk of the film. Largely the perspective of the child in the middle its one that many a viewer could easily relate to and was for all the emotions well worth a watch",Wildlife
28,kaptenvideo-89875,"Liked it! If your Oscars-season didn't start with ""Bohemian Rhapsody"", this could start it.",8,7 December 2018,"Ho ho, the cold-weathered Oscar season is getting into gear, and Sundance graduate ""Wildlife"" is a nice little gem to satiate your drama needs, or at least offer a quality alternative to the big-budgeted entertainment epics usually ruling the christmas time.It's about a teenage boy (Ed Oxenbould) watching his beloved father (Jake Gyllenhaal) and mother (Carey Mulligan) drifting apart.If you have seen the trailer, then you might think you more or less know what it's about - but the whole thing is a somewhat different beast altogether. More multilayered and deep, to be exact.Above all, it's not a mainstream project but suitable for more intelligent and dedicated movie fans in search of something ""serious"".Not only is it a tight and gripping family drama and a true actors' movie chock-full of memorable performances -, it's also a splendid achievement by an admired indie actor Paul Dano debuting as director and screenwriter (shared with two others, including partner/colleague Zoe Kazan).And it's not even an easy project to start with. ""Wildlife"" concentrates on the emotional state of its characters, not so much on events.This means there can be no simple ways to stand out, such as big emotional moments and shouting matches that could be added to any family drama.Dano is much more interested in the slow-burning tension between the people, the quiet scorn and accumulating rage that can sprout from enduring the several types of stress the characters come to contact with (social, interpersonal, unability to work through the issues on spiritual level).There's lot to like about his double job behind the camera. Everything in ""Wildlife"" is so sharply and elegantly measured and put together that best original screenplay or director Oscars shouldn't be out of the question.Refreshingly, everything shown is to the point - no extra fat, nothing unimportant to fill the time. Even seemingly trivial details effectively serve the story or its main themes of isolation, anger, and wordless pinching discomfort of being in a bad place emotionally.I also loved how the makers have subtly brought out the many little ways of how parents may use the children as allies, targets, and weapons in a quest to hurt each other.The emotional stress can make us regress to an earlier, less mature states of psychological being, and this we can see in the parents who oftentimes remind more teenagers than adults. This makes ""Wildlife"" an uncommonly multifaceted achievement even in the long bitter history of family dramas.And although it's never the focus, the movie even works as a period piece of sorts, recreating the struggling working-class life in 1980-90's USA. The general look seems authentic and believably worn-in.The extraordinary lead trio - Mulligan, Oxenbould, Gyllenhaal - are a great help illuminating the different shades of familial discomfort and all that.Dano has carefully made ensured that they would not compete for screen time, so everybody gets enough to stand out in their own day (that goes for the most important supporting character too).This makes it rather difficult to say which actor deserves the most kudos but I'd very much like to see Mulligan nominated for best actress, and Oxenbould for best supporting actor Oscars.Mulligan is simply phenomenal as a young woman and mother in search of a new stable ground both mentally and financially.Although her character is mostly angry and thus maybe somewhat uncomfortable to watch, she gives a masterful, nuanceful performance of a woman in a downward spiral - and almost totally commands the movie.All in all, she's given her best acting performance yet, and fully deserves another Oscar nom (after breakout role in 2009's ""An Education"").I am also quite fond of Ed Oxenbould as the teenager between the domestic guerrilla war. Curiously looking like a younger Dax Shepard, he's the one child/teenage actor that really deserves attention and more roles.His naturalness and humble but self-assured acting is yet another good thing about the movie. You should also check him out in little-known 2015's thriller ""The Visit"" which may actually be the finest M. Night Shyamalan movie of this decade.Gyllenhaal is in fine form too but he's more of a supporting player, so let's not make the review even longer, and conclude with the thought that ""Wildlife"" is a sharp piece of filmmaking.It has enough personality, confidence and quiet charm to compensate for somewhat small-scale or trivial story - just like its author Dano.And so what if you don't feel like you probably wouldn't see it twice? How many movies do you really have time and commitment to repeatedly watch anyway?",Wildlife

Some might say that not a lot happened, and what did happen I won't spoil. But what I will say is Wildlife is a compelling study of a relationship bursting at its seams but with the obvious, and sometimes less than obvious, left unsaid. Joe is a 14 year old studious boy in 1960s Montana USA. It soon becomes clear that his parents have very different views on how their and indeed his life should be lived. Jake Gylennhall's character is an idealist; Mulligan's a realist, and the film takes us through their journey through the eyes of their son. Mulligan, Gylennhall and the young lad, who apparently had not acted in a film before are all excellent, and the film slowly affects you in ways you thought it wouldn't. 7 and a half out of ten",Wildlife
30,danybur,"Sober, sensitive and eloquent chronicle of the crisis of a marriage",9,10 January 2021,"Remarkable opera prima of Paul Dano, Wildlife paints the crisis of a marriage from the uncomfortable place (for more than one reason) and the point of view of the couple's teenage son in a Montana town in 1960, in an unpredictable story.
The film demonstrates how with sobriety, few and precise dialogues and eloquence in the images, the dissolution of a marriage can be sensitively depicted, placing it at the opposite end of the strident and overloaded Story of a Marriage. And, of course, with great performances, standing out that of the young Ed Oxenbould and especially that of an incredible Carey Mulligan.
----------------------------
It's 1960. Jeanette and Jerry (Carey Mulligan and Jake Gyllenhaal) and their teenage son Joe (Ed Oxenbould) have recently lived peacefully in a Montana town. The father works at a golf club and the mother, a former teacher, plays the role of housewife. But suddenly, Jerry is fired from his job, precipitating a marriage and family crisis.Thus put, it seems like a conventional and over-traveled story. But this exemplary opera prima by fellow actor Paul Dano is anything but predictable, in the first place, because of the uncomfortable place it assigns to Joe in the development of the story.The fluidity of the narration is perfect and it unfolds with equal reliability in the scenes in closed spaces, with several fixed planes, as in the beautiful outdoor images, with scenarios that always make dramatic sense. The use of ellipsis is also notable.Despite being based on the novel Fires by Richard Ford (narrated in the first person, that of the endearing Joe, from whose point of view the film is also developed) luckily Wildlife avoids the narrator in off, since it is enough to see the Ed Oxenbould's expressive face to understand his feelings.But it is Carey Mulligan, whose Jeanette is the true engine of the story, who gives us an extraordinary performance that beautifully develops the evolution of her character.Paul Dano and his screenwriter Zoe Kazan (also a notable actress that we saw in The Plot Against America) demonstrate how with sobriety, few and precise dialogues and eloquence in the images, the dissolution of a marriage can be depicted, placing itself at the antipodes of the strident and overloaded Story of a Marriage.",Wildlife
31,bastos,Well directed but left me wanting more,6,4 February 2021,"I usually like both coming of age movies and marriage implosion movies, but, for me, the secret to those kind of movies is that you have to like the characters so that you root for the relationships to work.

Stylish and twice as boring, I didn't buy Carey Mulligan and Jake Gyllenhaal as a married couple, much less, as parents.

It's never explained why the family moved to Montana or how they can afford to rent a house on Dad's meager $40 a week salary as a glorified gofer at the country club. Dad deciding that he needs to abandon his family to play Firefighter comes out of absolutely nowhere. Likewise, Mom pulling Junior out of school for the day to drive up to the fire WITHOUT tracking Dad down made even-less sense. Instead of setting an example for her boy on how to be strong, independent, and self-reliant, the now-""liberated"" Mom throws herself at the slovenly Town Big Shot, and recruits Junior to help her reel him in in a scene which borders on incestuous! You've Come a Long Way, Baby!Actor Paul Dano (in his directorial debut) does us no favors by chucking key points in the novel (Dad was fired because a club member accused him to stealing his wallet, which sends Dad into a breakdown). Worse, Junior's budding relationship with a classmate goes nowhere. So, what does Dad do when he learns Mom has been doing the ""cha-cha-cha"" with the slovenly Town Big Shot? He pours gasoline on the porch, and sets it on fire (I'm sure the Landlord really ""appreciated"" THAT)!

34,Bertaut,Old-fashioned filmmaking with a progressive theme,7,16 November 2018,"The directorial debut of actor Paul Dano, Wildlife is based on the 1990 novel by Richard Ford, and is written for the screen by Dano and his girlfriend Zoe Kazan. Looking at the implosion of a family from the perspective of a 14-year-old member of said family, the film is thematically similar to Revolutionary Road (2008) and Blue Valentine (2010), and aesthetically similar to the Texas scenes in The Tree of Life (2011) (the period detail drips off the screen, whilst the use of a child as the focaliser colours much of what's depicted). And although Wildlife is a piece of remarkably nostalgic filmmaking, at the same time, it tells somewhat of a progressive story, demonstrating the uncertainty with which second-wave feminism manifested itself at a grassroots level prior to really taking off in 1963. Although it's essentially a character study, the film also suggests the 1950s-style clean-cut, neatly trimmed, rigidly defined way of life, built around the perfect nuclear family wherein a wife must be subservient to her husband, is about to become a thing of the past.Set in Great Falls, Montana in 1960, the film tells the story of the peripatetic Brinson family; father Jerry (Jake Gyllenhaal), mother Jeannette (Carey Mulligan), and 14-year-old son Joe (Ed Oxenbould). When Jerry loses his job and takes off in a misguided attempt to reaffirm his masculinity by fighting a forest fire, something is awoken in Jeanette, who, for the first time, allows herself to admit she has become deeply unhappy, and overnight, her behaviour changes dramatically, as she rebels against her domesticity. Determined to forge a new identity, she is adamant she won't become one of the ""standing dead"" (the term used for trees that survive a forest fire).Importantly, the film is set three years prior to Betty Friedan's ground-breaking The Feminine Mystique (1963), which redefined the parameters of all gender-based topics, depicting a society in which women were no longer content to do their husband's bidding and raise children. Initially, Jeanette is depicted as a quintessential 1950s wife and mother, almost to the point of cliché; she cooks, cleans, washes the clothes, does the dishes, sees that Joe attend to his homework, and when Jerry loses his job, it is Jeanette who goes out looking for work for both of them. She knows that her (unspoken and unacknowledged) role in this patriarchal society is to hold the family together, but it's a role that is nothing like she thought it would be when she was younger. Although she and Jerry seem to love one another, or they certainly used to, she clearly feels trapped by her domestic situation.That her transformation happens so quickly is the key point; when she goes to bed, she's a wife and mother, trapped in her domestic environment, but when she wakes the next morning, she realises that she has an opportunity to escape, perhaps the best opportunity she will ever get. This has been building up for years, but she has gotten so used to feeling lost that when she gets a chance to change things, she doesn't even recognise it as such, at least not at first. Once she does, however, Jeanette makes a conscious decision to stop performing the role delegated by men. As much of the female population of the western hemisphere would be asking over the next ten or so years, Jeanette wants to know, ""is this all there is?"" She wants more than simply getting through the day. In this sense, she recalls Nora Helmer from Henrik Ibsen's A Doll's House (1879), or any number of Tennessee Williams heroines - a woman who wakes up to find she has become deeply unhappy despite attaining everything she once wanted, and who sets out to do whatever it takes to alter her course.That all is not well in the Brinson household is hinted at in the opening scene, where Jerry and Jeanette have a couple of inconsequential but noticeable disagreements over dinner (such as whether Joe should continue pursuing football). This scene establishes an assuredness and subtlety-of-hand that lasts for the entire film, with Dano's directorial work proving unexpectedly sophisticated. For example, something he does several times is have characters walk off-screen to speak, whilst keeping the camera trained on Joe as he tries to listen, with the dialogue barely perceptible from just off the edge of the frame. As well as being an excellent use of off-screen space, something you don't see too often, this technique ties us rigidly to Joe's POV early on, inculcating us into his worldview. Another very nice piece of direction is an early montage cutting between Jeanette riding her bike, Jerry driving the car, and Joe riding the bus, in which each character is facing a different direction, each in isolation from the other two. It's basic cinematic shorthand, showing instead of telling, but it's very well done. Equally impressive is the penultimate scene, where Dano uses the windows of the Brinson house to block the characters in such a way as to suggest both their inner emotions, and the prevailing theme at this point of the film. For the most part, however, Dano's direction is invisible, relying far more on static painterly compositions than camera movement.The acting, as you would expect, is universally superb. On paper, Jeanette and Warren Miller (a superb Bill Camp), an older man who becomes romantically interested in her, are very much the villains of the piece, but Mulligan and Camp's performances are so full of warmth and genuine emotion that you simply can't look at them as antagonists, and the film itself never judges them. Mulligan plays Jeanette as utterly weary, much older than her years, at times fragile, at times rock solid, both vulnerable and manipulative. Full of anger, she simply can't hold in her emotions any more. Unfortunately, in letting them out, she betrays Joe by forgetting he is only 14-years-old. When she starts drunkenly dancing with him at Miller's house, the scene is deeply uncomfortable, but Mulligan's performance is such that we don't condemn her, at least, not completely. She never allows the audience to lose sight of the fact that although she is behaving rather poorly, she is a prisoner, and is reacting against her restraints as best she can.Of course, there are a few problems. Essentially a tale of marital angst, the narrative is not especially original - we've seen this story before, many times in fact, and for all the craft on display, Dano never really manages to say anything wholly new. Additionally, his measured direction is also too good in places - everything is so ordered, neat, and trim, that at times, the milieu doesn't seem lived-in, but more an abstract concept of what the period was like. Additionally, there are a few lines that sound great on paper, but which are just not the kind of things one says in real life. For example, Jeanette tells Joe, ""I feel like I need to wake up, but I don't know what from, or what to"". Later she says, ""I wish I was dead. If you have a better plan for me, tell me. Maybe it'll be better than this"". This kind of dialogue seems more interested in hitting thematic waypoints than developing character beats. Similarly, late in the film, Jerry says to Joe, ""It's a wild life. Isn't it, son?"" Proclaiming the film's title in this context doesn't even remotely work, and the line feels totally out of place, to the point of ripping you out of the narrative.On the one hand, Wildlife is about how society was changing in 1960, and on the other, about how that change manifests itself within the Brinson family. Yes, it's another ""death of the American dream"" story in a long line of such films, but here, the focus is, for the most part, on character rather than theme, with Jeanette functioning in kind of a synecdochical manner; our specific entry point, she is the individual that facilitates an examination of the masses. And yes, Dano may take his eye off the ball a couple of times, with the odd bit of clunky dialogue, and a somewhat too picture-postcard perfection, but all in all, this is an excellent directorial debut.",Wildlife
35,mr_bickle_the_pickle,A good start for Paul Dano's directorial debut,7,11 September 2018,"This movie is being described as ""A boy witnesses his parents' marriage falling apart after his mother finds another man."" And while I think thats true, I think its a bit more complex than that. It also is a bit of a coming of age story where Joe has to grow up and be the adult in this family, but also it seems that mom is having a mid-life crisis (although shes not quite mid-life) and trying to discover who she is outside of being the ""perfect 50s housewife"" that perhaps she feels trapped in. There's a lot of symbolism in this movie. The backdrop of this movie is that there is a wildfire that has been raging and the townspeople have been desperately trying to put out. And that correlates with Joe and his own family. Hes trying to put out the fire in his own family. Also, Joe works at photography studio and Paul Dano (the director and co-writer) even said that this is supposed to be a PORTRAIT of a family life. Speaking of Paul Dano, I think he did well with his directorial debut. I think visually there are some gorgeous shots in this movie. Like for instance where Joe is watching the wildfires (and hes perfectly centered - probably again to mimic the portrait vibe). Also where Joe is about to give up but it starts to snow and hope has regained. I liked the film for the most part. They do frame the film by following Joe's perspective. And I think its mostly effective in making you feel for this kid, my only problem is there are a couple of parts where I feel like there are gaps in the story. Without giving too much away there is a scene where Jerry (Jake Gyllenhaal) has decided to seek revenge and it ends up backfiring. And yet, the next time we see him everything seems to be fine. And it never really gets explained what happened. Theres a brief line that they decided it was a ""misunderstanding"" but you never really see what happened and he also gets hurt during this, and that never gets brought up again either. I know Paul and Zoe (the other writer) were adapting this from a book and perhaps thats the way it is in there too. But I personally found that a little frustrating. I needed a little more. Carey Mulligan is fantastic in this. She would be deserving to have her name thrown in the hat for awards season. I also thought Ed Oxenbould was a standout too. Which is good to hear since he's onscreen for pretty much most of the movie. I definitely will be looking forward to more of his things. I also thought Jake Gyllenhaal was good but hes absent for a good chunk of the film and so he just didnt stand out as much as Carey or Ed did.Overall I liked the film. It wasn't perfect, but I would totally check out another film that Paul Dano directs.",Wildlife

38,PotassiumMan,Haunting portrait of family turmoil told through the eyes of a teenage son,9,10 November 2018,"Paul Dano's directorial debut is a powerful achievement, one that lingers on. It's the portrayal of a teenage boy in 1950's Montana whose parents' marriage begins to crumble amid financial hardship and his mother's subsequent restlessness. It's an adaptation of Richard Ford's novel.Ed Oxenbould is the teenage boy from whose vantage point the story is told. Carrie Mulligan portrays a mother who has no qualms about showing her true colors, as she meets an older, prosperous man. Jake Gyllenhaal is the hard-working father who has just seen his livelihood upended and finds himself at a crossroads. These three tremendous performances constitute the quiet but powerful life in this film, and keep the audience gripped to the very end. The potent screenplay adaptation is written by Dano and Zoe Kazan.Dano shows the ability of a director who realizes the subtle power of understatement. That part of his craft is visible throughout the film and he clearly has an eye for conveying raw emotion without the use of any dialogue. The jarring spectacle of a family slowly disintegrating is seen through Oxenbould's innocent, anguished eyes. This is one of the best directorial debuts I've ever seen.A quiet but powerful drama, this is a superior piece of cinema with incredible work all around. Highly recommended.",Wildlife
39,Moviegoer19,Slice of Life,9,12 January 2019,"I very much enjoyed watching Wildlife. Whether it was a Directorial Debut or a director's tenth film, I found it to be superb, which I suppose speaks of the talent of Paul Dano. (Did anyone else feel there is some resemblance between the actor who played Joe and Paul? Just an aside...) The film, as other reviewers have mentioned, has a restraint to it which works well and stops it from descending into overdone pathos. In its strong quiet way it brought up emotions in me which made it a compelling film to watch. I was very involved with the experience of each character. They each were realistic with very realistic concerns. I would say that perhaps the overriding emotion I felt was anger at the parents because they each gave in to their selfish needs and wants, while leaving their 14 year old son to be the mature one. What does ""mature"" mean here? It means doing what's right, as in the Buddhist ""right action."" Jeanette, the mother, did things that made her feel good; she gave in to her own egotistic wounds and tried to fix them, at her son's expense. Likewise, Jerry, the father, did too. He drank, he gave up a job out of pride, and he ultimately pursued an adventure, also rather than do what would have been more responsible, and also, more dull. Joe, the son, was the one who was focused on the three of them as a family, as captured in the final shot of the film, symbolic as it was. One could say the theme of Wildlife was Family vs. the Individual, i.e., how much can adults sacrifice of their own desires and ambitions in the name of the family unit and/or the children? By extension, it can also be asked how is it possible, assuming it is, to satisfy both. Ironically, the teenage Joe enabled his parents to respectively pursue their own desires while he maintained the family unit. I'd wholeheartedly recommend this multi-faceted film to anyone who prefers depth to flash.",Wildlife
40,babyjaguar,DANO'S WILDLIFE: A TURBULENT VIEW OF ADOLESCENCE,8,7 November 2018,"As his first directorial debut, Dano presents a beautifully woven tale of small town marriage through the eyes of 14 year old boy. The story based on a 1990 book by Richard Ford, scripted by Zoe Kazan; Dano's direction is on a great start on the telling of 1960s family going through a transformative change.Its centers on the Brinson family: mother, ""Jeanette"" helmed by Carey Mulligan, father, ""Jerry"" helmed by Jake Gyllenhaal and the son, ""Joe"" moving into a new town. This is a wonderful depiction of small town life, exploring the economic class divide, as ""Joe""'s father trying to hold to jobs while observing the frustration of his mother maintaining the ""nuclear"" household.Dano's focuses on the loneliness of ""Joe"", he has only one friend and quits the football to take a part-time job after his family's economic situation worsens. As his mother plunges deeper into depression and drinking indulgence, ""Joe""'s job as a photographer assistant allows him an insight to other families lives in the town (via portraiture). I feel the strength of this film is held together by the acting talents of Ed Oxenbould is truly ""Joe Brinson"".This is only flaw in this film that Dano's newly founded talents did not delve into the one of charming aspects of ""Joe"": his tendency to observe everyone from his parents as to random strangers. This aspect obviously reflected through ""Joe""'s artistic but emotional outlet for his sadness, portraiture. But in all, Dano's first entry is promising. This film illuminates a steady pathway for Dano to tell humane stories amidst beautifully-photographed ""Americana"" cultural landscapes.",Wildlife
41,Genti23,Simple on the surface,4,7 January 2019,"Wildlife tells quite a simple story, in a bit of an unnecessary manner. The acting is all good, but Paul Dano, the first-time director, takes a very conventional approach to the subject at hand. There is very little to separate this movie from a hundred others that deal with such themes, and quite frankly, I would rather watch many other films than this when it comes to such dramas.
It's not bad by any means, but it is a bit boring, and just overall in my opinion falls flat on what it is trying to convey to the audience. There is barely anything to get out of this movie, except for some good performances, and some decent cinematography.",Wildlife
42,Camoo,Excellent first,8,9 March 2019,"Paul Dano is the real deal, it seems. He delivered a film here which is very well made, and told with merciful simplicity. I appreciated his invisible hand: confidence as a director means you let a good film speak for itself, and don't inject yourself all over the place. There is confidence here in droves, from the delicate writing, empathetic acting and lush cinematography. Nice job.Wildlife is basically about a fragile, repressed family and the challenge of reconciling a responsibility to your loved ones with a desire to be free in a world that expects so much of you. The title says it all, really, and the films strength is that it taps into what so many of us struggle with when we go to work, loop into a routine, and find ourselves wishing we were elsewhere, anywhere, but here.It's not quite a perfect film, and there are moments when it feels closer to a novel in terms of excessive, self-involved dialog, when for me it's best moments cut the chatter and lets the silence, subtle eye contact and just-under-the-surface emotion do the talking.",Wildlife
43,jacksisjax,It's a wild life isn't it,9,21 July 2020,"I do believe this movie would be a fantastic prequel to marriage story. It is in that same caliber of movie. Very real, very human and also rather hard to watch. Because of how tragically real it is.All the performances are SPOTT on. Carey Mulligan crushes it as we see her character go mad. Jake Gylenhall gives one of his best performances as just a regular selfish father, who goes a little nuts. And Ed Oxenbould is also very good, he plays the role of a spineless confused young boy well, havent seen him in anything else but he was really rather interesting to watch.This movie is very well done, VERY well done. It is stunning. The movie is shot in a way that makes everything rather beautiful. Killer cinematography. It's filmed in a way that makes the audience feel like it's peering in through a window into this melting families life. This is what makes the movie so realistic and personable.The movie is also riddled with symbolism. Using a wildfire to describe the decay of the family, and placing each member in a role of a wild fire. There are some very interesting things in the movie that you could sit and dissect.I don't have too much bad to say about this movie. It's very good. It's enthralling to look at and scoff as you see characters make fatal human flaws, that many make in reality. Fantastic show. Marriage story caliber. But not quite as good as marriage story.
And to find out that this was Paul Dano's first run of directing. What the blazes.",Wildlife
44,svhot,"Authentic, Realistic, Restrained but Rebellious - ""Wildlife"" is a new masterpiece",8,11 January 2019,"""Wildlife"" is a brave, bold movie that dares to show viewers a number of themes and life lessons. It all depends on how you interpret it, and which options you are willing to accept, and which ones you do not want to accept at any cost. An early montage scene shows viewers the 3 main characters travelling in 3 different modes of transport - Jerry (Jake Gyllenhall ) is driving a car, Jeanette (Carey Mulligan) is riding a bike, and Joe (their teenage son in this movie) is travelling on a bus. This is a very symbolic scene because it signals and provides clues to the viewers that these 3 people are heading in different, independent directions in their life. In other words, the movie is confirming the fact that ""everyone's journey is different, each one of us has a different mission to fulfil in our life"".The performances of the 3 main / central actors in ""Wildlife"" is simply excellent. Jake Gylenhall , Carry Mulligan, and the teenage boy simply shine in their respective roles. The director, Paul Dano , is a very intelligent director ; he has done brilliant work on this movie - whether it is attention to detail in presenting a 1960's type of America on-screen, churning out restrained but genuinely great performances from actors, or using various symbolic devices to convey the themes and lessons he wants his viewers to understand. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes to watch movies that show us the realistic problems that we face in our everyday life - unemployment, family disputes, materialism, individual rights, and how each person deals with it in their own unique ways.",Wildlife
45,cappiethadog,New slang,10,10 September 2020,"Joe Brinson(Ed Oxenbould) grew up in small town of your dreams, where everybody knew your name and nothing bad ever happened. ""Wildlife"", the directorial debut by Paul Dano, adapted from the Richard Ford novel, tries to puncture a hole in this mythology. Just like David Lynch's ""Blue Velvet"", sans surrealism and the trappings of genre, ""Wildlife"" asks you to take a second look at that perfect lawn. ""Wildlife"" challenges the notion that people were happier when men and women knew their place in the world. The husband was the breadwinner, the sole provider who made it possible for the wife to stay home with the children. There was meat loaf on the table. There was a baseball game on the radio. Jeanette Brinson(Carey Mulligan), Joe's mother, plays the part of suburban housewife until she doesn't have to anymore. A former substitute teacher, the homemaker discovers a more interesting role, the mistress of a local scion, when Jerry Brinson(Jake Gyllenhaal) loses his job as a golf pro and catches a malevolent strain of wanderlust. He volunteers to help put out the wildfires that threaten to encroach on the small-town. Less than a hero, being a firefighter gives Jerry an excuse to abandon his wife and son.There were signs. Fissures in the family dynamic. Prior to Jerry making this sudden unilateral decision to abdicate his familial role, leaving Jeanette and Joe in a lurch, you could see how their matrimonial bliss was largely performative. At the end of the bravura opening sequence in ""Blue Velvet"", the camera penetrates the green surface, and reveals the darkness of the undergrowth, where insects fight other insects. The laws of nature, institutionalized, but bypassing notice. Both husband and wife are dying to be somebody different. Alas, the child, there is the child to consider, so they go through the motions. Predetermined by the social mores of rural life in 1960, a place and time still undergoing a fifties hangover, Jeanette gives it the old college try, crouching over her son as she proofreads his homework amiably, while Jerry sits nearby in his lounge chair, listening to a ballgame on the radio, beer in hand. There can be nothing more than this, right. The assignation of strict gender roles dictated that the wife cooks and cleans, and does the lion's share of the child-rearing, while the father comes home after a long day at work. Jerry eats the meat loaf. Jerry opens the cap of his bottled beer. Jerry watches, self-satisfied with the arrangement. Dano's camera catches the insects getting ready to fight. The woman, who never aspires to be nothing more than a wife and mother, as suggested by the iconography from this era in television and film, never examined this ritualized dance of domestic self-effacement up-close. But Jeanette has, in private. When Joe adds the comma Jeanette suggests, she takes her leave, but not without picking up her own alcoholic beverage. This woman thinks. This woman drinks. She's not June Cleaver. She's not an ethereal version of the Beaver's mother that Jessica Chastain plays in Terrence Malick's ""The Tree of Life"". The nameless woman never yearns for a world of her own making. Jeanette, however, with the departure of her husband, realizes she can stop being a wife, and by choice, a mother, leaving Joe to fend for himself. During the interim, when Jerry had refused to accept his old job back at the country club, his wife rejoined the workforce, giving swimming lessons at the Y. Breathless with excitement about her first day, the mother delivers this odd discomfiting, almost Lynchian-like monologue:""Maybe we're all about to get washed away in a big flood. Some of us will get washed away in a big flood. Some of us will float to the top.""What in the world is she talking about? The state they live in may not have the ocean, but there are freshwater ponds and lakes, not to mention the chlorinated water in pools. Learning to swim as a preventive measure against accidental death was a skill many children acquired at their parents' behest. Remember the time and place. ""Wildlife"" remembers. ""Wildlife"" is coded. It's up to the viewer to break the code. When Jerry could still call himself an upstanding citizen of the community, gainfully employed, the fire was somebody else's problem. ""Do you see any smoke?"" Jerry asks his son rhetorically as he waters down the putting surface. The potentiality of fire in their community is minimal at best, according to Jerry. He assures his son that whatever he heard is nothing more than scare tactics. Father knows best. The fire is miles away, as far as the eye can see. The park ranger had spoken to Joe's class. Although the fires are ""burning out of control"", he tempers the seeming danger by pointing out that a change to the landscape can be a ""positive force"". Maybe the forest needs regenerating; a wider variety of fauna and flora. But for the time being, Jerry insists: ""They are making people afraid for no reason."" Father only thinks he knows best. One night, at dusk, after having been laid off, Jerry steps outside his craftsman house and looks out toward the horizon; he sees, or thinks he sees, plumes of smoke rising over the mountain range. It's a calling, Jerry explains to his son. He needs to ""quiet the hum in my head"" and help stave off the flames encroaching on their town. On the television, over the radio, Jerry hears phrases like ""campaign war"" and ""impending danger"". Colloquialisms? You decide.A stentorian voice on the television warns: ""Now in 1960, these difficult and dangerous and challenging times, I believe we can get this country moving again.""What exactly is Jerry Brinson signing up for? You decide.Jeanette and her son pass the city limits. Joe takes the day off from school to make a road trip with his mother. They're going to check up on the person who completes this nuclear family. At the fire site, Jeanette cuts the engine, then orders her son out of the car. She asks him: ""Do you like it?"" It's an odd question. Of course, Joe replies: ""No,"" since his father could get burnt to a crisp, identifiable only by dental records. Arguably, it's an existential question. Not to Joe, but to the audience. Why did Joe turn around to see the foliage recede in the rearview mirror before they stop? You decide.Jerry stares at the fire, horrified.""I'm sorry we both can't sympathize with him. You have to see for yourself what he finds so important,"" Jeanette tells him. The son remembers the park ranger's words: ""Fire can be a positive force."" It has the power to ""regenerate"". The filmmaker chooses not to show Jerry in a heroic light. The audience never sees him with a water hose, or digging trenches to impede its progress. Is Jerry fighting something more than a fire?You decide.Before they head back home, mother and son grab a quick bite to eat at a diner, the sort of greasy spoon you never see anymore. ""How old are you?"" Joe asks. Jeanette Brinson is thirty-four. Surely, her son already knows this. It's you, the audience, who needs to know this; it's more than clumsy exposition. ""Would you like it better if I was fifty?"" she responds.Do the math.Joe works part-time as a photographer's assistant. Newlyweds, youth organizations, families, and all the good people of this small town come to get their picture taken because, as the shopkeeper(John Walpole) puts it: ""People want to remember something good that's happening in their lives."" ""Wildlife"" disproves the notion that 1960 was like a ""Leave it to Beaver"" rerun. Ironically, after tagging along with mom on date night with Warren Miller(Joe Camp), the richest man in this one-horse town, Joe turns on the television and watches the life he's supposed to be living. Dad comes home. Mom greets him. And they all sat around the table for dinner. ""The Beaver"" never had to shop for his own groceries. Wally and ""The Beaver"" never had to eat spaghetti from a can.Nobody got divorced in 1960, but ""Wildlife"" remembers things differently. The Brinsons get a divorce. Jeanette moves out of state and starts teaching again. When she returns for a short visit, Joe picks her up at the bus station. They have a family dinner. Jerry does the cooking, of course. On her last day, the beleaguered son drags his parents to his place of employment. He wants a family photograph, a realistic one; a portrait of the broken family.The camera doesn't lie.",Wildlife

Between family and Jerry's desire to fight wildfires for the greater good at the salary of $1 an hour, between loyalty and Jeannette's eventual adultery- 'Wildlife' has so much to say about the human condition but refrains from cliche or showing the obvious.The production team including Diego García go above and beyond in terms of cinematography, composition and editing to engage rather than impress; especially with the lustrous landscape that recalls the likes of 'Red Desert' and 'Brokeback Mountain'.

It's a four-person, five-act story that could easily be a stage play.Carrey Mulligan plays the mother as a mixture of Blanche DuBois / Madame Bovary, someone who imagined a better life than what she got and reaches a breaking point.Jake Gyllenhaal plays the dad who is similarly disappointed by his lack of progress in life and has his hopes pinned on his son becoming something better than he could ever become, embarking on a desperate attempt to salvage his dignity.Then there's the son (Ed Oxenbould), who most of the time is just at a loss. He is presented as the only mature/responsible person in the family, who is confused and frustrated by his parents' behaviours but simultaneously too reserved/repressed to do anything about it.Bill Camp plays the catalyst in the family's implosion - not so much a separate character, as an embodiment of the family's desperation.It's not unpleasant to watch and it has a nice stage-play feel to it, what with the addition of the poetic backdrop of the neverending forest fires that burn throughout the summer and until the arrival of the first snow. However, it also doesn't manage to be captivating and all the characters feel underdeveloped. The mum and dad are practically the same person: the frustrated adult who - at one point - tried too hard to achieve a better life and got punished for it.

Instead he shows everybody and himself what it means to work hard, for little money, and do some good in the process. That is the story that should have been explored, not the son's take on things who, admittingly, acts admirable in the face of adversity, but is just not very interesting as a human being. Maybe it would have helped if the actor had any screen presence, or would have even remotely looked like his parents, for believability. Acting is great, from everybody in the film.

We were gonna have to tough it out without him, but the day of the match, he showed up at the last minute, didn't say a word and won his match by a close decision. His folks broke up shortly after, I heard. Yesterday, through that time machine the internet I found a photo of Steve from a couple years ago. Obese, bearded and smiling, he stood in a group photo with a girls' soccer team he was coaching. Go Steve. It was a close decision but you won and there you are.",Wildlife
80,shenamere,"Delicate, subtle and honest",8,24 January 2020,"What a refreshing movie. The acting is both powerful and subtle. The boy is both innocent and knowing. He feels tortured between idolizing the adults he is supposed to trust and believe in and then their frailties and desires take over. He is far stronger and more honest than the adults. Through it all he is totally alone all the while hoping to be able to trust in the care and faith of the adults around him. Despite all the uncertainties swirling around him, the boy shows strength and determination. Presenting a movie like this is a supreme challenge and the directing, filming and period elements are top notch. A refreshing story that we can all learn from.",Wildlife
81,cre8toruk,I mean simply yawn....,2,11 June 2020,"There are stories that need to be told and enjoyable and have something about them. This I found trite, over long and utterly pointless. I had very little sympathy for the character apart from their desire to survive at all costs. The inexplicable desertion of Jake Gyllenhaal's character, seemed to be incidental though central and the movie ambled along from the child / teenagers point of view without really fully exploring his emotions. His characters meeting with a fellow student and their friendship again was incidental and never really explored.You could sum the movie up by simply saying.. Down on their luck parents + teenage son. Dad loses Job and buggers off, Mum becomes a prostitute to make ends meet. The end.The best part of 2 hours of my life I'll never get back.",Wildlife
82,sps-70659,Exceeded my expectations,8,5 November 2018,"Richard Ford, so I jest, used to write slimmer but inspired books for guys, now he writes bulkier but uninspired books for gals. Wildlife, which I reviewed in the Australian press when it first came out, is of the first kind.I loved Dano as Brian Wilson, in a movie that exceeded my expectations. After a slow start, this one did too. Jake G and Carey M have done it all before, Bill Camp makes his crucial scenes work, so the Australian teenager Ed Oxenbould is the one who's under pressure.At first he seems to do little, but in crucial later scenes, where his parents are well outside their best behaviour, he starts to shine. The last 20 minutes I thought carried a real effect and justified the movie. The ending (which is much more elliptical than the novel's ending) is well-judged by Dano and his co-writer.I'm not saying we have the new Clint Eastwood, but for a first-time actor-director, Dano makes a few thoughtful technical choices, that I really liked. Mulligan in particular seems to bring out a bit extra in response to him.",Wildlife

If you don't like this kind of character-driven story, just don't watch this movie.

90,eaveschristopher,A Faltering Family Shown Through Unyeilding Love,8,27 July 2020,Wildlife Micro Review -Wildlife is actor Paul Dano's directorial debut. Jeanette (Carey Mulligan) and Jerry (Jake Gyllenhaal) are a faltering wife and husband in 1960 Montana while their 14 year old son Joe (Ed Oxenbould) struggles with this downturn. The film is beautifully told through the perspective of Joe's unyielding love for his flawed parents.Jeanette and Jerry both make mistakes but both are also shown to care deeply for their son. The film never attempts to vilify any character but instead show them as complex and flawed people. Dano's acting background strongly shines through in his ability to pull performances from his actors; Wildlife also hits on the emanucalet production level and gorgeous cinematography.Each character has multiple opportunities to express their emotional point of view of a failing relationship. Dano allows these scenes to play out showcasing acting and reaction in a single shot with little cutting. Although the film does leave a number of loose threads surrounding Joe's fellow classmate and an escalation that developed too quickly with its reveal. Wildlife is a phenomenal debut from Paul Dano building excitement for his next project.,Wildlife
91,jacobmounter,What a load of...,6,11 June 2019,"ACTING: The casting of the son was so wrong. He looked nothing like his parents and it was super off putting. He's a great actor but he was not right for the role at all.
Jake was the bomb as always, and Carey was ok, if not meh. She almost cracks a smile at one point when she's supposed to be serious.
STORY: I was disappointed at the ending, where Jake's character essentially finds out his wife's been seeing another man, WITH HIS SON AROUND.
I was looking forward for something super dark, since my blood had been boiling throughout the film at the wife's infidelity and disgusting character.
And what happens?
He pours a bit of gasoline on the porch and sets it on fire. A small fire at that.
All is forgiven, and we get this wishy washy ending where everyone is affraid to confront what actually happened... really unsatisfying.
DANO: The director / writer did very well for his first movie, he has had extensive life experience of what a great film looks like so this makes perfect sense.
My only gripe is that some of the shots are really badly framed. Like when the phone rings and the boy sits up on the couch. Half his head is going off frame. These sort of mistakes take you out of the movie, make you realise, oh yeah I'm staring at a screen.
Anyway, decent movie, but extremely forgettable with nothing really to take away except that you should do what's right for your kids and not marry stupid untrustworthy gold digging women.",Wildlife
92,Dandido,Overhyped debute,5,17 November 2018,"I watched this movie yesterday at Stockholm Film Festival and what a disappointment it was. I like Paul Dano as an actor a lot and had read promising reviews of the movie beforehand. Just before watching Wildlife I had seen the Palm Dior winner Shoplifters which was a wonderful piece of cinema. Maybe having seen such a wonderful movie before watching Wildlife had a negative impact of my view on Wildlife, but still, Wildlife was still the worst movie I have seen in several years. Let me explain why. There's so much I find bad about this movie that I don't have enough time to write thoroughly about it all. Maybe I will come back to this review when I have more time to update it.First of all, I found the characters to be completely unbelievable and confusing. Jake Gyllenhaal as a dad was then out of nowhere he starts drinking, refuses to accept his job back and decides to go fight wildfires.The son who was supposed to be 14 looks like he is 17.The story about the girl hanging out with the son is completely forced, unnecessary and leads to nothing.The mother does not try to hide from her son that she's cheating on her husband. She even invites the son to a dinner at his house. Then she proceeds to dance with first her son and then the man she's cheating with in front of her son, while repeatadly singing on a infuriatingly irritating ""cha-cha-cha"". It was one of the most cringe-worthy scenes I've ever seen in my whole life. I had to laugh and I heard several other people in the audience do the same. This happened at several times in the movie.The son does not seem to be able to display any other emotion than disbelief by looking stupid with his mouth half open.I had a few good laughs while watching this movie.

Gorgeous cinematography and scenery, framing- very pleasant visually.
Acting was great 10/10, hopefully Carey Mulligan gets an Oscar nom.Film centers on a family moving to suburbs, where they face financial difficulties that are changing the mundane life and tearing up the family.
Often film is framed from the perspective of their son Joe, what makes it a bit of a coming of age story as well. He has to grow up quicker and be more of an adult in the family as well as facing the loneliness of the new town.Great directorial debut from Paul Dano!The scene where Joe watched the Wildfires is powerful as it's kind of exactly what family is going through emotionally.Absolutely loved the scene where Jerry gets mad and tries to execute he's revenge, reckless and emotionally powerfull.

I love the realism on how a child sees both parents going through marital problems and there are issues on both sides. The performances by everyone was as good as it can get.

Although the pace of the film is quite slow, the director uses that well enough to show us how each character evolves throughout the film. Notably, the cinematographer deserves a praise for the tone used in picturizing as it sets the film's soul. Jake Gyllenhaal excels as usual while Carey Mulligan's delivers a sucker punch and award worthy performance. The movie relies more on character study as the director never really reveals how the character feel or think of each other and completely leaves it to the audience to decide. Thus, at the very end, the plot turns out very believable as the pain suffered by the three main characters unfolds into a well crafted message. A must watch preferably for adults.",Wildlife

115,aligolshani66,J Family,6,2 February 2021,"Jerry & Jeanette & Joe In Wildlife ...""Wildlife"" is the story of a teenager who tries to keep his composure and balance in a broken family. This story line may be familiar to all of us, but ""Paul de No"" in his first directing experience has the same qualities. Which we have already known about him in his roles in the film. ""Wildlife"" is a clever, understandable and emotional film. The screenplay for ""Wildlife"" is an adaptation of the novel of the same name by Richard Ford. The film provides Kerry Mulligan with a great opportunity to play a full-fledged upset mother. It is also an exceptional opportunity for the newcomer star, Ed Oaksenbold. He has the opportunity to play the role of a teenager who is less open-minded but closely monitors events.The story of the film takes place in 1960 in Montana. ""Wildlife"" is about Joe (Oxenbold), who is recently with his ailing mother, Giant (Mulligan), and his restless father, Jerry (Gyllenhaal), who is constantly searching for new job opportunities. Are migrating. Jerry has taken a high-risk job after losing his job at a golf club. His new job is a forest firefighter, which sometimes keeps him away from his family for weeks.De Nou, who co-wrote the screenplay with Zoe Kazan, quickly shifts the focus of the story to Joe and his mother, whose mother treats him more like a partner in crime than a son. As Jerry leaves, Ginnett starts talking to Joe about the problems in her marriage. Coincidentally, Giant shows a more liberal personality than himself, which is the result of his anger at his wife for leaving them, as well as his skepticism about his marriage.Joe, who can do practically nothing, only reacts to his mother's momentary actions, which can be a serious challenge for any actor. But Oxenbold offers an impressive demonstration of his ability to pretend to be calm in the face of anxiety and stress. His dignified face at a young age shows that he has to grow up early to act as a judge between his parents. Because of his great love for his father, he now has to find a way to protect his family, especially since Ginette has expressed his love for a wealthy local entrepreneur.As quiet as Oxenbold is, Mulligan is fast and hardworking. Janet, now 34, regrets choosing a simple life and sees an opportunity for herself to change her life in Jerry's absence. The actress, who has an Oscar nomination in her repertoire, beautifully portrays the frustration and sexual harassment of a married woman. ""Wildlife"" has enough psychological details for the audience to understand the plight of women in the 1960s.With the perfect imagery of Diego Garcia, Di No succeeds in giving this emotional story an acceptable rhythm. As a director, Dino preferred a fixed camera and regular frames to emphasize the mundane nature of the drama, which only deepened the grief in the story.As an actor's first directing experience, ""Wildlife"" not only does not always show signs of weakness in narrative, but the cast also performs very well. ""Bill Camp"" with a clever role-playing makes the audience never realize the real intentions of that rich entrepreneur in his relationship with Ginnet. In Gyllenhaal's case, however, the fate of his character becomes one of the most clichéd: a failed father who thinks he is away from his family because of a chance for a better life for his family. ""Wildlife"" tries to distance itself from the clues of Deja Vu's story, and Gyllenhaal gets caught between this event and the main plot of the story.",Wildlife

He walks away from the classic structure of a film, and focuses on the feeling and emotion of the story. Unfortunately, it ends up emotionless.

It has a great cast though & I think they are why I made it to the end. Sometimes, movies are terribly sad but it's that way for a reason especially when it starts off with sad & depressing people but they learn important life lessons. That is definitely not so with this movie! It is just sad & depressing all the way to the bitter end. There isn't anything to be learned here besides how not to treat your child while splitting up your marriage. The mother is a ""pretender"", one that fools herself into believing all is well until it gets to an intolerable point. Dad is someone that believes workplace rules are for others & that any place of employment that disciplines him for an infraction of an obvious rule doesn't deserve to employ him. Which, of course, results in bounced checks, rent going unpaid, etc.
Anyway, if you are someone who is able to convince yourself that it is ""artsy"" & an ""excellent first effort"" for the director even though it sucked & depressed you, this is for you!!!

I thought that the mother and father characters didn't quite work but the acting is very good and the depth and gravity of the characters feelings is well-conveyed. The tatty fling between the mother and the slimy businessman is interesting, and in a very dark way, amusing at times. The movie can seem slow at times and but this may be due to the Director's attempt to portray the characters much as they are in Richard Ford's Wildlife novel. I have not read it but I have read some of the author's stories and seem to recall that his characters tend to have a defeated, subdued nature. Although here, the boy is inspiring and there is hope for him. The film has a powerful ending. The son still loves his parents even though they have failed him. He forgives them, and in the final moments the full meaning of what they have lost comes to them. I don't know that I can fairly compare the ending to the French classic Forbidden Games, but the deep emotion it generated in me were comparable.",Wildlife

122,belousyegor,It's a wild life!,9,12 November 2018,"Uncertain. It is the only word that comes to my mind as I try to describe this movie using one word. But it is uncertain not in a bad way, it is uncertain in a very positive way. This flick makes you think deeply about things during its runtime. After moving to the other city not everything for the Brinsons goes smoothly as they would want it. They face the job loss of the head of the family, Jerry, and at the same time his wife, Jannet, finds a new love interest. But the one who suffers most of all is their fourteen year old son Joe. The future of the heroes is very uncertain and this feeling transcends beyond the screen. There is no ""black"" or ""white"", only ""grey"". No winners, no losers, only the hurt ones. No wrong, no right, only raw wild humanity.
From a technical point of view I can point out to three things: the acting, the camera work and the soundtrack. Acting of the main actors makes you believe in what you see and feel the emotions of the characters. And here the acting meets the camera work. The movie is full of close ups of characters' faces, even in the scenes with two or more of them. That gives you a closer look at their eyes and facial expressions which creates tension and depressing atmosphere in some moments. It is one of the camera work methods, another one is the movement of the camera. At first, it doesn't move at all, there are mainly still shots, but closer to the end the camera starts to shake, letting us know about the unstable situation in the family. I don't want to say much about the music, it is simply there, creating a very beautiful and sometimes very eloquent background.
It is very difficult to make conclusions about the ""uncertainty"" of this film. Everything is good about it, you don't want to nitpick about it, but also you don't want to talk much about it. It is one of those movies that you recommend to your friends and close ones, and will surely re-watch it yourself one day, but you don't have any desire to speak up about it. On the other hand, it is the film that you would definitely want to discuss with someone, as the movie doesn't sort things out by itself, it is left up to the viewer.",Wildlife

He passively observes everything that's happening around him with no will or power to stop or change anything.The mother is the single most dislikable character I've seen recently, and ironically, oocupies the most screen time and has the most lines. Nothing she says resonates, or is belivable.Unless you're a Jake Gyllenhaal fanboy, or are really really bored, this is a must miss.",Wildlife
126,FaustFox,Drama portrayed with honesty,9,6 July 2019,"I think this movie will resonate with people having sympathy for the story and having had similar experiences themselves.
I thought that the pace of the movie, the symbolism (the fire, the portrait,...), the tonality, the cinematography and the soundtrack all worked harmoniously together to create the feel and atmosphere that made the experience feel very honest and true.
There are little moments here and there that really took me back to a whole other period of time, like to when my mom would drive me places, old memories just flashing in front of my eyes.
To anyone and everyone that has gone through situations like their parents fighting, seperating, cheating on eachother and the taste of fear when you feel the ground shake underneath your feet, I think you will understand this movie and it will make you feel nostalgic. However, I'm not sure how positive of an experience that would be. If you feel like it's still a trigger for you or that it would disturb you in any way, don't watch this movie. But if you feel like reminiscing wouldn't hurt, then give this one a try.
Also, for anyone not having gone through this, maybe you could get a glimpse here.
For me, it's a story of survival and hope; the portrait of Joe, being a teenager so mature for his age, watching his life, as he knew it, fall apart and him not giving up, fighting to keep the wheels rolling.",Wildlife
127,ajforapplejack,First and only movie I ever walked out of,2,26 August 2020,"Bland, boring and depressing two hours. Though I have to admit that I did not know what movie I was going to watch that evening because I watched it as a sneak preview with a friend so I had hoped for a fun movie - still this was the worst cinema experience I ever had and I watched that other Avatar movie nobody is allowed to talk about",Wildlife
128,raywsims,Really??,1,14 November 2020,"The only thing good about this movie was the acting. Super boring, and very strange for no apparent reason. It's one of those low budget movies that all the critics love for some reason you can't figure out.",Wildlife
129,kgeorge_kg,Extremely Boring,2,29 October 2021,"It tries to be clever, it's not. The long pauses and predictable storyline make this one of the worse films I've seen in a while, i managed to watch just 15 minutes before switching it off.",Wildlife
130,anna-kiralyovna,What a directorial debut!,10,13 March 2020,"I was so curious about this movie because of Paul Dano. I'm intrigued by seeing an actor-director's work, I have this preconception that it should involve extra sensitivity, complexity in conflicts and character archs etc. And Wildlife went so far beyond my expectations. I'm humbled.
I think the way the film was constructed was just so smart: while the perspective of the boy was maintained, we got such delicate portraits of the parents - I could understand the motifs, fears and anxieties of both - but nothing was overexplained. Witnessing this from the boy's point of view was why it was really heartbreaking to watch: he saw the 'storm' coming (parents moving apart) way before things happened explicitly - as the symbolism of the forest fire tells it (it's already toxic when the smoke is coming).
And it cannot be stressed enough how well this film was acted, the three main characters supported each other so well, I cannot separate one from the other. There was no moment where I had a feeling of 'too much'. It was subtle and heartwrenching.
And this was very well executed with the cinematography as well. The compositions and the lighting (especially those plain landscapes and cold sunlight) made that mood of anxiety.
I don't often cry at movies but I did at this one. It was so true and sad.
I don't understand the 6.8 rating, it's ridiculously low for this film.",Wildlife
131,roger-batten,Spare me,2,1 April 2019,"So slow it almost expired. Mind numbingley tedious. I was the only one who hung in there until the end. I suppose that was a (personal) triumph, which was more than could be said of the film!",Wildlife

I felt almost guilty watching what this poor child had to endure from his so-called parents. They were two of the most narcissistic people I've ever seen.
It breaks my heart to think of the pain this young man would take with him on his journey through life.",Wildlife

135,revd11,"Simple, yet great story with good performances",9,27 February 2019,"The movie has a pretty simple story, which is fine. All 3 of the main actors (Jake Gyllenhaal, Carey Mulligan, Ed Oxenbould) are great, but Carey Mulligan steals the show, she's just fantastic.
This is a perfect example of how you don't need extreme budget and a complicated story, to make a good movie!",Wildlife
136,arqueuer,Why not just say it was Livingston MT as opposed to Great Falls MT?,10,20 August 2021,"I recently came across this. Great critical ratings. I live in Livingston, born and bred. A LOT of Livingston shots. It's odd that I didn't hear or read about it being filmed. At any rate, it's neat to see all of the local shots.",Wildlife
137,comicrelief96,Observatory observation,7,9 August 2019,"The showcase of a fractured American reality is old news, but the way Paul Dano did this makes this one worth a watch.Paul's debut, I like how the camera work was static which made you observe the reality with more focus.Ed, did his role with complete justice. A silent guy who's observe reality with intensity.Jake, no formalities, is an outstanding actor but the appreciation here should be for Ed and Carey.A new perspective to Divorce.Although, like I mentioned, static camera work does give a slow pace vibe, at least it did for me.Anyways, 7/10.",Wildlife

140,hariharshankar,"Carey Mulligan and Jake Gyllenhaal as haunted parents, and what a debut by Paul",10,21 January 2018,"As an actor, Paul Dano, with his long-faced gaze of inquiring gloom, has always radiated a sense of unease. That's far from the only thing he communicates (he was spectacular as Brian Wilson in ""Love & Mercy,"" a performance that beautifully merged Wilson's disturbance and his joy). But a kind of hushed foreboding remains the vintage Dano mood, and ""Wildlife,"" his directorial debut, is suffused with it.",Wildlife

142,jimkelly-54420,Promising directorial debut!,8,31 March 2021,"I've loved Paul Dano's strong, sensitive performances as an actor, and he successfully makes the jump to directing with a meaningful, beautiful to look at film. Sort of reminds me of Greta Gerwig, with her especially strong showing as young, new director with her Lady Bird debut. You know you can count on Carey Mulligan and Jake Gyllenhaal to deliver the goods, but it's up to the young man who plays their son to carry the film, and he most certainly does! And Bill Camp! He really moved me in Queen's Gambit, and damn if he isn't good here, too. Beautiful color schemes and long, even paced scenes bring intensity to a satisfying film.",Wildlife
